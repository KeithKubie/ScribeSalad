00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.500
So what I'm about to show you are my
methods for doing these things

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.160
they may not correspond exactly
to what Rich Sutton did.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.970
So keep that in mind but
I've used these methods in practice and

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.560
found them to work really well.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.254
Let's start with Learning T.

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:23.720
Remember T of SA S prime
represents the probability

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.800
that if we are in state S, take action
A we will end up in state S prime.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.840
To learn a model of T.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.480
we're just going to observe
how these transitions occur.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.960
So in other words we'll have experience
with the real world we'll get back

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.900
on s, a, s prime and we'll just
count how many times did it happen.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.310
So I'm going to introduce a new table.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.630
I call T count or TC.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.860
And it goes like this.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.000
So we initialize all of our T count
values to be a very, very small number.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.080
The reason for that is later on you'll
see that if we don't do that we could

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.380
get in a situation where
we have a divided by zero.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.880
Then we begin executing Q learning.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.990
And each time we interact with the real
world we observe, s, a, and s prime.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.600
And then we just increment that
location in our T-count matrix.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.360
So every time we see it transition
from S to S prime with action a,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.130
boom, we add a one.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.470
And that's pretty, it's pretty simple.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.970
That's it.
