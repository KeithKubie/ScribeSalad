00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.760
What’s your favorite super hero?

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.760
Superman?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.760
Wonder Woman?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.760
The Black Widow?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.760
What about Batman?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.510
While super heros with super powers are pretty
cool, flying, truth lassos, I like the ones

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.260
who are just ordinary people who decide to
do great things.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.230
And I bet so does the military.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.530
Because it seems the military is taking cues
from comic books.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.010
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.640
Bruce Wayne was just an ordinary man.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.750
Okay a really rich ordinary man.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.600
But he wasn’t special, he didn’t have
super strength or could grow into a giant

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.920
green smashing machine.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.030
Instead he had lots of money.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.700
Which he used to turn his ordinary self into
the hero Gotham needed.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.250
His beaucoup bucks went into sweet stuff like
tricked out batsuit, batmobiles and batarangs.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.870
As technology changed so did Batman’s toys,
in Batman Returns, his staple weapon, the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.420
batarang got an update with an onboard computer.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.920
And comic tech might be coming to life.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.850
Communication on the battlefield used to be
cumbersome.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.780
Telephones and other electronics had huge
batteries that were difficult to carry and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.980
left little room for other equipment.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.770
Outdated equipment burdened soldiers with
over a hundred extra pounds on the battlefield.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.100
Yet, today computers fit in our pockets and
so the Air Force is making use of similar

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.719
breakthrough technology everyday.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:18.079
To make it easier to carry around equipment,
the Air Force started BATMAN in 2004.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.860
The program stands for Battlefield Air Targeting
Man-Aided kNowledge.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.341
Okay i know that last letter is a bit of stretch.

00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:28.950
The goal of the program, based out of Ohio's
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, is to “ find

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.289
innovative technologies for our operators,”
Lt. Anthony Eastin, a behavioral scientist

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.079
with the program team, told Defense Tech.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.290
Basically it’s what the acronym suggests,
it’s a program assembled from military and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.869
civilian scientists to build a better suit
for soldiers.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.049
Some of the technology is sewn right into
their uniform.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.039
Some of the features are kind of basic, like
red lights on their gloves to help them see

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.109
when they write at night.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.049
But here’s the catch, the red lights don’t
interfere with night vision goggles.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.130
One of more popular features of the BATMAN
gear, is a wrist mount for a tablet or smart

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.130
phone.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.130
That way soldiers can access everything they
need all within arms reach.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.130
Both simple, yet kind of high tech.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.429
While some of the technology is made in the
Air Force's own Batcave, the BATMAN program

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.909
also takes advantage of more commercial technologies
like Google Glass.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.819
They designed a google glass system specifically
for pararescue jumpers, with an app to help

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.319
rescue workers keep track of vital signs on
multiple people.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.540
It streams real time data like heart rates
and blood-oxygen levels of several patients

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.599
right to screens by their eyes.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.599
While some of the tech is life saving, some
just seems kind of fun.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.599
Like a real life Bathook.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.599
Yeah basically someone in special ops said
you know what would be really cool?'

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.599
“Something like what Batman has on his belt
that he can take out and wing it up to a power

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.599
line and get power”.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.599
Yeah that’s a direct quote from a Tech News
Daily piece.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.599
All this new BATMAN technology needs to charge
and if their batteries die, you don’t want

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.599
to leave anyone stranded.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.599
So the bathook or the Remote Auxiliary Power
System, as it’s really called, does just

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.599
that.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.599
It can be strung up on overhead, low voltage
power lines and keep all the field gear up

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.599
and running.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.599
But not only is the technology better so is
the overall build of the equipment itself.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.599
It was designed to be like like a scaffold
airmen could wear, or as the Air Force calls

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.599
it a "Human Chassis."

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.599
So all the gadgets and gizmos could be strongly
attached maintaining the wearer’s range

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.599
of movement and agility.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.599
The antennae is placed closer to the torso
to improve balance.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.599
and batteries are better too.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.950
They’re lighter by 25% because they use
methanol as a fuel source.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.520
That way the pack gets lighter as the fuel
is used.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.500
So these advances in technology allow for
much easier use and maneuverability than the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.390
clunky communication systems of days past.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.629
So the future might see us in fitbits and
google glass and our men and women in uniform

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.890
in BATMAN suits.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.749
Speaking of those men and women, the United
States Air Force is powered by Airmen, fueled

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:01.799
by innovation.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.859
Every day American Airmen go above and beyond
to break barriers both professionally and

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:06.859
personally.

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.420
Whether it’s overcoming poverty to become
a nurse and officer or becoming the first

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:28.420
female Thunderbird pilot, these Airmen are
doing what others once thought was impossible.
