00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.210
In the last video, we
talked about how parallax

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.200
is the apparent
change in position

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.590
of something based on
your line of sight.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.627
And if you experience parallax
in your everyday life,

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.960
if you look outside of the
car window while it's moving,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.760
you see that nearby
objects seem to be

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.970
moving faster than
far away objects.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.560
So in the last
video, we measured

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.890
the apparent displacement of
this star at different points

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.060
in the year relative
to straight up.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.690
But you could also measure it
relative to things in the night

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.900
sky at that same time of year,
that same time of day that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.180
don't appear to be moving.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.263
And they won't appear to
be moving because they're

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:38.640
going to be way, way, way
farther away than this star

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.139
over here.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.820
There might be other galaxies
or maybe even other clusters

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.070
of galaxies or who knows.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.990
Things that are not
changing position.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.032
So that's another option.

00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:47.489
And that's another
way to make sure

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.840
that you're looking at the
right part of the universe.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.839
So you could measure it
relative to straight up,

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.464
if you know based on the time
of year and the time of day

00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:56.880
that you're looking at the
same direction of the universe.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.310
Or you could just find
things in the universe that

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.280
are way far back that their
apparent position isn't

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.200
changing.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.769
So just to visualize
this again, I'll

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.210
visualize it in a
slightly different way.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.760
Let's say, this is
our-- let's say,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.620
this is a night field of vision.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.440
Let me scroll to the
right a little bit.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.890
Let's say, our night field
of vision looks like this.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.580
And I'll do it in a dark
color because it's at night.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.430
So our night field of
vision looks like this.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.209
And let's say, that this right
over here is straight up.

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.250
This right here is if
we're just looking straight

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.480
up in the night sky.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.940
And just to make the
convention, in the last video,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.980
I changed our
orientation a little bit.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.920
But I'll reorient us in a
traditional orientation.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.290
So if we make this
north, this is south.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.930
This will be west.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.900
And then this will be east.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.460
So when we're looking at
the star in the summer,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.030
what will it look like?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.350
Well, first of all, the sun
is just to beginning to rise.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.864
So if you could think about
it, this north direction--

00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:05.280
we're looking at the sun from--
we're looking at the Earth

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.950
from above.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.600
So the north will be the top
of this sphere over here.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.440
And the south will be the bottom
of the sphere, the other side

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.240
of this sphere that
we're not seeing.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.140
The east will be this
side of the sphere

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.810
where the sun is just beginning
to rise right over there.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.920
So what will be the apparent
position of this star?

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.940
Well, it's going to
be towards the east.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.830
It's going to be
towards the direction

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.090
that the sun is rising.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.140
So this angle right over here
is going to be right over there.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.640
So this will be the angle theta.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.620
So this is in the summer.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.990
And what about the winter?

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.260
Well, in the winter in
order-- straight up--

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.450
in order for straight up to
be that same point in time,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.190
or that same direction of
the universe I should say,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.750
then, the sun will just
to be setting word.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.240
We're rotating around that way.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.070
So we're just going to
be capturing the last two

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.840
glimpse of sunlight.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.410
So in that situation, the
sun is going to be setting.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.430
So this is our
winter sun-- so I'll

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.070
do a slightly different color--
will be setting on the west.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.050
And now, the apparent
direction of that star

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.980
is going to be in the
direction of the sun again.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.890
But it's going to be
shifted away from center.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.700
So it's going to be to
the right of center.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.110
Sorry, to the left of center.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.360
So it's going to
be right over here.

00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:40.990
And it's a little
bit unintuitive,

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.050
the way I drew it
in the last video.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.910
Well, I won't make any judgment
on whether the last one is

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.250
easier to visualize
or this one is.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.250
Over here, I just wanted
to make the conventions

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.530
so that north is
up, south is down.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.080
But I just want to be clear,
over here, the sun is-- well,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.500
sun always sets to the west.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.720
So in the winter, the sun
will be right over there.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.100
This will be shifted from center
in the direction of the sun.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.820
So it'll be at an angle theta
just like that in the winter.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.900
Now, that's all review
from the last video

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.310
I just reoriented
how we visualize it.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.120
What I want to do in this
video, given that we can measure

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.842
theta, how can we figure out
how far this star actually is.

00:04:22.842 --> 00:04:24.550
So let's just think
about it a little bit

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.050
before even give
you a theta value.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.600
If we know theta,
then we know what

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.810
this angle is right over here.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.670
Because this is a
right angle, we're

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.420
going to know this angle
right here is 90 minus theta.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.694
We also know the distance
from the sun to the Earth.

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:46.860
And let's say, we're just
going to approximate here,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.004
it's one astronomical unit.

00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:50.170
It changes a little bit
over the course of the year.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.470
But the mean distance is
one astronomical unit.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.840
So we know that angle.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.040
We know a side
adjacent to the angle.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.730
And what we're trying to do
is, figure out a side opposite

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.200
to the angle--
this distance right

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.500
here, the distance from
the sun to the star.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.290
And this is, of course,
a right triangle.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.540
And you can see it right here.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.416
Here is the hypotenuse.

00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:13.790
So now, we just
have to break out

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.300
some relatively
basic trigonometry.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.600
So if we know this angle,
what trig ratio deals

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.760
with an adjacent side
and opposite side?

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.590
So let me write down
my famous SOHCAHTOA.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.740
I didn't come up with it.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.770
So the famous SOHCAHTOA.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.182
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:34.640
Those aren't the
two we care about.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.417
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:38.000
We don't know what
the hypotenuses is.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.670
And we don't care
about it just yet.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.240
But a tangent is the
opposite over the adjacent.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.050
So if we take the
tangent of the angle.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:55.330
If we take the tangent
of 90 minus theta,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.260
this is going to be equal
to the distance to the star.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.130
This distance right over here.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.420
The distance to the star,
or the distance from the sun

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.160
to the star.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.820
We can later figure out
the distance from the Earth

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.360
to the star.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.776
It's not going to
be too different

00:06:06.776 --> 00:06:08.470
because the star is so far away.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.950
But the distance from
the sun to the star

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.940
divided by the
adjacent side, divided

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.810
by one astronomical unit.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.380
I'm assuming everything
is in astronomical units.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.400
So you can multiply
both sides by one.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.920
And you'll get the distance
in astronomical units.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.960
The distance is equal to the
tangent of 90 minus theta.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.657
Not too bad.

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:31.740
So let's actually figure
out what a distance would

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.230
be based on some
actual measurements.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.300
Let's say, you were
to measure some star.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.150
Measure this apparent-- this
change in angle right here.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.270
Let's say, you've got
the total change in angle

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.709
right over here from six months
apart, the biggest spread.

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:47.250
And you're making
sure you're looking

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.570
at a point in the universe
relative to straight up.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.760
You can do it other ways.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.310
But this is really just
simplifies our visualization

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.880
and simplifies our math.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.814
And you get it to be
1.5374 arc seconds.

00:07:01.814 --> 00:07:02.980
And I want to be very clear.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.080
This is a very, very, very,
very, very, small angle.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.670
Just to visualize
it or another way

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.060
to think about it
is, one point, there

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.580
are 60 arc seconds
per arc minute.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.180
And there are 60 arc
minutes per degree.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.251
Or another way to think about
is a degree is like an arc hour.

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:21.000
So if you want to
convert this to degrees,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.010
you have 1.5374
arc seconds times

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.920
one degree is equal
to 3,600 arc seconds.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.550
The dimensions cancel out.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.510
And you get this as being equal
to-- get the calculator out.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:47.720
This is being equal to
1.5374 divided by 3,600.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.487
So it's 4.206.

00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:54.820
I'll round because we only
want five significant digits.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.370
This is of infinite
precision right here

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.870
because that's an
absolute quantity.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.037
It's a definition.

00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:00.120
So let me write this down.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:10.680
So this is going to be 4.2706
times 10 to the negative 4

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.500
degrees.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.225
Could write it just like that.

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:14.100
Now, let me be clear.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.930
This is the total angle.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.790
This angle that we care about
is going to be half of this.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.080
So we could divide this by 2.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.730
So let me just do our
significant digits 4.2706

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.809
divided by 2, or I
could even say times 10

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:37.820
to the negative
4-- divided by 2 is

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.900
going to be 2.1353 times
10 to the negative 4.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.809
So that's this angle
right over here.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:48.590
This angle, or the shift from
center we could visualize it,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:54.361
is going to be 2.1353
times 10 to the negative 4.

00:08:54.361 --> 00:08:55.860
So now that we know
that, we already

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.651
figured out how to
figure out the distance.

00:08:57.651 --> 00:08:59.730
We can just apply
this right over here.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.520
So let's just take
the tangent-- make

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.260
sure your calculator
is in degree mode.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.370
I made sure of that before
I started this video.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:12.520
--of 90 minus this
angle right here.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.340
So instead of retyping it, I'll
just write the last answer.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.360
So 90 minus this angle.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.510
And we get this large
number-- 268,326.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.400
Now remember, what
were our units?

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:32.704
This distance right
here is 268,326.

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:34.120
I should just round
because I only

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.210
have five significant
digits here.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.710
300 and-- although with trig
numbered, with the trig,

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.460
when you're using,
involving trigonometry,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.540
the significant digits
get a little bit shadier.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.039
But I'll just write
the whole number

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:55.730
here 268,326 astronomic units.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.420
So it's this many distances
between the sun and the Earth.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.690
Now, if we wanted to calculate
that into light years,

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.390
we just have to
know-- and you could

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.620
calculate this multiple ways.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.150
You could just
figure out how far

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.380
an AU is versus a light year.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.100
So this is AUs.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:23.650
One light year is equivalent
to 63,115 astronomical units,

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.200
give or take a little bit.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.800
So this is going to
be equal to-- the AUs

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.920
cancel out-- this
quantity divided

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.550
by that quantity in light years.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.670
So let's do that.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:41.750
So let's take this number the
we just got divided by 63,115.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.550
And we have in light years.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.146
And so it's about
4.25 light years.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.770
I'm messing with the
significant digits

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:58.870
here but just roundabout
answer, 4.25 light years.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.700
Now remember,
that's about how far

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.390
the closest star
to the Earth is.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.090
And so the closest
star of the Earth

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.970
has this very,
very, very apparent,

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.977
a very small change in angle.

00:11:09.977 --> 00:11:12.310
You could imagine as you go
to further and further stars

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.440
from this, that angle,
this angle right

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.530
here is going to get
even smaller and smaller

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.050
and smaller.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.240
And all the way until
you get really far stars.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.330
And it would be, even
with our best instruments,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.429
you won't be able to
measure that angle.

00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:25.720
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that cool because you just

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.060
figured out a way
to use trigonometry

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:33.020
in a really good way to
measure angles in the night sky

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.830
to actually figure out how far
we are from the nearest stars.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.730
I think that's pretty neat.
