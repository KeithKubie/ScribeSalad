00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And at t = 1 it is fairly straightforward.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It moves on average by 1 to the right so the mean is going to be 1.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The variance is going to be 2.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
At t = 2, it's now moved 1 more to the right no average, so the mean is 2,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the variance is going to be 4.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
At 10 they also just both multiply.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The mean will be 10, and the variance will be 20.
