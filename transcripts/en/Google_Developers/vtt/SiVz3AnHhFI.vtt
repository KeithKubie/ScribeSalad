FRANK SAVAGE: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.600
I'm Frank.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.890
TIAN LIM: And I'm Tian.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.140
And we lead Android
games engineering

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.360
and Play product
management at Google.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.880
First, welcome to GDC.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.800
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.930
We know you have your
choice of 10:00 AM sessions.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.120
There are only about
1,000 others right now.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.690
So we appreciate you
being here with us today.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.020
So like many of
you, we have spent

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.020
our careers and
most of our lives

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.960
playing and building games.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.880
Pop quiz-- does
anyone here remember

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.130
"Strike Commander" or
"Wing Commander 3" or "Wing

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.380
Commander," in general?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.530
OK.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.380
A few.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.463
That was Frank.

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:45.630
FRANK SAVAGE: Yeah, that's--

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.130
thank you.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.820
TIAN LIM: To show you
just how hardcore he was,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.600
this was his license plate.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.410
You were in high school then?

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.160
FRANK SAVAGE: Well,
it wasn't high school.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.880
Unfortunately, I was
quite a bit older.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.450
But, yeah, this was in Chicago.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.390
And before I had even started
in the games business,

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.129
I may have been a
little bit too large

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.230
of a "Wing Commander" fan, so--

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.504
TIAN LIM: No issue with that.

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:12.840
For my part, I helped build
the Nintendo GameCube, the Xbox

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.360
360, and the PlayStation 4.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.610
And to prove my
nerd cred, here's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.590
an old picture kind of
showing my bad hair choices,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.340
late at night, as we brought up
the high-performance skidding

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.480
and animation code
for the GameCube

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.110
that was generally used in all
GameCube games and Wii games

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.650
for quite some time.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.010
FRANK SAVAGE: I spent 17
years working on Xbox.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.140
I worked on all
three of the Xboxes.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.390
What I consider to be my
crowning achievement for that

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.360
was, I was the development
manager for XNA Game Studio.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.330
So if any of you remember
XNA and the XNA framework

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.240
and all that stuff that
Unity is based on today,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.280
you can blame me for that, too.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.880
I joined Google because I see
the potential here of Google's

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.060
reach, and really the
expansive capabilities

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.870
that Google has that can really
take your game businesses

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.010
to the next level.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.260
TIAN LIM: Now, Frank and I also
care deeply about diversity

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.240
in the games business,
and we mean that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.150
in every sense of the word.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.190
We live in a world where large
story-driven, triple-A games,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.130
like "God of War," can live side
by side with a mobile, indie,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.940
premium title, like "Florence,"
on Game-of-the-Year lists.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.680
That's absolutely outstanding.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.590
And so we just care
a lot about fostering

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.810
both ends of that
spectrum, everything

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.570
from large triple-A to small
indie and all the business

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.310
models in-between, from premium,
subscription, ads, and so on.

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:45.090
FRANK SAVAGE: Your
businesses are

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.070
helping to fuel
incredible growth

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.950
in the global mobile games
market, which are forecasted

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.800
by New Zoo to grow
yearly by double digits

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.480
for the next decade.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.250
By 2021, mobile games revenue
will be 60% of the global games

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.425
revenue.

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:03.800
TIAN LIM: And we're seeing
some really interesting trends

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.120
in the industry, like the
explosion of gaming in India,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.750
which is not traditionally
a huge gaming market.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.500
And this is, in part, due
to the amazing success

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.390
of "PUBG Mobile."

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.990
This game has become a
cultural phenomenon there.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.930
The Indian prime minister
has made references to it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.230
and couples have made
the news by putting out

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.905
PUBG-themed engagement photos.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.830
But success is not only
for the large developers.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.920
Every year, we see
inspiring stories,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.790
like Small Giant Games who
launched "Empires and Puzzles"

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.370
way back in March 2017.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.340
It became a top-grossing
title on Play last year,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.366
and they just very recently
got acquired by Zinga.

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:51.200
It started out as
this tiny team,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.730
so huge congratulations to them.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.500
However, as people who have
been around games for quite

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.680
some time, we know that Google
hasn't quite always lived up

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.440
to its potential.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.940
FRANK SAVAGE: We know we can
improve the experience for game

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.482
developers, and we
want to share some

00:04:07.482 --> 00:04:10.590
of the things we're working
on to make it better for you.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.750
You'll hear from various Google
teams throughout this week.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.439
But for now, we'd like to
focus on Android and Play

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.290
and the things that we're doing
there to improve the ecosystem.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.760
As the engineering lead for
Android games and graphics,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.850
my team's primary
goal is to help

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.880
you reach more of the 2 billion
Android devices that are there

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.340
by making it easier for
you to build for them.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.820
We hear your feedback today,
that it's too hard, especially

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.100
when building
high-fidelity games.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.320
My team's focus
is to build tools

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.240
that will help all
developers bring

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.220
mobile games to the
next level, pushing

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.550
the boundaries on graphics,
multiplayer experiences, and so

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.580
much more.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.430
Android has traditionally been
one of the toughest platforms

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.380
to develop for-- as
though that's like a badge

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.150
of goodness--

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.460
given the fragmentation of
the ecosystem and limited

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.230
availability of game
development tools

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.000
to deal with this complexity.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.670
When you think about
all of the SOC vendors

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.100
that are out there and
all of the different OEMs

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.710
using those SOCs, it's
very, very difficult

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.297
to know what to target to
hit the kinds of things

00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:15.880
that you're going
to be after in terms

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.430
of what your game needs to
do, in terms of performance

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.110
or look and feel.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.740
At the same time, mobile games
are becoming much more complex.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.870
With more titles moving
from console and PC

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.030
to mobile, as
developers, you know

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.700
these games need advanced
debugging and development

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.545
tools.

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:33.670
And those are the kinds of
problems that my team is

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.090
going to be focused on solving.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.220
To do so, we're
making big investments

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.530
to improve the development
experience on Android.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.510
We're expanding our scope
and ramping up teams

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.353
to unblock game developers
in problematic areas.

00:05:45.353 --> 00:05:46.770
And also working
with the platform

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.660
teams to build
solutions at scale.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.430
There are a lot of
hard problems to solve.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.600
And if you're up for a
challenge, we are hiring.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.570
TIAN LIM: Hey, you know
I used to optimize games

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.698
for the GameCube, right?

00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:00.240
FRANK SAVAGE: No,
I didn't know that.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.150
How long has it been
since you goded?

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.765
TIAN LIM: Seven or
eight years, maybe.

00:06:03.765 --> 00:06:05.160
FRANK SAVAGE: Oh,
well, maybe you

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.665
should keep your day job then.

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:08.804
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.367
You know, just saying.

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:13.950
We're also investing in tools
to help give you better insights

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.830
into what's going on.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.460
We know that the CPU and
GPU profiling stories

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.460
on Android today are not
up to what they need to be.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.510
We need, again, better
debugging workflows,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.610
and we're investing in
wider Vulcan availability

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.340
as well, so that you can tap
the graphics potential that's

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.970
in a lot of these
mobile GPUs today.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.720
We've also heard from
developers that it's

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.390
hard to find information
and resources on mobile game

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.320
development and distribution.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.130
So to help today, we've
launched a new site

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.920
as a central location
to make great games

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.862
and maximize your reach.

00:06:45.862 --> 00:06:47.820
Keep an eye on this, as
we're going to continue

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.920
to add new resources over time.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.040
These are just a few
places we're working on

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.872
to make things less complex for
you to build games on Android.

00:06:57.872 --> 00:06:59.330
And we look forward
to sharing more

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.070
with you throughout the year.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.590
In fact, we'll have
much more to say

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.650
at Google I/O in a brand
new track dedicated entirely

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.550
to games.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.890
This is the first
time ever that games

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.630
have been featured
at I/O, and this

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.090
speaks to the commitment
across Google,

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.420
because we really want to be the
full lifecycle partner for you

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.370
as you're building these titles.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.900
If you can't make
the event, please

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.733
make sure to follow
along on the livestream.

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:26.165
There'll be a lot
of information.

00:07:26.165 --> 00:07:27.540
We know that
developing your game

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.210
doesn't mean the work
stops when you publish.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.880
This is where you shift
focus to improving the game's

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.030
performance in the marketplace.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.830
TIAN LIM: And that's
where Play comes in.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.440
So over the past year, I've
spent a lot of time speaking

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.160
with the game developer
community around the world.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.590
And a couple things really stand
out that we want to focus on.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.210
First, discovery.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.550
It's hard.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.740
And we want to help your game
succeed on the Play Store.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.500
Everyday, more
games are appearing,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.300
but we only have the
same number of pixels.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.455
And we want to make it easier
for everyone to get discovered.

00:08:03.455 --> 00:08:04.830
Now, we know that
it's especially

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.080
hard for newer and
smaller game developers,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.350
and we want to do a lot
more to support you.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.420
So if you visit
our booth starting

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.390
on Wednesday in Center Hall,
you can learn about some

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.670
of the programs that
we run specifically

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.910
for indies that help
amplify your great work,

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.522
such as the Indie
Games Showcase.

00:08:23.522 --> 00:08:25.230
So to learn more,
please go to this site.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.539
So while we're improving
the storefront,

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.720
we continue to offer
new and effective ways

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.539
to help you distribute
your games to users.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.150
Last year at GDC, we
announced the launch

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.420
of pre-reg, which allows you to
start marketing and building up

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.780
the pre-launch hype and demand
for your upcoming release.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.450
This is a tried and true best
practice across the games

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.170
industry, and it helps build
that hype with players.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.350
You're going to hear some big
news later today about pre-reg

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.490
and some great new features.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:06.108
So stay tuned for our session
called "Building the Hype."

00:09:06.108 --> 00:09:08.150
There's a lot more that
we're thinking about when

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.960
it comes to games discovery.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.440
New games have so much
creativity and so much

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.570
innovation, and then we
tell you to condense it

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.940
into one icon on the
home page of the store.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.350
So we want to do more to
show the soul of your game

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.500
to users, before they even click
through to the store listing

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.920
page.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.830
So what you see
here on the left is

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.180
one of our new
auto-playing treatments.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.200
It should be going out
into experiment this week.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.060
And in general, you
should be expecting

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.360
to see more and more of
your videos and screenshots

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.805
show up on the home page
over the coming quarters.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.240
On the right, you will see
our live-ops events page,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.870
and this can help drive
re-engagement and discovery

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.050
for your live-ops
events and games.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.520
Major updates can
also be shown here.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.370
And so in general,
we just want to be

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.950
there to help amplify those
big beats in your business.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.650
We also launched Google
Play Instant for games

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.680
at GDC last year.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.800
Players can hit the "Try Now"
button on your store listing

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.610
page and go straight to a
demo experience of your game

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.193
within a matter of seconds
with no installation required.

00:10:22.193 --> 00:10:23.610
FRANK SAVAGE: You
know, I remember

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.750
when we had to cut
discs for demos,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.860
and we'd glue them to
the fronts of magazines.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.773
Does anyone remember gluing--

00:10:30.773 --> 00:10:32.940
going to get the disc off
the front of the magazine,

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.513
and then rushing
home and having fun?

00:10:34.513 --> 00:10:35.430
Does anyone miss that?

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.230
No?

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.530
OK.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.363
Well, this is the best
part, is that now you

00:10:39.363 --> 00:10:41.310
can download and play
a match of something

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.690
like "Garena's Free Fire"
in about 10 seconds,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.380
which is a very, very different
world to be living in.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.540
TIAN LIM: Great
times we live in.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.200
We also enabled Instant
for premium titles,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.880
like HyperBeard's "DR. MEEP,"
an incredibly cute take

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.780
on the match-3 genre.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.840
We also want to
help you make money.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.080
We want developers to
have more options on how

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.060
they monetize in general.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.550
In-app purchases, of
course, are super important.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.780
But we want to support other
methods, like subscriptions,

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.000
premium games, or rewarded ads.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.300
And we're constantly trying
out new approaches here.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.420
We see huge benefits in
helping developers diversify

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.100
their revenue streams.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.990
And later today,
you'll hear more

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.230
about the success of
developers, like Playgendary

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.210
and Kongregate.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.390
Stay tuned.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.570
We're investing in
even more options,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.840
and we hope to give you even
more choice in the future.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.160
So if it isn't
already clear, Google

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.590
is super serious
about helping games

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.600
throughout their lifecycle.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.290
And if you want learn more, come
to our booth in the West Hall

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.930
or visit our new
Google for Games site.

00:11:56.485 --> 00:11:58.110
FRANK SAVAGE: Before
we kick off today,

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.210
I wanted to share some other
events we have lined up.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.693
Join us tomorrow at 10:00
AM for the big reveal.

00:12:05.693 --> 00:12:07.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.638
Yes.

00:12:08.638 --> 00:12:10.180
Then, on Wednesday
there's a full day

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.167
of sessions from Google Cloud.

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:13.750
And finally, Wednesday
through Friday,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.450
there are over 40 Google
sessions and talks

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.250
throughout the conference.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.040
Full agendas and the
livestream details can be found

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.900
at g.co/gdc19.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.950
Here's a quick
overview of today.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.760
We have four main sessions
full of updates and tips

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.082
to help you succeed
on Android and Play.

00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:34.540
The first three
sessions will cover

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.160
tools, monetization strategies,
and new opportunities.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.340
Then, make sure to
come back at 2:40

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.060
for a more technical
session focused

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.430
on building games on Android.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.840
We appreciate everyone
being here today.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.530
Thank you for choosing Android
and Play to create and scale

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.430
your games.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.420
And we look forward to
seeing what you do next.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.560
With that, we'll hand
over to Ben Frenkel,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.980
who will share more about
distribution and discovery.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.640
Thank you all.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.600
TIAN LIM: Thank you.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:00.870
BEN FRENKEL: All right.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.780
Hello, everybody.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.640
I'm Ben Frenkel.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.530
I'm a product manager on Play.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.498
And today, I'm going to go
a little deeper into some

00:13:07.498 --> 00:13:09.540
of the things Tian talked
about earlier about how

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.030
we're improving
discovery on the store.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.030
And joining me later
on, in a little bit,

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.950
is my esteemed
colleague Kobi Glick,

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.740
who will be talking about
distribution on Play.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.320
But before I get
rolling, I wanted

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.440
to kick things off with some
audience participation-- get

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.060
you guys energized, all right?

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.570
And so just to provide
some context for this,

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.170
about a month or so ago, I was
looking at the latest results

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.310
of the GDC State of the
Game Industry Survey

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.830
among other things that
asked this question--

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.010
which discovery methods,
you, the game developer,

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.850
find most effective.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.180
And the top five responses in
no particular order were word

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.060
of mouth, promotion on
the digital storefront--

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.040
so that would be the
Play Store, for example--

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.710
social media-- very popular--

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.300
YouTube video--
which apparently is

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.360
its own category-- and
traditional press and bloggers.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.390
So take a second to let
this soak in, all right?

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.345
Look at them closely.

00:14:11.345 --> 00:14:12.970
Keep them in your
mind, because they're

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.460
going to be coming
in handy in a second.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.110
So now what I want you
to do is to take a moment

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:25.850
and guess which discovery
method most developers selected

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.350
and which you
believe the fewest.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.580
So take a guess.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.140
What's the yellow bar
and what's the blue bar?

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.640
All right.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.337
And I'll give you a second
to think about it, all right?

00:14:36.337 --> 00:14:37.170
Which is number one?

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.520
And which is the last place one?

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.260
OK.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:40.760
All right.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.940
So survey says that--

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.860
you can imagine a drum roll--

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.190
the number one choice
is social media.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.070
Very exciting, I know.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.740
And last place--
last place, survey

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:01.190
says it was promotion on
the digital storefronts.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.000
And for completeness, this is
how everything else shook out.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.520
So raise your hand
if you successfully

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.142
guessed that social media
would be ranked first.

00:15:11.142 --> 00:15:13.100
Who thought social media
would be ranked first?

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.267
I think there's more of you
who really thought that.

00:15:15.267 --> 00:15:18.800
But now raise your hand
if you successfully

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.290
guessed that the storefront
would be ranked last.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.030
Not that many of you, like me.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.410
I was a bit surprised, too.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.162
Now raise your hand
if you just thought

00:15:28.162 --> 00:15:30.370
this whole thing was contrived
to make the Play Store

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:30.870
look good.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.440
All right.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.020
So there's at least some
cynics in the audience,

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.750
and I appreciate that.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.390
So when I saw these results, I
wondered, how is this possible?

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.265
With the billions of
people that are visiting

00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:48.440
the store and the fact that
all discovery roads end in one

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.430
app store and the other, where
is this disconnect coming from?

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.350
Do developers believe that most
users have made up their mind

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.828
before they come to the store?

00:15:56.828 --> 00:15:58.120
I was wondering the same thing.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.410
Well, I did some digging.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.630
And in fact, a majority
of store sessions

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.670
are discovery-focused,
with people

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.590
searching for things
like free games

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.140
or scrolling through
the home page.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.780
So my takeaway was
that, we, as Play,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.260
have a tremendous opportunity
to improve the effectiveness

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.400
of game discovery.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.130
And here is how we think
about that opportunity.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.190
So for years, game
discovery started

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.910
with the tried and
trusted game icon--

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.170
lots of icons, all
of the game icons.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.300
And we know that you
put a lot of effort

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.920
into carefully
crafting these things.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.180
But there are physical limits
to how much information these

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.250
could possibly convey to users.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.690
The game icon is really
just a narrow, keyhole-view

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.110
into the store listing.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.610
And the store listing has a lot
more information-- there are

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.500
videos, there are screenshots.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.500
But the store listing is
still just another slightly,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.440
less narrow keyhole-view
into the layer

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.110
below the actual game.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.740
And each layer, sure, provides
more information than the last.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.200
But playing the game is
really the first time

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.930
the user can tell if they
found a match for what

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.410
they're looking for.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.740
So we asked
ourselves, how can we

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.770
elevate what's inside
the game-- the soul

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.569
or essence of the game-- to
the front line of discovery?

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.160
How do we move things from this
bottom layer up to the top,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.170
further and further up?

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.140
And over the last few
years, we've, in fact,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.807
been making progress
towards this goal--

00:17:25.807 --> 00:17:27.680
some of this Tian
covered earlier--

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.160
moving content like
trailers and screenshots

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.070
from the store listing
to the top layer.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.650
We recently expanded to
auto-playing elements

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.595
like this, which Tian
mentioned earlier.

00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:40.362
And there's also a
ton of activity inside

00:17:40.362 --> 00:17:42.320
of games in that bottom
layer, the stuff that's

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.020
happening inside the game--
daily events, competitions

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.070
and promotions.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.560
And that's where
live events come in

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.580
and why we have the Events tab.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.360
And we believe the next step
in the store's evolution

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.870
is to bring more of the
essence or soul of the game up

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.370
to that top layer.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.640
And Google Play Instant plays
an important role in this area.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.370
So this next section
is going to provide

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.980
an update on how the
product has matured

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.680
since we talked about it and
announced it at GDC last year.

00:18:13.697 --> 00:18:15.530
So as a quick refresher,
Google Play Instant

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.740
enables users to start games
instantly with a single tap,

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.650
to try the game without
installing or uninstalling,

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.170
and gives you the ability to
launch games from anywhere,

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.200
all over the store, and
Play's properties beyond that.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.620
And since GDC last
year, developer adoption

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.150
has been booming.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.450
Over the last six months,
we've seen 3x growth

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.610
in instant games, and sessions
have grown even further.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.820
So we asked ourselves,
with that success,

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.710
can we elevate
instant games further?

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.535
What else can we do
with this format?

00:18:45.535 --> 00:18:47.160
Could we shift instant
games from being

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.340
just part of the existing
discovery experience to being

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.870
"the" discovery experience?

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.570
Well, the Play
Games App Playlists

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.000
are the first real
attempt to do this.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.610
Imagine in the future
being able to click "Play

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.552
All" on the new and updated
section on the store

00:19:05.552 --> 00:19:07.260
and having an experience
like this, where

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.940
you can go from demo to demo to
demo until you found something

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.066
you love to play.

00:19:14.066 --> 00:19:18.110
Think about how different
that experience would be when

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.410
you are looking for a game.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.940
And the Play Games
app and the store

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.660
are going to continue to invest
and iterate and experiment

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.692
with concepts like this.

00:19:25.692 --> 00:19:27.150
And our success
has also emboldened

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:33.270
us to elevate instant games from
the store listing to the higher

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:38.540
layers here on the home page,
like in this ads example, one

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.150
of the new "Try Now" treatments
that we're testing out.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.390
So expect to see more "Try
Now" buttons on the home page

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.832
in the near future.

00:19:45.832 --> 00:19:47.540
And all these new
experiences were really

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.550
made possible because of
the incredible support

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.760
of our partners who
build instant games.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.930
So the question is, why
were they building them?

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.920
What's behind this growth?

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.800
So there are three
driving forces.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.920
The first, Google Play Instant
is delivering business impact

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.860
to you, the game developer.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.440
Second, we've made
it easier and faster

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.300
for you to build instant games.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.960
And lastly, we've cultivated
an ecosystem of implementation

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.790
and technology partners that can
help you build instant games.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.970
So diving into business
uplift, the key thing

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.970
I want you to take away is
that Google Play Instant

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.840
can work for any game,
any of your games.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.200
And here's a sample of
recent successful games

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.760
to help illustrate
a few key points.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.880
So number one, they've
all achieved improvements

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.160
for the developer
in terms of number

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.900
of users that install the game.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:43.020
That's a big, important thing
to emphasize-- from 6% to 26%.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.570
But in addition
to that, it's also

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.510
important to emphasize
that success can be

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.277
found in any category of game.

00:20:50.277 --> 00:20:52.110
So whether or not you're
building a strategy

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.140
game, an arcade game,
or a casual game,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.980
you can find success.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.670
And second, irrespective of
how you monetize your game,

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.560
Google Play Instant
can work for you.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.380
And that impact can be
particularly pronounced

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.520
for premium games, as
this example illustrates.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.160
And lastly, you can
find success, regardless

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.250
of how you have built
your instant game.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.760
So whether you prefer to use
HTML, like "Flip the Gun,"

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.090
or Unity, like
"Rodeo Stampede" did,

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.160
or a custom engine
or AppOnboard,

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.697
you can be successful.

00:21:26.697 --> 00:21:28.280
And speaking of
developer tools, we've

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.960
made major strides in this area.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.470
So in the lead up to GDC,
our early access partners

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.420
were taking months to
build an instant game.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.270
And with our investment
in Unity and Cocos,

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.200
we got it down to weeks,
then we got it down to days.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.020
But going forward, we
aspire to do two things--

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.730
enable developers to
build instant games

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.550
in a matter of hours, to
cut that down even more,

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.240
and enable every
single one of you

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.140
in the audience to
build an instant game.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.890
And for those of you
who may be skeptical,

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.600
we have a video
demonstration that

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.040
shows that this is possible
courtesy of AppOnboard.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.782
The demo was of their
new studio product

00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:07.240
that was announced last week
that takes a codeless approach

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.590
to building instant games.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.660
And just a warning, the demo
runs at 18 times normal speed,

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.560
so I will be talking quickly.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.400
All right.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.780
So you create a project.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.350
And after you've created
the video and audio assets,

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.320
you can actually import
them into Studio,

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.330
where you can drag and
drop them to build out

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.410
your user experience.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.990
You can set up your transitions
and link them to gestures,

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.550
like clicking and swiping.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.100
You can quickly preview
experience and iterate

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.550
through that process.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.030
And as you can see in
this time lapse here,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:43.110
in under 10 minutes, you could
have your first iteration

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.680
of an instant game.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.730
And this approach to
build instant games

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.003
could unlock a whole
new range of use cases.

00:22:50.003 --> 00:22:52.170
Imagine in the future having
different instant games

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.650
for every user segment,
for every content update,

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.950
for every live
event or promotion.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.550
That's the future we
are building towards.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.750
And another important signal
of Instant's maturation

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.990
is the implementation
partner ecosystem that's

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.730
growing up around the product.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.810
And they help solve critical
problems in adoption for us.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:19.275
And they have been critical
to our success, as a result.

00:23:19.275 --> 00:23:21.650
So to learn more about these
partners and everything else

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:26.330
I talked about today, check
out our GDC medium post here.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.460
And come to our session
at the Google booth

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.670
this Wednesday, to learn how to
build instant games with Unity.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:33.890
And with that, I'll
hand things over to Kobi

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.904
to talk about the power
of Play distribution.

00:23:36.904 --> 00:23:40.362
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.570
KOBI GLICK: Thanks, Ben.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.070
Hi, everyone.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.620
Ben showed you how Play's
content-first approach

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.350
and instant games help
you with discovery.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.330
I want to tell you
about how Play helps you

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.070
with distribution.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.292
I'll cover three things.

00:24:00.292 --> 00:24:02.250
And if there's one word
I want you to take away

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.220
from this talk, it's dynamic.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.100
I'll talk about Android App
Bundles and Google Play Dynamic

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.080
Delivery.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.080
I'll talk about
preparing for 64-bit

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.630
and how you can keep
your users on the latest

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.790
version of your game.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.168
So let's start with the bundle.

00:24:20.168 --> 00:24:22.210
We launched the Android
App Bundles at Google I/O

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:26.380
last year, and more than 60,000
apps and games have already

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.860
switched to publishing Android
App Bundles in production

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.470
on Google Play.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.960
You can build them
with Android Studio,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.540
you can build with
Unity, and recently, also

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.820
with Cocos Creator.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.860
In apps and games,
using the app bundle

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.550
becomes smaller, because
Play's Dynamic Delivery only

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.780
sends the device what it needs.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.860
Our data shows
that, as a result,

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.670
games switching to the
bundle see more than 3%

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.230
increase in their
install success rate.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.580
Large games benefit even
more, with more than 4%

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.610
install uplift.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.550
Gameloft's "Minion
Rush, Despicable Me"

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.065
switched to the app bundle.

00:25:10.065 --> 00:25:13.680
It reduced the size of
the game by 20%, which

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.140
is obviously great for
users, and as a result,

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.580
saw more than 3% increase in
their install success rate.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.790
And there are other
benefits, too.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.980
It's not just more installs.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.650
We see that games
switching to bundle get

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.440
more updates, which makes
sense since the update

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.930
patches are smaller, too.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.050
In addition, we've learned
that the size of the game

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.380
is a major factor in
the uninstall decision.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.880
We're looking into
this area, and we

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.140
plan to share more
numbers later this year.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.770
But generally speaking,
the larger your game is,

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.130
the more likely it
will be uninstalled

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.320
by users with limited storage.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.820
A few months ago,
we shared with you

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.460
that by August we
want you to provide

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.610
64-bit versions of your games.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.520
This provides tremendous
performance improvements

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:11.090
and sets you to a world
with 64-bit-only hardware.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.030
Some concern we've
heard over the years

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.380
is that adding 64-bit support
makes your game bigger,

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.020
because you need to
ship both the 64-bit

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.630
and the 32-bit
libraries to the device.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.540
With the Android App Bundle,
this is no longer the case.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.910
Google Play's Dynamic
Delivery will only

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.580
ship the required
libraries based

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.230
on the device architecture.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.060
And the great thing
here, you don't

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.580
need to do multi-APK
to achieve that.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:41.470
You can do this with a
single publishing artifact.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.990
To learn more about
preparing to 64-bit,

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.600
please join this session
we're co-hosting on Wednesday

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.650
with Arm.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.240
All the details are right here.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.851
And please also read our blog
post for more information.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.690
You all build great
games, and you keeping

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.260
improving them with time.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.590
And for your users
to take advantage

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.720
of your latest and
greatest features,

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.830
they need to be on the
latest version of your game.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.560
And you're probably familiar
with Play's auto updates,

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.230
which reach tons of users.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.970
But given Play's
enormous scale, there

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.850
are always users who
will not be on the latest

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.180
version of your game.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.420
So recently, we extended
our dynamic framework

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.400
and introduced an early access
program for in-app updates.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.310
With this API, you
can update your users

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.200
to the latest
version of your game

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.080
without actually sending
them to the Play Store.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.270
You can see here an
example of how the Chrome

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.940
app is using this API.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.480
And I want to show you
two flows that we support.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.370
The first flow is the
immediate update flow.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.310
This is for cases
when the user must

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.820
be on the latest version of
their game to start playing.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.920
Today, some multiplayer
games already

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.620
do this kind of blocking
flow, where they send users

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.570
to the Play Store
to get the update

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:07.210
and ask them to come
back afterwards.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.860
The great thing
about this new API

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.340
is that it allows you
to do this in line.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.170
You can keep the
user in your game

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.120
while they download
and install the update.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.780
The second flow is the
flexible update flow.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.440
This is for cases where you want
to upsell the latest features

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.630
of your game to your users.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.890
You can have the user download
the update in the background

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.070
while they keep
playing your game.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.230
We are ready to expand
the early access

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.970
program to more developers.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:42.750
So if you're interested, please
register with this URL right

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.010
here.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.100
And we are also planning to
launch this to all developers

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.120
publicly, soon.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.510
Now I want to tell you a little
bit about our future plans

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.220
in the distribution space.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.490
Mobile devices keep
getting better every year--

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.790
more computation power,
more memory and storage,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.270
better graphics.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.840
And as you know better
than anyone else,

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.240
this creates huge
opportunities to deliver

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.670
exciting mobile
gaming experiences.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.830
We realize that to do
that some games will

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.860
need to be large, because they
have high fidelity graphics

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.210
or have a lot of content.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.540
We also recognize that
some of the tools that Play

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.560
has provided for large games
over the years, like OBBs,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.977
were not always the
most optimal ones.

00:29:29.977 --> 00:29:31.435
So the good news
is we're investing

00:29:31.435 --> 00:29:35.860
in this space in 2019.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.630
Before I tell you
about our future plans,

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.270
I want to make sure you're all
aware of how things actually

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:44.380
work now, because we made some
changes in this space lately.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.420
And this is about
how Play validates

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.570
the size of your game
in the Play Console.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:54.730
Historically, we've only looked
at the upload size of your APK.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.340
This doesn't make much sense
in a world of app bundles

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.380
and Play Dynamic
Delivery anymore.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.600
So recently, we changed the size
validations across the board

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.510
in the Play Console,
and we're now

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.360
only looking at the
compressed download

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.580
size of your APK or app bundle.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.960
I started this
talk by telling you

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.990
about the immediate benefits
of switching to the app bundle,

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.170
like more installs
and more updates.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.960
I want to make sure you're
aware that bundles are also

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.740
the future format for
games on Google Play.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.750
Later this year, we
plan to provide you

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.210
new tools to help you
move away from OBBs.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.390
This will be based on bundles.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:38.290
We're going to provide you new
tools to deliver and optimize

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.270
the delivery of game assets.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.340
This will be also
based on app bundles.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.460
So switching to
the bundle not only

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.190
provides immediate
benefits, it sets you up

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:53.500
to benefit from our future
investment in this area.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.530
But while it's really exciting
to talk about the future,

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.190
we all live in the present.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.830
So I want to mention
a couple of things

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.320
that are happening right now.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.770
You're probably all familiar
with the large download warning

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.050
we show to users
in the Play Store.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.600
And over the years, we've
heard some developer feedback

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.690
about how this large
warning negatively

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.380
impacts the conversion rate
for large games on Play.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.790
So we're making a
couple of changes here.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:23.800
First of all, we are going to
be more transparent with users

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.720
and tell them the
exact download size.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.320
As a result, we will no
longer trigger this warning

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.150
when the user is on
a Wi-Fi connection.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.520
And in addition, we
will make the option

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.395
to proceed with the
download more explicit.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.640
And one more thing--

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.820
we will no longer trigger
this warning at 100 megabytes.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.810
Starting today, we are
triggering this warning

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.950
at 150 megabytes.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.380
The size limit of the
Android app bundle

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.300
will be increased
to 150 megabytes

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.440
to make sure you could
take advantage of this.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.390
We are currently keeping the
size limit for APKs on 100,

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.600
but you can still use APK and
OBB until we completely revise

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.180
this space later this year.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.950
So today I talked to you
about our dynamic framework.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.960
I spoke about the
immediate benefits

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.870
of switching to app
bundles, like more installs

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.580
and more updates.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.620
I showed you how it better
sets you for a 64-bit

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.070
and about our
latest API, allowing

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.910
you to keep your users on the
latest version of your game.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.130
Finally, I told you
about some of our plans

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.100
to better support large games
on Google Play and about

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.080
some changes that
are happening today,

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.252
like the new 150-megabyte
limit threshold.

00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:44.460
I hope you enjoyed this talk.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.613
Thank you for joining.

00:32:45.613 --> 00:32:48.030
Now, I'd like to call Fergus
to talk about Android vitals.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.988
FERGUS HURLEY: Hey, everyone.

00:32:52.988 --> 00:32:55.020
I'm Fergus Hurley,
Product Manager at Google.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.090
Android vitals is
a program by Google

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.820
to help improve the
quality of games and apps

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.158
on the Android ecosystem.

00:33:01.158 --> 00:33:03.450
And we've been running this
program for about two years

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:03.590
now.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.130
And I'm going to give you
an overview of the program.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.968
And then we're going to have
Felipe from Tapps Games come

00:33:07.968 --> 00:33:10.260
to stage and talk you through
how they're using Android

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.180
vitals and a bunch
of other tools

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.550
to help improve the
performance of the many games

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.300
that they are building.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.880
So to start off, hands up who
wants more five-star ratings

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.910
and less one-star ratings?

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:24.740
OK.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.790
If you don't have
your hand up, you

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.207
might be working
for a competitor.

00:33:27.207 --> 00:33:29.500
So you might want
to change jobs.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.460
But when we look at the data
for reviews on Google Play, what

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.180
we find is that the vast
majority of people talking

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.850
about negative things
in one-star reviews

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:44.210
are talking about bugs and
stability and other performance

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.070
issues they're having
and causing problems

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.030
on their device.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:52.790
And so 42% are just talking
about stability and bugs alone.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:56.060
When we look at the five-star
reviews on the Play Store,

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.700
we see that 70-plus
percent of the time, people

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.430
are talking about speed,
design, and usability--

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.350
positive performance signals.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.550
So what is the Android vitals
tool in the Play Console?

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:15.739
It is a place where you can go
and see 15 performance metrics

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.810
about your applications.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.750
These are broken out into
five performance areas--

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.310
battery, stability, rendering,
startup time, and permission

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.040
denials.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.170
For each of these metrics,
we provide you detailed

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:35.929
reporting with breakdowns by
APK, OS version, and device.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:38.360
These help you to be able to
understand, where should you

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.639
invest your time in improving
the tech and performance

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:41.880
of your application?

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.971
And these metrics are powered
by real users out there.

00:34:44.971 --> 00:34:46.429
The hundreds of
millions of Android

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:49.360
users who've opted in to
sharing their data with Google,

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.030
and you, our game partners.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.920
And these metrics are becoming
more and more important

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.870
to the business success
of your application,

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.900
because we can see that these
impact retention, engagement,

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.390
and monetization
of games and apps.

00:35:07.557 --> 00:35:10.070
There's a lot of information
in Android vitals.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.760
So to help you prioritize
where you invest your time,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.940
at the top of the Android
vitals section you're

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.630
provided core vitals.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.550
These are the four
metrics that we

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.430
think are most
important to your users,

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.310
and we have data to
show that they do impact

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.270
your performance.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.540
And so the four metrics are in
the stability area, crash rate,

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.330
and ANR rate.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.870
In the battery area we
have stuck wake locks

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.280
and excessive wakeups.

00:35:40.755 --> 00:35:42.540
For each of these
core vitals, we

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.830
have a bad behavior threshold.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.930
And the bad behavior
threshold enables

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.430
you to be able to
know if you're one

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:52.250
of the worst performing
games for that metric.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.760
For the other vitals metrics,
we want you to look at them

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.605
and be able to see how you're
performing relative to others.

00:35:58.605 --> 00:36:01.370
And I'll talk to you
about that in a second.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.950
Some of the vitals
metrics we have right now,

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.050
such as the rendering
metrics, just

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.570
capture UI
toolkit-rendered frames,

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.390
and so they don't
capture open GL.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.120
And so there are no
bad behavior thresholds

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.600
for the rendering metrics or
the other non-core vitals.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.360
It's an area that we
are working to improve

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.450
in terms of having more
insights for your games

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:24.670
that are using open GL.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.340
One of the things that Google
Play is uniquely positioned

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.500
to offer is benchmarking
across different games,

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.550
because we have the data
across the platform.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.050
Right now we offer
category-level benchmarks.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:45.550
So for each vital metric, you
can go in and select which

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:49.960
category of the Play Store that
you're in across all the games

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.460
categories that we
currently support

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.550
and see if you're doing worse
or better than the competitors

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.650
in that market.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.060
And so you can see
then that games

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:02.050
that are in the racing
car games area usually

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.110
have a slower startup
time than other games.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.540
And so this enables you
to be able to understand

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.790
how are you doing
versus your competitors

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.165
and be able to understand if
you should be investing more

00:37:12.165 --> 00:37:13.642
in that area than others.

00:37:13.642 --> 00:37:15.850
This is an area that we are
continually investing in,

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.500
and you should expect to
see a lot more advancements

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.333
in this area over the
next couple of months.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.400
Another major piece of feedback
we got on the Android vitals

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.350
product is that people
wanted to be alerted

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:29.960
when there was a major
change in any of the metrics.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.560
So we have anomaly alert
emails and notifications

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.220
in the console.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.780
These show you when
there's a spike

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.740
in any of your crash
or ANR clusters

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.495
or in any of the core vitals.

00:37:41.495 --> 00:37:42.870
You can be able
to go in and sign

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.415
up for these anomaly
alert emails yourself.

00:37:45.415 --> 00:37:47.040
Just go to the
Notification Preferences

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.840
section of the Play Console.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.070
Sometimes we hear
developers talk

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:58.450
about how Android vitals only
applies to bigger developers,

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.380
and we know that developers who
are smaller, any developers,

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.702
are getting a lot of
value out of the product.

00:38:04.702 --> 00:38:06.160
And if you're not
using it already,

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.620
I'd encourage you to
join the over 100,000

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.550
game and app developers
that are using it today.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.550
Now I'll hand it over to
Felipe from Tapps Games

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.740
to talk about how he's using
Android vitals and other tools

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.100
for Tapps Games.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.450
FELIPE HAYASHIDA: Hi, everyone.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.617
My name is Felipe Hayashida.

00:38:25.617 --> 00:38:27.973
I oversee marketing and
analytics for Tapps Games.

00:38:27.973 --> 00:38:29.390
And before anything
else, I wanted

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.720
to talk to you a
little bit about Tapps.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.210
So we're a Brazilian studio.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.100
We've been in the
market since 2012.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.200
And we have a little
bit over 180 people

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.000
in our studio in San Paolo.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.800
We have a little bit
over 30 million users.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.758
But more importantly,
we've developed ourselves

00:38:41.758 --> 00:38:43.357
over 400 titles
across the years.

00:38:43.357 --> 00:38:45.440
And I wanted to talk to
you a little bit about how

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.490
we deal with this today.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:52.110
So the first thing is, having
400 titles is complicated.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.900
So when we're
talking about this,

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.640
we split our portfolio
in two main areas.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.650
So we have legacy titles,
which are the ones

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.050
that we are keeping
technically updated,

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.380
but we don't really put
anything else in the game,

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.917
so we don't get new features.

00:39:04.917 --> 00:39:07.250
The important part, though,
are the games that are live.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.030
So the games that
we have game squads.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.767
So teams that we
have with people

00:39:10.767 --> 00:39:11.850
from different categories.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:15.210
So developers and testers
and QAs, et cetera-- everyone

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:16.310
on the same team.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.870
And of course,
several of the teams

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.910
are not directly related
to a single title,

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.810
such as marketing, for example.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.490
Each of these titles,
the live ones,

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.770
they go through several
stages of development, right?

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.530
I'm pretty sure you saw several
different frameworks for this.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.780
For us, it's split in more
or less as five categories.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.910
So games go all the
way from concepting,

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.410
where we're figuring
out the market,

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.330
seeing what actually
is happening,

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.310
and seeing what game
we should actually

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.340
build, all the way to having the
gaming operation, where we're

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.860
just keeping them live,
keeping events and pushes

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.443
and how that goes.

00:39:46.443 --> 00:39:48.110
Across several of
these, though, several

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.590
of these stages, a
very important part

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.300
is deployment, right?

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.730
I know several of you have
different takes on it.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.300
And we tend to use it on a
very simple three-stage step

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.370
that I want to
talk to you about.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.453
The first one for us is
pretty straightforward.

00:40:03.453 --> 00:40:04.870
So just talking
about building, so

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.172
getting our game in
the store itself.

00:40:07.172 --> 00:40:09.130
We have a specific
pipeline, because the amount

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.100
of games that we used
to publish every month.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.270
This is highly automated.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:17.200
We use a GoCD pipeline, where
we ship things to the store,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.800
go through automated and manual
testing, and get it live.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.440
The most important part though,
especially for deployment,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.380
is the role of monitoring, which
is where vitals, specifically,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.750
has been very useful for us.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:32.620
This has, for us, takes
from 7 to 10 days,

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.380
where we are rolling out across
our user base who's getting

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.720
the new version of the game.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.240
We have both business
and technical teams

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.200
monitoring rollout.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.800
So while the business team
is just using simple tools,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.260
either through the console
itself or through our own

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.020
analytics-- which is largely
based on Firebase, by the way--

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.660
these are just
checking major metrics.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.700
So are we getting
major drops in reviews?

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.980
Are we getting actual
spikes in reviews?

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.990
And how we can
actually act on it.

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.700
From a technical
perspective though, this

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.980
is where our
developer and testing

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.270
team are the most conscious
about what we're doing.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:10.960
During this phase, we are
monitoring both ANR crash

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.060
rates, which are the
issues that we have

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.560
the most, most of the time.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.920
And these are being checked
constantly and proactively

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.600
across the whole period.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.310
After that's done, we'll
go into live monitoring,

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.530
which is business as
usual for most games.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.710
So there's not just
actually deployment,

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.630
but it's where we shift--

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.640
from a business perspective, we
shift to a much more proactive

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.140
approach.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.140
So we're tracking the
deeper metrics in the game

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.760
that we can't really
see during deployment.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.710
And from a technical
perspective,

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:42.760
we go into a more reactive
side based largely on alarms.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.390
So using Crashlytics and
vitals to having alarms

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:49.000
on all the stores and all
the games that we have.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.150
Because honestly, if you have
400 titles, checking all of

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:55.680
them manually is
just not feasible.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.420
I want to share with
you a simple use

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.120
case that I'm sure
several of you

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.320
have gone through
across the years, which

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.770
was one of our releases last
year on "Bid Wars," which

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.590
is our current biggest title.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.260
So we were releasing a new
version, several updates,

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.140
several partner
updates, and, of course,

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.370
getting a lot of
technical fixes online.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:20.430
In this case, both our
technical and business teams

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:24.060
got a sign as soon as
we were rolling out.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.770
So we got a spike on reviews.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.410
Our games usually have
relatively good reviews.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.510
So getting a spike saying
people couldn't access

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:31.765
a game or the game
was crashing, there

00:42:31.765 --> 00:42:33.060
was definitely something wrong.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.640
And lo and behold, we
were also getting a spike

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.980
on ANRs of the game.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.980
Investigating this was done
as soon as we were reaching

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.810
20% rollout, so
we didn't actually

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.670
reach the whole user base.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.070
And pretty much what
was done was just--

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:49.350
it was on Android specifically,
so we were checking,

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:52.470
we were seeing that we were
getting a lot of crashes

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.570
on specific third-party SDK.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:55.500
How do you solve that?

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.370
As everyone else does.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:02.220
So pull it out, stop rollout,
and actually remove that SDK.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.340
It was something that would take
a little bit longer to test.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.532
It's very important, though,
to notice that this is

00:43:07.532 --> 00:43:08.740
something very common, right?

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.750
There's no secret sauce here.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.960
But I'm pretty sure all of
you have seen this before.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.660
And for us, being able to
catch this before it actually

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.560
impacted our revenue,
so it actually impacted

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.140
most of our users,
it's very important.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.910
And this is part of what we
learned across the years.

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.000
So first, the tools
themselves don't

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.390
have to be that complicated.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:31.560
So know that you don't have
to necessarily overshoot.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.520
You don't need a complicated,
technical analysis team

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.990
to make it work.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.120
You can just have
tools that give you

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.980
what you can react upon.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.828
Second, quality of the app.

00:43:43.828 --> 00:43:45.870
Differently, from what
you used to do in the past

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.450
and from what most
people do, it's

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.190
not about just a technical team.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.833
Everyone is impacted
and everyone

00:43:51.833 --> 00:43:53.250
should be paying
attention to what

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.900
we get on that performance.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.250
And more, in the end, quality.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.490
It's about discipline
and effectiveness.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.080
So know that every
single time that you're

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.620
launching something, you have
to be monitoring actively.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.700
And once it's live, you
have to pay attention.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.790
You can't just expect
it to be ready for you.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.870
So I think that's a
little bit about it

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:13.560
that I wanted to
share with you guys.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.566
And I want to call Fergus
back to talk to us.

00:44:17.566 --> 00:44:20.947
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:24.277 --> 00:44:26.360
FERGUS HURLEY: Thanks very
much, Felipe, for that.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.735
We hope that in
the future, we'll

00:44:27.735 --> 00:44:30.300
be able to share great examples
from you about how you've

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.050
used Android vitals
to be able to improve

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:35.440
the performance of your games.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.180
We know that technical
performance is

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.400
critical to business success.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.440
What we have also heard
is that sometimes it's

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.480
hard to make the
case for investing

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.290
in technical performance
within companies.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:47.650
So I encourage you
to use the benchmarks

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.300
that we provide in
the Play Console

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.270
to make the case of
where you and your team

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.210
should be investing more
to be able to compete

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.270
more effectively.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.310
I'd also encourage you
to focus your attention

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.793
on the core vitals, if you have
limited availability, to be

00:45:02.793 --> 00:45:04.650
able to focus on performance.

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.603
And make sure to sign up for the
email alerts around anomalies

00:45:08.603 --> 00:45:10.020
and get the rest
of your team that

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.690
are focused on reacting
to technical issues

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.100
to sign up, too.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.310
We have a session later today
about bug hunting on Android

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.800
by Damien, who's
going to be diving

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.650
into specific detailed examples
that developers have faced.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.817
So I encourage you to
attend that, as well.

00:45:26.817 --> 00:45:28.609
Thank you very much,
everyone, for joining.

00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:31.363
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:31.363 --> 00:45:32.740
EMILY PUTZE: Hi, everyone.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.120
My name is Emily Putze.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.670
And I am a BD manager on the
Google Play Games BD team.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.670
And today, I am here with
my colleague Jonathan,

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.860
who'll come up to the stage
in a couple of minutes

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.320
to talk to you about
some powerful tools that

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.120
can help you more
effectively market

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.310
your new and existing
games in the Play Store.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.110
As we all know, marketing
is critical to the success

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.765
of games at all stages
of their lifecycle.

00:45:56.765 --> 00:45:59.390
Before launch, it's important to
build excitement and awareness

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:00.980
for your new games.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.010
At launch, you want to turn
this awareness into installs,

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:05.930
and also make sure that
your store listing is

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.140
ready and optimized to attract
as many prospective players as

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.208
possible.

00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:11.750
And of course, after
launch, you want

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.210
to continue acquiring
new users and make sure

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.430
that your store listing
stays relevant, as you

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.150
make big updates to your game.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:21.690
So today, we're going to
focus on a few tools that

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.940
can help you better market
your game in the Play Store

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.440
in each of these three phases.

00:46:28.232 --> 00:46:30.190
First up, let's talk
about pre-launch marketing

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.070
and pre-registration.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.860
Today, many businesses
do pre-launch marketing

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.590
to build hype and awareness
ahead of big upcoming product

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:39.730
launches.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.940
There's a long history of
this in tech, entertainment,

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:46.750
and even in gaming, particularly
in the PC and console gaming

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:48.790
worlds, where
pre-launch marketing

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.260
and even things
like pre-ordering

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.605
are well-established norms.

00:46:53.605 --> 00:46:54.980
Well, today,
pre-launch marketing

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:57.813
is also increasingly
popular for mobile games.

00:46:57.813 --> 00:46:59.480
However, until recently,
it was actually

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.772
really hard to do pre-launch
marketing for mobile games

00:47:01.772 --> 00:47:04.250
well, because there was
no real way for developers

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.250
to tie all the marketing that
they were doing across channels

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.738
directly to their game launch.

00:47:09.738 --> 00:47:11.155
Instead, what we
would tend to see

00:47:11.155 --> 00:47:13.510
a developer do is
spend a lot of money

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:16.120
prior to launch to build
hype and awareness,

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.340
use suboptimal tools
that really only allowed

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.380
you to capture a
portion of the demand

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.630
that you were creating
through that marketing,

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:25.360
and mostly just hope that
that buzz that you created

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.510
would translate into
real installs at launch.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.570
Well, today, as you heard
a little bit earlier,

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.480
I'm very excited to announce
that Google Play's solution

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.740
to this pre-launch marketing
problem for mobile games,

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.850
a feature known as
pre-registration,

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:44.535
is now available to all
developers on Google Play.

00:47:44.535 --> 00:47:48.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.510
So for those of you
who are not familiar,

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.780
Play's pre-registration feature
is an extremely powerful tool

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.240
that essentially allows
developers to fully capture

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.520
the demand that you generate
through your pre-launch

00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.840
marketing activities.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.910
And we actually activate
that demand for you

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.030
on your launch day.

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.180
So how does this
technically work?

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.680
Developers essentially tie all
of their pre-launch marketing

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.840
across channels to one
page in the Google Play

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.500
Store, your pre-registration
store listing.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.340
And that listing has
a very clear call

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.190
to action for interested users,
where they can pre-register

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.100
for your upcoming game.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.670
And in return for
pre-registering,

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.490
what users will get is
actually a direct notification

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:26.770
from the Google Play
Store letting them

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.880
know that your game
is now available,

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.513
allowing them to be some of
the first to install and play.

00:48:32.513 --> 00:48:34.680
Now, pre-registration also
has a lot of key benefits

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.090
for developers at
launch, as well.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:40.840
Not only does pre-reg allow you
to engage and reward your core

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.590
fans early, but pre-registration
notifications also

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:49.100
drive a high volume of D1 and
D7 installs, both in general

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.370
and when compared to other
pre-registration tools

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:53.480
that are available
in the market.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.480
In other words, Play's
pre-registration tool

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.170
is extremely effective at
converting pre-registered users

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:00.920
into installs.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.170
In fact, across all
geographies and all genres,

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:06.350
we tend to see that
there is a 38% conversion

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:09.710
rate from pre-registered users
to installs after launch.

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:12.380
Now, this is a much,
much higher conversion

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.470
rate that you would see through
other pre-registration sources,

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.000
around 2 to 3x, and
it's pretty compelling.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.605
Plus, Play's
pre-registration campaigns

00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:24.480
are actually really easy
to setup and manage,

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.940
and you can do that directly
in the Play Console.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.850
So in the Pre-Registration
Center on the console,

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.010
you can setup and
manage your campaigns,

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.990
you can decide
which countries you

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.230
want to run your
campaigns in and when,

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:38.783
and you can actually view your
campaign performance data.

00:49:38.783 --> 00:49:40.200
So for instance,
before launch you

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.158
can see the number of
users who have signed up.

00:49:42.158 --> 00:49:44.117
And after launch, you
can see how many of those

00:49:44.117 --> 00:49:45.520
users converted into installs.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.370
And you can do these
breakouts across geographies.

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.980
Another very cool feature
related to pre-registration

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.560
that is now available
in the Play Console

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.110
is related to Play Instant.

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:00.910
Earlier today, from
Ben and others,

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.670
you heard a little bit about
how effective instant games are

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.010
in terms of driving
user conversions.

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:09.220
Well, as of today, we are
very excited to also announce

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.890
that now you can add an
instant experience directly

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:14.210
to your pre-registration
store listing.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.750
And this will allow you
to attract even more

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.000
users to sign up for
your full product launch

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.390
and drive greater
awareness and excitement.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.280
Another pre-registration
feature that

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.590
will be coming soon
to the Play Console

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.380
is the ability for developers
to grant rewards directly

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.272
to pre-registered users.

00:50:32.272 --> 00:50:34.480
Now, this is really exciting,
because what we've seen

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.750
is that rewards, in general,
can help drive greater consumer

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.120
interest in
pre-registration campaigns.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.290
So for instance, listings
that actually market

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.210
pre-registration rewards can
drive as much as a 15% higher

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.380
click-through rate
than those who don't.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.810
And on the backside,
when it comes

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:52.660
to conversions to install,
pre-registration rewards

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.120
can also help drive
higher conversions.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.700
Because on day one, there
is value waiting in-game

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:02.415
for pre-registered users to
come, claim, and consume.

00:51:02.415 --> 00:51:03.790
So as I mentioned,
you can expect

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:07.810
to hear more about
this very, very soon.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:10.090
Lastly, I'm excited to
share one more product

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.710
update around
pre-registration, which

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:15.250
is that Google Ads will now
offer app campaign support

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:17.760
for pre-registration campaigns.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.740
Obviously, this is
a great, new way

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.990
to reach prospective
players, but more

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:24.324
to come on this in
sessions this afternoon.

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:29.450
Finally, a few recommendations
for developers who

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.910
are interested in
using pre-registration.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.980
First, allow time
to build excitement

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.410
within your audiences
before your launch.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:38.060
Generally, we see
developers starting

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.120
pre-registration campaigns
anywhere from 3 to 12 weeks

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.970
ahead of launch.

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:45.820
Second, make sure you're using
all channels at your disposal

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.980
to support your
pre-registration campaigns.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:52.350
This means social, CRM,
media, you name it.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:56.070
Third, make sure you drive your
Android traffic to pre-register

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:58.830
in the Play Store, due to
the higher conversion rates

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:02.590
we see in the Play Store
versus external websites.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.780
And finally, consider
using Play Instant

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.970
alongside your
pre-registration campaigns

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.100
to drive greater consumer
interest and awareness

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:12.072
for your upcoming launches.

00:52:12.072 --> 00:52:14.030
Now I'd like to invite
my colleague Jonathan up

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.340
to the stage to talk to you
about some other powerful

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.454
marketing tools that can help
you at launch and beyond.

00:52:19.454 --> 00:52:19.954
Thank you.

00:52:19.954 --> 00:52:23.258
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:26.448 --> 00:52:27.740
JONATHAN CHEUNG: Thanks, Emily.

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.170
Let's switch gears and talk
about some exciting features

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:32.030
around store listings.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:35.210
Whether during pre-launch,
launch, or post-launch, having

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:36.620
an effective store
listing can be

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.230
critical to the
success of your titles.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.660
For many, your store
listing is the first thing

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.180
a user will see about your game.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.270
If it doesn't immediately
grab their attention,

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:48.990
they're likely to move on.

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:51.120
In general, we see that,
for game developers,

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.713
your icons, videos,
and screenshots

00:52:53.713 --> 00:52:55.380
are particularly
important on your store

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.640
listing for user acquisition.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.710
For instance, game
devs can see up

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.620
to 40% difference in
conversion performance

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.140
when testing different icons.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:09.190
And data suggests that we see
similar variability for videos

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.570
and screenshots, as well.

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.820
We've also seen that the
ordering of your marketing

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:17.002
assets can impact
user acquisition.

00:53:17.002 --> 00:53:18.710
Because gamers really
want to quickly get

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.990
a sense of the true
gameplay experience,

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.480
we really recommend that it's
important to put marketing

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.690
assets that highlight
key gameplay features,

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:28.620
like your videos
and screenshots,

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.210
upfront in your store listing
in the first position.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.160
Also, a quick PSA--

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.140
it's important to
call out, that to be

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.690
eligible for the new
visual promotional clusters

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:43.620
on the Play Store, you must have
a landscape-orientation video

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.820
trailer and a minimum of
three landscape screenshots.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.950
So really make sure you
have these, and put them

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.330
up front in your store
listings to get the most out

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:55.420
of your users.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.230
Now, I will say that one of
the most common pain points

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.593
we hear from developers
about store listings

00:54:00.593 --> 00:54:02.010
is that, although
they can already

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.410
localize into
different languages,

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.600
they want the ability
to customize their store

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.510
listings based on
where their users live.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.030
For instance, maybe you're
making a sports game

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:14.390
and you want to market
it as football in Europe,

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:17.790
but soccer in the US, in order
to make your store listing as

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.280
locally relevant as possible.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.500
Well, now you can.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.710
Today, we're excited to announce
a powerful new feature only

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:28.680
available on Google Play
called country-targeted store

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.070
listings.

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.020
With this feature,
you can customize

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.970
your store listings based
on the user's country,

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:37.090
as well as their locale setting.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:39.100
And from the Play
Console, you can

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.530
create up to five different
groups of countries

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:43.830
and set up a completely
different store listing

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:48.112
for each group, complete with
full localization support.

00:54:48.112 --> 00:54:49.570
All parts of your
store listing can

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:52.420
be customized, from your
icon, your screenshots,

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.390
your promo message,
your video, you name it.

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:58.420
And you can also localize
everything there, as well,

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:02.690
in order to better appeal to
users in your target market.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:07.060
Even better, because you can
target different store listings

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.160
to different countries,
technically, you

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.770
can target based on
the state of your game

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:13.670
in different countries, as well.

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:15.820
So for instance, in games
we're running actively

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.340
pre-registration,
your listing might

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.990
want to highlight
the rewards users

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:23.410
may get for pre-registering
or display a pre-launch teaser

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:24.580
trailer.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:27.830
And in countries we are actively
enrolling for open tests,

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:30.660
your store listing can
highlight key gameplay features

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.160
in order to entice people
to install and become

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.930
part of your test.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:37.750
This is a really powerful way
to target your marketing message

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:39.700
to the right sets of users.

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.740
And country-targeted
store listings

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.340
is launching right now to all
developers on Google Play.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.660
Now that we've talked about
the importance of your listing

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:52.880
for the lifecycle
of your game, I

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.880
think it's also important to
discuss one of the best ways

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:58.370
to test and manage changes
to your store listing

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.110
in a controlled fashion--

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.470
store listing experiments.

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:06.200
Store listing experiments is
one of the most popular tools

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.940
among top game developers.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.580
It's a tool that allows you
to A/B test your store listing

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.820
assets against user traffic,
so that you can make the most

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.550
data-informed decisions
about which of your assets

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:19.010
are driving the most installs.

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.740
Using Play Console,
you can swap out

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.450
assets on your store listing,
such as your screenshots

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:26.520
and video, to certain
percentages of users

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.840
who visit your store listing
and compare the performances

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.910
of each variant before applying
them to your full user base.

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:38.240
As mentioned before, testing
and optimizing certain assets

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:41.150
can yield huge differences
in performance.

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:42.710
Running experiments
also allows you

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:48.220
to roll out these changes in
a safe and controlled fashion.

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.710
For those of you that are
already using store listing

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:53.590
experiments, we are happy to
announce that we've recently

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:55.240
rolled out some
exciting improvements

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:59.450
to how experiment
results are reported.

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:02.000
First off, we are
introducing two new metrics,

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.390
which are replacing the existing
metrics on the Play Store.

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:07.820
First-time installers,
it tracks users

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.450
who see your listing in a
store for the first time

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:13.340
and omits reinstallers who are
less likely to be influenced

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.140
by your store listing.

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:19.280
Day-one retained users tracks
users who install and do not

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.260
uninstall within one day.

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.910
We believe both of
these new metrics

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:25.118
more accurately reflect the
performance of your store

00:57:25.118 --> 00:57:26.060
listing.

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:27.530
And you, as
developers, can choose

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:29.690
which ones to use as
your success metrics

00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:32.290
in your experiments.

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:35.170
Both metrics are also reported
at hourly intervals updated

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:38.140
every few hours, allowing
you to see results faster.

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.140
And you can also now opt in to
email notifications about when

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:42.960
your experiments finish.

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.680
By reporting the results faster
and providing notifications,

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.730
you can run more experiments and
terminate bad treatments faster

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:51.720
to minimize install drops.

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.940
All of this is coming right
now to the Play Console

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:57.810
and is available
to all developers.

00:57:57.810 --> 00:57:58.400
OK.

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.567
So here are some tips and
tricks about store listing

00:58:00.567 --> 00:58:01.490
experiments.

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:04.070
Have a clear objective
about what you want to test,

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:05.720
and test one thing
at a time to make

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.800
sure the experiment results are
great before you apply them.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.770
Test for 7 days minimum in
order to get weekday and weekend

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:13.980
performance.

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.000
Prioritize testing of icons,
videos, and screenshots

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.873
for the biggest impact.

00:58:18.873 --> 00:58:20.540
And you can also
invert your experiments

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.670
to validate the true performance
before applying to all.

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:25.300
OK.

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.950
So that about wraps up my
talk about marketing tools.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:30.460
And I wanted to give you some
key takeaways from the session

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.260
that you can do right now.

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.350
Consider using pre-registration
for your upcoming launches.

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:38.150
It's a great way to build
interest, pre-launch.

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:39.560
Consider building
an instant game

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.450
to run alongside this
campaign, as well.

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:44.920
Optimize your store
listings using SLEs.

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.920
Top developers are already
finding great success

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.300
to using this.

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.610
And finally, look into how
you can make your store

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:52.540
listings more
relevant to your users

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.230
using country-targeted
store listings.

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:56.790
For instance, using
a store listing

00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:00.870
to run pre-reg and one for
launched or test countries.

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:01.860
Thanks.

00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:04.590
Next, I'd like to invite
Nacho to the stage, who's

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:07.161
going to talk about lifetime
value for your games.

00:59:07.161 --> 00:59:09.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.110
IGNACIO MONEREO: Hi, everyone.

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:14.190
My name is Ignacio, or
Nacho, as people call me.

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.120
I am based in London.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.400
I work with game developers
across the Western Europe

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.510
region.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:20.650
And this session is
about lifetime value,

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:21.690
which is a dense topic.

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.030
And it only started for
me about three years ago,

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:26.670
when very often I heard this
term mentioned in my meetings

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:27.770
with developers.

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:31.890
And in fact, it's a very
popular metric to the point

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:34.020
that the latest
report by Mary Meeker

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:38.280
last year was mentioning this
is the number one metric when

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.080
it comes to ad spending.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.770
So really, really, developers,
they care about it.

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:45.060
And if you take into
consideration the context where

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:48.480
we are, on one side we have
the mobile gaming industry,

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.040
which is highly competitive.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.590
And on the other hand,
we have all this data

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:55.440
that we're sitting on, and
it's becoming more available

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.040
and easier to handle.

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.250
So this is really
leading to developers

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.830
to feel the need that
they need to understand

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:06.180
the value of their players
from the very first minute they

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.780
jump into the game.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.780
And as such, they're using
lifetime value metric

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.055
for many purposes.

01:00:11.055 --> 01:00:12.930
So the first one is like
marketing viability,

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.280
which we spoke already.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.790
So how far we can
push those CPIs

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:19.260
and how much we can invest
in acquiring a user.

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.780
But also, we see a
lot of developers

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.240
thinking about live-ops and
running some of the offers,

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.030
running some of the
promotions within the game.

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:28.770
As well, if we
think even bolder,

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:31.110
we can think about
product prioritization.

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:32.780
We can think about
new games, if we

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.720
are looking to improve our LTV
across the portfolio of games

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.840
that we have.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.620
And last but not least, if
we subtract some of the cost

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.500
and we think about it
in net terms of LTV,

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.820
we can think about
the profit margins.

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.280
So as an example,
GameHouse is a developer

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.190
based in the
Netherlands and Spain,

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:53.870
and they're using lifetime
value to do many of the things

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:54.620
that we mentioned.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.230
So they're doing
user acquisition.

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.180
They are doing remarketing,
re-engagement, retargeting,

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.550
and they're even
thinking about LiveOps

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:05.480
for the new game,
"Doctor's Oath."

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.910
So in an ideal world,
our lifetime value metric

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.200
would look like in this way.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.450
So it would be predictive,
where we're looking forward

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:15.382
rather than just
like historical data.

01:01:15.382 --> 01:01:17.840
It would be a metric that is
extremely accurate, because we

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.170
need to take decisions with a
certain degree of confidence.

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.870
It would be also looking at an
individual level rather than

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:24.610
cohorts.

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:25.598
And it would be fast.

01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:27.140
From the very first
day, we will know

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.790
what is the value
that this player is

01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:31.400
going to bring in its lifetime.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.900
As well, the model
that we're using,

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.400
it would be fast
and simple, meaning

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.770
that we don't have
to spend months

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.690
in order to train this model.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.190
But the first thing
that you learn

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:42.440
when you start researching
about lifetime value

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.230
is that there is no standard
way of calculating it,

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:47.630
which means that this
comes with some trade-offs

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:49.100
and some challenges.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.740
We asked Plarium, an
Israeli developer,

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.720
the creator of
"Vikings, War of Clans,"

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.665
and they told us they
faced three key challenges.

01:01:56.665 --> 01:01:58.790
The first one is how to
estimate the lifetime value

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:00.380
for a certain type of players.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.880
They call it outliers,
and these are

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.460
players that they might
be highly engaged,

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.680
but still, they are non-payers.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.770
As well, they have multiple
games in their portfolio.

01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.420
And it's very difficult
for them to use

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.420
one unique model that
really is adjusting

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.540
to every type of game.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.580
And last but not
least, the long window

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.700
that is needed to validate
these models, in fact,

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.830
is higher than expected.

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:26.380
But whenever we are
talking about developers,

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.770
they see that these
models, all of them, they

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:31.840
have several common
things, common areas.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.810
In this case, we
could have split

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:35.310
lifetime value in three areas.

01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:39.270
And the first one we would
talk about, what is lifetime?

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:42.360
That is generally represented
in daily retention,

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.830
and this is a classic way.

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:45.300
But here, many
developers, they are

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.570
starting to think about whether
the classic retention is

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:50.862
like the one that makes more
sense for their own game,

01:02:50.862 --> 01:02:52.320
and they can think
about other ways

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.080
of calculating retention,
such as, for example, range

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.640
or rolling retention.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.860
Also, think about retention,
it means, right now,

01:02:58.860 --> 01:02:59.820
opening the app.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.220
But it is not the same as if
we're opening the game just

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.820
to collect the daily reward
or to play another battle.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.360
The second area
would be the value.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.735
And this is
generally represented

01:03:08.735 --> 01:03:13.457
by purchases or by averages,
such as ARPDAU or ARPPU.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:15.540
And in this case, if you
are considering averages,

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.840
it's very important to take into
account, as well, how long are

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.010
you going backwards?

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:23.400
Let's imagine that, for example,
you ran an offer last week.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.900
And then last but not
least is the period.

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.410
So how far are we going
into the future in order

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:30.080
to estimate our lifetime value?

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.830
And generally, from my
conversations with developers,

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:35.070
it all comes down
to two things--

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:38.910
the nature of the game, and as
well, how well-funded are we

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:42.840
in terms of acquiring users
for like a period of 180 days

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.210
or 365 days.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.380
Here we have an example
that I just mentioned.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:51.220
For example, in this case, we
are taking the ARPPU of a user

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.940
and we are projecting
for 180 days.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.670
So other things that
developers take into

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:59.440
account when they refer
to lifetime value.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.040
So we have, first
of all, how do we

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.990
integrate all the
different business models

01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:06.210
that we are monetizing nowadays?

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:09.330
So how do we include
in-app purchases together

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:11.700
with subscriptions
and together with ads?

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.500
As well, if you are
a developer that

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.960
has multiple games
in your portfolio

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.060
and you are running some
sort of in-house ads

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.100
and cross-promotions,
it is the best practice,

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.558
that some developers, they're
thinking about their lifetime

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.780
value across their
whole portfolio.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.870
Last but not least, we're
talking about, as well,

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:28.890
virality and K-factor effect.

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.050
So this might not affect
the lifetime value,

01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:33.800
but indeed affects the
return on ads spent.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.210
And some other areas
that developers can see,

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.940
there is, as I said
before, net LTV.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.357
Also, the frequency when
we do these calculations,

01:04:41.357 --> 01:04:43.440
and what are the segments
that we are using, if we

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.360
are applying averages.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.510
So I tried to cluster,
which is very difficult.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.880
I tried to cluster all these
models into three areas.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.820
So the first one, if
we have small data,

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:56.250
we have to make
decisions, we can

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.420
see that these simple
predictive models,

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.210
which are looking at averages--

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:01.890
we are trying to
estimate based on this,

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:04.200
for example, a
bottoms-up approach

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.160
or a top-down approach.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.370
We are trying to estimate
the lifetime value of a user.

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:10.920
You have a number of tools
available today in the Play

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.590
Console, and, as well,
in some analytical tools,

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:16.680
such as Firebase, where you
can extract this information

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.380
and start working
around these models.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:23.130
If you have more data and
you have more mature games,

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:25.770
actually, also you have
more resources to dedicate,

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:28.930
you can think about these
predictive statistical models,

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:31.320
which generally they're
coming from the offline world,

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.820
and they are backed by academia.

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.680
And you have a couple
of examples here--

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.590
Pareto-NBD, BG-NBD.

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:39.180
The good news is that
they are open-source,

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.740
and you can download
the libraries.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.800
In this case, I put
Lifetimes Python library,

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.660
which is open for everyone, and
you can start playing around.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.740
The good news is it will have
individual predictive lifetime

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:50.660
values already.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.252
And it would be very helpful
if you want to run live-ops.

01:05:53.252 --> 01:05:55.710
And then last but not least,
we have the predictive machine

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:56.640
learning models--

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.848
way more sophisticated, a
bit more complex, as well.

01:05:59.848 --> 01:06:01.390
But they're extremely
helpful, if you

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.557
are trying to understand
what are the behaviors that

01:06:03.557 --> 01:06:06.745
are driving certain actions,
such as making purchases.

01:06:06.745 --> 01:06:09.120
If you want to start-- like
we have Firebase predictions.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.090
There is going to be a
session later on today.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:15.930
And you can think about
using these as a first step

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.377
into these type of models.

01:06:17.377 --> 01:06:18.960
Obviously, if you
have more resources,

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.660
you can use Tensor
Flow or AutoML

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.810
to build your own algorithms
based on random forest

01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:27.600
or neuronal networks.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.260
So GameHouse, the same developer
that I was mentioning before,

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.350
they use historical data
combined with machine learning,

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:37.580
and they're able to estimate
a lifetime value within a week

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.148
with 90% accuracy.

01:06:40.148 --> 01:06:41.190
So which one is the best?

01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:43.310
This is the most
trickiest question.

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:46.583
I would say, in this case, also
the answer would be it depends.

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:48.000
It depends on your
resources, what

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.470
you want to do with this
metric, and how much effort

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:51.470
you want to put into it.

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:54.410
If you, for example, don't
have too much data or too much

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.690
resources, some of the
simple predictive models

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:57.830
would be interesting.

01:06:57.830 --> 01:07:01.490
If you, for example, have a very
clear focus on user acquisition

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:03.600
and you have the data
and the resources,

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.600
some of these machine
learning predictive models

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.270
could be very helpful
in order to understand

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:11.390
the likelihood of a new
player becoming a payer.

01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:13.310
And then, if you
have a mature game

01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:15.590
with lots of data and
highly-engaged users,

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:18.120
you can think about
predictive statistical models,

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:22.495
which they run very well
to calculate live-ops.

01:07:22.495 --> 01:07:24.870
I want to spend the last two
minutes talking about a case

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:25.430
study.

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:29.367
Space Ape is a developer
from the UK founded in 2012.

01:07:29.367 --> 01:07:30.950
And he's the creator
of popular games,

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:33.445
such as "Samurai
Siege" and "Fastlane."

01:07:33.445 --> 01:07:34.820
In this case, the
Space Ape, they

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.310
calculated the lifetime value
based on historical data

01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:39.200
and using statistical models.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.500
They have data for
about one to six months.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.170
And after the day two,
they are able to estimate

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:48.650
what is going to be the lifetime
value with an 80% to 90%

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:49.760
accuracy.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.920
The way they do it is
they create segments

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.350
based on tenure,
based on geography,

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:57.080
and they multiply the
revenues generated

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.540
of that particular
player by a ratio

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.430
that they estimate
based on their models.

01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:05.540
So the LTV is mainly used for
user-acquisition purposes,

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:10.070
but also Space Ape
uses it for live-ops.

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:13.580
The LTV metric is
refreshed on a daily basis.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:17.270
And they have two interesting
additional LTV metrics.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:21.020
One is called LTV+, which
essentially is adding a small

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.770
percentage to these metrics
and is used only for user

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:25.800
acquisition purposes.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:30.020
And this is to take into account
the virality or the K-factor.

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.330
Then, the second
one is the ad LTV.

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:35.149
And what they are doing
is, thanks to partnerships

01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:38.090
with networks, they are
trying to understand

01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:40.670
what goes beyond the
ad view and even what

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:43.490
would be the conversion
of a particular player

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:46.770
when they see a rewarded
ad, for example.

01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:50.120
So in essence, for Space
Ape, lifetime value

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.180
is a critical metric,
and they aim to actually

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.430
have a return in that
span of at least 100%

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.887
in the first two months.

01:08:56.887 --> 01:08:59.220
So with this, I would like
to conclude with four things.

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.040
So the first one
is, remember, we

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.380
are using lifetime value for
user acquisition purposes,

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:07.819
but you can use it, as well, for
other topics or other purposes,

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:11.840
such as live-ops, or
in this case, net LTV.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.810
As well, when possible, try
to use a predictive model,

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:15.950
an individual.

01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:17.848
And as well, consider
other things,

01:09:17.848 --> 01:09:19.640
such as how are we
going to use this model?

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.290
How are we going
to use this metric?

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:25.430
And if we have, for example,
multiple apps in our portfolio,

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:28.649
how are we going to incorporate
other business models?

01:09:28.649 --> 01:09:31.200
Now, last but not least,
predicting the future obviously

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.859
is not 100% accurate
science, so take these more

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:37.479
as a tool and as a metric
rather than just a goal.
