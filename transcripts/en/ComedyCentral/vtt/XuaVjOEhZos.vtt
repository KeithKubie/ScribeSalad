00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.203
- We at Nintendo would
like to thank you for

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:07.273
making Pokémon Go the most
successful app of all time.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.875
We also know that
playing Pokémon Go

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.977
can lead to some
tricky situations

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:13.213 align:start size:88% position:13%
so we are legally
obligated to remind you

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:15.648 align:start size:84% position:16%
to please be careful
while hunting.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:17.884
Now let's meet Nathan.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.854
Nathan loves Pokémon Go
but if he's not careful,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.455
he could end up hurting himself.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.556
- Charmander!

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:26.559
(crashes)

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.961
- So before you catch them all,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.029
please remember to check out--

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.363
- Ooh, a Pidgey!

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.134
(playful music)

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:37.237
(thumps and crashes)

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.777
(breaks glass)

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:47.147
(boxing bell rings)
(crowd cheering)

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.848
(punches)

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.884
(crowd cheering)

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.055

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:23.516 align:start size:75% position:25%
(tires screech)
(crashes)

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.019

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.954
(door slams)

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.123
- [Man In Hoodie] Oh my god!

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.191

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.794
Yes!

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.329

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.931
