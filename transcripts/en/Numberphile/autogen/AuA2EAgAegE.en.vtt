00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 "James": We'll talk about (e)! 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 The famous hard (e), well, it is one of the famous sports constants. 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:15.620
 One of the most important constants, such as pi (pi), the golden ratio and square root of number 2. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.800
 Mathematical constants are the most important types of constants, and (e) is one of these constants. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.060
 (e) is a non-relative number, which equals: 2.178281828 ... etc 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.300
 The hard problem (e) is that it is not an engineering identifier (using geometry). 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.180
 Now, hard ebay (pi) is a fixed geometry identifier. It is the ratio between the circumference of the circle and its diameter. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.100
 Which was known to the ancient Greeks. Many of the geometric constants are due to them. 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.800
 But the constant (e) is different, it does not depend on geometrical form, it is not dependent on geometry. 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.820
 It is a mathematical constant linked to inflation and the rate of change, but what are they associated with? 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.760
 Let's take a look at the issue that was used for the first time. 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:18.340
 So, we will return to the seventeenth century, this is Jacob Bernoulli, who was interested in compound interest, which is to earn interest on your money. 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.980
 Imagine you have a pound in the bank. It is a very generous bank, offering you 100% annual interest. 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.500
 Thank you very much, Bank! 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.820
 100% interest, so, after a year ... 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.240
 You will own two pounds. 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.520
 You have earned interest of LE, and you have the original pound in the bank ... 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.900
 So, you have two pounds. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.360
 What if you are offered 50% interest every six months? 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 Is it better or worse? 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.860
 Well, let's think about it ... 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.560
 Well, you will start with a single pound, then I will offer you 50% interest every six months. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.780
 So, after six months, you will have a pound and a half. 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.180
 Then you will wait for another six months, and you will earn 50% interest on the total amount of your money ... 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.240
 And another 75 piasters ... 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.500
 This will bring together what you already have, so that you have a profit and a quarter. 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.060
 This is better! 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.720
 it's better. But what happens if I do this more regularly? 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.180
 What if I added interest every month? 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.800
 I will offer you a benefit of 1/12 each month. 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.240
 Is that better? 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.140
 Let's think about it. 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.180
 After the first month, it will be hit in the following number: 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.640
 1 + 1/12 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.840
 1/12, this is your advantage, and you will add the value of this interest to the pound you already own. 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
 You will do this in the first month ... 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.280
 Then in the second month ... 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.040
 You will take this value and hit it again .. 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.060
 In the same value. 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180
 And in the third month you will hit her again ... 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.780
 and again. 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.780
 You will do this twelve times a year. 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.980
 Therefore, to calculate the total value in general, 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.320
 This will be raised to S12. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.600
 The value will be 2.61 pounds. 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.700
 So this is actually the best. The fact is that the more regular the interest is added ... 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.200
 The better the result. 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.840
 Let's try this every week. What if you added a profit every week? To what degree would this be better? 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.780
 What I mean is that you earn 1/52 of the original amount per week. At the end of the year ... 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.460
 You become 52 weeks, and the total amount will be 2.69 pounds. 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.060
 It becomes better and better. 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 In general, you can notice a pattern that consists ... In general, the final form will be as follows: 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.720
 You hit at (1 + 1 / n) ^ n. Please note that this pattern occurs. 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.460
 So, here, n = 12 if you add interest every month, and n = 52 if you add interest every week. 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.500
 If you add interest daily the value will be equal to 1 * (1 + 1/365) ^ 365 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.620
 This is worth 2.71 pounds. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.660
 Well, it would be better if you added interest every second or every nanosecond. 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.560
 What if I added interest consistently? 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.520
 At every moment I earn a continuous benefit. How would this look? 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.920
 This means that I have this formula here ... 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.240
 It will become (1 + 1 / n) ^, where it is bound or goes to infinity. 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.780
 This will be a constant interest that never ends. Now, what does this mean? What is this value? 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.240
 This is what Bernoulli wanted to know. 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.100
 He could not solve it, but he knew that it was between the two and three, so Euler managed to solve it 50 years after Bernoulli's idea. 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.240
 Euler fixes everything! 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.560
 "Brady": Is he the mother of Gauss? 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.180
 James: Either Euler or Gauss, if you say that Euler or Gauss will be right. 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.020
 And the value that Euler had reached was 2.718281828459 ... etc. 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.540
 Brady: We were very close to this value when we added interest daily, right? The value was 2.71 when you added interest every day. 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.040
 James: You're right, we were getting closer to value, right? 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.560
 We were getting closer and closer to that value. So when adding daily, we were really close to it. 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.020
 But if you do it forever, you will have a disproportionate number. 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.080
 Euler called this value (e). He did not release his name on it, yet it is known as the Euler number. 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.600
 "Brady": And what he named (e) then? 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.440
 James: It was just a character. He may have already used A, B, C and D for something else. 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.000
 is not it? So he used the next letter to them. 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.580
 "Brady": a strange coincidence! 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 James: I think it's an amazing coincidence! I do not think he was arrogant and called it the first letter of his name. 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.960
 But it is an amazing coincidence, the value called (e), and the number is Euler. 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.920
 Brady: Would you call it G if you discovered it? 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.600
 James: No, I did not call it C, but I was hoping someone else would call it C ... 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.340
 I would agree to this. 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.180
 Euler proved to be a disproportionate number. 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.440
 He created a new formula for the calculation of (e), not the previous one, but a different one. 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.000
 And have proved that it is a relative number, I will show you this quickly. 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.500
 It was found that (e) is equal to two plus one ... 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:57.480
 One Plus One On Two Plus One On One Plus One On One Plus One On Four Plus One On One Plus One On ... 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.320
 One plus one on six ... And this goes on endlessly. 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.940
 This break lasts forever, breaking is not finished. And you can see that it lasts forever 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.520
 Because there is a pattern, this pattern remains true. 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.660
 You have 2, then 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, etc. 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.560
 And so you can see that the pattern goes on forever, and breaking it is an unfinished break. 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.700
 This means that it is a non-relative number. 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.160
 If it does not last forever, it will be finished, and if it is finished, you will be able to make it in a fractional form. 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.160
 Euler also calculated the value of (e), and reached eighteen decimal places for this figure. 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.580
 To do this use a different formula. I'll show it to you. 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.240
 This time, find that (e) is equal to 1 plus ... 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.180
 1 on the 1 plus 1 multiplier on the 2 plus 1 multiplier on the 3 multiplier 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.400
 Plus 1 on the 4-stroke. This goes on forever. 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.780
 It's a good formula. If you do not know the meaning of the multiplier, the multiplier is the sum of all the numbers. 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.580
 For a given number, if it is multiplied by 4, it will equal 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.040
 Well, why is this so important? Because (e) is the natural language of inflation. 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.660
 And I'll show you why. Well, let's draw a graph, where Y = e ^ X (Y = e ^ X) 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.560
 Here, we take the basics of (e). So at zero, x = 0 (X = 0), the line will intersect at one. 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:21.860
 So if you take a point on this graph, the value of the point will equal (e ^ X) 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.800
 Therefore, this is important. The inclination at that point, the slope of the curve ... 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:36.860
 At this point it equals (e ^ X), the space under the curve, which means the space under this curve ... 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.980
 Even an infinite minus equals (e ^ X). 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.580
 This is the only function that has this feature. 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.520
 The value, inclination, and area at each point are equal. 

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:58.920
 So, at number 1, the value is equal to (e), because the value at this point is equal to e ^ 1. The value is equal to 2.718 and the slope is equal to 2.718 ... 

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.840
 The area below the curve is 2.718. This is important because it is a unique property. 

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.780
 Because of this characteristic, e becomes the natural language of differentiation. 

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.840
 Differentiation is the mathematics of the rate of change, inflation and spaces. 

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:26.960
 If you are interested in these things, if you write with (e), math becomes much simpler. 

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.560
 Because if you do not use e, you will get lots of complex constants 

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.400
 And then the math becomes chaotic. If you are trying not to use e, 

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.020
 You make things harder. It is the natural language of inflation. 

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:49.700
 Of course, the constant (e) is famous for combining all the famous mathematical constants together using this formula ... 

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:57.700
 Which is as follows: (e) Pi plus one equals zero (e ^ + + 1 = 0) 

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.500
 Here we get all the important mathematical constants in one formula. 

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:11.240
 We have (e), and we have the imaginary number (i), which is the square root of one negative, and we have the pi, and the numbers 1 and 0. 

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.140
 They have been compiled in one version ... 

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.380
 Which most people see as the most beautiful formula in mathematics. 

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.160
 I've seen her a lot, and I feel a bit bored. Do not put this in the video clip!
