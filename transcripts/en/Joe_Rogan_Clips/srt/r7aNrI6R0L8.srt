1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,770
The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. That's
called theirs. I think they should bring,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,050
they shouldn't, you know how hockey that
you still fighting hockey? Nascar fights.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,810
Yeah. Pull out in the pit. Stop
wants Duke it out. Let's, yeah,

4
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:16,050
let's say if there's a caution. Everyone
else was lapping. You've got two guys.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,400
Have a beef pullover. Get out of the car.
Whoa. In the middle of the infield grass,

6
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,670
we have a wrestling rink and it's like
full on. Let's go get in the rink.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,870
We'll get it, we'll give you two
minutes. And then if you win that match,

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,510
maybe you get a little time
shaving off. You know? So it's uh,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,090
there's advantage to, uh, I'd watched
that more if it were like half wrestling,

10
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:40,590
half now put the Natya leap, right.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,820
Mascot Nascar's a weird one, right?
Because it's, it's obviously fun to watch.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,080
It's fun to be there, but it's not as fun
as Formula One. You Watch Formula One,

13
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:53,580
you're like, well, these guys are going
way faster when those wheels. Yeah. Yeah.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,260
I mean, that's a whole nother thing.
Yeah. Those wheels touch. It's over.

15
00:00:58,261 --> 00:01:01,200
You're in the air right now.
Yeah. These guys now is called.

16
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:05,520
A lot of that happens and it's fine.
It's true that one wheel. Wow. Yeah.

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,190
And those guys die. Yeah. Well I
guess Nascar guys did too. Yeah.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,860
Not as much anymore, but mean anybody's
driving a fucking car going fast can die.

19
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,780
What am I saying?
But there's something about,

20
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:17,430
have you ever see the video between um,

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,120
they showed gt three race racing
versus formula one racing.

22
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,500
It's the same track and they
show a good gt three car look,

23
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:30,210
a Porsche going around this car really
fast and then they show the same exact

24
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,870
path being taken by a formula one
car. And you're like, Jesus watches

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,180
watches. Yeah. One on the left,

26
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:43,020
the tool and won't how much faster
they are now. What's the Oh, okay.

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,770
That's the same track as the same track.
Exact same turn.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,520
Look how much goddamn faster.
They are bad at it so far.

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,390
Is that car going on the right?
I don't know, man. That's insane.

30
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,940
It seems amazing and perfect line.
He's cutting.

31
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:00,000
See how the line perfect racing
line is cut into the groove.

32
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,670
Like you see that darkness. Yup. Yup.

33
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,120
That's a bunch of talented drivers.
Another thank you.

34
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,840
I think the fastest I've
ever been is like maybe 115.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,470
You ever been on a racetrack? I've been
on a race track. Yeah. Yeah. But not,

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,880
you know, not at a pace car, you
know. Oh, the Nascar. Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,140
But uh, but the Daytona 500
has that huge, you know,

38
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:27,141
the incline and just being down there
and seeing that standing there next to it

39
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,280
like, well, I didn't know his best steep.

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,140
You have to go faster and stay
on that then that is pretty wild.

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,910
And people get hit up there.

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,690
They bump wheels up there and
collide and fucking spin out. Yeah.

43
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,050
Look at that thing. Yeah.
Yeah. That's a serious bank,

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,060
like a wall that is a little turn to
the picture, but still. What is, um,

45
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,280
what do you think that degree is? Like
what angle? Uh, they've told me before,

46
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:58,890
I forgot. It's probably
like, it's pretty serious.

47
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,410
20 degrees first one third or one degree.
One degree. Whoa. Wow. That's crazy.

48
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:06,550
That's insane. That's, I mean,

49
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,460
if you would be nervous if you're
on a skateboard on that thing,

50
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,350
you have to go a certain speed just to
stay up on the probably, right. Yeah.

51
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,600
It's such an American sport,
man.

52
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,600
Nascar's so American because it's allowed
as fuck. Yeah. The cars are gross. Yeah.

53
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,860
They look to Scott. They're
so gross looking. Yeah.

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,810
They don't look anything
like the real car. How many
sponsors are all right? Yeah.

55
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,000
If you have a really nice car that's
supposed to be the model that that car is

56
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:35,750
and that the Cask, our car
looks gross and they, the decal,

57
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:38,600
they make fake headlights.
It's a sticker of the head.

58
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,590
I won't even put that on there. Yeah. What
are we doing? Why are you lying to me?

59
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,530
It's a fascinating piece
of equipment though. Yeah.

61
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,430
That we've decided to make these things
that just drive really fast and then

62
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:56,170
hurl them around the circle,
this oval over and over and
so high tech, like every,

63
00:03:56,171 --> 00:04:01,110
they count every little, the drafting
of it, they, they know it. Every angle.

64
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,580
It's, you know, all of
that. But back in the day,

65
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,680
it was just a couple of good old boys.
That moonshine.

66
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,830
I'm trying to outrun this actually.
Yeah. That's actually what I want to say.

67
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,500
That was hot rodding and it's
fine. It's, that's what it was.

68
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,470
That's what I want to say. Put money
down in them cars and that fun that,

69
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,040
that's where it all came from.
Yes.

70
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,420
Guys are trying to figure out how
to get the fuck away from cops.

71
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,490
Cops used to have the
fanciest cars, man. Yeah.

72
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,390
You think that they had to chase
people and like caprice classics

73
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,260
with Bob Bench seats? Yeah. That is the
worst car from handling with dress shoes.

74
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,160
Yeah. Oh my God. They make them
wear a stupid shoes. Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,740
Some Nike's that's back in the day.

76
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,950
That's like the fur on the beach while
I taught I was on the ocean was Daytona

77
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:48,640
500 the first event. Uh, you know, I
think so. I think, well, I'm not, no,

78
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:53,530
I don't know about that, but I know
that's, it was on the, on the sand. Okay.

79
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,580
The first Daytona was on the sand. I
believe she's around the sand. Yeah,

80
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,940
they're driving in the sand. This
is crazy. They're not going as fast.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,820
All those cars are social, convertible.
It looks like the Batmobile.

82
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,680
They are convertibles. Convertibles.
Wow. That's what I want to see.

83
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,030
I'll bring back the dam convertible in
Nascar. I want to see these dudes faces.

84
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,960
Wonder why they made them in
convertibles? I'd have no, yeah,

85
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,410
well they got the roll
bar. Yeah. But still,

86
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,290
I mean I bet it gets too hot in there
and they probably didn't have air

87
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,920
conditioning. Right. And yeah,
that's probably it was, it's on fire.

88
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:29,920
It's easier to get out when you
don't have a roof. Yeah. Yeah.

89
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,640
Those people probably died. Those
things all the time. Those shitty cars.

90
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,030
Like if you are a car racer back
then you were going to crash.

91
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,440
There's no way you're going to know.

92
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,220
You're not going to keep
it together every time. Uh,

93
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,560
what's the fastest you think
you've been in a vehicle?

94
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,370
I don't want to say cause we're on
there. Ah, well you know, you say where,

95
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:52,720
what country it was in. Uh, I don't
know. This could be on Germany,

96
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:55,810
on the auto mile. In the
one hundreds yeah, yeah.
