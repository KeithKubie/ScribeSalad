00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:02.011
What actually would happen if you open the

00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:03.861
windows on a plane which it was cruising at

00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:06.881
10,000 meters? Maybe you think the plane

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.610
would explode. Maybe you think that

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.208
everyone would get sucked out of the window

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:12.724
or you maybe you just think there won’t be

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:14.463
enough oxygen and passengers will start to

00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:16.977
pass out. Choose the best answer and I’m

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:19.462
warning you if you’re a movie buff, you might

00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:23.000
actually be in bad shape to answer this question.
