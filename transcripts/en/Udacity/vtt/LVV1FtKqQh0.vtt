[NOISE].

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:04.900
Design.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.240
&gt;&gt; Congratulations, everyone.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.530
You've finished productionizing
the Sunshine app.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.430
&gt;&gt; But isn't there always room for
more sunshine?

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; You know, there is, Dan.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.940
But now it's time for the students to
go and finish their final projects.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.750
&gt;&gt; And you can find a lot of
the resources you need to build a great

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.180
mobile app on the Android
developer site.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.860
&gt;&gt; And stay tuned for
more from us, and Udacity.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.130
&gt;&gt; For now,
let's celebrate with some cake.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.908
&gt;&gt; Ooh, marshmallow.

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:30.472
Nougat.

00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:31.536
&gt;&gt; Cheers.
