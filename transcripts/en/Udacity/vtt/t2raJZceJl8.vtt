00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.070
The answer is the middle two.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.040
This first one might not be true.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.660
A may well be in P.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.210
But B could be something much harder and
not be in P.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.070
The fact that we can turn
an instance of problem A,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.610
into an instance of problem B,
doesn't tell us anything.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.320
The same logic applies
to the last theorem.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.690
The answer then, is the middle two.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.820
The second one is just what
the previous theorem said.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.971
And the third, is just
the contrapositive of this statement.

00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:30.162
And it's this contrapositive version
that we use most in the study of

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:30.830
complexity.
