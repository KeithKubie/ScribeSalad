00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.200
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.970
[ Music ]

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:27.050
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: I wonder if you
wouldn't mind jumping over to some

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.090
of the pieces that are
from a part of the world

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.890
that you're very directly
engaged with in your history.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.810
So from La Raza Graphics, we have
a couple of things over here.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.920
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
From La Raza Graphic Center.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.220
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Yeah.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.520
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Right?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.820
From La Raza Graphic--

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.330
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Screen
Print Center, exactly.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.060
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: La Raza
Graphic Center, Printing Center.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.230
So this particular--

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.530
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: You were there.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: I was there.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.130
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: This
is your neighborhood.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.430
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: I was
there in the neighborhood.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.660
So the poster we have over here,
it's a bit of a place I remember

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.570
that was on 16th and Mission.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.520
And this is a 1982 poster
from La Raza Graphic Center.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.440
And it says right there they
do typesetting, silkscreen,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.850
illustration, logo
design, cartoons, and on.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.260
And I remember going to
La Raza Graphics just

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.060
to get some flyers done or to
just say hello Herbert Siguenza,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.860
Malaquias Montoya, and
was it Linda Lucero?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.180
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Linda
Lucero, Juan Fuentes.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.980
And they're pictured in
this image in this studio.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.110
And so you've been to this place
and you know these artists.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.460
And they printed the
poster that we've put along

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.760
with the scene from the studio.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.460
And this is very personal,
something that you helped to build.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.760
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.830
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: El
Tecolote, bilingual newspaper.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.370
And you did something specific.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.670
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yeah.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.970
So this El Tecolote [inaudible].

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.900
So this El Tecolote,
beautiful poster

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.190
that was done at La Raza Graphics.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.530
And it's celebrating the El
Tecolote 8th Anniversary.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.830
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: So 1978.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.130
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: 1978.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.430
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: 1978.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.730
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: 1978.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.230
And I was there in 19-- I kind
of got into the Mission District.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.400
This is what takes place in
San Francisco, in the Bay Area.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.270
And with Francisco Rincon.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.210
And I kind of teamed up
with many good friends

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.060
in the Mission District,
Victor Martinez

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.790
and La Handra Muhia [phonetic],
Roberto Valdez [phonetic],

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.750
and we're many good
friends [foreign phrase].

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.420
And we, Francisco I believe, put
together the event to propose

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.530
that we form Tecolote
[foreign phrase],

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.860
kind of like a literary insert.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.560
Tecolote means paper [inaudible],

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.580
so really open arms and
invited us to do so.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.910
And then we began to call
on poets from the Bay Area

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.240
and throughout California
United States and Latin America

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.090
to send us poetry and art.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.030
And we did that for
a number of years.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.170
And Francisco Rincon has
always been at the heart of it.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.470
Also Horgeta [phonetic].

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.980
And Susan Martinez from San
Jose did a lot of the art.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.280
And many more good people.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.660
So these are very-- I'm
very close to these posters.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.910
So these are very-- I'm
very close to these posters.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.050
I'm so glad you have them here.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.050
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: It's part
of an amazing collection.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.280
Mission Graphic [inaudible]
collection is more

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.640
than 1,000 prints and posters.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.830
We were talking about how
it's many different art forms

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.130
and many different artists.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.870
So the posters are
reflecting activism,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.370
but they're also reflecting--
it's a whole universe.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.910 position:56%
So they're reflecting the community.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.700
They're reflecting this
party that's in celebration

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.140
of the 8th anniversary
of the newspaper.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.120
Dance, music, poetry
readings, there's a poster

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.030
for a poetry reading that you
participated in in this collection.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.970
So this is just very rich.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.770
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Many
of the people, you know,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.590
sometimes people talk
about an art movement

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.280
or a poetry movement
or a social movement.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.860
Well, this is what it is, you know?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.240
It's people working out of
a cultural center or out

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.890
of a small storefront like La Raza
Graphics, or have a smaller space

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.570
like El Tecolote [foreign phrase]
El Tecolote Community Newspaper,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.920
bilingual newspaper,
Spanish and English,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.270
and putting out some beautiful
posters and doing readings

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.520
and doing art and activism,
newspaper, stories, journalism,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.020
and doing a little
business for the people

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.320
by creating silkscreens
of beautiful events.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.400
So so many beautiful things.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.810
And so I'm so happy.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.250
And look at this right here.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.620
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: This is--
this was an amazing experience.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.260
I was invited to the print-making
studio/class that's in Quentin,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.130
which I hadn't known this existed.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.780
And this would have
been around 2008.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.140 position:56%
And the instructor, Katia [phonetic]
Macoa [phonetic] invited me.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.530
And I sat and watched the
artists making linocut prints,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.730
and I talked with them, and you've
selected a few things to show

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.780
from this portfolio, San
Quentin Art's portfolio,

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.220 position:56%
and by a particular artist featuring
this artist Ronnie Goodman.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.520
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Ronnie Goodman.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.820
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
He continues to--

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.360
so these were prisoner
artists at the time.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.290
Ronnie Goodman is now working in
California and exhibiting and,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.160
you know, working actively
as an artist still.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.690
But he's very, very talented.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.650
It's very compelling
work, in my opinion.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.950
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's beautiful.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.690
You know, I noticed that
Ronnie Goodman does a portrait

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.740
or includes an image of Frida
Kahlo in one of these prints.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.050
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Do
you want to share it?

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.350
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Oh, sure.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.650
Let's share it.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.180
And there's a figure with kind
of an angelic figure right here

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.650
with the big wings and he's kind
of sitting down facing down.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.140
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
And this is the artist.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.440
It's a self-portrait.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.740
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And this is the artist,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.040
a self-portrait, Ronnie Goodman.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.920
And this takes place in a
prison location, a prison space,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.640
place of containment
without keys at the moment.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.190
But there is the key of art.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.490
And above--

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.810
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
A way of being free.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.450
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And here's Frida Kahlo,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.950
an image of Frida Kahlo.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.570
And I haven't seen
this kind of image

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.760
of Frida Kahlo to this very moment.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.060
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: It's unique.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.620
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: It's
very unique, very unique.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.210
And it's the night stars
and the black and white.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.510
And very moving.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.370
African-American artist.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.670
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: That's right.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.970
He's holding his paintbrushes.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.270
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Holding his paintbrushes.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.570
So I'm really moved by--

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.870
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: That's the key.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.170
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's the key.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.470
That's the key.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.770
Beautiful.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.200
And that's the key that we're
inviting all of you to use

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.460
because you already have that key
to express yourselves, to write,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.750
to view these beautiful materials
from [foreign name], our prints

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.040
and photographs, the vision
here at the Library of Congress

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.050
that we want to bring out to you.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.780
And La Casa de Colores'
annual long-year project.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.080
And I just can't believe it,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.920
all these good materials,
and Ronnie Goodman.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.240
And right here in front of us--

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.540
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
Elizabeth Catlett.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.130
So one of the great-- and
I'm going to show this

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.410
so you can sort of look at it too.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.710
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Okay.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.010
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
Elizabeth Catlett is one

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.220
of our great canonical
American artists.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.700
And so she was-- I want
to say she was in her 80s

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.390
when she made this in 2005.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:34.440
And it's very cool because all
of the color is digital and all

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.950
of the blocks for the
framework is lithography.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.500
So she's sort of straddling
the old and the new.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.800
It's called Gossip.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.100
This piece is called Gossip.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.350
And this is just this
beautiful little intimate scene.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.100
And she's known often for
portraying women, strong women,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.330
and this is a very
contemporary expression of that.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.630
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And they look

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.100
like they're having
a serious exchange,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.890
something that has taken place.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.190
I can't believe it.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.490
I love it.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.790
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: I love it too.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.720
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
