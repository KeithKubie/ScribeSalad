00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.360
&gt;&gt; David Mandel: Good evening.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.800
I'm David Mandel, the
library's head of exhibits.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.180
On behalf of the Librarian of
Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.840
I'd like to welcome you
all to tonight's program,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.370
opening the library's
Baseball Americana Exhibition.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.910
It was Dr. Hayden who
greenlight this project

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.930
and was instrumental
in making it happen.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.430
And we are very appreciative
her support.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.760
We began developing Baseball
Americana, the team set

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.460
out to produce an
exhibit-based experience,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.290
that provides meaningful
engagement

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.930
with the library's collections
relevant to baseball.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.850
We did this with
story and design.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.490
The storytelling focused on the
idea of baseball as community

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.450
on any given day when
the weather is nice here

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.400
in the United States
there are boys and girls,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.700
men and women playing softball
and baseball from Oakland

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.530
to Omaha, from Albany
to Atlanta.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.930
The story structure was a broad
thematic sweep of history,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.690
people and growing inclusivity.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.140
The design rifted off
architecture organic

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.440
to baseball.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.230
The grandstand, a public space
where people come together.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.510
We set out to make an
immersive environment

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.570
that would be a place where
the library's visitors can also

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.870
come together.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.040
Those with a love of
baseball and those

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.370
who are new to the game.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.890
Those who already
know the library

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.680
and its extensive collections,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.420
and those who are
discovering its treasures

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.880
for the first time .

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.190
We hope it's a place where the
story of baseball as community

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.060
and related items on display,
the interactive experiences

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.550
and design inspire conversations

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.010
and create enjoyable
moments and memories.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.780
The best exhibits combine
engaging aesthetics

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.610
with intellectual rigor.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.910
That was our goal.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.290
And I hope you and all

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.570
of our visitors feel
that it was obtained.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200
Exhibitions are collaborative
endeavors.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.370
I'd like to think my
main co-conspirators

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.340
in committing this act of
active visual communication.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.240
Our curator, Susan Rayburn.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.020
Our exhibition directors Betsy
Nahum- Miller and Cynthia Wayne.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.660
Our deputy chief of exhibitions

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.800
and production manager Karen
Worth [assumed spelling].

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.580
Our education specialist
Naomi Coquillon.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.140
June Ni [assumed spelling],
our digital project specialist.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.440
And our colleagues

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.700
in the Interpretive Programs
Office and Library Services.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.560
Pure and applied were our
wonderful, exhibition designers,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.790
Northern Light Productions
made our audiovisual pieces.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.370
Space Design built and install
our grandstand and graphics

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.020
and Color Ad our exhibit cases.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.760
Lastly, I'd like to thank our
content partners and lenders.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.600
Major League Baseball, the
National baseball Hall of Fame

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.750
in Cooperstown, ESPN
and Mr. Hayden Trubitt.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.960
Now, please welcome the
curator of Baseball Americana,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.510
Susan Reyburn to introduce
tonight's featured guests.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:09.120
[ Applause ]

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.070
&gt;&gt; Good evening everyone
and welcome

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.800
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.270
Thank you all for coming.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.130
The calendar says tomorrow is
June 29th, but for the Library

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.300
of Congress it will
be opening day,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.210
as Baseball Americana officially
begins its year-long run.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.510
I hope you all had a chance

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.710
to get an advance peek
earlier this evening

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.650
and that you will all send out
to everyone you know copies

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.150
of the baseball cards you
just made of yourselves.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.910
Hashtag Baseball America.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.270
You will probably have noticed a
couple themes in the exhibition,

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.630
including a comparison
between baseball then and now

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.780
and how the game has
fostered a strong sense

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.010
of community among
teammates, fans, neighbors,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.610
and of course baseball
stat geeks and stat heads.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.630
A group that will find
tonight's discussion

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.170
especially illuminating.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.040
There are items in
the exhibition

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.860
that specifically
address baseball's ancient

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.540
and unique obsession
with number-crunching.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.370
Whether it stats on the
back of baseball cards,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.830
hand color hitting charts

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.120
that Whitey Herzog
produced by the thousands.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.530
A game of Strat-O-Matic,
or the use of sabermetrics.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.070
A newspaper broadside from
1859 covering the first

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.440
intercollegiate baseball game
includes an early example

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.430
of a box score, before things
got so much more detailed.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.910
Taking stats to an extreme,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.450
we display a book illustrating
Allan Roth's mind-numbing,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.370
seemingly endless formula

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.370
that reduced a player's overall
performance to a single number.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.710
Roth anticipated the
importance of OBP.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.530
I've been looking a
lot of acronyms lately

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.280
on base percentage, a concept

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.930
that plays a central
role in Moneyball.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.520
It all used to be so
simple; batting average,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.810
home runs, runs batted in.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.240
The acronyms BA, HR, RBI were
easily understood by those

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.970
who had only a passing
acquaintance

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.400
with the game or mathematics.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.940
Today, of course, nobody
has just a batting average.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.780
They have an entire
slash line, EA/OBP/SLG.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.140
And if you have slash marks,
you also probably have WHIPs,

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.950
that walks and hits
per innings pitched.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.210
Slashes and WHIPs,
obviously would lead to WAR,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.710
that is wins above replacement.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.010
Meanwhile, Major League
Baseball's stat cast calculates

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.310
new forms of data.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.570
Such as average launch,
angle and exit velocity.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.660
For most fans in
the general public,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.160
the concept of what is now known

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.100
as sabermetrics reinterpreting
data and inventing complex,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.400
comprehensive methods

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.330
for calculating player
performance first entered the

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.820
national consciousness
with the 2003 publication

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.770
of the eye-opening and
best-selling book "Moneyball,

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.860
The Art of Winning an Unfair
Game" by Michael Lewis.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.200
And the subsequent
film released in 2011.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.680
"Moneyball" represents
an important milestone

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.780
in the crowded field of
excellent baseball literature.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.790
As many of you here know, the
book chronicles the efforts

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.490
of Oakland A's general
manager Billy Beane

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.220
to build a strong team
with a weak budget

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.670
by using advanced forms
of statistical analysis

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.350
to identify worthwhile players

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.040
who were overlooked using
conventional scouting methods.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.050
"Moneyball" not only look back
on what happened in Oakland,

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.570
but it prompted an entire
sport to look forward

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.450
to what this new
approach offered.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.340
The Library of Congress
currently has more

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.320
than 9000 baseball books and
few have had such an immediate

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.670
and resounding effect
as "Moneyball."

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.070
It influenced the way
teams evaluated players

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.860
and built rosters, and
it prompted front offices

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.390
to add science and
technology to the hunches

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.330
and gut instincts
of veteran scouts.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.450
More than a sports book,
"Moneyball" is also a book

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.200
about business and success.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.950
Finding an edge among
opportunities that others miss.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.720
In celebrating the
exhibition opening,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.840
The Library of Congress is very
pleased to have with us tonight,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.010
Michael Lewis the
author of "Moneyball,"

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.580
and pioneering baseball
analyst, Rob Neyer.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.750
In addition to "Moneyball,"
Michael Lewis is the author

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.140
of several other popular works

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.210
that have also made
it to the big screen.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.510
Including "The Big Short,"

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.980
about the financial
crisis that began in 2008.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.570
And "The Blindside,"

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.900
which followed a high school
football lineman's journey

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.770
from hardship to success.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.890
His latest book is
"The Undoing Project,"

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.560
which examines how
we make decisions.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.580
Rob Neyer is a former senior
baseball editor for Fox Sports,

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.300
an analyst for ESPN,
and a research assistant

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.870
to the baseball stats
guru Bill James.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.370
He is the author of several
baseball books including the

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.350
forthcoming "Powerball, Anatomy
of The Modern Baseball Game."

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.560
He was also just recently
named the Commissioner

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.250
of the Summer Collegiate
West Coast League.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.960
To get into a "Moneyball"
frame of mind,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.200
we've got a clip from the film.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.510
Take a look.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:19.350
[ Applause ]

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.190
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Let's just
jump right into this thing.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Let's do it.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.360
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Because
we've already introduced

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.790
and we all know what
this is about,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.770
so let's just talk
about "Moneyball."

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:36.100
I met Michael back in
the summer of 2002.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.020
Oddly, I had read
one of his books

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.990
and enjoyed it but
forgot his name.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.410
So, when he introduced himself,
I had no idea who he was.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.730
But told he was writing
this book about baseball

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.030
and focusing on the A's.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:53.020
And we talked, and it wasn't
until the book came out.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.320
And he shared with
me the manuscript.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.930
But it wasn't until the
book came out that I,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.480
of course that we realized we
had a phenomenon on our hands.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.390
But I want to first ask what
led you to start hanging

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.670
around the Oakland
Coliseum in 2002?

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Well,
there's a back story.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.870
And the back story was, I
followed my wife to California,

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.080
Tabitha had a Fellowship
at Stanford.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:25.290
And I had always, as a little
kid been a fan of the A's.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.590
And I'd been a fan of the a's

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.470
because my high school
baseball coach had come to us

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.490
from A's spring training,
where he'd been beat

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.570
out for the starting
catcher job by Gene Tenace.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.100
And decided that the Minor
Leagues were no longer for him.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.400
He was from New Orleans.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.700
His name was Billy Fitzgerald.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.000
And he showed up with
Gene Tenace's mitt

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.520
and an incredibly persuasive rap

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.050
that I was the next
Catfish Hunter.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.480
And the only thing I had in
common with Catfish Hunter was

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.640
that I didn't have a fastball.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.700
But he turned this into
like a positive attribute.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.070
Just like him, you've
got no fastball.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.340
And so, the A's; I started
following them from then.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.980
So, we're now in
the A's backyard.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.620
And I started watching games
on TV again for the first time.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:19.180
And this was late nineties,
when salaries are exploding.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.340
And I started to pay attention
to the money on the field,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.680
because salaries are exploding,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.290
and I was particularly
interested in the beginning

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.560
with the question of
whether there was kind

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.210
of class warfare within teams.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.490
You know, the leftfielder was
being paid $6 million a year

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.880
and the right field
was making 150-grand.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.920
And I wonder how pissed
off the right fielder was

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.910
when the left fielder
dropped a fly ball.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.210
And I was watching for that.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.390
I was seeing, are they
starting to hate each other?

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.610
Is the inequality in
baseball expressing itself

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.910
in the team dynamics?

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.790
And that's why I
started paying attention.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.890
And then, I started realizing
these payrolls are radically

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.190
different from each other.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.400
And that the A's had no money,
and they were playing some

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.010
of these teams with
all this money.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.150
And that made me curious,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.570
because they were
doing real well.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.870
How could you?

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.920
If the market for baseball
players was efficient,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.750
the team with the most money
should just buy all the best

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.560
players and win all the games.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.630
That seemed to be a question
worth trying to answer.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.750
And then, two things happened.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.920
I met a man named Dough
Pappas, who died not long after.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.610
But, who was in the
part of the Society

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.820
for American Baseball Research.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.540
And he sat me down and he
showed me analysis he'd done

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.650
that showed just how
extraordinary it was what the

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.240
A's were doing with their money.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.610
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Marginal wins.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.910
Right?

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: That's right.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.510
It was dollars per win.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.220
And they were winning so
many more games per dollar

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.820
than every other team.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.470
If it had been a normal industry
they would just acquire all the

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.770
other teams and run them too.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.920
They were clearly running their
team, it looked like they were

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.380
in a different business.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.540
So, that caused me to call
Billy Beane, who was at the time

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.400
at spring training in 2002.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.180
And I said I'm thinking
about writing a neat little,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.640
something about this,
I'm curious about it.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.340
I thought it was going to
be maybe a magazine piece.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.810
And I flew out and
spent time with him.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.280
And after a day, I
thought oh my God.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.580
This is big.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.340
I don't know how big, but and
I didn't know what it was.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.040
I'd never written a sports book.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.760
So, I didn't even think
to myself at first

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.380
that there would be an interest
in me writing on the subject.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.610
So, it took some time
before the storm gathered

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.400
and I realized exactly
what this was.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.700
Maybe six or seven weeks.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.960
But it was six or seven
weeks of really kind

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.040
of immersing myself
in the organization.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.340
So, that's the beginning of it.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.640
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: And was there?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.870
We talked about your
process before,

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.690
you typically start off thinking

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.550
with luck this is
a magazine piece.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.230
And with more luck, or a great
story, it's more than that.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.880
Do you remember a moment or
moments when you thought oh,

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.070
this actually is a book, this
is my next six or either months?

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So,
I remember it vividly,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.040
because I took action.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.240
I had not told anybody I was
doing this except my editor

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.600
at "The New York
Times Magazine,"

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.820
who was faintly interested,
but you know.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.230
He was humoring me.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:21.940
And it had become
clear, that yes,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.040
they're doing things
differently than everybody else.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.340
Yes, he's thinking about;

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.640
the person who's running
this team is thinking

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.050
about his players differently

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.780
than the other organizations
are.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:35.270
But it wasn't until, it
was a night, I decided,

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.780
so they were conducting
what amounted

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.020
to be a science experiment
in baseball.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.740
And the lab rats
were the players.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.790
And I remember asking Billy
Beane, what do the players think

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.090
about this experiment.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.790
And he said, we don't tell them
it would only confuse them.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.210
He said, but you know,
you've got a first baseman,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.510
who's never played first base.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.020
You've got a leadoff
hitter who's slow.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.510
You're using people in
all kinds of strange ways.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.420
And you don't explain it?

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.520
And he said, don't explain it.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.480
Now, what I found, just
generally in my writing life,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.600
that it's easier to
insinuate myself into a world

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.380
if I can add some value.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.760
So, of course, the first thing I
do is run over to the clubhouse

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.580
and start telling players what
I learned from the front office.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.880
And they were like?

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.180
You're shitting me, really?

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.480
That's why I'm playing
first base?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.780
Tell me more.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.150
And so, at the end of every,
what I was starting to do

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.550
after every game, I'd
meet with one player

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.120
and tell him what I knew.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.260
And then get kind of a feel
for who these people were.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.560
Because I was already thinking,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.030
who are the characters
in this story.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.390
And I was already thinking,

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.040
it's the hitter who's
the most unlikely

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.340
that people don't appreciate.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.280
And it's the pitcher who's
most unlikely, you know,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.580
people don't appreciate.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.880
But I wasn't sure
who those were.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.090
And I was sitting in the
clubhouse after the game

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.260
and waiting for a player
to come talk to me.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.310
And I looked up and I was
seeing all these naked bodies.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.490
It was the first time I'd
seen the Oakland A's naked.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.680
And it was such an
unpleasant site [laughter].

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.660
It was repulsive.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.880
A baseball uniform, I mean
it really is a business suit

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.180
for an athlete.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.140
It hides all the problems.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.120
And I mean there were
guys with fat ankles.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.220
There were guys, I mean
they just didn't look good.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.010
And I went to the A's,

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.560
I went back to the
front office that night.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.190
And I found Paul DePodesta,

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:34.540
and I said I just saw your
guys naked, and I said,

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.940
it was such a strange site
that I thought to myself,

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.520
if you line all those naked
bodies up against a wall,

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.260
and asked anybody what
they did for a living,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.140
nobody would guess
professional athlete.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.620
And he says you kind of
stumbled on part of our story.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.970
And the story is we're
in the market for players

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.360
who the market miss
values in some way.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.750
And one of the chief sources

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.420
of mis-evaluation is
physical appearance.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.070
A good-looking player
will be overvalued,

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.800
and an ugly player
will be undervalued.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.590
A player who doesn't look
the part will often be an

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.050
opportunity for us, because
we can detect his value

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.350
with statistics.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.650
and I remember driving home
from the coliseum that night

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.600
and thinking, wow, it's
not a baseball story.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.760
It's a story about the way
markets miss value people.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.430
Forget that it's a sport.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.290
Imagine this is just a business.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.840
You've got employees
on the field,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.460
who have been doing basically
the same thing for a century,

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.680
with statistics attached to
every move they make on the job.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.880
With millions of people
watching them while they work.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.080
And all those people think
they're experts on valuing them.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.070
If that person can
be miss valued

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.920
by the market, who can't be.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.770
A story of women
in the workplace?

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.820
A story of Jackie Robinson.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.930
There was something
universal about this.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.830
About the way people
get misjudged.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.460
And I went home, and I wrote my
editor, WW Norton, my publisher,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.580
Starling Lawrence who's been my
editor since my very first book.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.940
And I said I've got had
bad news and worse news.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.400
I said the bad news is the
reason you haven't heard from me

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.440
for the last six or seven weeks
is I've been kind of marinating

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.990
in the Oakland clubhouse.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.710
And I'm going to write
a book about baseball.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.630
And it's good be
called "Moneyball."

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.250
And I said, and the worst
news is, it's just the first

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.590
of two books about baseball.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.780
And the only reason I'm
writing "Moneyball" is

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.730
so I can write the second book.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.920
And the second book is going
to be called "Underdogs."

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.220
And it's going to
be about the people,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.500
they were about to draft
players in the draft,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.790
and they were going to turn
that into a science experiment.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.150
And I thought I was going to
write a second book about that.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.160
And he called me up the
next day, he said go for it.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.090
That was the moment it started.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.820
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: So, I wasn't
going to bring that up,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.710
but since you do I have
two related questions.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.850
One is the next big moment was

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:12.810
when somebody told you this book
is exploding, and you're going

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.380
to have a huge best-seller
on your hands.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.170
Do you remember that moment?

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So,
I'd already had a few.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.040
And so, it wasn't
new [laughter].

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.220
No, so I mean that
sounded differently

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.520
than I intended [laughter].

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:40.200
I remember I think
it went to number

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.850
on the Best Seller
List almost right away.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:49.030
And what I remember,
the memories I have

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.650
of the publication of the
book are not about sales.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.460
My memories are about
the controversy.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.500
It was so loud.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.980
And angry.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.790
And that's what I followed.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:10.870
And my most vivid memory is; so,
with my subjects I have a rule.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.820
Every writer should
have this rule I think.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.320
You're not allowed to see
it until it comes out.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.970
I don't' want your
fingerprints all over my prose.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.480
And I'm going to do my best
to get everything right

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.780
and check things with you.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.080
But you're not going to
get to read the thing

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.660
until everybody can
read the thing.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.170
And Billy Beane had got
his copy of the book.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.630
And it was not hardback
yet, it was a galley,

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.330
but it was it was a week before
it was going to come out,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.090
it was that kind of thing.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.190
And it's now a year later, it
was spring training of 2003.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.680
And I remember sitting in
my office talking to him.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:51.190
He calls and he's my first
inside baseball reader.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.650
And he's upset.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.910
I mean he's really upset.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:02.030
But he's not exactly
directing at me,

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.230
but he's incoherent
on the phone.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.530
And he's just upset.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.030
I read this thing,
and God this thing.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.360
And this is not making
any sense.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.810
I said Billy, stop,
you're obviously upset.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.530
What are you upset about?

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.720
And at that point I was
feeling a little guilty

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.730
because I thought well, I'm
going to destroy his business.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.320
That what I've done is
revealed his secrets .

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.980
I've done my best, and
everybody's going to read it.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.770
and there's no longer going
to be these inefficiencies

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.030
to exploit, because what they're
doing makes so much sense.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.260
And he says, not that.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.860
He says, you don't understand,
you have me saying all the time.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.010
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: And my mother's
going to read this book.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: My mother's
going to read this book.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.770
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: And I said you
do say all the time [laughter].

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.540
And he said, you
don't know my mother.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.380
He said, my mother
is going to be.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.360
And I said, I said
you are kidding.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.890
You're not serious right?

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.550
You're upset because your
mother is going to read it

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.850
and she's going to see you?

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.890
And he said, yeah [laughter].

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.600
And I said, I'm so relieved.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.530
I thought you were
going to be upset

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.710
because I just destroyed
your entire business.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.820
And then there's this long
pause at the end of the line,

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.650
and he said you don't think
anybody is baseball is going

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.940
to read your book [laughter].

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.020
And, Billy he had once,
there was a line that came

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.390
out of his mouth once, you can't
be too stupid to play baseball.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.920
And he did explain.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.070
He said, you don't understand
we've been doing this

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.220
for the last six or seven years.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.980
It's been obvious to anybody
who wanted to pay attention

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.240
that we were more
efficient than anybody else.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.670
A book isn't going to
make any difference.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.630
And I remember following that.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.740
So, my memory or response
to the publication wasn't,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.040
oh this thing is
selling so well.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.190
It was selling not quite as
well as one of my other books,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.490
and a little better
than the other one.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.100
And it seemed to be doing fine,

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.130
but it was all these
baseball people,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.430
angrily not reading my book.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.130
Joe Morgan, I couldn't turn
on ESPN, I could not turn

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.880
on that television without
hearing someone talk

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.180
about the book.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.890
And that went on for a while.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.900
And usually it wasn't spoken
of in flattering tones.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.220
Everybody, to the extent,

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.170
they talk about "Moneyball"
the way people

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.340
in Oklahoma talk
about climate change.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.700
That it's a controversial
subject at best.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.990
And actually, if we were on
air, we didn't have to be polite

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.070
about it we would damn
everything about it.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.460
And so that was the
tone of it all.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.940
And that was preposterous to me.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.930
And I knew they were to lose.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:49.400
Evolution was going to
take care of the problem.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.750
But it was not until
I published a book,

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.390
"Flash Boys" did I have a
similar sort of experience

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.160
where a whole industry
was angry.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.770
And that was my memory of it.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.580
And that it was going to
be an influential book.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.220
Well, Billy had told me no
one in baseball was going

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.510
to read it, and they
seemed determined not to.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.260
but what happened was curious.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.940
What happened was my
other audience kicked in.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.240
Rich people [laughter].

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.850
And the head of Goldman
Sachs, called the owner

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.040
of the New York Mets
and said, you fool.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.680
You have any idea
what these people

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.990
who are running your
organization are doing

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.290
with your money?

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.180
and that conversation
happened with owners

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.910
and their rich friends, a lot.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.200
And that's where the
pressure came for change.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.640
The owners started
saying oh my God.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.020
And had a number of
young people say,

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.620
I got my job because of you.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.920
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Well,

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.530
and I baseball would look much
different without the book.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: You think so?

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.130
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: I do.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis:
I'm not sure I agree.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.730
Maybe slower, but that's it.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.030
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Yeah,
slower, but what I mean is

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.110
in a very specific way, there
are lots of people who have jobs

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.720
in baseball who wouldn't
without the book.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:03.160
And most recently you can draw
a direct line between the book

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.320
and the Houston Astros
win the World Series

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.710
because Jeff Luhnow,
who built that team.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: That's
how he got the job.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.580
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: He wouldn't have
ever been considered for a job

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.920
in baseball unless the
Cardinal's owner son,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.970
or son-in-law hadn't
read the book.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:23.160
So, I guess I'm wondering,
I'm sure you knew that.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.390
What it was like
to see the Astros.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.380
Because that's sort of the most
direct link between the book

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.360
and a team actually
winning the World Series.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Theo,
no, the Boston Red Sox.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.160
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: But Theo
worked for the Red Sox,

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.460
before the book came out.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yeah, but Theo
wouldn't have gotten his job

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.330
without the book.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.010
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: He got the job
before the book came out.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: No, he
didn't get the job before,

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.220
if he got the job before the
book came out, it was this.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.250
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: He
was hired in 2002.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: No, he wasn't.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.090
But this is what
happened [laughter].

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:56.550
So, while I was working on
the book, I went and reported

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.850
in other organizations.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.810
And one of the other
organizations I went

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.330
and reported in was
the Boston Red Sox.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.800
And John Henry had bought
the Boston Red Sox a couple

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.100
years before.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.580
And I told him what I was up to
and he said please come see me.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.190
I flew out to Boston
and we went to lunch.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:18.090
He said what do I have to do to
get you not to write this book.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:19.390
And I said why?

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.500
He says because we are going
to do this in some way.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:26.740
We've caught on to
what the A's are doing.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.960
And I said well, I'm
writing the book.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:34.010
Then, he said more or less
how do I hire Billy Beane

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.390
to be the general
manager of the Red Sox.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.870
And I found myself in this
weird conversation where I was

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.300
in between Henry and
Billy Beane talking terms.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.320
And it ended with Billy
briefly accepting the job

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.210
at the Red Sox, and
then walking away

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.940
because he was uncomfortable
with other people there,

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.710
or for whatever reason.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.840
And Henry then said,
who do I hire?

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.520
And Billy said hire Theo.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:11.120
So, if that happened before the
book published, it was just.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.610
Because I was talking to Theo
who was a minion at the Red Sox

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:15.910
in the year I was
working on the book.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.200
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: I think Theo
was hired as GM that fall

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.150
after the season of 2002.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis:
After 2002, right.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.280
All right.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.970
So, it's possible, you're
right, it's possible.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.950
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: You can take
credit for as many championships

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.060
as you want [laughter].

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis:
Billy, actually,

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.660
the Oakland A's can
take credit for that.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.900
Because the reason Henry wanted;

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.990
Henry had noticed
what I had noticed.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.260
So, it was a move
that was happening.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.710
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: He
hired Bill James.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis:
He hired Bill James.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.310
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: two
months before I think.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yeah,
that sounds right.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.240
So, all right.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.320
So, you just defeated
your own argument.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.010
My first response was I
think baseball would be kind

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.940
of where it is now, but it would
have moved a little more slowly.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.350
And you say all these things
changed because of it.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.700
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: What I think is
that the movement would be.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Here's the
counterfactual, all right.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.890
You're right.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.300
You're right in this sense that
the Boston Red Sox were going

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.980
to do this in some
form or other.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.060
And they were going to win the
World Series because of it.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.510
When they won the World Series,

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.640
everybody would have
imitated them.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.510
And they would have; Theo

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.240
and John Henry would have
gotten all the credit

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.680
for having revolutionized
baseball.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.570
And no one would
know Billy Beane is.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.630
That's probably the
counterfactuals.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.840
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: And I think the
movement would be roughly the

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.140
same, a little slower.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.830
But every World Series
would be different.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.820
If you think about
the cascade of events

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.370
when you have all
the hiring and team.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.860
Just the world would
look different.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Imagine if
your parents had never met.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.320
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: That's right.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: That would
have changed the world.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.650
That would have changed
the world.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.390
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Well, before
I forget I do need to ask,

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:57.680
since you brought it up, what
ever happened to "Underdogs?"

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis:
"Moneyball" ate it.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.630
The response was so loud that
other things I was going to do,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.470
it all, everybody
else was doing it.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.970
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: But
you worked on it,

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.530
you went to Sacramento and saw?

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I spent three
years roaming the minor leagues

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.370
with these players.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:20.410
I was in uniform for the
Midland Rockhounds during games.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.120
I shagged flyballs before
the games with players.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.480
I mean, I was all over
the minor leagues.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.550
And I could never quite figure
out how to tell the story.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.950
First, there were
20 main characters.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:38.420
And then, all the fake work
that was going to be in it,

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.860
it just felt like
"Moneyball" just had;

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.530
there was just too much
noise around "Moneyball."

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.830
So, eventually I walked.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.880
But what happened, interestingly
what happened is my wife,

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.080
Tabitha is a professional
photographer,

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.090
mainly art photographer,
but she tagged along

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.040
and started taking
pictures of these players

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.340
that they were drafting.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.470
And she followed
them for 15 years.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.340
And she's published a
book called "Fantasy Life"

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.980
which did real well, last year.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.710
Where it's photographs of
these players over time.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.360
And this to me is

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.760
like a watershed
moment in our marriage.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.770
Because when I met her, the
night I met her in Seattle,

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:20.100
1996, the night before
she'd been asked to throw

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.550
out a first pitch at a
Seattle Mariners' game.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.060
And I was seeing her the night

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.360
after she'd been
invited to do it.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.640
She was a celebrity on MTV.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.280
And I said well,
what was it like?

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.100
And she said, well,
I didn't do it.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.450
and I said why didn't you do it?

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.330
She said, I didn't
want to get hurt.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.630
I said, wait, wait.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.930
Why are you going to get hurt?

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.230
She goes they hit
it right [laughter]?

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:52.080
And that was, that I have taken
that woman from where she is

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.510
to the point where she is
publishing famous books

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.510
about baseball is a
great, great triumph.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:06.030
[ Crowd Noise ]

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.610
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: So, when you
were young, playing baseball

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.150
for Billy Fitzgerald,
coach Fitz, there's a book

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.110
about Coach Fitz called "Coach."

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:16.410
You were pitching.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.790
What did that teach
you about baseball?

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.090
That experience?

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.390
What did Coach Fitz teach you?

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.610
How does that experience show
up in "Moneyball" if it does

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:32.700
and more broadly in
your work in general?

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: The big thing,
so after "Moneyball" comes out,

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.290
all the sudden I'm allowed
to write about sports.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.220
And "The New York Times" editor
who was faintly interested

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.610
in the beginning of "Moneyball"
is extremely interested

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.610
when I mention my high
school baseball coach.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:48.030
And he's interested for the
same reason I'm interested,

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:53.650
is the idea was, describe
the power a teacher can have

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.290
in a kid's life.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:31:00.920
And that, to this day, when
I find myself in high stress,

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.210
high pressure situations, I can
hear Billy Fitzgerald's voice

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.340
and it gives me strength.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.760
And the things he put me
through gives me strength.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.170
And he used the sport
of baseball, probably,

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.480
he didn't use it, I mean he was
a great coach, and he won a lot

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.390
of games, more of
a basketball coach

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:20.690
than he was a baseball coach.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.940
But he was a really
intense person.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:29.480
And he used the trope
about baseball is

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.780
that it's a game
of failure, right?

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.440
And it is a game of failure.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.700
And it's an individual game,
masquerading as a team game.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.670
There are lots of one-on-one
encounters where you're

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.540
in the spotlight and
you are likely to fail.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.960
And the failure is
going to be very public.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.550
He used that to teach kids
how to come back from failure.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.050
And it was a rocky
experience at times,

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.120
but it was a great experience.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:56.620
I had found out this was you
know, 2003, before that a bunch

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.860
of former players for this
man were raising the money

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.260
to name the gym at the Isidore
Newman School in New Orleans,

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.220
where I had gone for the coach.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.280
And they were having no
trouble raising the money

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.640
from both the former
players, and the parents

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.700
because he had had this
profound effect on lots

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.000
of people, not just me.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.970
I mean he had turned around
my life in a lot of ways.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:26.590
He, at the same time, was
about to be fired by the school

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.050
because a handful of parents
of his current players thought

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.400
that he was too hard
on the kids.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.970
And he had mellowed
by so much [laughter].

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.980
When I went back and started
talking to the players

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.240
and told them some of
the things we had done,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.680
their jaws were on the floor.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.040
I started calling former
players, Payton Manning

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.420
and Eli Manning both played for
him, they went to the school.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.620
And Payton Manning
said to this day,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.710
I think of Coach Fitz
when I'm in huddle.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:57.470
Since this day, he's in my head.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.610
And this is playing
baseball and basketball

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.430
for him, not football.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.180
So, I thought, what's happening,
Coach Fitz became an excuse

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.270
to write about something that's
happening in the society.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.720
That how hard it
is for a teacher

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.610
that is demanding
to work his magic.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.040
Because the parental fear,

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.890
life has just become
too front-end loaded.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.190
Failure when you're 13,

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:26.530
is all of the sudden too
fraught, or when you're 16.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.870
So, the parents in some
cases are just interfering

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.310
in a process that really should
happen, because they're afraid

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.510
of what happens to their
child if they aren't

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.930
on the all-district
team, or whatever.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.770
Or they aren't playing
shortstop.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.070
Or they're on the bench.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:44.920
So, that's what that
story was about.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.980
How he leads me to
"Moneyball" is well,

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.030
I would never be writing about
baseball if I hadn't played,

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.850
but I'd played before I met
him, and I probably would have,

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.860
I don't know might have played
even if he wasn't there,

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.300
though he was one of
the cheap attractions

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.880
for playing at the school.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.050
But, there's something I've said
a couple times in interviews

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:06.440
and I was ridiculed for it
because I pitched two innings

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.740
at Princeton my freshman year,

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.650
that was the extent
of my college career.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.950
But I was recruited.

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:13.220
And it got me into
college, no question.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.690
Coach put me on a list, because
my high school stats were gaudy.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.420
But they were gaudy
without a fastball.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.700
Because I had a really
good curveball.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.750
And he taught me how
to; he turned me into a

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.590
"Moneyball" pitcher basically.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.470
Never walked anybody,
never hit anybody.

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:39.590
He gave me a feel for the game,
that when I hit the Oakland A's

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.080
and they're taking people
who don't look right,

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.240
don't have the obvious
attributes, I remember that.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.540
Because I was one of those,

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.430
as a player I was
one of those players.

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:52.960
So, in that way, probably
maybe a bit receptive

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.970
to the story I was hearing.

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:57.240
I too was undervalued.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.410
Now, and I think a lot of
people feel that way, right?

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.870
And I think the way the book
resonated, it resonated first

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.480
because oh there's this
controversy in baseball,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.060
and second because a lot
of people read it and said,

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.330
I feel that way, I feel
like Scott Hatteberg.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.790
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: so, you get
your two innings at Princeton.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:17.470
Then you've got a long stretch

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:22.560
where you're not really
immersed in baseball.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.860
I'm guessing.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.370
At least as a player, obviously.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:29.400
But then, was it
20-sum years later,

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.940
your daughter starts
playing when she's,

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.810
your oldest daughter
when she's 6?

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.110
Is that right?

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.540
So, for the last 12 years
now you've been immersed.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:45.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yeah, so I've
got my children, I have a 19,

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.050
16 and an 11-yeaer-old.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:48.560
Two girls and a boy.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.350
And each of their athletic
careers has already cost me

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:52.650
a book.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:57.860
So, the shear amount of
time that I've devoted

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.390
to the athletic careers
of my children.

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:05.590
And I'm dead serious, I mean
tomorrow morning I'm going

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.110
to get on a plane and
go to Boulder, Colorado,

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.480
where at this moment, my
16-year-old is playing his team

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.490
from New Mexico in a 16 and
under softball tournament.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:19.670
She's big-time.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.740
And so, I ended up in Berkeley,
California, where I live,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:29.020
first coaching my oldest child
when she was 6 all the way

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.850
to the age of 14, and
then she outgrew me.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.880
And then the second
daughter the same way.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.180
I'm still coaching my son.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.520
I'm his baseball coach
and his basketball coach.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.330
But I ended up the funny role
was if the kids were good

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.400
in the recreation league, we
have a couple hundred girls

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.900
in the recreational league and
the ones who are ambitious,

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.390
and committed, and
all the rest move

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.280
on to kind of an All-Star team.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.580
These travel teams.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.300
Starting at the age of eight.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.730
And the travel teams, I ran.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.860
The minute my eldest
got to the age,

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.160
they picked that
she was good enough,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.200
they said will you
be the commissioner.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.500
So, I was the Commissioner

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.890
of the Berkeley Competitive
Travel Teams.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.200
Now the Berkeley Recreationally
League was founded

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.890
by a moral philosopher

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:16.110
at the University California
Berkeley, 35 years ago.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.470
It's a wonderful league.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:21.000
The first line of the founding
document is, "The purpose

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.510
of children's sports is the
moral education of the parents."

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:34.230
[Laugther] And the league is
run so that if you win too much

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.440
as a coach you're not asked
to coach the next year.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.730
They gun for like you're
gunning for a 500 record,

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.460
that's the perfect season.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.270
And of course, the strike outs
are applauded, no one remembers

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.570
who won and all the rest.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.010
And it is as warm and
fuzzy an experience,

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.990
and competitive experience
as you can have it.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.400
So, now, these little girls from
Berkeley, these little liberals

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.320
from Berkeley, California get
on this travel team and they go

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.430
over the hill and have
to play republicans.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:08.440
And it was like taking these
small furry creatures who come

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.400
from an island without
predators.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.480
And letting them loosen
like, you know in a Safari.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.150
Where lions are chasing
after them.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.610
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: And how long
did it take them to learn?

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: It was
an incredible process.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.390
Because they had
both experiences.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.270
They realized there
were two roles.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.730
There was this role
where you're supposed

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.330
to be just collaborative
and nice.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.630
And then there's a role
where you're supposed

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.650
to slit the throat of the
person you're playing.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.250
And they learned how.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.200
It usually took kids
a couple of years.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:45.310
So, Dixie, who's my 16-year-old,
when she was 8 on the 10

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:49.470
and under team, they
were like 2 and 24.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.780
And when she was 10, they
were number 1 in the country.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.650
So, that's how long it took.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:00.360
And it was you know,
even little liberals,

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.090
there's a political
lesson in this.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.920
Even sweet natured
liberals if you beat them

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.230
up long enough, get tough.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.800
And learn how to fight.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.570
So, my role now, a
year and a half ago,

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:16.870
I stepped down from that role.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.030
But I ran that for five
or six years and it ate

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.330
up a big chunk of my life.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:21.630
And it was totally fascinating.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:25.010
And one day I'm going to
write a book about it.

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:26.310
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: So, I
have two more questions.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.610
The first one, quickly please,

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.560
do you think "Moneyball" would
have resonated the way it did,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.080
would have been essentially one

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.760
of the best-selling
baseball books

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.910
for 15 plus years running now,

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.530
if it had been a
different sport.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.440
Could you have done "Moneyball"
with football or basketball?

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: You remember
when "The Blindside" came

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.080
out and nobody bought it.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.670
And that's when I realized
how grateful I should be

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.520
to baseball for creating
readers.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.820
Because football
doesn't [laughter].

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:07.430
I mean there is no safe
place for a book to be

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:08.730
than a football stadium.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.810
No one is going to pick it up.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.110
No one is going to open it.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.670
No one is going to
ask what's in it.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.720
Fifty thousand people
will walk by that book

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.510
in a football stadium and nobody
will think twice about it.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.710
Whereas, you put a book in a
baseball stadium and people,

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:30.390
the ballpark people will pick
it up and kind of look at.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.330
So, if it had been
about football,

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.110
it wouldn't have worked.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.410
Any other sport.

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:39.570
So, I think that the literary
dimensions, the literary,

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:43.210
that there is an overlap between
literature and the sport.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.220
That there's a built-in
readership

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.510
for virtually anything written
about baseball, was the kindling

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.950
that started the fire.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:53.890
Without it, I don't think
it would have gone anywhere.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:58.370
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: So,
a very quick story.

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.980
I was the press junket
for the "Moneyball" movie.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I remember.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.580
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Which was in 2011.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I was
in the press junket too.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.200
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: You
were in the room?

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis:
Yeah, I mean kind of.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.050
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: I was in the
front of the theater in Oakland.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.880
And I have this very distinct
memory of sitting there

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.620
as the movie's it's the first
two minutes of having these,

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.260
well a continuing
wave of emotion.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.770
Because it felt like sort
of my life was up there.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.980
Because a lot of it
had been in your book.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.280
Not my personal life,

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.020
but my professional
life and my passion.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:35.320
And what I was going to ask you
was what it was like for you

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:40.050
to see that up on the screen the
first time and so will wrote.

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:45.470
But then you reminded me that
it wasn't your first go 'round.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.230
"The Blindside" had come out.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.920
Maybe even a better
question the moral

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.060
of the question is what did it
feel like when you were sitting

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.700
in the theater for the first
time watching "The Blindside"

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.470
and seeing your words, sometimes
your exact words being spoken

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:59.090
by these people.

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Right.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.760
I went to "The Blindside,"
the first time I saw

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.360
"The Blindside" was at
a benefit for Goodwill.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.720
They released the movie a couple
of days earlier to Goodwill,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.280
so they can show
in San Francisco.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.580
And the idea was I was going to
go watch it with 300 grandees

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.270
and then afterwards I was
going to get up and talk

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.140
about how I felt
about the movie.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.630
And I brought Tabitha with me.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.950
And we were sitting there and in
the middle of it, I leaned over

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.490
and I said, I don't
know if I like this.

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:32.810
And she said, do not say that.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.540
And then the more; but
as I was watching it,

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.560
I was laughing out
loud and I cried.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.550
And how often does
that happen in a movie?

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.870
Not often.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.390
And I realized afterwards,
I was quite moved by that.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.460
It was actually kind of
impressive what they did.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.090
What I had been doing up to the
point when I turned to my wife

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:51.130
and said I don't know if
I like this, is I was,

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.030
every time something
was really working,

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.280
I was saying, oh I did that.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.940
Yeah. They didn't screw that up.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.930
And then, if I thought
something didn't work,

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.590
or maybe it just wasn't from me,

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:05.230
I was saying that's not
working, that's his fault.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:08.590
And so, I was taking credit
for everything that was working

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.340
and not taking any
blame for what wasn't.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.160
And then, once I got through
that, you know since then,

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.490
by the time of "The Big Short,"

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:20.110
I don't' really watch
them in a proprietary way.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:23.960
I really do just kind
of watch the movie.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.640
And then, the only
concern I have is

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.740
that I've been son
enthusiastic about all of them,

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.020
that when I first see it
and I feel the enthusiasm,

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.710
the way I felt with "Moneyball"
and I felt with "The Big Short,"

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.460
that I'm only enthusiastic

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.050
because it's a move
about my book.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:39.540
And nobody else is
going to like this.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.330
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: And then they all
get nominated for best picture.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: It's been
incredibly lucky, right?

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.710
The talent that's been attracted
to it, has been fantastic.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.100
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Well, and
"The Moneyball" movie

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.430
in particular was, what entailed
you can write a book just

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:57.730
about the making of the movie,

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.420
because there were
so many false starts.

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.080
Famously, it was shut down.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.480
I think it was the day
before they were supposed

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.440
to start filming, you were
supposed to get your check.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yes, and I
was in LA, and I was supposed

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.960
to go have dinner at
Brad Pitt's house,

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.260
with my daughter
who was with me.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.560
And that never happened.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.450
And, it just shutdown.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:20.990
But, that whole story,
my memory.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:25.300
So, bumping along with the
drama alongside the drama

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.620
of the making of "The Moneyball"
movie was the drama Billy

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.410
Beane's response to the making
of "The Moneyball" movie.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.960
Because he was so upset about
the book, he never quite go;

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.400
he got over it after his
mother was actually furious.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.330
And actually, furious with me,

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.550
and I'm not kidding you I took
her to dinner in San Diego

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.340
and tried to charm
her and had no luck.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:51.860
But his attitude
towards the movie,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.490
right from the beginning
was, look,

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:59.410
this book has created this
huge noise in my life.

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:00.710
I never wanted it.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:03.970
He didn't know the book was
about him until he read it.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.890
And I disguised my
intentions well enough.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:11.260
And that he said why on earth
would I let anybody make a

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.220
movie, that's like
10 times the trouble.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.600
And I said to him right
from the beginning,

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.960
I said Billy you
don't understand.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.630
They never make the movie.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.410
They'll give you some money for
your rights, they'll go pretend

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:24.710
like they're going
to make the movie,

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:27.220
and then the movie
won't get made.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.050
And he made me list for him
all the times this had happened

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.350
to me.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.650
And it had happened
a dozen times.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:34.950
Not just with books, but
with magazine articles.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.690
I said Hollywood is fantastic.

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.940
You throw your manuscript in,
they throw this money out.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.670
And you run away
as fast as possible

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.310
and they never bother you again.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.990
They just give you
free money for nothing.

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:46.320
And when I told him
what I'd paid

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.550
for various things,
he goes, huh, huh.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:50.890
And he went and slept
on it, he came back

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:53.390
and he said, I'm
going to do this.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:54.790
He said this is great.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:57.940
And so, he got a check
for an 18-montyh option

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.180
on his life rights, and
then 18 months later,

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.420
he calls me he says, guess
what, I got another check.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.660
And he said, and like this
happened three or four times

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:12.200
and each time he'd call he'd
say, this is genius [laughter].

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.210
They're not making the movie.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:22.350
And then one night he calls
and he says, you bastard.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.890
He says, Brad Pitt just
called me and he wants

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:28.040
to come over to my house.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.440
And the babysitter's
wearing a dress

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.950
and my wife is putting
on makeup [laugther].

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.450
And then he proceeds to be
genuinely irritated with me

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.580
for having mislead
him into think

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.010
that no move would
ever get made right

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.630
through the making of the movie.

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:49.540
To the point where, they'd
been shooting for three months

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.400
and Billy has created this
social awkward situation,

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.500
where yes, he's let Brad
Pitt come to his house once,

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.350
but he's been invited to the set
over and over, and he won't go.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:00.660
They're filming in
the Oakland Coliseum.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.600
These beautiful night scenes
where they've re-created a game

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.850
between the Royals and the A's.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.740
And they've got body
doubles of 50 players.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.740
And they've got 8000 people in
the stands that they're moving

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.340
around so the place looks full.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.860
And everybody's there.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.530
And Billy won't go.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:20.390
And so, they call
me, and they say,

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:22.570
could you please just get
Billy down to the set.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:23.870
I mean everybody just feels

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:26.120
like we don't want him saying
how much he hates us all

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.420
at the end of it.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.770
And it won't be an
unpleasant experience

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.070
for him and blah, blah, blah.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.810
So, I call Billy, I say, Billy
I haven't been to the set.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:35.010
But I'm going to come
out and I'm going to go,

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.060
and you should just
come down and see.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.750
And he says, you
going to be there?

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.050
I said yeah.

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.390
You promise you're going
to be there he says,

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.420
he's like; I said I'll be there.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:49.820
So, child Dixie, softball player
in Boulder, Colorado right now

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:55.410
and I, after one of her games
go out to the Oakland Coliseum.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.050
We roll in and Brad Pitt has
just finished filming one

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.700
of his movie scenes where
he's roaming back and forth

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.670
in the middle of
an empty stadium.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.350
And we walk out, and at
this point I know him.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.350
And he comes running
over to say hello.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:12.040
And he gets down on one knee
and starts talking to Dixie,

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.210
who's then 9 or 10,
or whatever she is.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.220
And I leave them alone.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.260
and Billy comes walking
in from another place.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.260
I go talk to Billy.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:27.340
And as I get Billy, Dixie
comes running over grabs my leg

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.860
like she's terrified
and says who is

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.160
that weird old guy [laughter].

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.310
And she's standing there,
and Billy and I are talking.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:41.600
And while Billy and I are
talking, he's kind of like,

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.830
he's putting in an
appearance on the set and he's

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.800
about to like turn and leave.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.820
And a production assistant
comes running over.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.890
And he's got headphones on.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.190
He's got a notepad.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.310
And there's a book
inside the notepad.

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:59.680
And he comes running over
just dewy-eyed and gushing,

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.480
and he says Mr. Beane,
Mr. Beane,

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.970
please will you you're
your book for me; please.

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:09.210
And Billy says, it's
not my book.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:10.510
He wrote the book.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.830
And he says, no Mr. Beane,

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.180
I want you to sign my
book, it's your book.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.410
And he's so fawning, it's really
kind of awkward, uncomfortable.

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:20.980
And Billy goes okay.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.430
Now what you need to know
for what happens next is

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:27.540
that there were two Billy Beanes
who played professional baseball

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:30.380
and they actually played
int eh same outfield,

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.880
I think on the Twins;
what's that?

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.810
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: They played for
the Toledo Mud Hens together.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Really?

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.420
They played for the
Twins and for the Tigers.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.720
Right.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.020
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: In the minors
they were in the same team.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I
didn't realize that.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.290
But in the big leagues
they were in the same.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.030
And the other Billy
Beane, spells his name

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.790
without and e on the end.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:52.820
So, the other Billy Beane
had come out of the closet

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.810
and written a book
about the experience

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:59.240
of being a professional baseball
player coming out of the closet.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.830
You know what it's
called, it's "Hitting

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:05.250
From The Other Side
of The Plate."

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:09.150
It's like; so, and so the
young man, production,

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:10.550
flips open this binder

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:13.070
and there's the other Billy
Beane's book [laughter].

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.970
Now, there's no right answer for
my Billy Beane in that moment.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.790
There's just no right answer.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:25.670
And I look over and Brad
Pitt is sitting in one

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:29.650
of the A's dugouts
rolling around laughing.

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:30.950
He had set up,

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.250
he had orchestrated the
entire thing [laughter].

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:37.180
And the reason I had been
implored to bring Billy

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.240
to the set was so he
could play this joke.

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.450
He'd been thinking about it for,
obviously for like six months.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.180
It was just perfect.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.480
It was perfect.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.510
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: That's great.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:57.680
[ Applause ]

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.980
Well, we have run a little long,

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.280
but I think that
story was worth it.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.350
we do have time for
a few questions.

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.990
I will choose people.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.900
Please keep them brief.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.080
First one is always the hardest.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.380
&gt;&gt; Susan Reyburn:
We've got microphones

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.150
on both sides of the aisle here.

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:17.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Hi,
so can you hear me?

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:22.040
So, I saw you last year
at the book festival

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.650
and you had mentioned that
you're working on a project,

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:28.330
if memory serves,
of the transition

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:31.070
of the current administration,
I was hoping

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:33.500
that you could tell us a little
bit more about that project.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.360
How it's going now
and if it's damaging

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.250
to the current administration,
please hurry up

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.040
and publish it [laugther].

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So, the
book comes out October 2nd.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.980
It's called "The Fifth Risk."

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.920
It's not quite finished.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.430
The sixth risk is that
I don't finish it.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:55.770
But it's not due until august
1st, so there's some time.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:57.200
It's basically done.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.730
And it started as a
series in "Vanity Fair."

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:03.980
And the premise in the beginning
was well I was astonished

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.000
to learn actually, that, by law,

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.160
that the outgoing
administration is required

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.390
to make all these elaborate
preparations for the transition.

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:13.680
And as they should, because much

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.400
of what the federal government
does not ideological at all.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.900
There's just like here's
what we're working on,

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.290
or here are the problems,
or here are the risks.

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:21.980
And there are thousands
of people

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.630
in the federal government,
spent many,

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:27.110
many months generating
these briefings

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.500
and briefing documents.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.100
And you can get just
about the best course

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.910
in how the government works
ever created by just going

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:35.340
and listening to briefings.

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:39.410
And the Trump team had
not gotten any of them,

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:41.900
basically they'd not shown
up for the transition.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.970
And because Trump had fired
them all, the people who were

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.700
in place, who he was apparently
a little bit aware of,

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.850
fired them all right
after he won.

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:54.810
So, I went and got
the briefings.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:57.070
And I went, and I actually
had people brief me

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:58.820
who would have briefed, in place

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.680
where I thought were
most interesting,

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.420
or most frightening.

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.130
And you know you
can't write a book

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:07.430
about the whole federal
government,

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:09.480
it would be 60,000 pages long.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:14.560
But it is true that if you
parachuted me into any agency

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.770
of the federal government, I
could find you a great story.

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:21.010
Because of just how
mismanaged it is.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.940
Mismanaged in this
particular case.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.660
I mean there's general problems

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.270
that transcend the
Trump Administration,

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.570
and the Trump Administration

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:30.890
in many ways are a
symptom not a cause.

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:34.380
They're a symptom of decades of
trashing the federal government.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.520
For the people who actually
believe that it's just

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.810
like this pointless enterprise,
where if it falls apart,

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:44.540
you won't believe
what's going to happen.

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:48.970
But, so the book is me cherry
picking what I think is the

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.340
material that will be most
interesting to readers

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.560
who don't really know what goes

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.930
on inside the federal
government.

00:53:55.930 --> 00:54:00.400
And I'll be back to talk about
it in three months [laughter].

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hi, so I'm about
a quarter of the way through

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:10.810
"The Undoing Project."

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:16.010
So, in looking at the cognitive
biases that you talk about.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:19.170
How does that sort of what
you've learned about that stuff,

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.220
sort of shed light
on kind of your

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.560
"Moneyball" and those ideas.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So, I have a
very fun experience, which is,

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:29.420
I mean it was unique
in my writing career,

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.800
that after "Moneyball" came out,

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.490
there was a review
I actually read.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:35.620
I tend not to read the reviews.

00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:39.540
And the review was
by Dick Thaler,

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.380
who just won the Nobel Prize
in Economics, and Cass Sunstein

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.320
who was in the Obama
Administration,

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.350
he's a law professor at Harvard.

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:49.090
And they basically said

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.770
that I didn't understand
the point of my story.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:53.920
That I thought it was about
what I thought it was about.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.900
But what it was really about
in their view, was a case study

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.650
in the wisdom of the
work done by Amos Tversky

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:04.320
and Daniel Kahneman two
Israeli psychologists

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.100
who explored how the
human mind screws

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.730
up with making intuitive
judgments.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.880
Because what these baseball
scouts had been doing,

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.510
that had led to the
miss valuation players,

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:18.060
was just using their
intuitive judgment

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.170
when there was actually a
statistical answer at hand

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:25.830
about whether that this
player was good or not good.

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:30.140
And so, that sent me scurrying
to start to read the works

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.740
of Kahneman and Tversky who
I'd never heard of before,

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.950
even though the year I was
working on "Moneyball,"

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:38.070
Kahneman, a psychologist
who knew no economics,

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.590
won the Nobel Prize of Economics

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:44.900
for having changed the
discipline from outside.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:52.060
So, what subsequently, the
book, I wrote about them,

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:58.610
kind of informed me after the
fact because sort of the buckets

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:04.240
that a psychologist would place
the errors, the various errors

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.530
that the baseball
scouts were making.

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:09.850
I think most of them were
described one way or another

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:12.420
in "Moneyball" but
in different language

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.490
and with a different
depth of understanding.

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.240
That these people
had gone out and kind

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.050
of in a scientifically
plausible way demonstrated

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.350
that all human beings did it.

00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:22.320
That is wasn't just
baseball stuff.

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.240
If you'd asked me
when I was working

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.860
on "Moneyball" why
is this happening.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.280
It's a question I
should have asked right?

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:35.700
Like, why is the market
making these mistakes.

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.110
I didn't think baseball
scouts were stupid.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:42.730
I really enjoyed the time I
spent with baseball scouts.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:46.240
But I would've said this is kind
of like a groupthink going on.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.200
Something like, it would have
been kind of like peculiar

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.400
to these people in some way.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.050
That it was so universal
that the economy

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:58.280
of diversity would
take all kind of people

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.110
and replicate exactly the same
mistakes the baseball scouts

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:03.870
were making across a
range of human judgments.

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:06.420
That was really interesting.

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.630
And so, the story ended
up being, I mean it kind

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.970
of partly explains why
"Moneyball" was as successful

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:14.370
as it was because it was even
more universal than I thought,

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:17.890
the problems that they
were dealing with.

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:19.190
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: And by the way,

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:21.550
cognitive biases haven't exactly
gone away, even in baseball.

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:24.150
They're still out there,
there are just different ones,

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.990
to a large degree than
there were 15, 16 years ago.

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:29.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis:
Right and Kahneman

00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:33.670
and Tversky would have told you
at the time, that as amusing

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:39.250
as it is to them to classify
human idiocy, that them writing

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:41.220
about it and classifying
it isn't going

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.660
to diminish in any way.

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.530
That they themselves
remain; they themselves,

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:46.990
two of the smartest
people walking

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:49.980
around the planet
were amused by how,

00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.990
even after they'd
done all their work,

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:54.280
they were susceptible
to the same problems.

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.680
That we were wired to make
certain kinds of mistakes.

00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.310
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: So, the
smartest baseball people know

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:00.740
that they're suffering
from biases

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.160
and they do what they can.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: To not
trust their judgment.

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.020
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Right.

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.620
Right.

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:12.370
&gt;&gt; Susan Reyburn: Got
another question over here.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Thanks,
great talk.

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.270
Billy Beane was one of
those miss valued players,

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:18.570
in the other direction.

00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:20.600
And you get into it in the book.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.440
Why would he let you in,

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.160
regardless of whether
it's about him or not?

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:30.060
Why would he let
you into the tribe?

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:34.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: You know,
he did it only reluctantly.

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:35.350
And he did it.

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:37.040
I'm going to tell you
exactly what happened.

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.870
So, I go start to inform
the players in the clubhouse

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:42.660
about how the lab
experiment is going down.

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.200
And so, I start to get into
the organization that way.

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.980
And then I can come
back to the front office

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.270
and tell them things about
their players they didn't know.

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:55.370
I mean little things, but you
know how they were behaving.

00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:56.910
Who was maybe smoking dope.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:58.210
That kind of stuff.

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:02.860
And so, I made myself
somewhat useful to them.

00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:06.100
Not hugely, but I
wasn't just an annoyance.

00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.200
I wasn't just an
annoying presence.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:13.170
I somehow sometimes had things
to say that they wanted to hear.

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:16.450
And so, he let me just loiter
for a long time, to the point

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:19.340
where they kind of forgot
I wasn't part of the staff.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.750
And he's said that since.

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.050
He said, you know we
just started thinking,

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:23.540
he just kind of works here.

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:30.860
But talking to Billy Beane
about himself is not easy.

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.170
He's very self-protective.

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:35.190
And he did not have
much interest

00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:37.140
in the psychology
of Billy Beane.

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.260
A lot of other people
did, but he didn't.

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:45.730
And the way I found it's easiest
to get people to tell you

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:47.260
about themselves,
one way or the other,

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.940
is to do things with them.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.790
So, I started to orchestrate
things I would do with Billy.

00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:54.380
And one of the things I would
do is I would make him take me

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.110
when he would go look at
his minor league teams.

00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:58.600
So, he would go drive
to Sacramento,

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.040
and drive to Modesto
from Oakland.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.880
And the drive home was
always in the dark.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.400
And in the dark, he couldn't
see that I had the notepad open,

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.190
and I was writing [laughter].

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:15.380
But there was something
about being alone in the dark

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:18.220
where he would start
talking to me, in a way,

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.910
when I would ask him questions
about like why he got so angry

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.520
when he struck out
in minor leagues,

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.270
or you know why he thought
his career hadn't gone the way

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.570
it was.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:33.190
And he was more acute
about his own self

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:36.890
in those drives then
he was any other time.

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.760
And I got to the
point, where I thought,

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.450
I mean I could barely
read what I had written.

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:43.340
I did the writing is
all over the notepad.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.710
I was turning pages, because
I wasn't sure I was writing

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:49.080
over what I had already written.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.800
But I got to the
point where I thought,

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.370
I probably haven't gotten to
completely the bottom of this,

01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:57.650
I probably won't,
but I've got enough.

01:00:57.650 --> 01:01:01.570
And the enough was
realizing that he was very,

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:05.260
very aware that baseball
had screwed up his life.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.320
That he had this other narrative

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.930
that he really should not have
signed with the New York Mets.

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:11.510
He really should
have gone to Stanford

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:13.620
and been the quarterback
after John Elway.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.880
He probably would have played
in the NFL as a free safety.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.060
And he would have had
a Stanford education.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:23.660
And as smart as Billy
Beane is, and as on top

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.960
of the world as he is.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.800
I mean he's as on top of the
world as any human being I know.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:32.060
It's just like he rules the
world, he retains a charming,

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.010
intellectual insecurity that
he didn't go to college.

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:36.940
He eventually went
back and got a degree.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.500
But he didn't have
a really deep,

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.460
rich educational experience.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:44.500
He missed out on something and
he knows he missed out on it.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.230
It really bothered him.

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:49.790
So, once you know that
about him, you know part

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:53.630
of what's going on here is a
little bit of a revenge fantasy,

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.080
that part of what's going
on is they miss valued me

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.380
and screwed up my life.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.130
I'm going to screw
them up by figuring

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.320
out how to do this properly.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.380
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: But, you
know I should mention

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:08.300
that Billy Beane isn't
the only one who's opened

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.610
up to Michael Lewis.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.200
You're the common
denominator here.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.270
You got a certain way
of engaging with people.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:18.510
Which you might not want to
talk about at great length,

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:20.860
but there are; he's
not the only one.

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: You try not
to be tedious to be around.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.780
I mean if you're not
tedious to be around,

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.320
eventually people are going
to tell you who they are.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.620
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: And a
lot of people love

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.920
to talk about their work.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.590
You want to start a
conversation with a stranger,

01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:33.100
ask them about their work.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.400
And sometimes, they'll be great.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.150
Sometimes they'll
speak for 20 minutes

01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:39.030
and you'll be bored,
but they will talk.

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: That's true.

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:44.590
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Do we
have time for one more?

01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:46.940
&gt;&gt; Susan Reyburn:
We can do one more.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:51.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Hi, as you said,
baseball has changed, so much,

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:54.920
you know from "Moneyball" now
we see everyone's datamining,

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.220
right?

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.140
So, what do you think is going
to happen in the trajectory

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:02.970
of the sport now, and you're
looking at e-sports and betting,

01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:04.440
all of these other issues.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.250
Do you think that the game will
retain some of the integrity

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:10.770
that it has right now?

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:13.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: That's funny,
it's charming that you think

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:18.130
that the game has retained
[laughter] integrity.

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:21.420
I'm not sure integrity is
what it's ever been selling.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:29.980
So, I don't; if we're
talking about just baseball,

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.970
but the professional
sports generally.

01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:35.340
I don't worry that much about
the integrity of the game like,

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.950
oh because gambling is now;
sports betting is now legalized

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:41.450
that everybody's going to
be betting on the side.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:46.170
There's actually too
much at stake for a kind

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:48.720
of black socks kind
of scandal now.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.170
I think to happen.

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:54.160
I mean, so that kind of
thing doesn't worry me.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.790
The question is, 50 years
from now, will anybody want

01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:59.470
to watch a baseball game.

01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:03.010
And that, I don't know I
mean I think it's so much

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:06.690
of the appeal fo the
game is rooted in;

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:10.240
you know this is the thing that
ended up, of a lot of stuff

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.800
that ended up on the
cutting room floor

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.590
of the book I never wrote.

01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:20.110
And where I thought,
there's rich material here,

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:21.940
I just never figured
out how to do it.

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:27.360
And some of the richest material
was to discover that even

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:33.820
for players who were so
battle-hardened and successful

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.850
as the people who were
drafted by the Oakland A's

01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:43.650
to play professional baseball,
even those people were playing

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:47.030
in ways that were rooted in
their childhood experience.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:51.400
There was a player who could
only hit lefthanded pitching

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.780
because his whole childhood he's
only seen lefthanded pitching

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.750
from an adoptive father.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:58.770
He was great hitting lefthanded
pitching, and he just never got

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:01.560
around to hitting right
handers in the same way.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.370
There was a player who,
Martin, who developed his swing

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:10.260
in his backyard, he was
a lefthanded hitter,

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.810
he played wiffleball
every day for years

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:16.310
with his older brothers,
and their left field fence,

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:19.990
was way short, and the right
field fence was forever.

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:22.780
So, everything was
the other way.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.190
He couldn't get it out of
his swing in the big leagues.

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:30.730
And the emotion of the
sport is the same way.

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:34.050
It's rooted in the experiences
you had as a little kid,

01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:36.660
often with your parents,
your dad,

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.710
or with friends playing
the game.

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.570
And your attachment
to the sport later

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:45.410
in life is the echoing
of those feelings.

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:50.010
Now, I look around me and I
see little leagues that are,

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:53.610
and my son really wants
to play basketball,

01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:57.200
despite being given every
reason by me to play baseball.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.940
And I see that with
a lot of kids.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.750
The game is just a
little slow for them.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:05.690
It's out of step with the
way they live their lives.

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:08.670
And I think that's
the risk to the game.

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:12.070
That as long as you
preserve that childhood,

01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:16.670
of vibrant little league,
the game will be great.

01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:18.650
And people will want
to watch it.

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:24.510
But if America's youth move on
to another game, it's doomed.

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:26.510
&gt;&gt; Rob Neyer: Thank you all.
