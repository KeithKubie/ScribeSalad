00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.120
I'd like to show you
this cool machine I have.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.217
In fact it's one of my most prized
possessions that my great uncle gave to

00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:08.703
me before he passed away.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:16.178
Let's pretend that this
machine represents a company,

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:19.140
and that I'm the CEO of that company.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.500
This company can take raw
materials like this paper, and

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.950
process them, and
turn them into dollars.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.866
Here's how it works.

00:00:33.904 --> 00:00:40.150
So, each year, this company can
output a dollar bill reliably.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.310
What is this company worth?
