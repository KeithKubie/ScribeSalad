00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.750
I hope you made some good progress on both of these tasks.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.360
Ask us questions on the discussion forum, if you are stuck some place.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.280
In this and the next video, I will highlight some common constraints related

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.790
issues that students in this class have been having.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.400
So I changed the image for this button and it now looks like a rabbit.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
I also want to make sure that it lines up well with the other button, so

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.270
I will move it around and use these blue dotted lines as my guide.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.070
There.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.530
Now, to add constraints to this button, I can hold down the Ctrl key on

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.030
my keyboard, and add a constraint to the top space.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.998
After that, I can add a constraint to the trailing space also.

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:39.850
Now, I want to make sure that the leading space here,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.370
is equal to the trailing space here.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.050
To do that, what I can do, is select this constraint and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.480
drag out the utility area, and under size inspector,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.260
I can see that the value of this constraint is a constant 30 points.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.073
So I can now select the other constraint, the trailing space constraint, and

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:57.590
change its value to 30 also.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.730
Finally for the star button, let me scroll down a bit so we can see it properly,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.720
I can add a constraint so that we center it horizontally.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.090
And I can also make sure that it is pinned at a constant distance away from

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.890
the bottom of the phone.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.650
Okay, let me run this project and see how it looks.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.960
I'm going to go to the second screen, and there it is.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.350
All three buttons are showing up in the correct location, although,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.960
it seems these two buttons are way too close to each other.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.330
I will let you play around with the leading constraint here and the trailing

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.100
constraint here, so that these two buttons look evenly spaced on the screen.
