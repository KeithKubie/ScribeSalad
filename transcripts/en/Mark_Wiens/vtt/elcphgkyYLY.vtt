Okay, it's Mark wiens here making Thai street food recipes today

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.069
We're going to do a recipe for Lab Mu which is a minced pork

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.300
Thai salad um and it's an awesome dish

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.430
you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.129
Alright, so the base of this dish is minced pork

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.779
But you could also use minced chicken or minced beef you'll also need tae sticky rice some dried chili flakes a little bit of sugar

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.299
Fish sauce lime juice some shallots Culantro. Which is sort of like cilantro?

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.030
Green onions and mint leaves

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.110
Also, you can click below this video in the description box to see all of the ingredients and the directions for this recipe an important

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.110
ingredient in Lab mole is

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.510
Kokua and what that is this is Connie, Al which is sticky Rice Thai sticky rice. Do you have to roast it?

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.699
So you have to basically just cook it over a fire

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.889
in a hot frying pan and then after that Gonna kind of pounded up

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.080
So that's going to give the pork sell at some like a little crunch some texture to it. So the first step. We're gonna

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.029
Roast the sticky rice first step you want to turn on the fire to a low heat add

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.030
The sticky rice to the pan and then kind of continually stir it so the heat get sort of evenly

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.280
Distributed on the rice in about 15 minutes the sticky rice is turning really yellow almost looks like sweet and actually smells like popcorn

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.780
for pounding

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.769
It's best to have a stone mortar and pestle and then you just keep pounding the the rice until you have a coarse powder

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.259
Took me about five minutes or so

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:47.539
And once you're done with that you can scoop it out of the crop and then put it into a bowl aside

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.530
You'll come back to it later

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.780
Okay, so turn on the stove again this time. We want a really high heat and we'll be using a small sauce pan pot

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.700
I'd say fry it for about five minutes

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.569
And you want the pork to be completely gray and completely cooked through

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.539
When it's done fully cooked through you just take it off the heat

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.889
And you're actually done with the stove for this recipe on [the] streets of thailand

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.780
They mix the lab right in the same pot

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.550
So just grab your toasted rice add probably a big heaping tablespoon full add

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.130
Half to one tablespoon of dried chili flakes

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.579
I'll depending on how spicy you want it tiny Sprinkle of sugar and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.209
About half a tablespoon of fish sauce next step is to slice up one good-sized lime and squeeze it into the pot

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.179
I like [my] pretty sour so if you want it less sour you might start with just half a lime and taste test from there

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.629
Give the lab a quick stir to get those dry ingredients all mixed into the pork

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.540
And then it's time to get started peeling the shallots

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.409
So you want to peel the skin off the shallots then dice them into half rings?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.400
Before tossing them all into the pot you can grab the green onions and the culantro if you have it you want to just chop

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.459
off the roots first and then you can slice the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.029
Green onions really fine these herbs are going to give the cell at a wonderful fresh and just a green

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.850
Touch that just gives it awesome flavor

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.650
give it a quick stir right now to get those all mixed in and then you want to pluck some leaves of mint and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.260
Just sort of put them into the into the pork

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.559
This time you just want to give the lob a slight stir

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.330
So you don't like really crush those mint leaves um just up just a little mix oh

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600
Oh, yeah

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.750
It's Salty I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.800
Think we could use a little bit of lime juice actually I like my [feel] pretty sour a little more lime juice

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.938
And that should be just about perfecto

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.080
Going to Garnish it with some

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.080
leaves of mint

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.300
some sprigs of Culantro, and then finally some

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.179
Thai basil Thai sweet basil on the side and that is looking

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.120
Outstanding check this out. This is

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.290
my version of a ThAi street food Dish Larb Moo

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220
Hmm. Oh

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.019
That's just a like a refreshing me d. Porky salad so many awesome flavors

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.450
Got that good lime juice a little bit of crunch from the from the roasted rice

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.010
and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.980
Then you've got those herbs to to give it that nice herbaceous tinge to it

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.680
That's really good
