00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.487
 

00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:18.020
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.840
I'm Barry Smith.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.520
I'm the director of the
Institute of Philosophy, and

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.960
I'm the founding director of
the Centre for the Study of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.020
the Senses.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.640
So we're here at the Royal
Institution working alongside

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.280
the Arts &amp; Humanities Research
Council to bring people from

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.360
the sciences, the arts, the
humanities together to look at

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.690
food,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.250
because food is one of those
things which is many, many

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.440
dimensional.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.220
You've got an historical
object.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.890
You have a cultural object, an
economic object, something

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.170
chemical, something
perceptual.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.430
All of these sciences and arts
can be combined when we're

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.130
looking at food, how it's
presented, what its aesthetics

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.570
are, how we enjoy it, how it
works on us, how we grow it.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.360
People are fascinated by food.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.990
And so by coming together at
the Royal Institution we're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.630
going to get people to explore
how their senses work.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.230
So that they become a little
more aware of what's going on

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.820
in them and even more aware
of what they're eating.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.480
Hello, good evening, and
welcome to Food,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.990
the Brain and Us.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.930
Food is one of those things
which we have been attending

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.250
to from birth.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.530
We have a sense that
discriminates our engagement

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.360
with the world immediately that
we're born, giving us

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.630
liking or disliking, giving us
a way of interacting with

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.130
those things that we put in our
mouths or won't keep in

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.960
our mouths for long.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.190
And because food has now become
a source of adventure

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.790
for us and the choice is
proliferating all over the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.320
Western world.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.570
And we're mixing up cultures,
flavours.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.650
We find out not only about what
we can eat and where it

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.750
came from, but we're starting
to investigate, even more

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.630
seriously, what happens in us
when we eat, all of the things

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.760
that go on in our brain,
in our senses and the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.130
combinations of those, to give
us the flavour experiences

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.290
that we like, we prefer, and
that drive us to select our

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.280
particular favourite
food choices.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.570
Now, this evening is a chance
for us to do the theoretical

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.620
part of it.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.040
We're going to look at the
science both of what comes to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.610
us in eating but also what
happens to us when we eat.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.440
And as well as doing the
science, we're going to remind

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.230
you there are not only
theoretical gains to be had

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.920
here, but food is also fun.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.840
And you're going to, I hope,
experience that because after

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.140
the theoretical part
you're going to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.410
have a practical part.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.270
We're going to take you out and
give you a tasting menu of

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.630
experiences.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.070
Where we'll try to demonstrate
to you some of the things that

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.800
are going on.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.150
Now, this evening's event is
brought to us as a joint

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.080
collaboration between the Royal
Institution and the Arts

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.930
&amp; Humanities Research Council.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.420
And I'm Barry Smith and I'm
the lead fellow for the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.590
Science in Culture theme
for the Arts &amp;

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.270
Humanities Research Council.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.620
And the reason I want to do
something here, with the Royal

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.330
Institution, is because when we
look at food we realise how

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.780
amazingly interesting it is to
so many areas of study, to so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.380
many disciplines.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.120
You can think of food
economically.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.260
You can understand food in
its cultural aspect.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.670
We are going to explore some
of the history of food and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.090
eating, what our
ancestors ate.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.890
How does that and how do the
cultures we live in shape what

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.230
we choose to eat?

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.030
And how does that affect how
things actually taste to us in

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.960
our mouths?

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.390
And because we're going to
use all of the different

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.250
disciplines that we can in a
very short space of time,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.340
we're going to have a historian,
a neuroscientist,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.560
an artist and a chef.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.490
And that's just a tiny part of
what we could have considered

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.030
when we look at all the ways
in which food interests us.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.970
So we're interested in what goes
on in that moment when

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.450
you pop something
in your mouth.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.300
And most of us think,
it's very simple.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.029
Put something in your mouth,
chew it, crunch it, swallow

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.290
it, it's gone, over very fast.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.780
And the main thing you're
interested in is do I like it?

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.950
Do I want anymore?

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.040
Maybe I don't like it.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.380
But liking sometimes
distracts us.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.640
It sometimes stops
us from thinking

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.670
about the food itself.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.130
What does it taste like?

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.830
And how do we have those
experiences of taste?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.940
What gives rise to them?

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.550
Are they all coming
from the tongue?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.840
Well, maybe, maybe not.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.640
We're going to explore that.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.630
You'll hear Charles Spence
from Oxford, from the

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.650
Crossmodal lab, talking about
all of the sensory goings-on

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.580
that might affect what we eat.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.830
But our preferences, our initial
preferences, might be

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.780
set partly by nature.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.990
We know that children, whether
they're infant children or

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.750
whether you've got baby rats or
baby chimps will all have

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.580
that same liking for sugar.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.950
If you give them
a sweet sucrose

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.140
solution, lick the lips.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.760
You give them something
bitter, blech, don't

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.180
want it, reject it.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.460
And because most toxins are
bitter it's a good idea that

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.500
from birth you will reject
bitter flavours.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.350
Because toxins--

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.860
not all of them, but
most of them--

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.820
going into the mouth, recognised
as bitter, you

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.900
expel them and you
protect yourself.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.240
But how come, as adults, we
suddenly learn to drink

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.500
alcohol or coffee?

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.290
And we eat green vegetables.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.170
How do we do that?

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.950
What's gone on?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.280
What's developed our
sense of taste?

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.870
And how do we develop
or acquire tastes?

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.941
How does that happen?

00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:57.590
And the tastes that we have now,
in London in particular,

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.750
when you look at the volume,
the prodigious volume of

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.910
ingredients that we have in our
supermarkets, where did we

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.640
get our appetite for just those
things and not others?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.420
Why do we like some foods and
why do we find some foods

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.110
repelling or too difficult
or too demanding?

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.200
Is it just where we were born?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.130
Is what we were used to?

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.800
And how did our historical
ancestors eat?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.690
Did they taste things
just as we did?

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.430
Did their tastes work
differently given that they

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.880
were, perhaps, having a more
meagre diet or having a very

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.950
restricted diet?

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.920
And we're going to explore the
history of eating, especially

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.220
in medieval England with
Chris Woolgar.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.420
But we're also going to look at
the way in which dining and

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.210
the whole experience of dining
has become very, very

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.300
specialised.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.020
If you want to go out for dinner
now, yes, maybe you'll

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.130
go out and eat because
you'd rather

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.400
somebody else cooked it.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.650
But very often, if you go to a
restaurant when you say, I

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.670
could have cooked that myself
it's an invitation to feel

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.940
rather lazy.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.460
So we want to be amazed when
we go out and eat.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.500
And now we see that the
standards for having an

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.640
extraordinary experience
at the dining table--

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.360
and not even always at
a dining table--

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.550
are raising the bar.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.950
And from artists and chefs
working together and from very

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.500
experimental chefs like Ferran
Adria and Heston Blumenthal

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.520
we've learned to treat the
experience of dining in a

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.670
tasting menu as just that,
it's an experience.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.610
Don't go to the Fat Duck
if you're hungry.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.290
But go if you're curious.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.480
Go and find out how your senses
work and what's having

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.970
an impact on the way you
perceive and eat your food.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.930
And tonight we're going to have
Caroline Hobkinson, who

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:53.460
is an artist with chef skills
who is putting food as central

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.350
to her art and to the things
that she will demonstrate to

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.320
us and the things that she
will delight us with.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.790
And she provides people in these
special exhibitions or

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.000
pop-up restaurants with
extraordinary experiences.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.550
And food and the science
behind it is one of the

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.090
motivations.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.690
Finally, we'll hear from Charles
Michel, a trained chef

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.080
trained in one of the most
prestigious chef schools in

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.160
Lyon in Paul Bocuse,
but also Colombian.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.140
And who is very interested in
how he can bring very strict

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.200
and traditional--

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.020
rather classical training
in cuisine--

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.070
together with the range of
products and ingredients that

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.140
you might find in Colombia
and in South America.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.440
And how can you combine those?

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.270
And can you combine
them successfully?

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.669
Or well it always be for both,
the Europeans and the South

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.770
Americans, a little bizarre?

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.110
He's going to give you lots of
experiences later which will

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.510
be quite bizarre.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.910
Now, what we're going to do is
after the talks there'll be

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.450
time for some questions.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.370
And then, before you leave,
we're going to give you your

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.890
tasting menu.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.450
And your menu will be
numbered one to six.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.730
And when you go out, I want
you to find your Royal

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.170
Institution guide.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.630
They'll be wearing
the blue badges.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.990
And they'll have their
tour guide hand up.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.300
So they'll be number one or
number two, number three, and

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.365
so on, to six.

00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:17.960
And you follow that person and
that's your route through the

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.010
tasting menu.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.010
So we hope you'll enjoy
those experiences.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.610
But first, let's go
back a little bit.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.090
And let's find out about the
history of eating and the

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.250
history of eating and of
everyday eating in England and

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.760
in medieval England.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.130
So Chris Woolgar is a professor
of history from

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.730
Southampton University who
studies the everyday and who

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.860
believes, passionately, that you
can't study the everyday

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.530
experience in history until you
study sensation and how

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.630
people perceive the world around
them, and eating being

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.370
a very big part of that.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.930
And Chris is one of the leading
historians, food

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.190
historians, to really bring to
life what we don't know and

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.680
are now, through him, beginning
to know about food

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.794
history, Chris.

00:10:04.794 --> 00:10:11.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.910
Thank you very much Barry.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:19.160
I wanted to start, really,
by posing a question.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.800
Why would I want to think about
the senses in the past?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.690
Why aren't they like my
physiology today?

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.430
I mean, surely everything
is the same.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.600
The more I looked at this
question the more I discovered

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.470
that sensation in the past,
perception in the past, works

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.410
in very different ways.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.790
A lot of what goes on is
culturally determined rather

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.540
than biologically determined.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.580
Since the Enlightenment, the way
that we perceive the world

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.540
has been very much
a closed process.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.250
If we go back further in time,
perception is much more open.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.720
It's also a process that
is not just one way.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.940
It's two way.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.380
So if I, 600 years ago, were to
touch this table, not only

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.760
would I feel that it was solid,
that it was smooth, but

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.500
my moral qualities
would pass to it.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.910
And its moral qualities
would pass to me.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.130
Now, that is really very
significant, indeed.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.740
The medieval period inherited
from antiquity the notion of

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.560
five senses, and you see on
the left-hand side of the

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.110
screen, the wheel of the five
senses from the Longthorpe

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.340
Tower in Peterborough, the sense
of taste is the monkey

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.000
or the ape on the bottom corner
there, just about to

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.570
put something into its mouth.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.640
 

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.090
But one needs to understand
how this works in terms of

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.880
eating and taste.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.850
Taste is just one of the
senses of the mouth.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.950
It's, if you like, the incoming
sense, whereas speech

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.210
is the outgoing part
of the sense.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:19.860
So for example, we conceive
that you might acquire the

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.430
characteristics of the animal
that the meats that you've

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.430
eaten has come from.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.050
So you get strength from meat
in that sort of way.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.070
If you're eating the Eucharist
you might acquire holiness as

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.630
well in that particular way.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.140
But these things are
not quite as

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.930
clear cut as that sometimes.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.205
There are lots of treatises
called lapidaries which are

00:12:42.205 --> 00:12:44.810
about stones and the magic
and the law that's

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.260
associated with them.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.790
Well, one of the ones we have
from Peterborough Abbey from

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.550
the 15th century tells us that
if somebody puts the stone

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.570
under their tongue they
then speak truth.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.940
So this works in both ways.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.390
There is a moral connotation
with this sense.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.560
The senses are all the
gateways to the soul.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.610
And consumption is certainly
critical in that.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.470
We perhaps still abstain
from eating meat on

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.380
Fridays and eat fish.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.270
The origin of that, in the
medieval period, is connected

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.290
with carnality.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.220
Quite literally, the fleshiness
of the meat making

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.500
us lusty and gluttonous.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.120
So people eat fish
to avoid that.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.610
Not only on Fridays, on
Wednesdays, on Saturdays.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.850
Actually, about half the
days of the year they

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.910
abstain from meat.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.700
People are also trying to avoid
sensory stimulation.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.560
And as we will see, shortly,
there is a

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.770
very rich, spicy diet.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.250
And we have a very nice account
from the canonisation

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.200
proceedings of Thomas Cantilupe
who was bishop of

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.650
Hereford and died in 1282.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.980
And the way that one eats
tells you about an

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.190
individual's virtue.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.180
So he was avoiding sensory
stimulation.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.330
So his chefs would prepare for
him the most beautiful dishes,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.770
highly-spiced dishes.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.930
They would come to him.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.530
And he would mix them all up
together so that the spices

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.020
balanced each other out.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.880
So it was rather wasted
on him, I think.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:33.920
By about 1100, Western Europe
has acquired, really, from

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:40.365
Arab medical texts, a notion of
what senses there will be.

00:14:40.365 --> 00:14:41.970
And they divide them.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.990
Unlike us, we mainly think
of four tastes.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.160
They will divide them
into eight or nine.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
And you'll see that there'll be
sweet, there'll be greasy,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.090
bitter, salty, sharp, harsh
or styptic, salty

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.670
like the sea, vinegary.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.420
And there is also a notion
that taste is made up--

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.520
like everything in the
world is made up--

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.610
of bits of the four humours.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.860
And that's a critical
ingredient in it.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.620
And likewise, the substance that
goes with it is dependent

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.940
on texture.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.540
And they talk about things
being thin, interim,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.830
consistent.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.880
And that's also quite
interesting.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.730
Because when we look at medieval
cooking it's all

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.110
about grinding up food.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.960
These are people without forks
to help them keep their meat

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.590
steady, as it were.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.580
So it can be carved for you
and put on the plate.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.260
But most food is ground to
a pulp in elite culture.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.520
So that, in a way,
is the theory.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.120
 

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.020
What really makes a difference,
though, to taste,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.200
is cooking and consumption.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.180
And from, really, the late 12th
century, we have sources

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.590
that tell us a great deal about
the preparation of food.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.320
Our earliest collections of
recipes from this country come

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.610
probably from the 1180s.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.740
All across Europe, from
the 1160s, 1170s we

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.390
have domestic accounts.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.410
And then we also have physical
remains as well.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.780
You've got the kitchen of the
Abbot of Glastonbury there,

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.970
built in the first part of the
14th century, huge investment.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.580
There was another separate
kitchen for the monks and

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.380
possibly, a third for the lay
visitors, particularly those

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.990
who were just passing guests.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.860
What this enables us to see,
particularly with the addition

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.310
of archaeological remains, is
a broader picture of what is

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.500
consumed in medieval England.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.460
We can see, as well, that there
is a common pattern to

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.530
cooking all across Europe
from about 1100 onwards.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.940
And it's not exactly the
same across Europe.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.880
It's a bit like Gothic
architecture in that Gothic

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.780
architecture in Turin is
different from Gothic

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.089
architecture in Paris
or in Canterbury.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.450
So there are variations.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.089
But the cuisine is
characterised by

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.319
highly-spiced dishes.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:22.730
And it's characterised by thin,
acidic sauces, sauces

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.710
that are typically made with
wine, with vinegar, with

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:30.860
verjuice and not with
fats and oils.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.980
Another key component of
medieval diet is preserved

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.590
foodstuffs.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.130
This is the big conundrum before
the 19th century, is

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.820
how you preserve food in
the long term, really,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.560
throughout the year.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.450
Around about 1100, in the period
of 1000 to 1100 we get

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.350
a very significant change
in medieval diet.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.900
We suddenly get very large
quantities of marine fish

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.030
appearing across northern
Europe.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.670
And it's clearly come from
far out in the Atlantic.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.850
It's been preserved, typically
salted and wind dried.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:12.470
And likewise, we find
meat is also salted.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.650
Sometimes it's dried.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.490
It's smoked.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.960
So a huge investment
goes into this.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.790
And this must have some
consequence, really, for how

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:25.820
food probably tastes and how
people perceive that.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.300
So we're looking,
really, at the

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.510
practical workings of this.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.530
Now, food is one of those
substances that if somebody

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:39.010
has something interesting on
their plate you want it too.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.470
And that applies equally across

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.310
large swathes of society.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:47.520
So noblemen have spicy dishes.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.080
And the rest of the countryside
thinks,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.140
well, what can we do?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.860
We can't possibly afford
these spices.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.160
They've come from halfway
across the world to this

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.450
island, far out, really, into
the North Atlantic almost.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.200
So it's a long journey.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.180
It's expensive.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.650
But we can grow interesting
things in our garden plots.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.760
So people look to grow herbs
and things that will

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.390
substitute.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:17.680
We find preparations of
ready-made sauces that are

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.610
available in markets.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.880
One can see mustard
being used.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.710
But even then, there
are gradations.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.160
People may not be able
to afford mustard.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.940
And there are not-quite-real
mustards that are prepared out

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.580
of radish seeds and
sour ale as you go

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.255
down the social scale.

00:19:35.255 --> 00:19:37.850
 

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.990
So what happens is that the
elite think, well, we need to

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.530
keep ourselves distinct.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.050
And they will look to culinary
practises to continue to

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.500
distinguish them.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.560
The Black Death is quite
an interesting

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.000
turning point in this.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.280
Because the Black Death
kills people.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.500
But it doesn't kill animals.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.620
And it changes the ratio between
livestock in the

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.400
countryside and the
human population.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.480
And all of a sudden, many people
can eat much more meat.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.520
And they do.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.640
Aristocrats, however, try
to eat less meat.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.680
And they start looking at other
things that will change

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.600
taste and flavour for them.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.950
And there are just a couple
of examples there.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:28.645
The picture on the screen is of
a citron, not a lemon, just

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:33.030
to remind you that it's not only
taste that's changing.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.510
Sometimes it's animals that have
been bred in particular

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.690
ways, they will change.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.050
Does the meat taste the same?

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.080
But also plants as well.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.960
We think of lemons, a slightly
different taste to the citron.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.160
But citrus fruits come, really,
into aristocratic diet

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.740
in this country-- fresh citrus
fruits-- in the 15th century.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.120
And they're very
highly prized.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.580
They're also very bitter
until quite a way

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.900
into the 16th century.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.370
For example, the oranges that
come in are the Seville

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.200
oranges rather than the ones
that have been mixed with

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.100
breeds from the species
from the Far

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.790
East, the sweeter breeds.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.270
But Henry VIII, in the inventory
that's prepared

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:19.000
after his death in 1547, has
strainers for orange juice,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
silver strainers.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.750
So that's one indication
of what's going on.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.690
Likewise with sugar, we find it
originally as a medicinal

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:34.560
condiment, really, in quite
small quantities.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.920
As time goes on, more is made
in the Mediterranean, much

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.880
more comes to this country.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.940
In the 1450s and the 1460s

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.680
Anne Stafford, Duchess of
Buckingham, quite a large

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.020
household, probably 80 or 90
people, gets through about 60

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.450
pounds of sugar in a year.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.470
And she makes jam.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:53.930
She's probably one of the
first people I've

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.830
found making jam.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.510
But if you fast-forward
a hundred years

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.940
everything has changed.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.005
The floodgates have opened.

00:22:01.005 --> 00:22:04.222
There is, suddenly, a great
deal more sugar.

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:07.810
And these things affect, very
much, the way people think

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.730
about taste and flavour.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.670
The more you have of something
the less you're able to

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.870
distinguish, in a way.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:19.840
So going back to our listing
of flavours, one of the

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.760
interesting things are the finer
gradations that we had

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.550
in that list of eight flavours,
particularly of the

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.760
sour, the bitter,
and the salty.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.560
And you can begin to see that
in what they're eating.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.700
But as a concluding note, what
I would say, is that we have

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.990
to be very aware that we don't
think that something that is

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.140
salty is exactly the same in
conception as something that

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.490
they thought was salty.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:53.600
The terminology doesn't
necessarily map exactly.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.760
I can see something that's
red, for example.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.390
And I might read a medieval
manuscript and that says

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.550
something is red.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.930
We shouldn't assume they're
the same things.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.990
Because I can demonstrate that
something that's red in the

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.150
medieval manuscript might range
from a yellowy-orange

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:12.530
through to a purple.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.210
Now, there's no reason
why that should not

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.170
also be true of taste.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.530
So we have quite a
complex problem.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.904
Thank you.

00:23:19.904 --> 00:23:22.364
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:22.364 --> 00:23:23.840
Thank you, Chris.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.780
 

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.330
Thank you, Chris.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.390
It also reminds me of the
18th century, as Steve

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.460
Shapin has taught us.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.100
That's when we changed from
having an objective conception

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.820
of flavours being in the foods
to thinking it was just

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.500
subjective and in our minds.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.780
Because everybody wanted to
taste the pineapple once

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.890
discovered.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.930
And science had advanced
greatly.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.870
But even scientists couldn't
tell you what a pineapple

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:51.770
tasted like.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.570
So people started to believe
that maybe flavours were just

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.795
in the mind.

00:23:55.795 --> 00:24:00.140
But nowadays, we might say,
they're in the brain.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.070
So we're going to ask that
question by looking at the

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.130
work of Charles Spence, someone
who I collaborate

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.670
with-- and many of us do-- at
the Centre for the Study of

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.180
the Senses in the University
of London.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.290
And Charles is now part of a
large grant project there

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.190
funded by the AHRC called
Rethinking the Senses.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.970
And so Charles, from the
Crossmodal lab in Oxford,

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.397
would you take the story on?

00:24:26.397 --> 00:24:30.293
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:30.293 --> 00:24:33.180
Yeah, so I do look in history
a little bit.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.310
But only as far back as 100
years and the futurists.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.020
But if I were to take somebody
from the street now, a man or

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.220
a woman, and ask them about
taste, the sort of things

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.350
they'd come up with would be
the four basic tastes, I

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.420
guess, sweet, sour,
salty, bitter.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.330
If they've travelled a bit and
been to some fancy restaurants

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.790
they might come up with a fifth
taste of umami, kind of

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.670
yumminess, well known
from Asian cuisines.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:59.210
The taste of Parmesan cheese and
then ripe tomatoes, say.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.270
But beyond that, that would be
the list of all the tastes

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.220
that we know about.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.260
But as a psychologist or as a
neurogastronomist or as a

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.800
gastrophysicist, a range of
terms for those who are

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.020
interested in knowing about
the brain and how that can

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.630
help us to understand taste and
flavour, we think maybe

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.650
there are far more
basic tastes.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.860
Maybe there are 20 or 25.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.480
Things like kokumi, metallic,
there may even be an electric

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.250
kind of tingling taste that
you may dare to try at the

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:29.890
hands of Charles Michel
a little bit later on.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.430
Even a fatty-acid taste.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.570
And so the psychologists and
neuroscientists and the

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.050
philosophers are struggling to
say, what makes a basic taste?

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.790
Why should we just have
four or five?

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.095
And why not throw in all these
other ones that are unfamiliar

00:25:40.095 --> 00:25:42.880
to us in our daily lives, but
of which we might be able to

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.840
point to a specific receptor on
the tongue that codes for a

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.810
particular kind of input.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.480
But really, I think when most
of us actually talk about

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.500
taste what we mean is flavour.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.440
When I talk about the taste of
food and I'm thinking about

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.540
fruitiness and floral notes
and earthy and musty, and

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.130
meaty, and things like that.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.610
But all those richer experiences
of taste come not

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.345
from our mouth, but really
from our nose.

00:26:06.345 --> 00:26:08.680
And I think Barry will be
demonstrating some of that in

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.760
one of the exhibits outside
a little bit later on.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.610
And quite how much of flavour,
what we commonly call the

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.040
taste of food, comes from our
nose is a topic of intense

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.350
discussion between me and
some of my colleagues.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.850
But you will find some people
out there who will say that as

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.770
much as 80 to 95% percent of
what you think of as the taste

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.390
of food is really coming
from your nose,

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.470
not from your mouth.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.730
And that's part of the reason
when people who come to the

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.950
lab in Oxford with a complaint
it's nearly always the

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.210
complaint that I've lost
my sense of taste.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:37.710
What can you do?

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.540
I can do nothing.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.490
I'm a gastrophysicist.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.860
But what they've really lost
is not their taste.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.100
I can show that their taste buds
are working fine, sweet,

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.220
sour, salty, bitter,
all perfect.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.080
What they've lost is the fruity,
the floral, the meaty,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.820
the earthy notes.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.090
And their nose is blocked.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:55.210
But they're referring, the stuff
that's coded by their

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:58.040
nose, all those rich flavour
terms, and mislocalising them

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.020
into their mouth--

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.410
which is an illusion called
oral referral--

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.210
and to try and understand
why that happens.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.680
Again, you might want to look in
the brain of the subject or

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.840
the participant or the diner,
in fact, in some of our more

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.845
real-world experiments.

00:27:12.845 --> 00:27:15.010
And so those are two of the
key senses involved in the

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.126
taste of food and the flavour.

00:27:18.126 --> 00:27:20.500
I think a third one, that we
don't think about much-- and

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.720
which, again, will be a topic
for exploration outside a

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.530
little bit later--

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.360
is touch or oral
somatosensation.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.520
This is things like the
temperature of a drink, the

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.570
fact that cold Coke will
taste quite pleasant.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.750
But warm it up, change the
temperature, and suddenly, it

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.340
tastes too sweet.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.200
So the temperature, tactile
qualities affecting the taste.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.030
This is also what's going on in
this dish you can see here,

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.220
the bacon &amp; egg ice cream
from the Fat Duck

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.032
restaurant in Bray.

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:49.520
And if you take a spoon from
that bacon &amp; egg ice cream by

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.960
itself it's pretty OK.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.640
You wouldn't go out and
buy some from Tescos.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.350
But when it's served in the
restaurant it works.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.050
And why does it work?

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:00.230
It works because next to the
ice cream on the left is a

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.800
cube of flavourless crispy-fried
bread.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.460
And what that brings to the
flavour equation or the

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.610
flavour experience is texture.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.840
So when you take a mouthful of
the crispy bread with the

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.850
bacon &amp; egg ice cream, what
happens in your brain is those

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.370
flavours ventriloquise
and pull apart.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.210
And you experience the bacon
flavour in the texturally

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.400
appropriate crispy bread.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.330
And you leave the eggy flavour
behind in the ice cream.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.550
So you get a separation of
flavours in your mouth that's

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.950
all done by your brain,
combining, saying, what's the

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.680
most likely to be
my mouth now?

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.100
And where should that bacon
flavour really belong?

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.700
And it's using the
cue of texture or

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.250
touch to give the answer.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.900
That's three senses involved
in flavour experiences.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.650
The fourth one, I think, that's
very important, is what

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:46.880
we see, the eye.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.090
And that can be the colour of
foods or drinks themselves.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.960
And I'm going to try and play
some tricks on you downstairs

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.190
a little later on.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.570
But it could also be the colour
of the plateware.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.930
And those two plates you see in
front of you have no taste.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.990
They have no flavour.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.500
And yet, if you were to eat the
dessert from one of those

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.640
two plates, a strawberry
mousse--

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.200
this served in Farran Adria's
test kitchens in Spain--

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.770
and those who ate the dessert
off the black plate did rate

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:18.970
it as 10% less sweet and 15%
less flavorful strawberry

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.520
mousse than the dessert
on the right.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.760
Everyone's eating the same food,
but the colour of the

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.750
plate is changing the taste that
we ascribe to that dish.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.360
And of course, the potential
health implications there, if

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.870
I know that food will taste
sweeter off a round plate and

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.440
off a white plate could
be huge and

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.320
important in terms of obesity.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.710
We start these things
in the lab.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.800
Either in the lab in Oxford,
which is very scientific, an

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.920
unreal world.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.830
Or sometimes in test kitchens at
restaurants which are a bit

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.040
closer to real-world dining
but still not quite there.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.310
But when we find something we
think that works, we then go

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.690
somewhere like the Paul Bocuse,
where Charles Michel

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:55.980
was trained.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.550
And there they have an
experimental restaurant

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.140
where people go.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.490
They book, they pay,
they have a nice

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.830
dinner with their friends.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.720
They get a discount.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.410
And for that discount we
ask them to fill in a

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.140
questionnaire after
their meal.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.850
And there you can see, two of
the actual desserts created by

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.780
people like Charles Michel in
the restaurant setting.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.840
And there too, we've been able
to show with real diners

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.840
paying for their real dinner
that plate colour matters and

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.090
changes the taste.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.580
So when we think about taste and
flavour we think about not

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.060
only the tongue but also the
nose, the texture, the

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.290
temperature in the mouth,
but also, what the eye

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.536
is telling the brain.

00:30:27.536 --> 00:30:30.060
And if that's true, if
vision can dominate--

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.790
and again, there's a whole
neuroscience literature about

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.680
why what we see might dominate
the other senses--

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.590
then how can we use that
in a practical way?

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.525
And how might we use
that in the future?

00:30:38.525 --> 00:30:42.150
Well, here's Katsunori Okajima
from Japan and a pair of

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.170
virtual-reality spectacles you
can buy online for about

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.575
$1,000 and watch the movies in
its hyper-realistic form.

00:30:48.575 --> 00:30:50.530
And above are two
plates of sushi.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.400
Well, really just one
plate of sushi.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.340
The plate on the left is
some kind of cheap

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.080
bit of fish, perhaps.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.880
The one on the right is
what you might think

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.120
you're going to eat.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.900
So people come to the
restaurant, to the future.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.360
They put on these spectacles.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:09.500
The fish has been fished dry, as
it were, of the expensive,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.370
the really nice sushi.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.740
So what's a person to do?

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.010
Well, maybe they don a pair of
these headsets and then go to

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.330
the restaurant, try the sushi.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.660
And if we have the video,
please, you'll see somebody

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.990
having a dish of
virtual sushi.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.400
The plate on the left
is the actual sushi.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.980
And as they put their hand over
the sushi, you can see

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.050
the sushi on the right changes
its texture, changes its

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.700
visual appearance.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.050
And then you can just put
your hand over, no, I

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:35.810
don't like that fish.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:36.950
No, not that one.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.500
Keep going until you find the
fish that you want, put it in

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.520
your mouth.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.730
And it's got all the right
textural, the lighting cues.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:45.530
And the question is, how
will diners respond?

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.280
Will it really seem like
they're eating

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.940
the sushi they see?

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.780
Is visual dominance
that powerful?

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.750
And if it is, can we use
it to help preserve

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.330
some of the fish stocks?

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.980
And finally, the forgotten
flavour sense is hearing.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.160
One that now, people like Heston
Blumenthal would say, I

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.550
think of hearing and sound as
one of the ingredients the

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.530
chef can use in the kitchen.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.540
Never before did they
think that.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.960
And why did they start
starting to

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.250
think about sound more?

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.950
It's fully to do with the
sonic-crisp experiment that

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.970
you all-- at least some number
of you-- can try.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.140
We have boxes and boxes of
Pringles out there, waiting

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.850
for you to try the
sonic crunch.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.950
And we're going to show you how,
by playing with what you

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.010
hear when you bite into a
Pringle, we can make that

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:28.850
ultra crispy, crunchy,
fresh-as-ever Pringle.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.920
And we do that by knowing about
how the brain works, by

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.820
knowing how if you change
what you hear you can

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.920
change what you taste.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.910
And this is the kind of research
that starts out with

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.330
food companies who are very
interested in trying to make

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.060
healthier foods.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.270
Or at least, foods that
are no less healthy.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.810
But as they reduce salt, sugar,
fat and the unhealthy

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:44.780
ingredients.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.745
If you reduce those things
people say, what have you done

00:32:46.745 --> 00:32:47.075
to my brand?

00:32:47.075 --> 00:32:48.440
I don't like it anymore.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.330
But if you can use some of these
illusions or tricks of

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.420
the mind to preserve the flavour
by sound then that

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.430
could be of interest.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.360
So we have all the senses, I
think, playing, combining

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.200
together into what we think
of as taste or flavour

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.090
experiences.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.530
And the neurogastronomy tells
us about the brain science

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.670
which allows us to predict
what would happen if we

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.730
changed the sound, the
colour of the food.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.740
And what we're trying to do at
the moment is work with chefs

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.850
and artists like Caroline and
Charles Michel here in order

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.370
to put some of that science into
forms that are appealing,

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:22.990
that people really
want to taste.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.120
So here's one of them.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.470
The Sound of the Sea seafood
dish from Heston Blumenthal's

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.410
Fat Duck, the signature
dish on the menu.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.080
When you go to the restaurant,
outskirts of Slough, not a

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.940
very nice bit of the country.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.650
How do you capture
that seaside?

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.450
The provencal rose moment, well,
the waiter will come to

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.930
the table with a plate
of seafood that

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.050
looks like the sea.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:43.780
Maybe doing the visual dominance
with the foam and

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.230
there's seaweed and hopefully
some seafood.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.080
On the other hand, comes a conch
shell out of which comes

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.020
some little iPod headphones.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.450
The waiter says, probably with
a French accent, we recommend

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.085
that you put the headphones
before you start the dish.

00:33:55.085 --> 00:33:57.000
When you put the headphones
in what do you hear?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.900
The sounds of the sea with just
the right number of waves

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.430
crashing on the beach, just the
right number of seagulls

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.250
floating around overhead.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.490
And when you see people in the
restaurant they were chatting,

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.280
chatting, chatting, talking
to each other, distracted.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.460
They put the headphones
in and they're silent.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.199
Their attention is squarely
on the food.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:15.810
And if you attend to the
food it tastes better.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.474
Just for one course, you
wouldn't want to do it for

00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:17.540
five hours.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.330
It'd be kind of boring.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.120
But for one course, to
illustrate the power of sound,

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.980
I think that's a great thing.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.590
But one where the chef
is bringing the

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.380
technology to you.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.440
The same here, Denis Martin in
Vevey, in Switzerland, two

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.040
Michelin stars.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.800
He makes modernist cuisine
with smoke and foam and

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.540
mirrors and espumas and
all that stuff.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.710
And here is his take
on the gin and

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.360
tonic, the Gin &amp; Sonic.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.429
Take a gin and tonic,
put it in a balloon,

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:39.420
blow the balloon up.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.449
Put the balloon in a bath of
liquid nitrogen, roll the

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:43.310
balloon around, peel
off the balloon.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.920
What you're left with this is
perfect white sphere glowing

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.050
with illumination.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.050
Perfect gin and tonic as you've
never seen it before.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.500
But there's one thing missing.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:51.984
Sshhhh!

00:34:51.984 --> 00:34:54.260
The fizz of the bubbles
are not there.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.199
So what can we do to bring
back the sound that the

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.770
modernist cuisine has taken
out through artful

00:34:58.770 --> 00:34:59.880
presentation?

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.700
Well, put one of those little
loudspeakers onto the plate.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.030
And the sound of the fizz will
actually come with this dish.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:09.770
But it will come from the dish
rather than from the food

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.360
placed on it.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.820
Again, the chef bringing
the technology to you.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.840
But all of you, probably, have
a mobile phone in your pocket

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.080
or an iPod or an iPad or
a Samsung or one of

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.680
those sorts of things.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.330
When you're at a restaurant
you can see people just

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.030
playing away, Instagramming,
taking pictures, being

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.300
distracted from the food.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.940
Remember, if you pay attention
to the food

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.710
it will taste better.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.530
And we think there's so much
potential there, with the

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.140
technology at the table.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.130
Why can't we take our
iPods and maybe

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.190
serve dinner from them?

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.320
We don't think of technology
in that way.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.810
But they make waterproof
ones nowadays.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.150
You can stick them, I guess,
in the dishwasher.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.800
And what could you do if you
could synchronise the

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.650
sensations you received while
eating, technology in the

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:45.640
hands of the diners.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.320
We could change the colour of
the plate just like that, to

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.840
whatever we wanted.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.900
We could synchronise music with
the food, all exciting

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.610
possibilities.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:56.530
And finally, when we think about
flavour and taste, with

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.530
a neruogastronomist,
gastrophysicist hat on, we

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.100
think about all the senses
coming together.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.050
We think about the plateware,
the cutlery.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.680
But we also think about the
environment in which you eat.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.740
Wherever you eat, wherever you
drink, it's somewhere.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.320
That somewhere that sends out
signals to your brain about

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.330
sounds and smells and
temperature and textures and

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.040
feels and so on.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.000
And those sensory cues in
the background from the

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.230
environment, we think, are
integrated into your

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.240
experience of food.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.230
That's why food tastes so much
better in the Mediterranean on

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.900
your summer holiday.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.650
That's why, when you bring
those bottles of wine and

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.660
cheese back home and open them
on a cold winter's night with

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.540
your friends it's just
not the same.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.750
Something's missed
the experience.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.990
And what's missing is
the atmosphere.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.456
And if you know that part of the
taste of food comes from

00:36:34.456 --> 00:36:36.750
the atmosphere you can then play
with that, be it with the

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.430
sounds of the sea or be with a
Sensorium-- an event we ran in

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.300
Soho back in March--

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.370
where people went room to room
with a glass of whiskey and a

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.480
scorecard in the other hand.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.930
And we changed the sounds.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:48.830
We changed the lighting.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.900
We changed the texture,
the smells.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.360
And people could see, as they
went from room to room, that

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.640
the taste of the drink in
their glass changed

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.890
by as much as 20%.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.040
The glass was always
in their hand.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.030
But they could see, from their
the scorecards, they were

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.300
giving the same drink a
different taste, hence

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.010
demonstrating, we think, the
importance of the atmosphere

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.610
as part of what contemporary
people think of as

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.850
the taste of food.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:11.120
Thank you.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:19.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:23.700
Charles, thanks very much,
wonderful demonstration of all

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.770
the factors that will go into
a flavour experience.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.520
And Charles and his colleagues
from the Crossmodal Lab and

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.120
Ophelia Deroy from the Centre
for the Study of the Senses

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.060
are going to be with you to try
and get you to experiment

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.880
and discover some of
this for yourself.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.260
Now, we said it was fun.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.610
And we said it was serious.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.510
And I think when we want to
understand how it can be both

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.470
at once and genuinely
extraordinary then we turned

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.300
to art and artists.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.990
And that's why we are delighted
to have Caroline

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:57.860
Hobkinson to take us now from
the toolbox to the arts,

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.900
Caroline, thank you.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:03.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.460
Hi I'm Caroline Hobkinson.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.590
And I'm obsessed with eating in
any form, especially eating

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.060
as an experience.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.430
I'm trained as an artist.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.220
And that's why I say
I'm an artist.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:20.030
But I work as well as a chef
in all different ways.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.650
 

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.660
I really think that the way we
eat is such an ingrained part

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.780
of our culture that we hardly
ever think about it.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.740
It's just taken for granted,
the way, if you just look

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.100
closely at a fork, it's just
really bizarre, or the way

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.570
just food is just stuck
in front of us.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.310
So I'm just going to show
what I'm doing.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.130
Because it's a bit in
that no-man's land

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.500
between food and art.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.360
So I curate experimental
dining experiences.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.250
Sometimes you can call me a food
artist or a concept chef.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.080
Using performance, video
cooking, writing in all forms

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:58.830
I try to re-frame the everyday
rituals of eating.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:00.630
I stage dining events
exploring the

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.730
world through food.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.890
I really love to really grab
people and force them out of

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:05.630
their comfort zone.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.520
It's interesting how
conservative we are when it

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.300
comes to eating.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.045
We like new technology.

00:39:11.045 --> 00:39:14.050
But when it comes to eating,
I'm not sure we really want

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.160
that iPad at times.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.860
Because we actually
want our fork.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.660
I am, personally, really annoyed
if the fork is on the

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.910
wrong side.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:22.920
 

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.610
I like to do this
to other people.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.760
So here, I built a huge table
where people were literally

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.620
sitting underneath
the ceiling.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.050
And then with their
feet dangling.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.850
So the exhibition itself
was peoples' legs.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.860
And the food was brought
up by pulley systems.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.670
So punters in the gallery
could not see

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.560
what people were eating.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.830
And up there a jolly time was
had with the waiters popping

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:45.680
through the openings.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.540
And obviously, everyone else had
a rather nice view of the

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.520
diners from below.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.670
Another project I did is The
Secret Sensory Suppers at the

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.860
Andaz Hotel, where
they discovered a

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.360
secret Masonic temple.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.830
And I really love the idea of
having people anonymously.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:07.150
So they were led blindfolded
into the room.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.330
And they remained masked
throughout the whole idea.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.380
Because only when we are
masked-- and obviously

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.780
throughout the history, we
obviously know that as well--

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.000
we really come out of our
comfort zone most.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.150
So we have individual
assistance.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.050
We have a master of conduct.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:25.920
And I was working with helium
balloons to take the idea of

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.600
touch away.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.730
So we were literally eating
with our mouth rather than

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:29.410
with our hands.

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:35.260
So there's nothing in between
us, our hands, and our mouth.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.030
And this is another project I
did for a salon in Milan where

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.560
I literally deconstructed the
dining table and looked at the

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.850
bizarre ways we interact
with food, especially

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:48.190
when it comes to design.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.240
And there's a lot of attention
given to different things, but

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:56.290
never, exactly, to the meaning
of how does the fork taste?

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.560
And how does a fork influence
the taste in itself?

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.850
But people all over the world
obsess for the last 50 years

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:07.230
in the perfect design of the
fork, without actually being

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.640
behind where they should
be, maybe in

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.010
between the right materials.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.230
This is another project I did
in Berlin at the Grimmuseum

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.480
which is based on La Grande
Bouffe, where I invited 20

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.770
people to commit suicide
through overeating.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.210
And I stuck cameras in
between the food.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:28.110
So you can see there, that
inside the food, people were

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.360
being filmed.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.410
 

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:35.390
If anyone knows the film,
it's a lot of food.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.240
And then the leftover were left
to rot for six weeks.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.950
So it's very much playing with
the whole idea that one moment

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.520
we really love food.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.420
When it comes to over
consumption it becomes

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.990
something quite different.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:50.160
In this case, it's almost
like a moving,

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.260
breathing, vanitas painting.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.950
And it's an overwhelming
amount of

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.120
smell, as well, in there.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.410
Because sometimes, obviously,
it begins to smell.

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:01.960
This is something I did as a
culinary evocation of 15 Elder

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.400
Street, commissioned by the
Royal Academy, where I was

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.360
going through the eight stages
of a house and trying to

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.920
imagine the ghosts who used
to live in this place.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.780
So this is just a little
excerpt of the menu.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.820
Coming from Roman Spitalfields
going through Hungry

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.370
Spitalfields.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.050
I literally served a dish of
nothing and really, telling

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.100
stories and the storytelling
power of food.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.350
But obviously, this
all exists.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:33.990
I mean, the Holy Communion was
mentioned, Thanksgiving, the

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:36.720
way we interact with
our wedding cake.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.370
The actual taste of
the wedding cake,

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:39.420
there's not much to it.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.020
But we all remember it as the
most amazing taste we had.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.580
Because it actually
eaten in context.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.140
It's how all the other
senses are involved.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.400
It's visually, there's so
much presentations.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.200
But insider it's just an
over-sweetened sponge.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.390
And the fantastic feast at the
end of Eid as well, after

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.510
fasting during Ramadan.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.910
So food is a manifestation
of our longings.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.240
But I really believe it is
a vocabulary of our life.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.205
Because we really remember
last Christmas.

00:43:08.205 --> 00:43:09.918
Oh, that was when we were
in Italy and we

00:43:09.918 --> 00:43:10.420
had this great food.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.590
We use food as vocabulary, as
punctuation to our life.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.100
 

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.520
My favourite food ritual
is the birthday cake.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.460
Because for me, it is incredibly
universal.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.580
It only appeared--

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:28.015
correct me if I'm wrong-- in the
last 60 years worldwide.

00:43:28.015 --> 00:43:31.090
And the taste sensation of
eating a birthday cake is an

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:33.650
ordinary over-sweetened
sponge.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.650
But the eating of it
is a masterminded

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.610
multi-sensory spectacle.

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:41.290
The anticipation, it has been
baked especially for us.

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:42.200
The light is dimmed.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.940
Candles are lit, one symbolising
each year of our

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.180
life, another chorus of
Happy Birthday to You.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.050
We close our eyes, make a
wish, blow out the fire.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.040
The smell of the smoky wax,
our wish will come true.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.120
Oh, how delicious.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.350
Suddenly, we are four
years old again.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.040
So we have all those
10,000 taste buds

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.410
to detect five tastes.

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:06.090
But our mind really creates most
of our taste sensations.

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:09.220
So eating is a fully immersive
experience.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.890
And how do they interplay?

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.930
And what happens if the sense
of smell interplays with a

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:17.250
sense of hearing and it creates

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.700
something like no other?

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.480
So I was looking into how can we
enhance these experiences?

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.880
And then I came across
Charles Spence.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.935
I got really excited that,
actually, there is research

00:44:27.935 --> 00:44:32.090
done in exactly that very field
I find so fascinating,

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:33.750
which gives me, obviously,
most of the

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.140
motivation for my practise.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:41.370
So I ended up collaborating on
a multi-sensory menu which I

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.350
served up for one month
at the House of Wolf.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.440
This is a little excerpt
of the menu.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.760
And it really plays with the
findings Charles mentioned

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.030
before, the fact that so much
of our taste experience is

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:55.400
based on our hearing, and
playing with it and showing it

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.130
to people in the way, obviously
not meaning that

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:03.570
people should eat forevermore
with headphones and things,

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.320
just to really draw attention
to the way we eat and to

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.240
enhance our dining experience in
the way that we assess it.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.170
So science offers me a huge
toolbox to play with.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.910
It's fantastic because
it is almost like

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:16.820
the artist's palette.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.530
And I just grab and take it
from all different things,

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.310
from how much taste is in a
colour to touch and taste.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:31.370
And there are specially-made
dining utensils where I carved

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:37.280
fish-fork-style endings into
tree branches to really draw

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:41.320
home the wild nature of eating
meat and to grow it back to

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.510
the over-modulated fork.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.540
The one thing I find most
fascinating is sound, and how

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.450
to really modulate the
experience of food through

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:52.590
certain sounds.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.350
I mean, I heard that you can
actually modulate the taste of

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:59.630
food from sweet to bitter by
changing certain frequencies.

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:01.260
I thought that was really
fascinating.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.150
So I started to play
around with that.

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.420
So I came up with this sonic
cake pop, where I gave people

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.230
a cake pop and a lollipop
stick and

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.460
then a telephone number.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.560
So people could ring a
certain phone number.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.940
And then they could literally
dial a taste.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.270
And they could decide it.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.860
So diners were given
a number to call.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.530
And they were prompted
to press one for

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:23.680
sweet, two for bitter.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.120
And obviously, it does work.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.740
But it's fantastic where it
could go, whether we go one

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.230
day into a coffee shop and
we can have the perfect

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:31.870
customised coffee,
I don't know.

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:33.760
It would be fantastic.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.670
So the experience of flavour is
the integration of taste,

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.770
touch and smell.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:41.140
But flavour conjures memories.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.550
And I really am incredibly
fascinated into involuntary

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:47.450
memory, which obviously is known
as, as well, the Proust

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:49.200
phenomenon.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.360
I won't read this out, but
obviously, most of us would

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.170
have come across Proust or the
episode of the Madeleines,

00:46:55.170 --> 00:47:00.610
when almost just by eating and
dunking a Madeleine into warm

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.340
tea, he is completely
transported

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.280
back into his past.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.130
He's not remembering it.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.510
He's not thinking, oh, I'm going
to have a Madeleine like

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:10.200
I used to have when I
was 12 years old.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.180
But he's dunking it.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.730
And suddenly, it's almost
like human time travel.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:14.470
He's just there.

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:17.540
And he's there again.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.710
So obviously, there are
different kinds of memory.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:22.860
But involuntary memory is not
just an unearthing of the

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.470
past, but a reliving of the
past as the present.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.490
We grasp the past
as the present.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.695
So maybe Proust was
a neuroscientist.

00:47:30.695 --> 00:47:33.390
I mean, there are different
books on literature out there.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:34.410
I doubt it very much.

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:36.630
But science is not the only
path to knowledge.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.520
Where the brain is concerned,
sometimes art was their first.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.680
So there's a French chef who
first discovered umami.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.510
And with Cezanne and his
wonderful way of looking at

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.210
the world, obviously
this influence in

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.220
neuroscience as well.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.440
Picasso once said, we all know
that art is not truth.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.660
Art is a lie that makes
us realise truth.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.080
But just imagine where we'll
go when we bridge those two

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.240
cultures together.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.715
Because I really believe
food is us.

00:48:03.715 --> 00:48:07.550
And that's how we remember
our travels and our

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.530
family and who we are.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.370
And eating is the most
intimate way we

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:12.680
interact with our brain.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.938
So yeah, thank you.

00:48:14.938 --> 00:48:16.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:18.100
Wonderful.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:23.280
 

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.190
Thank you Caroline.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.570
I think that's a wonderful
illustration of just how art

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:31.520
and science can be not just
working side by side, but

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.980
genuinely interacting, where
each really benefits from the

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.580
contribution the other makes.

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:41.030
And that kind of reciprocal
working where we learn

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.500
something in the science from
Caroline's work and from the

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.140
experiments that she puts
people through.

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.630
But she's also using it to
create art and to create

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.170
experiences for people.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:54.760
I should also tell you that the
Proust phenomenon is one

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:59.160
of the big topics of another
AHRC-funded network, the

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.030
Memory Network.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.180
And I'm very much hoping you'll
come and join them and

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.300
talk more about Proust.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.820
But as we talk about different
cultures as you have, we're

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.830
crossing cultures because we are
having Charles Michel, a

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.220
trained chef, who's going to
tell us a little bit about his

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:17.640
adventures and also tell us why
the multi-sensory means so

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.570
much to him.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:19.820
Charles, welcome.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.500
 

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.200
So Barry likes a lot to talk
about my Colombian

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:27.990
nationality.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:29.482
I'm also French.

00:49:29.482 --> 00:49:32.470
But I think yeah, the Colombian
side is really

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.690
powerful in me and in
my inspirations.

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:42.110
So let me talk to you a bit
about my background as a cook.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.520
I studied at the Institut Paul
Bocuse, where I learned all

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:51.840
the basics of culinary
traditions, how with our hands

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.140
we could transform food into
delicious things to eat.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.230
So that was for two
years in Lyon.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:02.100
Then I went to dal Pescatore
in Italy, where you see, on

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.980
the far right, Nadia
Santini became my

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.330
master and my teacher.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:13.890
And she used to talk about how
it was not only about what was

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:17.720
happening in the dish, in the
recipe and the ingredients.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.230
It was also about transmitting
pleasure and

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.450
psychological wellness.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:26.180
She wanted people
to feel happy.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.330
She wanted to transmit joy.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:33.140
So that's what I saw in people
coming to the restaurant.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.230
And it was beautiful because
they were living this amazing

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:39.190
experience where they met this
family, Santini family, who

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:43.300
has been around since 1927,
these restaurants.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.900
Grandmother, Bruna, in the
middle, is still doing the

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:46.710
risotto today.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.120
So today, I mean today,
Wednesday.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.470
She's probably in the kitchen.

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:52.750
And she won't let anyone
touch her risotto.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:51:01.020
So it was beautiful to live
that experience and the

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:06.840
approach to traditions that they
had at dal Pescatore, the

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.260
wellness that they want to
transmit to their clients, the

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.070
culinary technique.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.350
Then I went back to Colombia.

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.030
Where here, I'm on a beach.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:21.830
I'm cooking on a beach with a
beautiful tradition bearer.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.680
She taught me there.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.840
We're cooking a lobster in some
kind of Colombian sauce

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.380
with coconut milk.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:31.950
So I had this beautiful
experience of re-knowing,

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:35.850
re-meeting my country, my
Colombian nationality through

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:37.090
its flavours.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.190
So at the same time, I was also
doing consultancy for

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:44.990
restaurants, teaching in cooking
schools and doing my

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:47.170
own events where I could also
play with all these

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:47.590
ingredients.

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:50.900
But Colombians weren't so keen
on their own ingredients.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.050
So I found that was
quite frustrating.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:58.110
Because I knew that a good dish
was about the technique

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.920
that I learned in France,
mainly, about the products and

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.850
the relationship to the quality
and the relationship

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.580
to the earth somehow,
and about passion.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.570
But I served this dish,
for example.

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:14.010
And if I told the name of that
dish to my clients in Columbia

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.360
they would say, no, no,
we don't want that.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:15.810
We don't want that.

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:16.690
That's no good.

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:19.880
It's Hogao, it's a
Colombian sauce,

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.260
traditional Colombian sauce.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.640
And they would say, no,
that's no good.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.270
Coconut milk?

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:24.180
No, we don't want that.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.630
Cook us some risotto.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:26.920
You know that.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.340
You've done it.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:29.380
I never did a risotto
before when I

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:30.390
came out of dal Pescatore.

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:33.440
But that's what they wanted
me to cook for them.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.410
So they were kind of blinded.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.930
And they wouldn't recognise
the beauty of Colombian

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:40.000
ingredients.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.580
So that led me to that
salad in particular.

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:50.800
So I was a bit frustrated that
I couldn't cook Colombian

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.630
traditions because they wouldn't
buy it, basically.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:59.932
So I got inspired by these
paintings by Kandinsky at the

00:52:59.932 --> 00:53:01.090
MOMA Museum.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:02.710
And I copied.

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:05.620
I transformed the aesthetic
message of

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.030
Kandinsky into a salad.

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:10.580
And there, Colombians
loved it.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.360
So that it was really
interesting.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.480
So Charles Spence was there
the first time I

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.290
prepared the salad.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:19.710
Because I wanted, sorry,
it was a tasting menu.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:22.940
And there was one dish
for each sense.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.560
So that was the visual sense.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.170
And it actually, we tested -

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.810
So now I'm here in England
doing research at the

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:34.330
Crossmodal Lab with
Charles Spence.

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:39.090
And we tested this dish in
three presentations.

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.120
One was this beautiful canvas.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.040
The other was just mixing up the
ingredients, placing it in

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.110
the middle of the plate.

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.810
The other one was just
the ingredients

00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:50.300
placed side by side.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:54.520
And the interesting thing was
that people liked more--

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.530
intuitively recognised--

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:58.480
the artistic presentation.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.610
They found it to be
more complex.

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:02.410
They liked it more.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:06.070
And when they tried it they
rated as being more flavorful

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.440
even though it was the exact
same quantity of the same

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.390
ingredients.

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:12.663
So that means either, well,
first of all, that we eat with

00:54:12.663 --> 00:54:13.210
our eyes first.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:18.570
And what we see or the
expectations we have determine

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.160
our flavour perception.

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.360
And also, that somehow
we can eat art.

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:31.340
So I go back to this beautiful
quote by Auguste Escoffier who

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:35.570
actually came to London and
became famous in London more

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:36.480
than 100 years ago.

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.070
So he said, "Culinary art,
by the form of its

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:42.050
manifestations, depends on the
psychological state of

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:44.670
society." And I think that's
really, really important.

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:47.840
Because the way we eat means a
lot, says a lot about the way

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.950
we relate to our planet
somehow and

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:52.910
to the other humans.

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:55.970
So what would be the
future of food?

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.790
I think that's a question
that we have to

00:54:57.790 --> 00:54:59.190
really focus on today.

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:04.560
And we have big challenges, like
being 20 billion humans

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.360
in a few decades, or
global warming.

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:13.470
And we know now that the way
we eat affects that.

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:17.300
So what's the future of food?

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.030
So I'm going to go to the next
slide, see this one.

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:23.370
What's the future of food?

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.760
So there's neurogastronomy,
beautiful tool that a few

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.420
scientists are going into
and the chefs are

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.800
getting inspired by that.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.010
How do we perceive food?

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.270
So we know flavour
is a perception

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:35.380
and not only a sensation.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:40.680
So a lot of chefs should stop
focusing on how technique or

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.830
how precise is their skill
to do the dish.

00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:47.030
And they should think about how
we perceive it actually,

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:49.210
how to play with sounds
and touch and

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:51.270
expectations in many ways.

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:58.600
So for example, Caroline says
she likes the fork on one

00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.650
particular side.

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:01.400
I don't like forks.

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.550
We have beautiful hands.

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:06.600
We've got a beautiful evolutive
tool that allows us

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.150
to sense what we eat.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:10.550
So I think that's one
of the things.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:13.710
If you have your hands cleaned
in a restaurant, for example,

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.510
and you eat with your hands
you're going to enjoy it more.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:19.050
You're going to integrate
the touch in a much more

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:19.860
pleasurable--

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:23.200
and you all, I think, we could
do research here and I bet

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.450
about 90% of you would say that
they really enjoy eating

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.360
with their hands.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.250
So that could be
neurogastronomy.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:35.730
There's gastrophysics, which is
understanding the molecular

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:39.480
and physical properties of the
food, but also how we perceive

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.590
them and how food also affects
our physiology.

00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:46.890
And there's also a lot of
beautiful molecules in food

00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:50.910
that can really excite
us, like spicy and

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.700
well, we'll see soon.

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.240
There's this beautiful
grasshopper there.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.080
I don't know if that gives you
a smile or a bit of disgust.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:03.710
And I think both
neurogastronomy, gastrophysics

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:07.930
can help us humans
eat more insects.

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.250
Well, start eating them
in the first place.

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:17.540
And I think our meat-based diets
today, the way we eat on

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.280
a daily basis in Western
countries is not sustainable.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.220
We know that.

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:21.760
We know that.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.630
And we have to change.

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:29.160
We have to find new ways of
doing a sustainable food for

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.300
humans, basically.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:35.440
So we need to find ways of
cooking that into a beautiful

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.640
shaped nugget, play with
the right expectations.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:42.700
And then a beautiful sauce, and
we'll be eating nuggets

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:46.710
that are 50% sustainable
source of protein.

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:49.940
And there's Biotech,
So GM foods, where

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.730
it's the devil today.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.100
But I've been to a few
talks in Oxford.

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.950
And that's what's cool about
being there, meeting a lot of

00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.420
people that have different
views and that know a lot

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.970
about the science underlying
those GM foods.

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:10.810
So I think what they say, is
that it's not a silver bullet.

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:13.770
It means that's not going
to save the world.

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:16.260
But it's definitely something
that we could use.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:18.360
For example, there's
Golden Rice.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:24.120
So they basically made his rice
that has vitamin A, which

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.770
is one of the causes, the
highest causes of death from

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:31.500
starvation is the deficit of
vitamin A. So why not?

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.900
I mean, we have to consider all
the options possible to

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.340
design the foods
of the future.

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.800
So I come back to this one.

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.750
A quote by the visionary,
Auguste Escoffier that is the

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:45.650
grandfather of today's
traditional cuisine.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:48.960
But he was much more of a
visionary than much of the

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.120
traditional chefs
today, I think.

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:56.340
So he said, "As flavours are
under constant refinement,

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.890
cooking is perpetually improving
to staisfy then it

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:02.840
will become more scientific and
more specific." Another

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.530
beautiful quote, "Cuisine has
to be the harmony that

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:09.420
reflects the wonders of the
Earth." I think that basically

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:14.360
says we have to have a good
relationship with nature

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:14.940
through food.

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:16.620
And I think there's a lot
of answers there.

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.670
 

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:23.780
Well, now I'm doing things,
research, Oxford stuff, as

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.070
Caroline says, doing
multi-sensory experiences, art

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:30.730
events involving food to make
people change their minds

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.140
about what they eat.

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.665
So that's it, thank you.

00:59:33.665 --> 00:59:41.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:45.080
Thank you Charles, that was
great to have a wider

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.850
perspective on what
we're doing.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.790
So you've seen, in these short
talks tonight, that we've been

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:55.050
hearing from a medieval
historian, from a

00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:57.450
neurogastronomist,
neuroscientist and

00:59:57.450 --> 01:00:01.540
psychologist, from a food
artist, and from a chef

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.710
researcher, myself,
as a philosopher.

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:09.280
And this is only a tiny number
of the people we'll need to

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.170
concentrate their work and
their ideas and their

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:15.660
collaboration together to
understand food and flavour.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.760
As a philosopher I'm very
interested in this question of

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.460
subjectivity and objectivity,
whether it's chefs that make

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:25.120
flavours or brains that
make flavours.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.083
But to get you to wonder about
that we're going to take you

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.160
now for the practical part.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.750
And we've heard this very nice
reminder we had from Charles

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:41.510
Michel and also earlier from
Caroline, that we've got

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.340
expectation leading
up to eating.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:48.190
And then, as Charles taught us,
an awful lot going on as

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.770
we're eating and an awful lot
of things influencing.

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:54.630
But then there's the memory of
eating, that remarkable bottle

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:58.530
of wine or that great meal
that you'll never forget.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:02.170
You'll remember who was there,
the colour of the wallpaper,

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:04.870
the sounds around you,
everything will be so vivid.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.570
So we're going to hope to
give you some memorable

01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:08.120
experiences.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.840
But now it's time for you to try
and to experiment and to

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.840
engage your senses with us.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.990
So we're going to give out
tasting menus to you.

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:21.040
Your tasting menus now will
have a number on them.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.220
And when you go out into the
hall look for the person who's

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.530
indicating your number.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.290
It'll be one or two or three
or four and six.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:31.320
And they will direct
you to the room.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.380
And you will have your tasting
menu in a certain order.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.800
We'll all be there
to talk to you.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.030
But we've got a few
minutes while the

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:38.560
menus are going around.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.040
If there were any questions, if
anybody would like to ask

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.220
anything of our speakers?

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.080
Yes?

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.770
We've got one here.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:48.175
Ian, please.

01:01:48.175 --> 01:01:49.765
I'm not sure who the
question's for.

01:01:49.765 --> 01:01:54.796
But I was just wondering
whether the impact of--

01:01:54.796 --> 01:01:55.238
is this on?

01:01:55.238 --> 01:01:56.310
It should be on.

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:57.270
Is it on?

01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:03.960
Whether the impact of how people
use food in the first

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.305
world as a tool for enjoyment
and going out, whether how

01:02:08.305 --> 01:02:12.410
people perceive taste differs
to, say maybe, where people

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:15.610
are, where food is just a thing
to keep them alive?

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:19.000
 

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:19.950
Charles?

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:23.750
I think Chris, in a historical
way, touched on that.

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:26.120
And maybe, Chris, I could invite
you to say something

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.582
about this?

01:02:27.582 --> 01:02:30.830
I think lots of people
enjoy food.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:34.130
I think there are all sorts
of elements of social

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:38.300
conditioning about how you enjoy
it, whether you should

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:42.970
enjoy it, with whom you
should enjoy it.

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:47.166
It's quite hard to
hang onto that

01:02:47.166 --> 01:02:48.890
sort of question directly.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:52.130
Because there's so many possible
contexts in which

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:56.740
food can be consumed and which
it can be prepared.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:01.145
There are, quite often, within a
society, different cuisines.

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:04.890
And if I was an anthropologist I
would expect to see an elite

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:08.470
cuisine with male chefs, if
you like, and a demotic

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:12.670
cuisine, perhaps run by the
women doing the cooking.

01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:16.250
But they provide different
philosophies really, for why

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:17.450
and how food is eaten.

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:19.750
So it's quite hard to see
a division between

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.080
one world and another.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.160
Because I suspect there are a
very great many experiences in

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.680
these different worlds.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.530
You might also expect that when
people are hungry, when

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:32.590
people are very close to
starvation, that if there is

01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:34.480
an edible and nutritious
source of food

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.170
around they'll eat it.

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:37.190
But there are parts of the world
where people are in that

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:39.910
condition and manioc is
locally available.

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:41.680
And they won't eat manioc.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.010
Whereas if you go to South
America, people will have it

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:46.330
as a food of choice.

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:47.750
They'll have it and
want to eat it.

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:51.170
So it's very interesting that
that discrimination of what

01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:52.860
you will find acceptable
or not still

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.570
remains even under extremes.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:55.701
Caroline?

01:03:55.701 --> 01:03:59.140
Yeah, I just wanted to say, or
add to that, that even when

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.480
you're hungry, I think
food is never just

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.310
reduced to pure nutrition.

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:06.250
And I went to Pakistan
into some camps.

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:12.000
And when people are very, very
hungry they even put more

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.720
emphasis on the eating
experience.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.280
And then so many fantastic
literature has been written

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.390
during wartime hunger years,
where people go on about the

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:23.450
absence of something.

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:26.220
I mean, often it's a very common
tool in literature.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.870
The absence of food, of
something is described by

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:32.900
describing the foods you had in
the plenty or longing, or

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.280
wishing for a certain food.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.450
So I think because obviously,
dealing with eating

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:39.250
experiences where there is a lot
of foods, like oh, you're

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.080
playing with food and people
are going hungry.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.250
How does that coincide?

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:49.920
But I think people always have
the right for eating

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.230
experience.

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:52.870
And food is so much more than
just nutrition, even when

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:53.465
people don't have any.

01:04:53.465 --> 01:04:54.950
Even when people are hungry.

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:56.780
One last question, I think
we have time for

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.260
here, in the middle.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:01.790
Different people have talked
about different conditions

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:04.960
under which eating
is taking place.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.870
Has anybody done anything
objectively with

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:10.190
regard to the brain?

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:16.740
For instance, doing functional
MRI studies?

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.980
Yes.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.460
Under all these different
sorts of eatings?

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.330
There is a lot of
study coming.

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:26.430
Certainly not as much as
you'd have on some

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:27.630
of the other senses.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:30.250
And part of the problem is that,
as you may know, when

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:34.630
you're in an MRI scanner and you
want to do FMRI you have

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.350
to keep very still.

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:37.440
So it's very difficult.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.970
If you've got them chewing
you're probably going to blur

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.340
those nice lovely pictures
where you see bits of the

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.215
brain lighting up.

01:05:43.215 --> 01:05:46.100
There have been two studies that
I'm very interested in

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:52.110
where they were studying
sommeliers identifying wines.

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:53.660
Now, it's a very uncomfortable
experience.

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:54.510
You're lying on your back.

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:56.650
You have a tube inserted
into your mouth.

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:57.850
And its directing liquid.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:06:00.210
And you're told just to let the
liquid go in and try not

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:02.150
to do too much swallowing.

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:07.120
Nonetheless, nonetheless, under
those conditions the

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.050
results are very interesting.

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:11.660
Because they answered the
following questions--

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:17.410
who do you think uses more of
their cortical regions?

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:19.980
Who uses more of the brain
when they're trying to

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.490
identify a wine?

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:24.380
The expert or the novice?

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.630
Any guesses?

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.500
 

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.970
So it's the expert who uses less
of the brain because they

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:32.170
know exactly what to use.

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.370
And the rest of us, maybe
trying to use everything

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:36.100
that's in our field.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:40.360
Second question, how much of the
brain is active in either

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:44.120
the expert or the novice
when tasting water?

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.760
And the answer is huge amounts
in the expert.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.370
Even when they're tasting water
they can't turn off that

01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:52.250
capacity to evaluate
and assess.

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:55.130
And the final question that
some of this research

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:58.490
addresses is who gets
most pleasure, the

01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:02.910
sommelier or the novice?

01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:03.950
The novice?

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:06.960
It's the sommelier.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.080
And that's why we do the
science, because the answers

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.090
are surprising.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:14.380
So yes, there is
some FMRI done.

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.910
Thank you all very much.

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:17.596
Let's go and taste.

01:07:17.596 --> 01:07:21.068
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:21.068 --> 01:07:31.980

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:52.880
 

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.300
That was absolutely amazing.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.710
I was not expecting that.

01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:01.530
If anybody told me I tasted
through my nose I would have

01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:03.220
told them that they were
probably tasting through

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.260
somewhere else.
