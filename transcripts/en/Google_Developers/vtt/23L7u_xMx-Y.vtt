VIVIAN CROMWELL: Welcome to the
second episode of Women

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.190
Techmakers.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.410
So we first started Women
Techmakers around Google I/O

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.340
back in May.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.540
It was so well-received, so
we decided to bring back a

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.620
week-long series of five amazing
and fabulous woman to

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.680
talk about their experience
in the tech industry.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.730
So today we have a special
guest, Mary Lou Jepsen.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.550
Before we get started, let me
quickly introduce myself.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.460
So I head up our global Chrome
developer relations team.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.230
So our mission is to teach
web developers how to

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.680
build great web apps.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.170
So it has been great experience
working on the most

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.900
amazing products with the
most amazing people.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.450
So I'm joined by Jean.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.270
JEAN WANG: Hi, everybody.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.770
My name is Jean Wang.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.510
I'm a lead hardware engineer
at Google X Project Class.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.680
And excuse me today for not
wearing my Glass device, it's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.250
currently charging.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.620
And I'm really excited to have
Mary Lou with us here today.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.170
She has spearheaded a number
of display technologies,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.000
including microdisplay, which
is actually near and dear to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.450
our hearts at Google
X as well.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.980
Mary Lou, would you like
to introduce yourself?

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.040
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Sure.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.240
I'm Mary Lou Jepsen.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.640
And I just want to
correct, I think

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.100
there's 15 amazing women.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.310
So you guys, all the amazing
hardware people at Google and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.650
software and technology
people at Google.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.270
So thank you for inviting me.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.330
I'm big fans of yours.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.790
My background, I'm the founder
and CEO of a company called

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.160
Pixel Qi, which is a spin-out
of a previous organization I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.640
co-founded with Nicholas
Negroponte called One Laptop

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.330
per Child where I architected
the $100 laptop.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.760
And it turns out that there was
a lot of great technology

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.020
in that laptop.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.880
It wasn't just a cheap laptop,
so much so that the CEOs of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.420
some of the big device makers of
the world really wanted the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.450
low power management and screen
architectures that I

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.710
had developed for this thing,
the $100 laptop.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.930
And so I spun out and I created
a for-profit company

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.190
called Pixel Qi where we've now
shipped about 3 million

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.310
different units across using the
excess fab capacity of the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.470
world's LCD fabs to create
really innovative screen

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.990
architecture that's
really low power.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.570
Before that, I founded a
microdisplay company and I was

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.750
a professor at MIT for a
while, and so forth.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.870
JEAN WANG: Can you talk a bit
more about that evolution and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.900
trajectory in your professional
life and how it's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.370
gotten to where you are
today with Pixel Qi?

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.050
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Ah, sure.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.630
I really liked art and
I really liked math.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.570
And it turned out that met with
some push from my parents

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.440
to be an electrical engineering
major because they

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.700
wanted me to be able to get
a job when I graduated.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.970
The deal was they would help
me pay for college

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.550
if I got an EE degree.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.080
But I found the first couple
of years of EE pretty

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.620
stifling, like if I had
any creativity it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.670
would've crushed it.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.160
So to sort of maintain my
sanity, I kept my art going

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.110
and got pretty much
a degree in art as

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.400
well at the same time.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.170
And that combined itself for
me, first, in holography.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.740
I started doing 3D things with
lasers and stuff, and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.240
holographic video, and just
different display

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.980
technologies.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.080
So I just really liked doing a
technically really hard puzzle

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.920
and kind of the reward is this
beautiful image at the end.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.284
So that's what I do now.

00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:34.666
JEAN WANG: Great.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.690
Can you talk a bit about the
current state of the hardware

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.980
industry in terms of
the display and

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.720
where you see it going.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.690
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yeah, it's
really interesting.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.620
Trauma is a nice
way to put it.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.610
I mean right now there's not
a single profitable display

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.610
manufacturer in the world.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.660
They're running at negative
20% margin.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.350
They have been for a
number of years.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.490
I think Sharp just forecasted
they're going to lose $6

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.460
billion, Panasonic worse,
nearly $10 billion.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.490
Negative 20% margin
for a number of

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.740
years is hard to maintain.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.610
It's actually geopolitical.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.280
China's building up more
manufacturing capacity and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.770
there's just excess capacity.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.040
So there's that.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.810
And then in the device space,
Apple and Samsung have

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.980
executed very, very well,
as I think, duh,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.260
everybody knows that.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.350
What maybe doesn't sort of
make the stage as sort of

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.790
pronounced is that everybody
else, HP, Dell, Nokia, RIM,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.530
Asus, Acer are running at nearly
just about break-even.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.290
And a lot of R and D
has been slashed.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.490
And so, there is just very
few innovative--

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.100
you're doing one of the most
innovative hardware programs

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.340
on the planet yourself--

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.870
but there's just very, very
little of that today.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.910
I think Andreessen says software
eats the world.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.400
That's great, but it still has
to run on something, and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.490
there's still this device.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.340
And if it's all Apple something,
god help us because

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.780
they're going to control the
whole stream of data.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.340
We need, I think, more
diversity, and we're

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.010
searching for that.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.040
I like Apple products,
I like all of them.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.120
But I just think it's more
interesting if there was more

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.300
than just two companies
shipping

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.890
devices in huge volumes.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.880
JEAN WANG: So how is Pixel Qi
and how are you doing your

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.370
part to try to make the display
industry profitable?

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.170
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Well, even when
I designed this thing,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.570
the reason I created a new
screen was cost, but it was

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.500
also power.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.420
In the developing world,
kids don't have power

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.240
outlets in the wall.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.810
Or if they do, they're
not on all the time.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.800
So this is a 1 watt laptop.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.600
The next laptop up is
about 10 watts.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.220
And that comes from a lot
of the power management

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.360
architecture that we created.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.430
So what are we doing is
continuing that march down in

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.270
a world where, since I made
this, the power consumption of

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.930
screens has quadrupled in the
last three to four years.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.050
This is in a world where Intel
will respin a chip to save 10

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.810
milliwatts, Qualcomm will fight
about microwatts, and

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.290
the screen power consumption
has gone up like 5 watts.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.460
If you look at like an iPad 3,
Apple's, sort of one of their

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.270
flagship products, it's a 9 watt
machine, 8 watts of that

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.780
is taken by the screen.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.130
So what we figured out how to do
is how to basically take 7

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.090
watts out of that, not 7
milliwatts, not 7 microwatts,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.820
7 watts, while maintaining the
front-of-screen performance,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.460
including the resolution and so
forth, viewing angle, color

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.850
saturation, contrast,
and all of that.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.020
So that's our next generation
architecture.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.470
But we've done that by building
up starting with this

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.600
screen in here that's sunlight
readable and really working on

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.080
basically what I call small
aperture pixels.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.720
As you increase the screen
resolution, if the transistor

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.380
stays the same size, it
takes up more and more

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.270
of the pixel area.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.210
That means the light from the
backlight gets blocked and

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.110
can't get through.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.320
And so you've got to crank up
that backlight and you've got

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.540
to power all those
extra pixels.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.230
Power is a huge deal.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.440
Maybe it's not even power,
it's thermal management.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.290
It's what do you do
with the heat.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.810
You can use the best batteries
you want, but even still the

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.690
iPad 3 is overheating.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.690
There's the thermal budget.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.450
And so if the pixels are
getting smaller and the

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.220
transistors stay the same size
and you crank it up, all that

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.130
power goes to the screen
rather than a zippier

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.850
processor, multitasking, being
able to beam video around,

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.650
being able to beam video to the
Google Glass, whatever.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.930
You can use power for a lot of
different things if the screen

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.740
isn't hogging it.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.120
So we're working on
that problem.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.160
And what we've done is over the
last eight years increased

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.960
the front-of-screen
performance.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.630
So now we can match that of
OLED, or any of the Android

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.585
screens, or Motorola.

00:07:57.585 --> 00:08:02.690
I don't mean to just pick on
Apple, but at a competitive

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.990
screen performance, including
the contrast, color, viewing

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.340
angle, resolution,
and so forth.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.360
So that's what we've
been doing.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.451
VIVIAN CROMWELL: Is One Laptop
per Child, the laptop, it's

00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:14.710
also [? convenient ?] to improve
the screen display?

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.094
Because I know I read
recently they also

00:08:17.094 --> 00:08:18.900
started having tablets.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.380
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yes, so
we're designing the

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.600
screen for the tablet.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.310
And we have improved
the front-of-screen

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.980
performance of this.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.645
Oh, I just turned it off.

00:08:26.645 --> 00:08:28.680
I'll turn it back on.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.370
But you can see, and I brought
a big flashlight to show you.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.570
But yeah, so One Laptop per
Child, I developed the screen

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.530
for it and we continue
to support them.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.750
When I created Pixel Qi, it was
a spin-off from a hardware

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.730
charity, a nonprofit.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.480
And so we did a cross-licensing
deal where we

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.520
get the IP and all the patent
stuff from One Laptop per

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.230
Child to use, to continue to
develop, and we give them

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.650
access to all of our IP that
we invent forever for their

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.800
nonprofit humanitarian goals.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.810
So we still support them also
with finding vendors and

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.290
things especially in Asia.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.460
I spend most of my
time in Asia.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:13.770
JEAN WANG: It's really
impressive

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.450
about the power savings.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.560
Can you talk about that
discovery process and how you

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.760
invent these new architectures
to achieve the savings?

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.286
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Ah, yeah,
how did it invent?

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.640
If you think of this, I've
got it back up and I

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.856
can show you that.

00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:38.360
Actually, I've got
a big flashlight.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.780
This is the brightest flashlight
on the planet that

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.420
you can carry on a plane.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.440
And so you can see it's
sunlight readable.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.620
And so it came from sort
of thinking about

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.430
really wanting E Ink.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.130
And that's like compared to my
supposedly sunlight readable

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.763
Nokia Lumia phone.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:09.240
This one, how do you invent in
general is you throw a lot of

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.910
ideas and see what sticks, I
think, and work through.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.190
And I just think about
it all the time.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.290
I can't sleep, I wake up.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.750
In this case, the kids had to
get their laptops, how are you

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.480
going to solve it?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.450
Oh my gosh.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.830
It was like falling in love
almost, complete with not

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.340
being able to sleep past 3:00
in the morning and waking up

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:35.410
and thinking, how am I going
to do it, how do we do it?

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.170
But the progression of this
screen to our next screens and

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.880
our next screens came from sort
of a point of discovery.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.380
We figured out how to make a
really good small aperture

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.720
screen because we wanted to
use most of the pixel to

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.450
reflect the light.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.130
Like why fight the sun,
why not use it?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.730
So we developed an architecture
where we could

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.870
hide a lot of circuitry
underneath those mirrors.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.340
We got rid of one layer in the
top substrate and added a

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.290
layer to the bottom substrate.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.030
And it wasn't obvious to me that
that could make a large

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.780
difference in where other screen
technology was going.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:19.560
But we've actually created a
lot of different IP around

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.840
that idea to solve a lot of our
customers' problems and a

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.730
lot of the problems that
we want to solve as

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.770
we invent new screens.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.980
I guess I'm not really answering
the question though.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.660
Like how do you invent?

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.480
I don't know.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.040
I just like noodling
on problems.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.100
JEAN WANG: I think some of it's,
of course, you do it off

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.410
on your own when you're
sleeping, perhaps dreaming

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.170
about it, or just having
lunch by yourself.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.010
And oftentimes, you just have
brainstorms with people that

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.230
you work with and from
diverse perspectives.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.695
So optics team, plus the product
design team, plus the

00:11:49.695 --> 00:11:52.005
EE team getting together in one
room with manufacturing

00:11:52.005 --> 00:11:54.830
and just figuring out what are
the key issues that we have

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.360
currently and what can we
do to attack it from a

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.932
perspective we never
thought of before.

00:11:59.932 --> 00:12:01.670
So there is some of that.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.490
MARY LOU JEPSEN: I also like
the hard criticism.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.550
I find out more about that when
people tell me the things

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.360
they don't like about what I
did, how come you didn't,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.540
especially if it's
something new.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.370
And sometimes they will tell
you that to your face.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.350
You know, Vinod Khosla has said
his Twitter stream is

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.180
very valuable for finding
out what people

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.410
really think about him.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.400
They'll post it in blogs and
different things sometimes.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.190
Because it's just grown so
much, every little nit,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.760
people, you have fanboys too
even for Pixel Qi, and they

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.120
say what they like and what
they're frustrated with.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.880
And when I hear their
frustrations, I think, huh,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.420
how can we fix that or the
intersection of things.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.900
But yeah, sometimes I just dream
about it, and wake up,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.800
and it's solved, yes.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.780
JEAN WANG: It's a nice case.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.960
It [INAUDIBLE] happens
all the time.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.470
So all these things are great
advantages for technology, are

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.550
there any disadvantages that
you can share with us?

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.940
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Disadvantages,
I suppose, for

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:06.750
me, the big sacrifices I've made
are just basically living

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.670
on a plane and giving
up having a life.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.375
When you start a company, when
we started One Laptop per

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:17.700
Child, forget about kind of
friends, family, all of that.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.580
So those are the sacrifices that
it seems to take because

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.860
you have to work on other
people's schedules.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.480
And the time zone thing is so
great and the travel time is

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.580
so great that it's pretty hard
to figure out when the factory

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.840
is going to be down in advance,
because you have to

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.860
be there immediately if
there's an issue.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.340
I suppose disadvantages of our
technology, today we've sort

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.070
of started with lower
front-of-screen performance on

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.200
some level, although
it's more readable.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.350
Which should matter because
books may disappear, but

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.750
reading is not probably going
to disappear any time soon.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:04.630
But Apple communicates with
its customers very well.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.270
So whatever Apple says matters,
that's what matters.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.610
Didn't used to be important to
be able to read a screen like

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.160
that, but now it is because
Apple said it was.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.280
So we all have to do that.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.440
I'm really grateful that Apple,
a lot of us in the

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.590
display community and hardware
community for a long time

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.040
wanted higher resolution.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.760
And I always spent the $500
extra to buy something with

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.510
high resolution.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.530
But now Apple has communicated
effectively to its customers

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.050
that resolution matters,
so everybody

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.100
knows resolution matters.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:40.450
So it's a world where a single
company calls the shots.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.960
And the entire industry has
slashed its R and D for the

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.210
past few years and is living
at negative 20% margin.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.710
So it's interesting to work
inside of that because we

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.580
started during the
economic crisis.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.020
So we've developed some pretty
interesting R and D. You guys

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.245
clearly have there.

00:14:58.245 --> 00:15:02.140
But there just aren't that
many efforts like that.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.500
You see the big software
players, Microsoft coming out

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:12.950
with hardware, Amazon, Android,
Facebook entering

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.570
because they're frustrated.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.050
They can't just continue to let
Apple eat their breakfast,

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.290
lunch, and dinner.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:24.510
Dell, HP, Nokia they all
misstepped or Apple executed

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.980
well, but it doesn't matter.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.630
You see people filling
in for that.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:34.120
But it's been walking
through the

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.290
valley of death or something.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.461
It feels a lot like that through
this period of time.

00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:42.225
VIVIAN CROMWELL: What is
your take on Amazon?

00:15:42.225 --> 00:15:43.956
Do you think they're doing
pretty well in

00:15:43.956 --> 00:15:45.290
terms of those devices?

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.540
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yeah, I mean
there's an example where

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.540
screen technology
really mattered.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.850
Sony took on E-ink first, but
didn't get the content.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.760
Sony, of all people, couldn't
get the content.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.905
But Amazon got the content and
was able to create, really

00:16:02.905 --> 00:16:08.900
spur, catalyze, execute on the
e-book reader, the e-reader

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.950
revolution five years ago now.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.260
And now it's come out
with other things.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.670
They're building
out more space.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.170
There's something like
1,200 people working

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.890
on different things.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.480
And there's a lot of rumors that
they're coming out with

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.000
other sets of devices.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.140
They've certainly been hiring.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.810
It's exciting, I think.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.840
It's very exciting.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.130
What does Eric Schmidt call
it, the Gang of Four.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.585
I don't think that you guys
actually gang together though,

00:16:39.585 --> 00:16:42.390
it's sort of more competition
of four

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.260
giant companies really.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.385
It seems to be the current
landscape.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.220
And I don't know, what's
your view?

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.580
VIVIAN CROMWELL: I'm more on
the software side of the

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:58.930
[? scene. ?]

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:04.730
So it's just like a lot of
continuous innovation.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.690
I mean, for us, like Chrome, we
have Chromebooks and so on,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:12.339
just like filling a market where
people, in addition to

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.430
meeting the [? tablets, ?]

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.920
which is always on the go, or
having a laptop being able to

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.310
do development or other
kinds of tasks.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.260
Like I found a place in my
kitchen, I use my Chromebook

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.349
when I'm doing the cooking.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.720
So I'm finding the places for
all these different devices.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.010
MARY LOU JEPSEN: And can
you spill on it?

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.850
That's OK.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.030
Yeah, for cooking it's been a
dream for a long time that

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.280
always failed, was the
cooking menu device.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.455
So maybe this is it.

00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:46.362
But it's an issue.

00:17:46.362 --> 00:17:49.210
JEAN WANG: Well hopefully
with Glass you can

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.900
use Glass for cooking.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.130
MARY LOU JEPSEN: We're looking
at a world in 2020 where the

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.530
estimates are there will be
10 devices per person.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.540
And so the charging gets
to be an issue

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.550
because all of the adapters.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.090
And sure, there's the inductive
charging, but that's

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.360
not very efficient.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.340
And it'd be nicer, I think, the
reason I work so hard is I

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.820
believe we have to get a world
of self-powered devices.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.610
Where you have to lower, just
like Intel does, or Qualcomm,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.490
or any chip maker, in the screen
and everything, the

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.130
power is so low so that it
becomes like a calculator, a

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.320
small little solar
cell is enough to

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.080
power the whole thing.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.730
And I think that we
can get there.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.820
Solar cells have gotten
a lot better.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.570
But the screen power consumption
now takes 90% of

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.840
the battery.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.860
It's only a small exaggeration
to say the battery in a device

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.830
is there to power the screen.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:51.460
And so, I think that that
will open up what

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.650
we can do with things.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:58.500
But take it further, why can't
we exhale the device, or spray

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.940
paint it on the wall and peel
it off and eat it, or

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.700
whatever, tattoo it
on our bodies.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.982
VIVIAN CROMWELL: A watch.

00:19:04.982 --> 00:19:06.010
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Certainly
the health care

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.140
devices that will come.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:13.570
There's some merger of
mind and device.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.660
You're right there on
the head, I'm sure.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.900
You probably can't
talk about it.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.410
JEAN WANG: Yeah, power is a
definite concern for Glass.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.650
And to be able to use the device
all day is something

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.360
that we think seriously about.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.980
And so anything we could to do
to reduce the power from the

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.880
display point of view, or even
the electronics, the audio

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.520
system that we have, all
of that is extremely

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.060
important to work on.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.430
And we're always on the lookout,
not just as a big

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.930
company, but looking at small
companies and innovations

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.970
there for technology
improvement, for battery

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.270
technology, and electronics.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.390
What is the [INAUDIBLE] thing
we can do to achieve a great

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.680
user experience?

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.290
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Right.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.520
And the battery technology
is getting better

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.430
at about 10% a year.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.300
Maybe there's some breakthrough
stuff.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.700
There's some very interesting
companies.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.300
And that's good.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.030
But also there's the
charge time.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.950
And so if the device takes more
power because it's got a

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.420
better innovative battery,
there's still the charge time

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.300
to the battery.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.430
And it's great because we can
use our mini USB adapters on

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.355
most things, but that really
limits the charge time.

00:20:19.355 --> 00:20:20.300
It's only 5 volts.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:25.100
And so it takes six,
seven hours to

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.140
charge a typical tablet.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.780
In fact, the Motorola Xoom
tablet charges faster, which

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.100
is why OLPC used it for a
deployment in Ethiopia,

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.640
because it's got a 12 volt
special adapter so it can

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.890
charge twice as fast.

00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:44.270
Can we just make it so that
they can self power?

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.130
If you're walking around, why
isn't that enough to charge it

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.055
or a little bit of light?

00:20:48.055 --> 00:20:50.430
Can we get it down
to that low?

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.430
And I think it's certainly
possible.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.390
It's very key in a lot of the
developing world where there

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:59.020
isn't steady ready access
to electricity.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.850
You could say, well,
that will change.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.210
Infrastructure will be developed
if you wait 10

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.040
years, 20 years.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.510
But some places it's hard to go
there and actually believe

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.710
that everybody will have ready
access to electricity.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.710
Because then you actually have
to think about the global

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:22.650
warming issues and sort of how
much of our electronics are

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.060
now the footprint of
our energy usage.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.880
In homes it used to be it was
the refrigerator that was the

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.950
most power hungry thing,
now it's the TV.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:36.720
And it's 10% of the power use
in a home is electronics.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.490
And as we get more electronics,
that goes up.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.040
So there's this whole green
level to it, which people

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.690
don't think of in the first
level because you're focused

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.350
on transportation being
one of the key things.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.430
But it's also just more
convenient if you don't have

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.640
to power this stuff up.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.250
So consumers can vote.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:22:01.020
But there's certainly places
where we're not really able to

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.170
compete with Apple or Samsung.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.520
If they only spent 10 times
what we did, we could.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.640
But they spend 1,000
times what we do.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.100
They spend billions and
we spend millions.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.590
So we actually have a nice
niche in our company.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.580
We serve 130 million people that
can't buy normal products

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.020
from Apple, Samsung,
or other vendors

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.850
because they work outside.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.150
Construction workers, military,
cops, meter maids,

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.290
truck drivers, they
all need stuff.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.430
So we have stuff like this.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.200
It's kind of a brick.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.130
But you can throw it on the
ground and it works or

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.530
whatever, spill on it.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.870
And it's fine.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.050
But you can dunk and
different things.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.730
It says activate Windows now.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.320
And it's sunlight readable.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.410
I can even stand on it
if you want to see.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.720
VIVIAN CROMWELL: What is the
special usage of this device?

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.440
Is it for the truck driver?

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.710
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Actually,
this is a new

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.640
product from Trimble.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.780
And they actually have
the surveyors of the

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.480
world, which are huge.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.810
They've got like 73%
of that market.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.590
So it's actually data input.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.300
There's even this in the back.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.940
But, yeah, I mean you can use it
for anything that you need

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:18.480
to be outside.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.320
If it's getting mud on it, if
someone will roll over it, you

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.850
need the ruggedness.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.880
And you need to be able
to see it outside

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.880
for it to be useful.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.580
The truth is, if we all
stayed inside all the

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.490
time, it would be OK.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.970
But in reality, people
go outside.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.530
Most of us go outside
every day.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.400
We use our cell phones
outside.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.930
We use digital cameras
outside.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.510
You can't even tell if your
grandmother is smiling when

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.710
you take a picture of her--
she may not be around that

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.320
much longer--

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.130
with all of today's devices
because you

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.780
can't see them outside.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.670
So we're doing specialty
stuff for professional

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.570
photographers.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.330
But we believe that people
will care about that, and

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.960
power, and readability.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:10.300
It's difficult in an
industry that is

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.530
struggling like it is now.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:17.010
So we persevere and we're pretty
happy about having this

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.580
large niche.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.550
We go profitable
on this niche.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.930
But our big ambition is to
make innovative screens.

00:24:29.566 --> 00:24:32.860
In the year 2000 maybe, let's
call it 10 million laptops

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.420
shipped that year.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.890
There were tablets
that shipped.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.790
Apple didn't invent
the tablet.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.810
But it's much smaller numbers.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.170
And so the volume that you
needed to achieve on a new

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.760
product was relatively small.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.890
Fast forward to today where
you've got 250 million, 300

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.375
million laptops, same amount
of desktops, 1

00:24:50.375 --> 00:24:51.980
billion cell phones.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.020
When you start mass production,
you have to be

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.890
able to go to a million
units a month.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.810
That means you have to
use existing factory

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.080
infrastructure or build your
own factory, which costs a

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.320
couple billion dollars.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.140
If you spend a couple billion
dollars to build a factory,

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.350
you've got to amortize that over
the output for, whatever,

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.430
five years.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.410
That's what Qualcomm did.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:14.470
They were basically wrapping a
$100 to $500 bill around every

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.070
product they shipped as a
gift to the customer.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:22.300
And so what we noticed is that
it's a moment, it seems to be,

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:28.150
in the display industry where
it's a lot like 25 years ago

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.310
in silicon where there were all
these different types of

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.380
silicon processes.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.060
There was CMOS, which
won, silicon on

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.340
sapphire, gallium arsenide.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.400
And CMOS got good enough, it
wasn't the best, but it got

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.480
good enough and the processes
reliable enough where more of

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.540
those factories were made.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:49.250
And people could basically
design a chip in software and

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.150
send the file to the
manufacturer

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.570
and back came a chip.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.100
So we think it's that moment
in the display industry.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.450
We're the only fabless LCD
company in the world.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.980
We're the only external team
that's ever gotten-- they

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.460
still call it tape out, that's
how old the nomenclature is,

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.640
back when you had computer
tapes-- that has gotten to

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.930
tape out into the big factories
of the world.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.600
Not even Apple gets that and
they get everything, for good

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.520
reason mind you.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.670
But we've been doing that and
basically using as-is the

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.560
factory process, Windows
processes, the materials that

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.760
are allowed in the fab, and
re-architecting every single

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.410
layer, the liquid crystal, how
we drive it, how we create

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.030
structures.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.880
Because basically we're
playing with layers

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.110
of metal and oxide.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.950
Oxide, another word for
that's glass, right?

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:44.250
And metal is a conductor and
oxide is an insulator, but

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.390
metal is also a reflector.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.050
And oxide is, well, glasses
are made out,

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.080
there's lenses, right?

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.710
And so you have to think of
shapes that can be both a

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:58.550
transistor shape or a line shape
and have good electron

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:03.370
mobility, while playing a double
role to bounce the

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.990
light where you want the light
to go and in the way that you

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.530
want it to go.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.090
And it's pretty fun.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.120
It's a very analog process.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.520
We work a lot on like
a small pixel, a 100

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.570
micron square pixel.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:15.720
Then we make millions of them.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.080
We copy it when we
nail that pixel.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:24.180
And that's really what we are
trying to do in a world where

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:29.710
97% of all screens are liquid
crystal displays using thin

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.320
film transistors.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.240
There are some other movements
in the industry.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.520
You're leading a fantastic one,
love LCOS or any of the

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.110
microdisplay technologies.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.720
That's single crystal silicon
and you can do so much more in

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.330
the backplane.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.730
And that's actually where
we came from.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:50.240
A lot of the people in the
company I have now I started

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.145
working with in the mid '90s
when we started microdisplays.

00:27:54.145 --> 00:27:56.210
And there was a big microdisplay
effort.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.360
It was thought that
that was going to

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.510
beat direct-view HDTV.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.660
We lost, LCD won.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.780
But we were developing
incredible innovation in the

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.860
backplane because we had single
crystal silicon, we

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.800
could tape it out to those CMOS
fabs, back would come the

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.200
chip, and we could smear the
liquid crystals on them.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.320
I had a factory in Richmond,
California with high school

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.300
kids working in it where we'd
actually crank out 20,000

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.850
units a month or so into
head-mounted displays, and

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:31.470
wristwatch video, and stuff
like that in the '90s.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.000
Unfortunately, nobody bought the
head-mounted displays, so

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.930
we pivoted to HDTV and lost.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.690
But what happened was there was
this sensibility that was

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.860
developed of architecture,
I think, more from that

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:52.920
background than the people,
primarily in Asia, who figured

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.780
out how to do high volume,
low cost manufacturing.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:01.190
Basically hang a big picture
window TV on the wall.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.090
That was a dream for 20 years.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:09.700
It now costs $200 to
make a 42 inch TV.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.430
So given that that's the factory
infrastructure that we

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.710
have, how do we use it to do
something more interesting?

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.740
Not everything has to just
be a little TV, right?

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.930
We need screens.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.920
The world's information is
digital, the way we access

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.420
that information is through
the screen.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.600
And that's why I'm quite
fascinated by the work that

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.250
you're doing.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.790
What can that be?

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.760
And I think part of it is you
can't even get there until you

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.590
solve the power problem because
as you make these

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:45.200
better screens the power just
goes through the roof.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.470
Long answer, sorry.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.500
VIVIAN CROMWELL: I have a
slightly unrelated question.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.930
I'm just kind of curious.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.630
I noticed the company
name is Pixel Qi.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.360
And I'm Chinese so I
can read Chinese.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.820
So I realize that Qi actually
means air in Chinese.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.170
I'm kind of wondering if there's
any special story

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.460
behind the name of
the company.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.620
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yeah, sure.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.020
Basically I've spent a lot of
time doing hardware as has

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.575
been well publicized,
it's Election

00:30:12.575 --> 00:30:14.780
Day, through the election.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.380
We lost our manufacturing
infrastructure in the West.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.720
It's moved to Asia.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.400
So if you do hardware, I
spend a lot of time.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.320
And people, when I visit a
company, they'll give me the

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.230
English name of the company and
the English address, which

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.730
is completely useless.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:32.860
Pick your country, it's
completely useless in Japan,

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.600
Korea, Taiwan, China.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.450
I learned some.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.840
I'm not as good as you, but
I've learned some Chinese.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:47.140
And I like the idea
of the display is

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.430
really what's alive.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:53.930
It's the Confucius belief that
sort of panned most of Asia of

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.600
a life force in an
inanimate object.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.820
Because the screens
are kind of alive.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.270
And then also I just wanted to
a company name that was the

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.620
same in every language.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.240
Qi is called chi in Japanese
and kwi in Taiwanese.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.360
But the symbol is the same,
which is steam rising over

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.640
rice, right?

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.310
The idea that rice is kind of
alive, it's got steam in it.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.661
VIVIAN CROMWELL: We also kind of
have a meaning like air is

00:31:21.661 --> 00:31:24.830
sort of very fundamental to
everything so you're kind of

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.650
using the natural resources.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.140
That's my using interpretation
of the story.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.820
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Also, I learned
later that it also

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.670
means something in kung fu,
kind of like an anger.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.660
And I thought, oh no,
we called the

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.700
company the angry pixel.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.660
Maybe that would be OK.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.855
But people say it's OK.

00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:44.193
VIVIAN CROMWELL: That's
very neat.

00:31:44.193 --> 00:31:45.060
JEAN WANG: Yeah, it's great.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.580
MARY LOU JEPSEN: And the
website was available.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.790
JEAN WANG: So you have this
great combination of

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:54.370
technologies expertise as well
as business acumen and skills.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.300
Can you talk a bit more about
the business side of things,

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.330
and how you've been able to
establish manufacturing

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:02.850
capability by working with these
Taiwanese manufacturers,

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.910
and how that was established and
how you continued to grow.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.165
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yeah,
that was really hard.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.520
What makes me a little bit
jealous of software is

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.990
software people don't have
to get permission.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.070
And in order with these
factories and get these

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.390
resources, you have
to get permission.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.830
So you have to learn how
to get permission.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:28.010
And I'm a woman in Asia.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:33.270
Like basically, they
remember me.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.470
They think whatever I'm saying
is a joke, it'll never work.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.660
It used to be for the $100
laptop, they just thought it

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.070
was so funny, they would take
the meeting because it was the

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.900
humor portion of their day.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:48.345
The CEO of Samsung flanked by
four VPs on one side and four

00:32:48.345 --> 00:32:51.270
VPs on the other side and little
old me on the other

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.245
side of the room explaining
my new architecture

00:32:53.245 --> 00:32:54.880
and the $100 laptop.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.220
And they just thought
it was so funny.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.740
And they'd point out all the
reasons it wouldn't work.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.760
And then I realized, ha, this is
great, they're helping with

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.720
the design.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.080
So I'd write all these
things down.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.400
I'd say, we've got some answers
on these, but these

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.610
ones, they're really
good points.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:13.590
So thank you for helping, and
if we can get answers that

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.965
hold water here, can I come back
to you in a few months?

00:33:15.965 --> 00:33:18.540
And they'd say, sure.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:24.000
And I realized that by doing
that, they actually really

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.100
wanted to help.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.975
With the $100 laptop the cause
was worthy, transform poor

00:33:28.975 --> 00:33:30.630
kids in the developing
world, everybody's

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.030
pretty much for that.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.010
Particularly a lot of the
executives in Asia who many of

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.830
them grew up poor and how
computing changed their lives

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.010
and believe deeply and
profoundly in how it can

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.260
change other people's lives.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:50.030
I worked in Asia for a long
time, but through that project

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.290
I was the co-founder,
I was leading.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:56.300
Rather than building a factory
in California, I was leading,

00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:02.000
trying to get their resources,
and was finally able to.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.520
And they remember me, they
underestimate me, but then

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.820
when you go back, they say, oh
yeah, you're the one I thought

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.989
was a nut last time, what are
you're doing this time?

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:13.030
It's probably fun too
and a little nutty.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:17.560
And so you go with that and
you just try to put this

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.770
incredible solid structure under
this thing that looks

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:22.810
like a nutty idea.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:29.520
Because even in cultures where
they say, whatever, Japan, the

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.489
nail that sticks up gets
hammered down is an

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:33.850
expression, they still like
to break the rules.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.690
They do.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.469
Everybody wants to do,
in technology,

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.139
like the next thing.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.800
And if you have to develop
that solid structure

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.580
underneath.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.630
The reason I lived there, I
spent so much of my time there

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.650
is during this crisis I started
Pixel Qi in 2008.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.449
I got my first term sheet the
week Lehman Brothers went out

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:53.860
of business.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.780
The VC that gave it to
us didn't execute

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.760
on that term sheet.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.340
It's been hard, and so things
are changing fast and furious.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.610
Our first manufacturer
went bankrupt,

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.390
got bought by Foxconn.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.150
It was really quite difficult.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.940
There's been a huge price
fixing scandal.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.900
A lot of the executives in
the display industry

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.760
have gone to jail.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.730
Or when they travel to the US,
the CEO of AUO wasn't allowed

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.100
to leave for a year and a half
because he was under

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.870
indictment and there was
no extradition treaty.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.020
Anyway, he was found innocent
after all of that.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.860
But there's all these
things going on.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.910
And I'm American and Wall
Street's my problem, the

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.450
extradition treaty, like it's my
fault they say, because I'm

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.660
American, I should fix it.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.570
And I just realized that I have
to be there a lot of the

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.690
time to talk them through,
explain Wall

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:45.760
Street wasn't my fault.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.730
I'm sorry I'm American, and we
really shouldn't have done

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.710
that, and those guys
on Wall Street, and

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.865
women on Wall Street.

00:35:52.865 --> 00:35:55.020
But I just think everything's
changing for them.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.650
I'm dealing with executives
that are losing $2 million

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.080
every hour.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.830
Why are they talking to me?

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:02.730
Why?

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.440
What am I going to
do for them?

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.290
It's like well, you've already
eaten all of your children.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.130
There's no more children
left to eat.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.050
They've killed their R&amp;D.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.990
I offer them a cheap form of
R&amp;D that really works.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.790
We've shipped 3 million
screens.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.890
It might sound crazy, but here's
why these will work.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.220
Give me over to your CTO, I'll
prove out some of it, but

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.895
we're not going to tell you all
the IP so you're going to

00:36:22.895 --> 00:36:23.870
have to trust us.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.380
We'll show you a demo of
a proof of concept or

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.750
something like that.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.570
And that's how I get them to
continue to work with us.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:38.500
But the deals are always
changing because the pressures

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:45.590
are so great on those executives
right now.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.790
VIVIAN CROMWELL: So since you
have worked so many years in

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:53.220
Asia, we are also engineers in
the tech industry, I'm kind of

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.320
curious to know like when you're
doing business in Asia,

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.335
do you notice any cultural
differences between doing

00:37:00.335 --> 00:37:02.710
business in Silicon Valley
versus Asia?

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.800
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yeah,
so different.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.020
Even for different countries,
they're all so different.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.660
VIVIAN CROMWELL: Is it
a lot more difficult?

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.820
MARY LOU JEPSEN: It's
just different.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.820
And when I context switch back
to California, you're supposed

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.290
to have kind of, well, in
Taiwan they'd call it

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:24.060
arrogant, everybody
in California.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.300
But it's not called that here
because everybody's sort of

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.120
more direct, is another
way to describe it.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:38.320
Although you just need to
understand and context switch

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.550
between the different cultures
so that you don't come off as

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:48.350
a wallflower to not
direct enough.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.270
And sometimes I have trouble.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.470
Especially when I hadn't spent
much time in California for

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.710
like three years, and this year
I've spent more time, on

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.030
the West Coast more than
just California.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.900
I got more up to date, but like
when I first came back I

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:08.330
was a bit more nuanced
rather than direct.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:14.930
And that's really considered
quite arrogant with people

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:20.610
that I deal with in
China and Taiwan.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.350
I think Korea is more direct.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:29.165
I think Japan, it's so
different, especially

00:38:29.165 --> 00:38:30.415
post-Tsunami.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.260
They're all different.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.710
And I guess in One Laptop per
Child, every country that we

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:47.300
went into, it's in over 50
countries, you have to sort of

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.460
figure out what works and
what doesn't work.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:54.340
Hopefully not using the trial
and error method, but having

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.780
somebody that understands sort
of what you're thinking and

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.970
sort of can sit down and tell
you three levels down kind of

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.380
a map for it.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.510
When I first started living in
Asia, I must have offended so

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.910
many people.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.220
I was walking into walls.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.950
I didn't even know
they were walls.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.220
I didn't know that I was making
people angry with me.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.220
I didn't know that.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:21.530
And I tried to get
forgiveness.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.430
VIVIAN CROMWELL: So Mary Lou,
when you grew up, what are

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.540
some of the women role
models for you?

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.000
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Well, my mom
who really encouraged me.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.900
And I think actually
a VP at Google.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:38.460
I met her when I started at
MIT for grad school, Megan

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.740
Smith became my best friend.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.190
And Margaret Minksy, Marvin
Minsky's daughter and Megan

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.380
Smith shared an office.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:52.410
And Megan was just this
force of nature.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:56.890
That first year they made a
video of her for the Lego Logo

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.600
people that became Mindstorms
called Megan in Motion.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.370
And she was just so high
energy, and just doing

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:04.460
everything, and let's do it.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:04.780
When?

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.590
How about now?

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.380
And so we'd sleep every other
day at that time.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.700
It just opened my eyes.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.545
I never really thought
about traveling.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.230
I just really liked
holography.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.590
So I was sort of niche,
I guess, then.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.780
And she kind of blew the
doors off of that.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.030
When I focused on holography,
what was really interesting is

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:32.520
it was about half men
and half women in

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.340
holography at that time.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.000
A lot of the women tended to be
artists, a lot of the men

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.570
tended to be techy, but there
was cross between both.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:47.510
And a woman, Paula Dawson, who's
a holographic artist in

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.250
Australia, I went
and collaborated

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.320
with her for a while.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.090
And I used to teach history
of science.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:41:00.470
And there's all these amazing
women if you look back that

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:04.190
aren't fully recognized, but
really did amazing things.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:09.440
And one that I really like is
Lucia Galvani, who was the

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.710
wife of Lucio Galvani, who
discovered basically a new

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.790
kind of electricity
in about 1790.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.670
She actually observed.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.220
He was dissecting frogs and they
were outside and there

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.150
was electrical sparks.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.720
It was either a generator, they
thought there were these

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.373
different types of electricity
then, there

00:41:28.373 --> 00:41:29.510
were like five different.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.980
Ben Franklin discovered
one, the key.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.940
But anyway, the frog's
legs moved.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:41.600
And that meant electricity was
causing our muscles to move

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.220
inside of us.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.360
It inspired "Frankenstein,"
Mary Shelley that wrote

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.570
"Frankenstein." But she made the
observation according to

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.120
the history and doesn't
really get credit.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.020
Galvanism, galvanic, all of that
comes from the Galvanis.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.890
And I think there's tons of
women through history that

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:03.650
just never got the credit
for what they did.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.610
VIVIAN CROMWELL: So you believe
women should really

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.970
fight for the credit for the
work they're doing to be able

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:15.210
to gain the recognition
in the office?

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.700
MARY LOU JEPSEN: It's
interesting because the way

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.110
you do that in Asia versus
here is different.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:28.420
But I think it's very critical
to find a way to get credit

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.130
for the work.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.550
And the way I do that, I don't
know, you can talk to how you

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:35.540
do it, I used to not do it.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.770
I didn't know how to do it.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:40.050
And then I realized, wow, I'm
just really excited when

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.615
somebody gets something pretty
cool to work, and I tell

00:42:42.615 --> 00:42:44.240
everybody about how
cool it is.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.540
And then I just realized I
should also say, I got this

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.940
work, isn't it great?

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.570
I'm awesome.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:54.320
And then and tell the other
people like there's all these

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.590
great things going on.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:43:01.030
And so I found it a lot easier
to take credit, also part of

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.850
it is sort of becoming
a boss and learning

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:05.750
how to do all that.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.920
But in my early years, I didn't
actually quite know how

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.182
to do that.

00:43:12.182 --> 00:43:15.350
VIVIAN CROMWELL: Are there a
lot of female engineers in

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.770
your organizations?

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.010
Do you do anything trying
to encourage

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.100
more females to enter?

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:21.960
MARY LOU JEPSEN: We do.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.060
We do have a lot of women
in our company.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.180
In fact, our VP of
manufacturing,

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.540
Belle Fu, is amazing.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.500
She brought up four
different fabs in

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.540
three different companies.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.780
She was a chemist by training
and then she went and got a

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:38.760
Ph.D. in psychology because
the decisions taken didn't

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.920
actually make any
technical sense.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.210
So she runs all of our
fab relations.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.900
And it's really great because
we have to understand the

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.940
space the decision makers and
decision influences are in,

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.080
because we are not their
top priority.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.110
We're just always at that sort
of are we in the fab or out of

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:01.340
fab because we're so
small and whatnot.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.950
So that's really key.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.360
And we have other
women as well.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.080
And would like more,
certainly.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.320
The numbers are pretty daunting,
I think, across the

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.210
technical industries.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.570
It's depressing.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:26.120
JEAN WANG: So what sort of
advice would you give to be

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.050
able to rise into leadership
roles and to excel in their

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.300
careers and development?

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.930
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Advice,
it depends.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:42.180
I think, in one sentence,
is do the hard stuff.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.830
Do the hard stuff, learn
it, even if it's hard.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.020
And also stay passionate about
something, see if you can

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.480
combine them, like whatever
the field is.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.050
Because if you don't understand
deeply how some of

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.330
this stuff works, like
especially the stuff that

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.810
maybe you don't like.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.830
Like I didn't like
some aspects.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:08.930
I hated inclined planes.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:09.920
I just hated it.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.480
I thought it was just a dumb.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.700
I grew up on a farm, I never saw
once something go down at

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.350
that force on an inclined
plane, it

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:17.510
doesn't actually happen.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.310
I just thought the whole thing
was dumb and I had to do that

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.610
for like a year for engineering
school.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:26.840
But it just seemed like I had to
stick through it to get to

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.230
the other side.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.250
It's really just Newton's Law
and you've got to learn that.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:34.600
But different people have
barriers at different times.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:39.670
And I think, basically, if you
can do that, I've mastered a

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.610
lot of different fields because
I loved holography and

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.230
you couldn't actually get
a degree in holography.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:50.670
So I had to learn vision
science, and chemistry, and

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:56.960
physics, and math, and art,
mechanics, and a lot of

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.000
different things in order to
learn, how to program, and a

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.090
lot of different things so that
I could make really good

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.090
whole holograms.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:08.400
And then you realize that it's
OK, you can sort of catch up

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.540
quick in a field.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.020
And part of that is you have to
deal with, as a girl, like

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.340
they're all boys.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:21.670
And there's this thing, like
at MIT, people call people

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.370
that don't know everything
like brain-dead.

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:26.640
And I remember joining the
holography group at MIT.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.350
There was actually a
holography group.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.130
And everybody kept talking
in these sort

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:31.870
of weird coded terms.

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.400
And there was a hologram that
was made and was called

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.320
[? sanjigen. ?]

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.860
And I didn't know what
[? sanjigen ?]

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.450
meant in Japanese because
it was a Japanese word.

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:43.090
It means 3D.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:45.790
And it just happened to be the
name of something and somehow

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:47.570
I was supposed to know
what that meant.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:51.410
And there were so many levels
in figuring out what the

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.440
context words, where if you
could just get through that,

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.920
it's like hazing.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.930
It just feels like they don't
really write it down and you

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.150
just have to figure out
a way through that.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:06.180
And some people will help you
eventually, as long as you

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.600
sort of help them, I guess.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.710
And I think that part
is pretty hard.

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:14.000
Because the assumption is that
when you're coming in,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.780
especially as a younger woman,
or maybe it wasn't the

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.700
assumption, maybe I just
felt it was that.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.640
The impostor syndrome thing is
that you must be an idiot

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.360
because you don't know
this stuff already.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.190
Like how on Earth was I supposed
to know the type of

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:29.370
hologram that was called
[? sanjigen ?]

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:32.270
was like this type of hologram
made this way.

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:34.440
It's like impossible, right?

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.220
Do you guys have
maybe similar?

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.860
JEAN WANG: Yeah, so I guess I've
been pretty lucky in a

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.200
way, despite going to an
engineering school.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.650
At Caltech the ratio is 3:1 for
engineering and even worse

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.280
for EE, which was what
my degree was in.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.460
But after a while, at least
for me personally, I just

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.220
didn't even notice.

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:58.830
We were all just people trying
to get our degree, trying to

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.390
get our A's or whatnot,
and doing research.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.776
And you don't really notice it
until somebody actually points

00:48:04.776 --> 00:48:06.420
it out to you.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:06.875
MARY LOU JEPSEN: That's
interesting.

00:48:06.875 --> 00:48:08.480
JEAN WANG: I think that's
been an evolution.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.200
And of course, we're standing
on the shoulders of all the

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.580
women who have gone before us.

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.520
And it will continue
to improve.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:19.950
But I think it's turning out to
be less of an issue now as

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:20.960
it was in the past.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.100
And I hope it continues
to improve.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.830
MARY LOU JEPSEN: I only noticed
that I was a woman

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:26.900
when I was in the
younger years.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.920
But I used to lifeguard at the
beach in summers before I got

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.105
my engineering jobs
in the summers.

00:48:32.105 --> 00:48:34.560
And I remember they'd all tell
me like they would never work

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.250
for a woman, all the lifeguards
who were my

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.960
colleagues on the beach.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.610
And that was sort of what
they would say then.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.280
I just stopped noticing.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.590
And I'm me, and it's their
problem, and it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:57.140
more difficult.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.950
But then, that said, Middle
East is a different story.

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.590
VIVIAN CROMWELL: I kind of
feel like I grew up in a

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:07.200
pretty lucky environment because
my family is pretty

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.950
heavily engineering oriented.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.710
My dad is a physics and
optical engineer.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.380
My mom is a mechanical
engineer.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.180
So as I grew up, I never really
realized there is a

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.330
gender association to what
you can do and not.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:25.075
I think the first time I
actually realized that was

00:49:25.075 --> 00:49:28.070
probably after I graduated
from school.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:30.070
Because in all the companies
I applied for, they were

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.232
actually putting a ratio of how
many males they want to

00:49:33.232 --> 00:49:34.400
hire, how many females.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.580
So that kind of struck me.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.890
Oh wow, they're actually
putting gender with the

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:41.120
position you want to fill.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.665
So in general, pretty lucky like
in terms of growing up in

00:49:45.665 --> 00:49:47.085
a very supportive environment.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.370
JEAN WANG: So now it's time for
our live question portion

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:56.490
of the session.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:00.650
First question comes from
T.S. In California.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:04.650
She asks, or he asks, it's not
clear, with the future usage

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:07.520
trend going into mobile
computing with smaller devices

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.300
like tablet, should
OLPC become One

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.670
Tablet per Child instead?

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:15.530
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Well,
they're doing that.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.730
The laptops and the keyboards
are pretty useful.

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:23.310
They've put touchscreen into
the latest version of this,

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:25.180
which uses the same thing.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.270
And this thing actually
does turn around.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.980
It's big, it's bulky,
it's like a brick.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.580
Oh, sorry.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.940
VIVIAN CROMWELL: Is this the
same, like $100 per tablet, or

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.980
it's going to be a little
bit higher?

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.200
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Probably
less, I think $75.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.710
They demoed it at CES last
year or year before.

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.590
It got a lot of Best
of CES things.

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:47.740
But the question is when it
goes into production.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.850
OLPC has done a very interesting
experiment of

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.240
actually airdropping tablets.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.240
And they use the Motorola Xooms
because they charge fast

00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.250
rather than starting a
pre-production run.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:00.780
They only have a small number.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:05.280
They airdropped them into two
illiterate villages in Kenya

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.280
about eight months ago to see
what would happen, places that

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.470
there's no written languages,
nobody knows how to read.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:14.900
The adults, no language,
writing is used.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:19.650
And they wanted to see if the
kids would learn how to read

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.990
or what would happen.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.790
In one village just the
kids used them.

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.470
And in another village,
the kids and the

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:26.385
adults used them together.

00:51:26.385 --> 00:51:30.540
But the kids have learned a lot
of pre-reading stuff, a

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.080
lot of alphabet.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.510
The government decided primary
education in--

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.890
Sorry, it's not.

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:37.280
Kenya, it's Ethiopia--

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.280
primary education in Ethiopia
is an Amharic, but secondary

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.090
and tertiary is in English.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.640
And so they thought, let's
put English on it.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.470
In fact, sidebar, we
made the first

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:53.050
Amharic keyboard in OLPC.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:56.630
Nobody had ever made
one before.

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.520
There was a lot of firsts
that we did.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.240
But tablets in the villages,
the kids started to

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:02.790
learn how to read.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:04.170
They also learned how
to hack them.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:08.370
Because OLPC had turned off the
camera features because

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:12.170
they wore down the battery
really quickly.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.570
And the kids figured out how
to hack around and hack

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:17.850
Android to turn on the camera.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.630
So that was great.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:25.130
But yeah, so tablets are very
important going forward.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:27.060
But different countries
are picking.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.450
Every child in Uruguay
has one of these.

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:33.300
The Uruguayan government has
ordered another 100,000.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.600
About half the kids in Peru,
50 other countries, 26

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.160
different languages.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.094
VIVIAN CROMWELL: So are those
mainly being distributed

00:52:39.094 --> 00:52:40.970
through the local government?

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.830
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Through the
ministry of education, they

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.505
buy them en masse like textbooks
and then give them

00:52:45.505 --> 00:52:49.870
out to the kids and they have
a lifetime of five years.

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:52.985
And they could be with
tablets as well.

00:52:52.985 --> 00:52:57.420
VIVIAN CROMWELL: I'm wondering,
it seems that even

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.180
outside the developing countries
there are a lot of

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.134
other places kids can use
laptops like this, but I

00:53:03.134 --> 00:53:06.470
haven't really seen a lot of
massive adoption of these

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:09.500
laptops outside the developing
countries.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.030
I'm just kind of curious why.

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:14.280
MARY LOU JEPSEN: I remember when
OLPC started, we had our

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.210
first prototypes out.

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:19.160
And the mayor of Birmingham,
Alabama walked into our office

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.200
on day in Cambridge,
across from MIT.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.150
And he said, do what you
want, arrest me.

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:25.300
He was a big guy.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.670
And he said, arrest me, do
what have to have to, I'm

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:29.200
leaving here with two laptops.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.540
Call the cops, don't care.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.950
Because he wanted some for the
kids of Birmingham, Alabama.

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.190
He got them, we gave him
some laptops, some

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:37.200
of the other schools.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.280
But we really designed this one,
it's mesh networked so

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.160
you don't need a Wi-Fi
connection, all the laptops

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.690
talk to each other.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:47.460
We actually had to finish the
standard for 802.11s.

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.350
S stands for mesh because
M was gone.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:56.520
But it's really a super low
power, sunlight readable,

00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:02.080
rugged laptop for kids that we
specifically designed for the

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:02.830
developing world.

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:06.290
Even there's like extra screws
underneath the keyboard in

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:10.790
case the kids have to fix the
screws and they can fix,

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:13.070
sorry, the laptop, and the
screws drop on the ground and

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.020
they can't have it.

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.390
There's a lot of solutions.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:19.440
I mean Chromebook might
be a good solution.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.160
You guys are at $250
right now, right?

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.810
That's pretty good.

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:27.410
So there's a lot of different
solutions that exist now.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:31.320
When we started this thing eight
years ago, people really

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.820
thought we were nuts.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.530
What Steve Jobs said, what Craig
Barrett said, what Bill

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:39.750
Gates, I mean they
were shocking.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:42.740
They were insulting,
public and private

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.960
derision from them.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:48.810
But what we did that was maybe
even more important--

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:52.410
only 3 million are in the field,
that's not every kid--

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:54.670
is change the agenda for
every minister of

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:57.620
education on the planet.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:00.255
The job of the minister of
education is to educate the

00:55:00.255 --> 00:55:03.390
kids of their country, it's
the job of the country.

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:06.610
And if you're living in a
developing world country, and

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:09.750
I won't name the country, but a
large country in Africa, for

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:13.310
example, a third of the teachers
that are paid to show

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:16.770
up, don't show up, the next
third are literate.

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:20.290
You're doing with one third of
the teachers that actually

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:22.600
show up, try to do right
by the kids,

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.580
and know how to read.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.260
At that point, better
teacher training

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.310
doesn't solve the problem.

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:29.020
You just realize the
kids are smart.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:32.520
When you want to fix, maybe
not a Google, but normal

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.270
everyday people, when they want
to fix an electronics

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:36.710
problem, they hand it
to a kid, right?

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:40.150
Because kids, they're sponges,
they figure it out.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:44.460
By definition, one or two of us
in every 100 are geniuses.

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.680
By definition, we
say that, right?

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.800
They're going to
figure it out.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.900
And the situation is so bad in
so much of the developing

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.040
world you have to leverage
the kids themselves.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:57.030
So sure, computers are also
being used in the classroom,

00:55:57.030 --> 00:56:01.900
Khan Academy, all this great
stuff that's happening

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:02.850
everywhere.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:06.710
But we were focused
on the developing

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:08.210
world for that program.

00:56:14.476 --> 00:56:16.886
VIVIAN CROMWELL: That's the only
question we have on the

00:56:16.886 --> 00:56:19.300
Google Moderator.

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.320
JEAN WANG: Actually, I do have
a follow-up question to that,

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.390
is how do you take the feedback
that you get on OLPC,

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:28.170
for example, and how do you roll
that into the next design

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:29.790
or improvements?

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:32.960
MARY LOU JEPSEN: I think a lot
of the feedback that OLPC got,

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.660
and I haven't been with
the organization

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:36.040
now for four years.

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:40.050
But a lot of the feedback
they got was on, what

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:41.220
do the tests show?

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.460
And there was a lot of testing,
particularly in

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.420
Uruguay and Peru, where there
were very large deployments.

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:51.130
Rwanda, Afghanistan, Pakistan
had bigger deployments as I

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:52.160
understand it.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.560
And some of the feedback on the
testing was, sure, truancy

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:01.070
went down, community engagement
went up, kids were

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:03.870
online, but were their
test scores better?

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:06.080
In some cases they were better,
in some cases they

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.120
were about the same.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:16.800
But the truth is I think OLPC
has been criticized for not

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.670
doing enough testing.

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:25.080
That said, I think literacy
rates in Peru there's like

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.195
these different levels
they measure.

00:57:27.195 --> 00:57:28.910
I can't remember the
numbers of them.

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:32.410
But in villages, Peru went into
places that didn't have

00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:35.000
electricity, or internet,
or anything

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.250
to deploy the laptops.

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:42.730
Sorry, something's beeping, I
don't know which one, probably

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:44.400
my cell phone.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:49.190
In those places, there was like
90% of the kids couldn't

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:53.410
even pass to the sort of base
level, which, I think, there

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:55.240
was five, four, three,
two, one call it.

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.580
So there'd be nobody at level
one, nobody at level two,

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.210
maybe two kids at level
3, most of the kids at

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:03.180
level four and five.

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:07.870
And six months with a laptop, it
got to like 30% of the kids

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:09.470
were like in level two.

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.080
And so that was pretty
compelling.

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:20.090
But yeah, I think how OLPC has
reacted is sort of saying,

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:26.690
it's hard to say this, the
teachers are a critical part

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:28.520
of education.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.010
So what do you do when the
teachers don't show up, or are

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:34.720
illiterate, or are scared
of the technology?

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.700
Can you make the technology easy
enough to use so the kids

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.300
can learn on their own
without the teachers?

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:44.240
And that's the grand experiment
that OLPC is now

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.920
doing with pretty rigorous
social scientists.

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.590
I think they've got three
different sort of great

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:56.230
thinkers on how we learn to
read and so forth in a

00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:58.125
non-reading society.

00:58:58.125 --> 00:59:03.950
I think there's been very little
significant research

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:06.590
done on how a culture
with absolutely no

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:07.625
reading goes to reading.

00:59:07.625 --> 00:59:12.360
So they're studying that to say,
how do we get around this

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:16.360
problem of teachers
and schools?

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:18.150
It's radical.

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.170
It's only part of the program.

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:23.200
A lot of the program is dealing
in the infrastructure,

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.480
transforming a lot of schools
in Latin America.

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:33.000
But then, the big problems, as
I think one of the lead execs

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.540
at One Laptop per Child puts it,
the rich kids are the ones

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.270
that get to go to school.

00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:40.350
There's 100, 200 million
kids that don't even

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:41.520
get to go to school.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.630
How do you reach those kids?

00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:45.810
So that sort of takes the
politics out of it.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:48.500
They're not getting to go
to school, can we do

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.340
something by them?

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:55.350
Because their life opportunities
are extremely

00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:58.110
limited if they don't ever learn
how to read, if they

00:59:58.110 --> 00:59:59.150
don't get to go to school,
if they don't

00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:00.960
get access to education.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.880
VIVIAN CROMWELL: And they are
usually the group that's a

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.670
little bit more hungry
for knowledge.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:08.420
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yeah, hungry
for opportunity, and feel

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:13.220
lucky, so they'll work
hard, when they can.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:19.980
So that's a long-winded answer
to the question.

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:22.780
VIVIAN CROMWELL: I think
this is our wrap-up.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.860
Thanks to Mary Lou for
joining us today.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.200
And I think tomorrow there is
another Women Techmakers

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.070
episode around the same time.

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:34.800
So stay tuned and join us.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.840
Thank you, guys.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.220
JEAN WANG: Thank you.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.730
Thanks to Mary.

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:39.840
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Thank you
two, Vivian and Jean.
