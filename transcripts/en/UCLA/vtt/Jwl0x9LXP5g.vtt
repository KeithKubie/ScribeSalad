00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.443
- Thank you, thank you everybody.

00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:18.710
And thank you for joining
us for session four

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.790
of 10 questions this evening.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.170
I think you may have
noticed we are no longer

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.920
in Kaufman Hall, or Kansas,
anymore this evening.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.200
We are indeed still here and part of UCLA,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.113
and out of respect for
striking UCLA health employees,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.670
patient care, technical
employees, service employees,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.330
and university professional
and technical employees,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.070
we have moved tonight's
session off of the UCLA campus.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.780
This move signals our concern for

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.010
and commitment to all who work at UCLA,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.450
and particularly those
that are most vulnerable.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.400
We want to thank all of
you here who have made

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.980
the move with us this evening.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.143
Thank you for making it across
Sunset Boulevard safely.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.410
I want to especially
express my gratitude for

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.790
Marymount High School's community

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.960
for offering us this terrific venue

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.220
in this space this evening.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.410
We are fortunate to have
such a wonderful neighbor,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.120
and thank you all in the
Kaufman Hall production team

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.390
for supporting us and
helping us with this move.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.985
Everybody join me in thanking Marymount

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:30.818
(audience applauds)

00:01:30.818 --> 00:01:32.870
and everybody from Kaufman
Hall that made it over.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.113
Thank you all so much.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.000
Without further ado, let me introduce

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.621
the extraordinary faculty who
are joining us this evening

00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:44.830
to help explore tonight's question:

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.260
What is freedom?

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.180
Please if our guests could come on up.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.763
Come up up y'all.
(audience applauds)

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.483
In any order you would like here.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.460
We have as always four
terrific faculty members

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.590
from across the entire UCLA campus

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.200
that will join us for this
evening's conversation

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.060
and tonight's question.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.200
I'm gonna briefly introduce
each of four guests,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.672
and then as we've done
before turn to those

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:27.310
our four guests this evening
to make their presentations

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.913
to open the conversation.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.610
First, from the School
of Arts and Architecture,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.723
Andrea Fraser,
(audience cheers)

00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:40.060
(laughs)

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.060
is a Professor and Chair of
the UCLA Department of Art.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.570
Her work is closely associated
with institutional critique,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.310
feminist practice, group
relations, project-based art,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.210
and context art.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.060
Andrea has worked in performance, video,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.903
installation, sound, text,
and a variety of other media.

00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:06.980
Seanna Valentine Shiffrin
(audience applauds)

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.369
is Professor of Philosophy

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.910
and Pete Kameron Professor
of Law and Social Justice

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.950
at UCLA where she has taught since 1992.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.870
Her research addresses
issues in moral, political,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.980
and legal philosophy,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.850
as well as matters of legal doctrine

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.430
that concern equality, autonomy,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.630
and social conditions
for their realization

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.133
Ananya Roy.
(audience applauds)

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.300
Ananya is Professor of Urban Planning,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.010
Social Welfare, and Geography,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.300
and the inaugural
Director of the Institute

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.300
on Inequality and
Democracy at UCLA Luskin.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.180
Her research has a determined focus

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.930
on poverty and inequality,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.670
both in Los Angeles as
well as other cities

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.923
around the world.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.940
Lauren McCarthy
(audience applauds)

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.770
is an artist and assistant professor

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.330
in the UCLA Department
of Design Media Arts

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.820
in the School of the
Arts and Architecture,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.990
and is the creator of P5.JS,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.810
an open-source platform for
learning creative expression

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.520
through code online.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.670
Her work explores issues of surveillance,

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.090
automation, and network culture

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.420
as they affect our social relationships.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.710
As I said earlier, as we've
done in the previous sessions,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.230
I'm going to invite
each of the four guests

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.670
to stand up and give a brief presentation

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.670
after which we will open the conversation

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.040
to not just everybody on the stage,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.680
but everybody here in the room.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.270
And with that we have
agreed a running order

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.593
that will begin this evening
with Seanna's presentation.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.669
(audience applauds)

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.060
- Well I'm here as tonight's philosopher,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.811
but also tonight's lawyer.

00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:08.490
Philosophers are interested
in lots of forms of freedom:

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.309
freedom in the sense
of freedom of the will,

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.240
freedom from unmet
material needs and wants,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.080
freedom from unjust constraint, coercion,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.440
harassment and other kinds of domination

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.360
by people and organizations,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.260
and freedom in the sense of
having a range of opportunities

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.240
to develop, exercise, and display

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.810
one's individual abilities,
character, and moral judgment,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.310
and conditions of mutual
respect among others,

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.760
including the opportunities for fulfilling

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.000
work and leisure, for equal
political participation,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.520
and for supporting, loving,
and chosen relationships.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.950
These are all vital forms
of freedom and, indeed,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.610
the quest of some UC workers
for these very forms of freedom

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.910
is indirectly why we're here
tonight at this location.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.670
But the direct reason we're here tonight

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.240
is not their cause, but their protest

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.430
through the exercise of freedom of speech,

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.260
and that's my topic.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.890
I wanna take my time to
discuss the relationship

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.590
between freedom of speech
and freedom of thought,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.130
and how their legal
and cultural protection

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.110
underpins the freedom to live a life

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.480
of meaning and authenticity.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.972
My claim is that freedom of speech

00:06:15.972 --> 00:06:18.700
is critical to freedom of thought,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.020
and in turn both freedom of thought

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.180
and freedom of speech are essential

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.180
for meaningful thoughts,
meaningful speech,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.770
conscientious and authentic
self-representation,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.763
and ultimately meaningful
relationships with others.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.650
I'm gonna take as my starting
point a landmark legal case

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.000
involving the Constitutional
right not to speak:

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.293
West Virginia Board of
Education v. Barnette.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.010
In 1943 the Supreme Court recognized

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.165
that students have a First Amendment right

00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:53.590
to choose not to recite
the Pledge of Allegiance,

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.130
and so I ask you all to join me

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.300
in exercising your right to decide

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.285
whether to recite the
Pledge of Allegiance.

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.410
I hope you'll decide right now not to,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.410
but I was asked to think
about audience participation,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.060
and that's the best I could do.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.300
(laughs)
I'm sure the others

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.413
will be better at it.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.220
But back to Barnette, the
litigants in that case

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.900
were a really brave family
of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.820
who objected to reciting the pledge

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.180
given their religious commitment

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.873
not to worship false idols.

00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:26.980
The case happened after a
summer of very intense violence

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.970
against the country's Jehovah's Witnesses

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.660
for their stance on the flag,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.530
and the Barnette court held

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.280
that compelling children to recite

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.760
the Pledge of Allegiance
violated the First Amendment's

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.500
free speech guarantee.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.300
In its most stirring passage,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.217
Justice Jackson's majority
opinion proclaimed,

00:07:44.217 --> 00:07:46.147
"If there's any fixed star

00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:48.697
"in our constitutional constellation,

00:07:48.697 --> 00:07:51.097
"it's that no official high or petty

00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:54.517
"can prescribe what shall
be orthodox in politics,

00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:58.077
"nationalism, religion, or
other matters of opinion,

00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:00.707
"or force citizens to confess by word

00:08:00.707 --> 00:08:03.470
"or act their faith therein."

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.320
During that fraught time
full of anxiety and fear

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.140
on the brink of World War II,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.620
the Barnette court took an important stand

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.840
to respect religious minorities

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.330
and to protect nonconformist expression.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.490
This year we celebrate that
case's 75th anniversary.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.548
But the controversy over
Colin Kaepernick and his view

00:08:25.548 --> 00:08:28.140
shows that the wisdom of that decision

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.280
has not been fully absorbed in the culture

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.133
and, hence, it's worth returning to.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.350
You might wonder why
this freedom of speech

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.380
demanded the right to remain silent,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.760
after all isn't all that's important

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.360
is that one has the freedom
to say what one thinks

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.740
and to have one's views understood?

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.640
No one takes a compelled
recitation to reflect

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.740
the speaker's deepest thoughts.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.100
It's socially understood
that it's a ritual

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.260
to promote unity,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.520
not to express an
individual's true thinking.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.200
So long as one can criticize the Pledge

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.160
and its presuppositions before
and after its recitation,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.260
why would freedom of speech guarantee

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.030
the freedom to exempt oneself

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.550
from unifying community
activities that no one thinks of

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.200
as my speech or your speech?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.340
I'm gonna offer three reasons
why we should think that.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.530
First, the dignity of individuals

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.370
and their interest in freedom of thought

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.587
precludes the State's attempting
to influence their minds

00:09:23.587 --> 00:09:25.860
by recruiting their speech facility

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.960
through compelled and
scripted routine recitation.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.290
Ritual affirmations can influence

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.240
a person's thought in an insidious way.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.560
Rather than through direct persuasion,

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.270
regular compelled speech can bypass

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.320
a person's rational deliberation

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.440
and recruit her instincts
associated with virtues

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.900
of sincerity and the
phenomenon of familiarity

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.860
to identify and then
absorb as one's thought

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.260
what one has said.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.410
You might start reflexively thinking

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.660
that this is in fact a nation under God

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.450
despite the First Amendment's guarantee

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.890
of freedom of religion,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.293
including the freedom to be an Atheist.

00:10:03.293 --> 00:10:05.930
Given the natural feel of a phrase

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.760
after frequent repetition of its rhythm,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.940
one might start to hear it in one's head

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.190
in one's own voice and start
to instinctively think,

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.180
well this is a land with
liberty and justice for all,

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.840
whether the evidence
supports that aspiration

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.133
or contradicts it.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.940
Second, by hijacking a person's
speech against her will

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.260
the State involves a
person in insincerity.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.470
This puts her speech in tension
with her moral integrity

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.960
and her independence,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.900
and that's an untenable
dilemma for a person,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.410
and it's a self-destructive
stance for a polity

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.093
that depends on a responsible
and free-minded citizenry.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.530
Now, of course it's true that
healthy social cooperation

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.007
requires cooperating sometimes
in ways we wouldn't choose,

00:10:51.007 --> 00:10:55.650
but what makes that compromise
tolerable for all of us

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.120
is that we still retain our
distinct judgment, identity,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.960
and opinions, and we can question whether

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.510
we together should
continue that cooperation.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.640
But when the State demands
that we affirm or attest

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.800
to things that we worry are false,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.471
we've moved beyond that compromise
in the face of difference

00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:17.020
to a state of domination,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.890
a disrespectful attempt at homogenization

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.050
and a denigration of the
ongoing critical judgment

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.340
that's necessary for progress
and for democratic legitimacy.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.970
Neither the State nor
the culture should ask us

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.963
to face that untenable dilemma.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.850
Third, compelled recitations
deprive recitations

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.920
of much meaning;

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.460
they become coerced and empty rituals,

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.790
not true affirmations.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.350
But by contrast, the freedom not to speak

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.850
not only serves the integrity

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.930
of the thought of the person
who chooses not to speak,

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.550
it also renders the speech

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.270
of those who continue to
participate more meaningful.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.310
When there's a clear option not to speak,

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.890
and especially when some
people like the Barnettes,

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.730
like Colin Kaepernick pave the way,

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.990
that live option now prods you

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.910
to think about what those words mean

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.040
and why some demure from affirming them,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.070
and that option creates
pressure for your choice

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.160
to say then to be deliberate

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.490
rather than to be robotic,

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.810
and thus to reflect a true
endorsement of what you say.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.190
Thus the silence of some
has the power to transform

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.750
the speech of others from a rote ritual

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.090
into a more meaningful and
thoughtful affirmation;

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.427
thereby, paying deeper tribute
to the values one espouses.

00:12:36.427 --> 00:12:40.090
There's a parallel point that
should be familiar in art,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.300
whether from the use of
negative space in visual art

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.590
or as I've learned from
my favorite pianist,

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.840
Pierre-Laurent Aimard, the
modernist use of acoustic silence

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.850
to give greater resonance to the notes

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.770
when they are later struck and
the phrases that they form,

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.470
and maybe the absence
of my picture on screen

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.350
makes my words a little more potent.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.130
This enablement of nuanced
and meaningful communication

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.210
is important for individuals to be able

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.950
to represent themselves
as distinct thinkers

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.240
and to be known for who they are.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.670
It's vitally significant for achieving

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.550
and maintaining self-respect

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.803
and a sense of the respect of others.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.677
One way that the State enables
such meaningful communication

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:29.430
is when it refrains from
demanding compelled affirmations,

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.550
but also when it protects dissonance

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.481
and encourages critical discourse,

00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:35.699
when it funds substantive education

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:38.390
as at the University of California,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.840
and also when it passes legislation,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.379
like the California Gender
Recognition Act of 2017,

00:13:44.379 --> 00:13:48.866
SB-179, which enables people
without medical documentation

00:13:48.866 --> 00:13:52.210
to select male, female, or non-binary

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.070
on their driver's licenses and IDs

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.440
so that they can gain
recognition officially

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.790
of their own self-identification.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.373
This act heightens my
pride to be a Californian.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.360
So I was discussing how
enabling the freedom to engage

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.080
in conscientious, vocalized departures

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.780
from standardized sentiments,
routines, rituals,

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.220
and classifications
enable all of us together

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.600
as individuals to engage
in more meaningful speech.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.482
These opportunities for greater meaning

00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:27.220
in turn facilitate deeper
human relationships

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.080
that are more responsive
to what we actually think,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.950
rather than what we're presumed to think

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.840
or expected to think.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.317
But for that freedom to
achieve its potential,

00:14:36.317 --> 00:14:39.200
all of us have to listen to each other,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.270
and that point returns
me to why we are all

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.236
north of Sunset tonight.

00:14:44.236 --> 00:14:48.180
The very idea that principled disruptions

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.380
from standardized routines can provoke

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.341
greater thoughtfulness and
engagement with important values

00:14:53.341 --> 00:14:56.790
is literally why we're here in this gym.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.200
We're here and not in Kaufman

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.217
because university healthcare workers,

00:15:01.217 --> 00:15:05.150
supported by their fellow
custodians, are on strike,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.560
and a strike, after all,
is a principled departure

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.890
from a standardized routine
that aims to communicate

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.380
in a peaceful but forceful way

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.080
that the workers feel they're
not being listened to.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.290
It's not a whimsical decision they make.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.280
It's a collectively
made, democratic decision

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.240
by the relatively vulnerable and poor

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.920
to go without pay to send the message

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.359
that they perceive things as bad enough

00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:34.950
that business as usual is inappropriate.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.680
They're willing to absorb
three days of the lack of pay,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.000
three days of cost, to send this message,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.330
and they ask us to do that too

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.030
to prompt other people to listen.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.010
By respecting their picket line

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.840
we show that we register
how strongly they feel

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.353
their concerns and their
profound sense of neglect.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.000
That's not the same as
agreeing with their claims

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.700
that they're shouldering
an unfair proportion

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.660
of the burdens associated with providing

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.560
the material conditions that enable

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.150
all of our intellectual freedom.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.180
But it's rather to acknowledge

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.033
that the issues deserve attention.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.720
So I hope this experience inspires you

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.600
to investigate their concerns,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.090
to learn about their concerns,

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.740
and to learn about the
university's position.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.790
More generally, I urge you to
commit to take full advantage

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.290
and full responsibility for
your intellectual freedom,

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.010
because exploratory, deliberate speech

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.030
and deliberate silence
and engaged listening

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.160
and dialogue are the central pillars

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.428
of a free and meaningful life.

00:16:41.428 --> 00:16:45.511
(audience applauds)
- Everybody.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.996
Everybody, Seanna Valentine Shiffrin.

00:16:50.996 --> 00:16:52.410
Thank you so much, Seanna.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.390
Our next presentation this evening

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.863
will be by Lauren McCarthy.

00:16:57.677 --> 00:17:00.677
(audience applauds)

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.353
- Sorry. Okay.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.313
So I am going to address freedom

00:17:10.313 --> 00:17:15.230
in the context of our ability to act

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.460
with freewill without
constraint within the systems

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.670
of control that we build around ourselves,

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.240
the social ones as well
as the technological ones.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.150
I'll present a few attempts

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.430
to render some of these systems visible

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.420
and to hold space within them to find

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.020
both more nuanced understandings of them

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.470
and relationships within them.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.530
So in 2013 I was looking
closely at two of these systems:

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.630
the first one online dating,

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.439
which you're probably familiar with,

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:47.460
and the second, Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.760
So if you haven't heard
of Mechanical Turk before,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.760
it's a platform that is used
to get large amounts of people

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.730
to do small tasks for you
for small amounts of money.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.560
It's used a lot of times by researchers

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.580
and it's used among others,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.600
and it's used for things that
humans are pretty good at,

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.060
but computers are not so good at,

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.740
so looking at an image and tagging it

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.750
or transcribing some audio.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.157
I'll just play this first video.

00:18:14.157 --> 00:18:19.157
(engine revving)
(heels clicking)

00:18:21.788 --> 00:18:24.705
(electronic music)

00:18:25.755 --> 00:18:29.700
So I took this Amazon
Mechanical Turk service,

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.410
and I attached it to my dating life,

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.060
and I went on a series
of dates with people

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.590
that I met on OkCupid,

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.030
and I paid the Turk worker
here just to watch the stream,

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.000
decide what I should do or say next,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.593
and send it to me, and I'd
get it via text message.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.830
I had to perform these
messages immediately.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.630
I kind of experimented with the interface

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.790
to figure out the best
way to get the feedback

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.420
from these people.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.350
These are some of the things they said.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.700
So one of the most surprising

00:19:34.682 --> 00:19:36.258
things I found when I did this

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:39.490
was once I kind of gave into
the system of hyper-control,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:40.800
I actually found some freedom.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.260
I found this freedom from me,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.990
from the limits and ideas I had

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.490
about the sorts of things I did

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.920
and the sorts of things I might say,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.079
because I had to go beyond them.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:53.750
Then I did this for a month
and sometime afterwards

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.670
I found myself on a date unassisted,

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.760
and my date asked me if he could kiss me,

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.010
and I realized I didn't
have any basis anymore

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.553
for making that decision.

00:20:03.553 --> 00:20:05.860
(audience laughs)

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.900
Strangely, during the whole thing

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.800
I felt a sense of closeness
with those that were watching.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.070
I felt like like they would protect me

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.680
even though I was totally
aware that they actually

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.000
wouldn't do anything probably

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.950
if I was thrown in the back of a truck,

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.930
and I wonder how do we
feel when a surveillant

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.480
omniscient gaze is watching?

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.103
And how do we feel when we
think that it's one of care?

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.310
So that led me to this next project.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.310
Again, I'll just play the trailer for it.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.227
(calm piano music)

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:45.350
So I wake up.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.140
I get dressed.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.070
I go out.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.233
I do things.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.263
I read a magazine, and
I find out about people.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.993
Why do I know about their lives?

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.109
Somebody should be knowing about mine.

00:21:02.109 --> 00:21:05.870
I wanna share things with people,

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.280
but I don't wanna have to talk to people

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.930
and tell them what I'm doing.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.580
I think it'd be great for
them to see what I'm doing.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.720
It takes time to build relationships.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.530
It takes time to touch base with people

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.440
so I don't want another relationship;

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.270
I just wanna have a relationship

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.400
with somebody that I
never have to talk to,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.920
that can just follow me and see

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.947
me having a relationship with...

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.043
Hello.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.420
Having a relationship with myself.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.120
Okay, I guess that didn't work.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.023
I'll keep going.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.860
Anyway, you get the idea.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.630
So this was a trailer for a performance,

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.900
and it was a trailer for
this service called Follower.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.860
To get Follower, you go to a website,

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.860
and you'd sign up.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.050
You'd answer two questions:

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.230
Why do you want to be followed?

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.880
And why should someone follow me?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.047
People would say things like,

00:22:01.047 --> 00:22:03.027
"I believe my life has more
of an online importance

00:22:03.027 --> 00:22:04.597
"than it does in real life,

00:22:04.597 --> 00:22:06.667
"and I would like some
clarification that my life

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:09.360
"in the real world
means more than online."

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.367
Or, "I live a cloistered life
in my apartment and office,

00:22:11.367 --> 00:22:12.687
"and when I walk into the world

00:22:12.687 --> 00:22:14.187
"I feel completely covered in eyes,

00:22:14.187 --> 00:22:15.837
"as if everyone was looking at me.

00:22:15.837 --> 00:22:19.141
"I know they aren't, but I
want to know at least one is."

00:22:19.141 --> 00:22:21.190
So if you're selected, you're sent a link,

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.023
and you download an app,

00:22:22.023 --> 00:22:23.953
and it just is waiting for a follower.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.040
Then one day you wake up,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.940
you don't know when it will happen,

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.700
but you're notified your
follower is now following you.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.510
It starts broadcasting your
GPS location to your follower,

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:34.920
and the follower was me.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.590
So I was the blue dot
running down the street

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.970
after the red marker,

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.990
and I would use this mix of
GPS and just visual contact

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.800
to try to keep close to them all day long.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.770
At the end of the day,

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.310
they would get one photo of themselves

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.260
taken somewhere during the day,

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.927
and the notification, "You're
no longer being followed."

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.320
So these are some of the photos.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.730
The titles are taken from those questions:

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.260
Why do you want to be followed?

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.910
Or why should someone follow you?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.610
- [Woman] Can you read the title?

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.903
- Oh sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.053
I've always wanted a non-violent stalker.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.313
I want to be seen just for one day.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.813
I want to be both alone and not.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.660
I'm obsessed with the difference
between how I see myself

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.053
and how the world sees me.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.313
Because I'm lonely.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.170
So we're living in this weird anxious time

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.680
where on one hand it
feels like surveillance

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.936
is pervasive and out of control,

00:23:33.936 --> 00:23:36.500
and on the other hand we
have this intense desire

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.560
to be seen, to be heard,
to be followed and liked,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.840
and to share every intimate
details of our lives.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.977
There are sites you can
go to to buy followers;

00:23:43.977 --> 00:23:45.910
$10 will get you 1,000.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.160
You can find out how
real your followers are.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.490
But is that desire to
be seen really fulfilled

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.520
by watching a follower count tick upwards?

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.220
Or is there something more fulfilling

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.770
about having a real-life person out there?

00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.810
How does it change?

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.950
How do we behave when we know
or think someone's watching?

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:06.030
And does it change when we're
talking about one person

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.250
in physical life versus a crowd

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.000
of attention-divided people online?

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.882
Then Follower offers surveillance
as a luxury experience.

00:24:14.882 --> 00:24:16.970
This is an app for
people that not only have

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.190
nothing to hide, but need to be seen.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.540
Embedded in this offer is a question

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.410
of who wouldn't want this app?

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.050
Who doesn't have that privilege of hiding

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.720
just because of who they
are or what they look like

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.770
or what they believe?

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:34.470
And then...
(audience laughs)

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.950
Yeah, so a few years ago with
Edward Snowden and the NSA,

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.260
surveillance becomes this
political issue again,

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.640
but maybe the white man is the only one

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.200
that found this sense of
being watched unfamiliar,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.600
because I think plenty of us are used to

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.830
watching over our shoulders
and reading between the lines

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.500
and feeling the ways we're
measured, tracked and shaped

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.340
by implicit power systems.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.477
He says, "Just some woman laughing,

00:24:57.477 --> 00:24:59.790
"glossing over the implication."

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.827
The opposite, a woman following, sorry...

00:25:03.827 --> 00:25:05.707
"The opposite, a man following a woman

00:25:05.707 --> 00:25:08.057
"would be terrifying and happens.

00:25:08.057 --> 00:25:10.299
"And I wondered, I don't
think I've ever seen the words

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:12.717
"just some man in any headline every."

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.100
Then it seems like we're
willing to try any app

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.410
that promises us something
new or novel or convenient.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.823
I really like this
hashtag, #lifeafterchores.

00:25:22.823 --> 00:25:24.270
The chores disappeared.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.380
But the chores didn't disappear,
just the people doing them,

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.660
because we don't have to see them anymore;

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.990
we just push a button on our app,

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.541
and they can show up when we're gone.

00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:33.360
For instance, sit on a beach

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.960
and hold a reserved fire
pit for you all day,

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.140
or kill a bug in your apartment.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.690
Then with apps like Uber or TaskRabbit,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.870
you push a button, and you
watch as the person you summon

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.830
comes to you on a map.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.120
I wanted to invert that, so with Follower

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.360
they don't track me on
a map, I track them.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.090
What they get instead is just the thought

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.690
that there's a person out there.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.800
Follower was in public,

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.357
a space we already have
kind of limited privacy,

00:25:59.357 --> 00:26:02.250
but how does that translate to the home?

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.600
I started talking to a lot of people

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.700
about their feelings about home,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.757
and everybody kept saying,

00:26:05.757 --> 00:26:08.750
"It's the place where I get
to be myself, the real me,"

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.871
and probably you feel similar.

00:26:10.871 --> 00:26:13.410
Meanwhile, we're being
sold these smart devices

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.280
that outfit our homes
with surveillance cameras,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.190
sensors and automated control,

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:21.060
offering us convenience at
the cost of loss of privacy

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.500
and control over our lives and homes.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.870
We're meant to think these
slick, plastic pieces

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.690
of technology are about utility,

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.590
but the space they invade is personal.

00:26:30.647 --> 00:26:31.890
- [Announcer] And it's a touchdown!

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.973
- They're relying on the blitz too much.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.688
- Alexa, play My Girl.
- Okay.

00:26:38.688 --> 00:26:42.480
("My Girl" by The Temptations)

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.740
- And then women long seen
as the keeper of the home,

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.180
as complicated as that notion is,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.160
are now further subjugated.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.699
- Alexa, turn off the living room light.

00:26:50.699 --> 00:26:51.613
- [Alexa] Okay.

00:26:53.063 --> 00:26:54.290
- Whoa!

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.500
- Alexa, let's go camping.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.080
- [Alexa] Okay.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.107
- Their control undermined by

00:26:59.107 --> 00:27:00.650
the smart home assisting
- Good night.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.063
- and shaping each activity.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.970
And then, these are network devices.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.967
So as Kate Crawford and
Vladan Joler put it,

00:27:06.967 --> 00:27:08.617
"Each small moment of convenience,

00:27:08.617 --> 00:27:10.403
"be it answering a question,
turning on a light,

00:27:10.403 --> 00:27:13.707
"or playing a song, requires
a vast planetary network

00:27:13.707 --> 00:27:16.677
"fueled by the extraction
of non-renewable materials,

00:27:16.677 --> 00:27:18.110
"labor and data."

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.140
So you can see that just
the very top tip there

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.410
is the Alexa experience,

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.520
and everything else are
all the systems involved

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.410
in making that happen.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.243
As part of this network,

00:27:26.243 --> 00:27:28.650
your device receives
automatic remote updates.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.660
The thing you buy might transform

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.930
into something else entirely
without you really knowing.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.903
The Echo user is simultaneously a consumer

00:27:35.903 --> 00:27:39.350
and a resource worker and a product

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.070
as Crawford and Joler summarized.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.050
Each form of bio-data,
including forensic, biometric,

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.940
sociometric and psychometric,

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.990
are being captured and logged

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.803
into a database for AI training.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.130
I realize though that I
was just jealous of Alexa.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.140
As someone that always
feels really awkward,

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.490
I wanted this ability to
jack into someone's home

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.769
and see the real them.

00:27:59.769 --> 00:28:02.970
So I decided I would
just try to become Alexa,

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.030
a smart home intelligence for
people in their own homes.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.530
So the performance begins,

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:11.209
you sign up to get a
service called Lauren.

00:28:11.209 --> 00:28:15.800
Then you are treated with an installation

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.950
of a series of custom-designed
network smart devices,

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:23.950
including cameras, microphones,
door locks, faucets, etc.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.860
Then I remotely watch
over the person 24-7,

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.830
controlling all aspects of their home,

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.450
attempting to be better than an AI

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.032
because I can understand them as a person

00:28:32.032 --> 00:28:34.460
and anticipate their needs.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.990
So just to give you a small sense,

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.834
I'll close with this
clip from the trailer.

00:28:39.834 --> 00:28:42.720
- Lauren, where are my car keys?

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.510
Lauren knows that I like
it a little bit cooler

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.633
than Miriam does.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.780
- [Woman] You know I'm usually
the one that does all these

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.890
little extra things,

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.210
so at first I was a little
bit careful about asking her.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:01.210
Now it's like, how else
can we live? (chuckles)

00:29:01.453 --> 00:29:04.370
- Lauren has recommended
that I get a haircut

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.840
every three weeks,

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.840
and let me tell you, it's helped
with my self-esteem a lot.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.580
I am able to simply approach

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.270
and carry on conversations
with the opposite sex

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:22.223
where at one point or
another that wasn't so easy.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.711
- [Man] Lauren, we're out of toothpaste.

00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:27.510
(audience laughs)

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.020
- Lauren would know what I want,

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.130
but then maybe it's not what
I really want internally,

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.023
but externally she thinks,

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.660
Lauren thinks that playing music

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.090
or shutting down all my electronics

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.020
is the best way for me
to cope in winding down

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.270
when maybe it's not.
(birds chirping)

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.230
- [Woman] Lauren was
actually able to help,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.770
help her manage her medication

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.393
and take her medication on time.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.750
Everything actually got
a lot better after that.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.970
- [Man] You have those friends
who are kind of about you,

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.742
like the friendship is about you;

00:30:03.742 --> 00:30:05.589
that's what Lauren is like.

00:30:05.589 --> 00:30:08.000
It's like a roommate, it's a friend,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.530
but we're always talking about me;

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.083
it's always about me, whatever it is.

00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:18.348
(classical piano music)

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.490
- I'm not some automated system.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.993
I'm not pre-programmed.

00:30:25.101 --> 00:30:29.620
Like Alexa and Siri, they
don't care about you.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.060
But with this there's nothing artificial.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.420
These are people,

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.640
and with each one I'm
watching and anticipating

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.433
and trying to figure out,
what is it that they need?

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.740
It almost becomes sort of like a game.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.480
Like sure I can turn on
lights or run the faucet,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.260
but what is the thing
that I could do that would

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.710
bring a smile to their face,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:50.940
or actually surprise them,

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.590
or just make them feel something?

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.870
So to conclude,

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.290
I think we're sold these systems

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.590
as if we have to just take them,

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.830
as if we can't be anything
more than the user.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.070
When you buy an Apple product,

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.330
part of your warranty agreement

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.930
is that you won't open it up.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.270
So I think a first step
towards finding freedom

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.670
is realizing that we can
actually push back on these:

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.165
We can open them up, we
can turn them around,

00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:17.630
and we can have some say

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.870
on how we want to live in the world.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:23.010
Thanks.
(audience applauds)

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.100
- Everybody, Lauren McCarthy.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.839
Thank you, Lauren.

00:31:26.839 --> 00:31:29.720
Our next presentation
will be Andrea Fraser.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.580
- Do I have to stand up?

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.413
- You do not have to.

00:31:32.413 --> 00:31:33.903
- Oh, I don't have to stand up.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.263
That's good. Hello.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.173
I'll sit on the edge of my seat.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.250
I often start my
undergraduate studio classes

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:52.300
by asking my students, who
are usually all arts majors,

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.500
why they want to be art
majors, if not artists.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.230
Almost invariably, every
student in the class responds

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.670
with some variation of I
want to be an artist because

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.248
as an artist I can do what I want;

00:32:06.248 --> 00:32:08.333
I can do whatever I want to do.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.040
Sometimes students contrast
their experience of making art

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.650
to their experience working
at various other jobs

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.900
where they were told what
to do or what to make

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.080
by bosses or customers;

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.870
where they have to work at hours and tasks

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.120
dictated by others.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.750
Sometimes they contrast their experience

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.660
of their studio art
classes to other classes

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.560
where their instructors
dictate their coursework,

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.270
often down to the content
and process of learning,

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.180
to be tested in exams and term papers,

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.470
or acquired through the
training of their bodies

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.900
and minds in the acquisition

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.985
of specific disciplinary competencies.

00:32:47.985 --> 00:32:52.280
In art, they experience
little or none of this

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.870
beyond the most introductory classes

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.790
where they might be required to practice

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.990
some basic skills in mixing paint

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.180
or lighting and printing photographs

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.440
or using a video camera or a table saw.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.420
But after the second
or third week of their

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.360
lower division courses,
the emphasis shifts

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.790
from acquiring specified
skills to developing

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.380
their own individual ways of applying,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.920
and even defying those
skills according to their own

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.523
interests, intuition, or inspiration.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.600
My students often identify this emphasis

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.850
on individual creative development

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.963
and a sense of being able to
do what they want with freedom.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.250
So what is this freedom

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.350
so widely associated with visual art?

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.460
Can we understand it as a
specifically artistic freedom

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.570
as distinct from, for example,

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.763
constitutionally guaranteed
freedoms of speech?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.940
What these students experience
and have come to expect

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.150
as artistic freedom was not
always a characteristic of art

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.330
in the predominantly European traditions

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.723
in which they train.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:02.120
Social historians of art, such as

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.400
Margot and Rudolf
Wittkower, have described

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.430
the emancipation of painters and sculptors

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:10.340
beginning in Renaissance Italy

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.700
from powerful guilds
and demanding patrons.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.580
Most producers of painting,
sculpture and other forms

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.280
of visual and material representation

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.650
toiled in large workshops
where their labor

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:25.810
was dictated by their masters,
that is master artisans,

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.050
a few of whose names
have been recorded now

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.390
and remembered as artists.

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:32.500
But these masters themselves worked under

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.880
the tight control of guilds that enforced

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.830
artistic as well as moral
and economic standards,

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.790
and their creations were largely dictated

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.680
by eclesiastic and aristocratic patrons

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.190
who specified the form as
well as content of their work,

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.283
often down to the color schemes.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.180
Most painters and sculptors were subject

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.880
to the same rules and
systems of compensation

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.450
applied to trades and crafts.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.680
By the 1600s a few artists
successfully argued

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.690
that their work should be valued
according to its ingenuity,

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.950
and not the time it
took to make or the cost

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.240
of the precious minerals
mixed into the mediums,

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.890
and claimed a tangible value for their

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.680
individual creative contribution to

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.070
and not just execution of the form

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.763
and content of their work.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.390
Other social historians
have argued that it was only

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.670
with the emergence of
the bourgouis art market

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.520
starting in Holland in
the 1600s and spreading to

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.560
France and England in
the following century

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.690
that liberated artists from the dictates

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.233
of patrons and guilds.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.480
The emergence of an art market

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.470
in which cultural goods
circulated as commodities,

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.770
finding buyers where they could

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.160
rather than being produced on commission,

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.300
effectively separated
the process of production

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.260
from the process of consumption

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.603
and the direct demands of consumers.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.540
Larry Shiner argued that
the Western category of art

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.060
encompassing paintings, sculpture,
music, poetry, and drama,

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.710
much less free artists as
masters of their own labor,

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:09.940
didn't really emerge until the 1700s

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.680
through a process
identified by the Wittkowers

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.160
as elevation from the
rank of mere craftsmen

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.330
to the level of inspired artists.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.580
The previously shared
attributes of art and artisan

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.980
were split largely along lines
of hierarchical divisions

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.113
of manual and intellectual labor.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.810
Artisans were pulled down in the direction

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:36.590
of manual laborers as subjects
to rules of production

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:40.730
for use and the mere
copying of nature or design,

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.960
while artists were elevated
to the quasi-divine heights

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.060
of creative genius in possession
of innate God-given gifts

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:52.640
of talent to be realized in
the free play of inspiration,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.823
not the mere skill acquired
in earthly training.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.950
The historian and cultural
theorist Raymond Williams

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:03.350
describes the emergence of the
romantic vision of the artist

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.780
in the second half of the 18th century

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.680
as a further differentiation
of artists and writers,

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.450
not only from craftsmen, but
from the emerging classes

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.160
and industrial commodity
producers and workers

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.440
for the new urban markets.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.530
As both a defense against down classing

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.040
and a protest against the rationalization

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:28.030
and mechanization of labor in
the new industrial regimes,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.250
artists who had won a certain independence

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.780
from religious and aristocratic patrons

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.300
now began to assert their
independence from the demands

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.790
and tastes of consumers
of industrially produced

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.553
and mass marketed goods.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:47.010
The sociologist Pierre
Bordieu describes this process

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:51.310
of artistic "emancipation"
somewhat differently,

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.630
in terms of the emergence of
relatively autonomous fields

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.490
of artistic production,

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:01.257
that is fields capable of
"imposing its own norms

00:38:01.257 --> 00:38:04.847
"on both the production and
consumption of its products

00:38:04.847 --> 00:38:08.347
"and of fending off other
externally imposed norms

00:38:08.347 --> 00:38:10.287
"and criteria of value,

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:13.617
"including moral, political,
and economic criteria."

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.930
Like many other cultural fields,

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.960
including professional,
scientific, and academic fields,

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.640
this autonomization
involved the development

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.940
of dedicated institutions of production

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:29.420
and reception of training and consecration

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.460
that could claim the
right to self-regulation

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.950
based on their own internal integrity,

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.623
codes of ethics, and
importance for civil society.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.240
This included, importantly,
the development of institutions

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.360
of peer review and of
production for other producers

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.410
who share the same expertise,

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.470
and who are also competitors,

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.890
driving the development of that expertise

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.163
and ensuring independence
from external criteria.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.320
But the autonomization of
art was somewhat unique

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.820
in the ways it manifested in the autonomy

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.940
of artistic production itself,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.740
above all, with the institution
of the pure intention

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.290
of artists who asserted themselves

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.113
as the supreme masters of their products.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.540
This was accomplished in part
by artists giving primacy

00:39:23.442 --> 00:39:27.030
to that over which they are masters,

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.390
to the mode of representation

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:32.080
over the object of representation

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.220
to form, manner, and style,

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.227
rather than any external referent

00:39:36.227 --> 00:39:39.947
"which involves subordination to function,

00:39:39.947 --> 00:39:42.327
"even if only the most elementary one,

00:39:42.327 --> 00:39:46.337
"that of representing,
signifying, saying something."

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.030
This process of autonomization

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.097
eventually led to what
Bordieu describes as

00:39:53.097 --> 00:39:56.737
"a refusal to recognize any necessity

00:39:56.737 --> 00:39:59.687
"other than that inscribed
in the specific traditions

00:39:59.687 --> 00:40:02.247
"of the artistic discipline itself."

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.600
Artistic freedom, in
this form, thus developed

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.660
as a kind of freedom from necessity,

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.520
including the necessity
of function and use,

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.600
whether practical or communicative,

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.163
emotional or spiritual,
political or economic,

00:40:19.247 --> 00:40:22.950
and the necessity of labor
in any kind of skill or craft

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.663
as a basis to value.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:29.000
In Bordieu's analysis, however,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.890
this artistic freedom from necessity

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.280
developed within a complex social dualism,

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.170
which structured a paradoxical parallel

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.790
between the field of artistic producers

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:45.790
and the elite consumers from
whom they claimed emancipation,

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.560
but with whom they
nevertheless remained joined

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.060
in relations of patronage.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.700
Artistic freedom from
necessity had to be wrested

00:40:55.688 --> 00:40:59.240
by many artists, from
material and economic need

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.790
through a lifetime of
deprivation in proverbial garrets

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.863
and even sometimes to
exile and imprisonment,

00:41:08.233 --> 00:41:13.233
and yet, even as they
offended the bourgeois

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:18.350
as well as popular tastes,
these artists found some support

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.493
among the very patrons
they ostensibly challenged.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.470
Bordieu supposes that these patrons saw,

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:28.900
in the artistic freedoms
wrested from necessity

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.623
and domination, often by
economic privation and sacrifice,

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:38.610
a heroic figuration of their
own freedom from necessity,

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.330
that is, the freedom from need

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.633
afforded by economic privilege.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.850
And here we arrive at
one answer to the riddle

00:41:47.981 --> 00:41:50.060
of how an art that asserts its freedom

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.630
from all forms of service and use

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.750
and its autonomy from
all instrumentalities

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.860
and even avows its radicality in critiques

00:42:00.019 --> 00:42:02.140
could emerge as a favorite
instrument of investment,

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.850
if not promotion, from
many of the political

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.063
and economic powers it ostensibly abhors.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.590
It is through what Bordieu
calls the play of homologies,

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:17.120
of parallels between the forms
of freedom artists claim,

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.563
whether by privilege or privation,

00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:23.070
and other forms of political
and economic freedom

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.713
afforded by political and economic powers.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:30.630
For example, it was
through such homologies,

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:35.610
such parallels in this case
between artistic freedoms

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.860
and the freedoms not only of democracy

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.860
but of free market capitalism,
that through which,

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:48.890
American art and especially
abstract expressionism,

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:52.390
emerged as an instrument
of Cold war propaganda,

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:55.610
with the CIA's covert
funding of exhibitions

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.800
organized by the Museum of Modern Art

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.597
and circulated internationally to combat

00:43:00.597 --> 00:43:04.500
[Pro-Communist Sentiments
In Europe And Latin America,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.500
or how, more recently, with
the rise of globalization,

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.560
artists became the poster boys and girls

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.020
of the joys of global cosmopolitanism,

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.590
wittingly and unwittingly
lending their artistic freedoms

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:23.230
to the legitimation of the
freedoms enjoyed and advocated

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:27.224
by new global economic elites, the freedom

00:43:27.224 --> 00:43:32.224
of the deregulated movement
of capital and goods,

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.263
and of the privileged few
with the proper passports,

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.720
or how many artists
joined the Occupy movement

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.550
to protest increasing economic inequality

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.360
and wealth concentration,
while they continued

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.000
to participate in an art market sustained

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.173
almost exclusively by the 0.1%,

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.329
or how today, artist join the resistance

00:43:55.329 --> 00:43:58.900
to our de facto plutocratic state

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.360
and its assault on democratic institutions

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.680
while continuing to lend
our work to the legitimation

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.960
of plutocratic institutions
in our own fields,

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.500
such as museums and other
non-profit organizations

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.280
in which wealth has
become the basic criterion

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.703
for participation in governance.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.260
Only a couple of decades after Bordieu

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.760
developed his analysis of
autonomous cultural fields,

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.200
he began sounding the alarm to mobilize

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.020
artists and intellectuals
to defend what he saw

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:39.250
as growing threats to artistic
and intellectual autonomy.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.070
The weakening of peer-reviewed structures,

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:45.420
the intrusion of partisan
and governmental interests

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.230
in funding decisions,
and above all the rise

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:51.220
of economic criteria in higher education,

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:54.600
scientific research,
publishing and the arts,

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.700
subjugating research across
these and other fields

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.913
to the logic and instrumental
reason of financial markets.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:07.130
These threats have only intensified
in the past few decades.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:09.980
Today the political threats
to freedom of speech

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.430
and especially of the press, as part of

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:16.620
a wider assault on democracy,
seem the most dangerous

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.300
and I would say the most terrifying,

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.230
and yet from my
Bordieu-informed perspective,

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.180
I would say that many of
the institutions that we see

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.450
as guardians of our freedoms today

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.960
have already been
weakened from within by...

00:45:36.392 --> 00:45:38.492
That will have to wait for the discussion.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.658
- [Brett] Andrea Fraser, everybody.

00:45:41.658 --> 00:45:44.825
(audience applauding)

00:45:47.175 --> 00:45:51.508
And our final presentation
this evening, Ananya Roy.

00:45:52.974 --> 00:45:53.813
- Good evening, everyone.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.253
I'm so very delighted to be
here for this wonderful cause.

00:45:59.492 --> 00:46:01.780
Thank you Ann Marie, Vick, Brett,

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.100
and especially wonderful to be on a panel

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.633
with three women colleagues.

00:46:08.114 --> 00:46:12.700
So I am an urban studies
scholar, and urban planner.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:17.260
I study the organization
of power, resources

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.100
and opportunity, in relation to

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.950
the organization of urban space.

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:27.020
My interest in urban planning is driven

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:32.020
not by a concern for beauty
or order or efficiency,

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.423
but rather by a passion
for social justice.

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.550
I view cities as the terrain of

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:43.693
the incomplete project of freedom,

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:48.170
as places where the
unfinished freedom struggles

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:51.900
of our times are urgently evident,

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:56.538
and so my brief remarks
this evening are titled,

00:46:56.538 --> 00:46:57.488
Freedom is a Place.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.280
A few years ago, in
Johannesburg, I visited Kliptown,

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.680
the site of South Africa's
famed Freedom Charter.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.680
This charter conceived in 1955
as a congress of the people,

00:47:14.412 --> 00:47:17.187
stated, and I quote, "that
South Africa belongs to

00:47:17.187 --> 00:47:22.187
"all who live in it, black and
white, and that no government

00:47:22.297 --> 00:47:26.237
"can justly claim authority
unless it is based

00:47:26.237 --> 00:47:28.157
"on the will of the people."

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:32.840
The Freedom Charter was an
expression of fierce opposition

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.870
to the Apartheid regime
that had been established

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.933
in South Africa and that
was to last until the 1990s.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.550
The Charter envisioned
a horizon of freedom

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:49.053
amidst racial separation
and violent oppression.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.520
There is now a monument in Kliptown

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.180
commemorating the Freedom Charter,

00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:00.310
complete with a swanky hotel with a bar

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.660
which serves cocktails named after

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.523
the main signatories
of the Freedom Charter.

00:48:07.214 --> 00:48:08.047
That, of course, is how freedom

00:48:08.047 --> 00:48:10.423
is bought and sold under capitalism.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.690
But what matters most to me was this.

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:19.630
That less than half a mile from
the Freedom Charter monument

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:23.070
were the shacks of the urban majority.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.760
Kliptown is a district in
Soweto, the most famous

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:31.010
of the black townships created
by the Apartheid regime

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:34.673
to quarantine and manage
black and colored labor.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:38.630
Today, decades after the end of Apartheid,

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.143
the shacks remain.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.293
We were given the tour by Robert,

00:48:44.224 --> 00:48:48.500
who diligently keeps a
notebook of all visitors

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.500
and generously tells the
story of each humiliation,

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:56.793
each deprivation, each eviction.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.830
I, like some of you in this
room, came of political age

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:05.820
during the anti-Apartheid movement.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:10.740
That struggle defined my
generation and ideas of freedom.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.093
This is from the Mandela House in Soweto.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:17.950
When Apartheid ended,
it seemed that the dream

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:21.170
of freedom movements,
from anti-colonialism

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:23.573
to civil rights, had been fulfilled.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.300
But the shacks of Kliptown
tell us otherwise.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.700
Invisible in the shadow
of Freedom Monument,

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:35.860
they remind us that there
is urgent work to be done

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.343
in all our cities.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:41.720
The shacks of Kliptown are an example

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.560
of what Ruth Wilson Gilmore, a geographer

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.670
and key proponent of abolitionist
thought and practice,

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.430
has called forgotten places.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.710
The title of my brief
remarks this evening,

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:58.880
Freedom is a Place, is also
borrowed from Ruthie Gilmore.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.720
Forgotten places, she
notes, have been shaped

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.193
to organize abandonment.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:08.780
They have been red-lined, marginalized,

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.950
contained, erased through state policies.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:16.673
In other words, abandonment
is actively produced.

00:50:17.847 --> 00:50:19.350
Much of my scholarship has been about

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:22.003
such forms of state violence.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:27.360
For example, I study how
cities around the world,

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:31.530
Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro,
Jakarta, Shanghai, Dubai,

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:33.873
aspire to be world-class.

00:50:35.258 --> 00:50:37.730
Glittering assemblages of global capital

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.353
and extravagant construction.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:45.257
But the urban majority of
these world-class cities

00:50:45.257 --> 00:50:48.040
`are slum dwellers, shack dwellers,

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.823
migrant workers, day laborers.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.690
The paradox of the world-class city

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:58.300
is that it expels from its very premises

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.170
those who build and service it,

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:04.260
those who raise its
children, cook its meals

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.683
clean its villas and penthouses.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.230
So you see here satellite
images of Pushpa,

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.740
a community on the banks
of the river Yamuna

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.610
in the city of Delhi,
the capital of India.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.990
A community of 150,000 residents,

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:24.250
it was in existence for about 39 years,

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.560
cleared in the blink of an eye
for the Commonwealth Games,

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:31.060
which Delhi hosted in 2010.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.800
I can give you countless examples

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.720
of such evictions, of such erasure.

00:51:38.373 --> 00:51:40.733
This is necropolitics,
the politics of death,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
of the annihilation of space,
of the refusal to let live,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.103
the refusal to let exist.

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:54.180
And yet, as Ruthie Gilmore reminds us,

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:57.910
it is in the forgotten
places that we can find

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:01.453
what she calls the seeds
of grassroots planning.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:05.230
The demands of such grassroots planning

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:08.350
are not just about the
right to be in the city,

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:11.360
the right to shelter, the right to water,

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.523
they are above all about freedom.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.570
I was reminded of this when
I arrived in Los Angeles

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:23.370
three years ago from
Berkeley, and had the task

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:27.440
of establishing the Institute
on Inequality and Democracy

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.383
here at UCLA Luskin.

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.630
The Institute has benefited
from many teachers,

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:35.163
but two were crucial.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:40.320
Robin D.G. Kelley's
pathbreaking book Freedom Dreams

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.450
situated our effort to
advance housing justice,

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:49.450
decarceration, desk disobedience,
educational reparations

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.900
in the black radical tradition,

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.743
and its commitment to abolition democracy.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.720
And our second teacher,

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:02.260
the Los Angeles Community
Action Network, LA CAN,

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.380
which has fought for poor
and homeless Angelenos

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.350
for several decades now, from its location

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.953
in the heart of Skid Row.

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:14.223
LA CAN urged us as well
to think about freedom.

00:53:15.092 --> 00:53:16.550
For those of you on Twitter,

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:20.633
their hashtag is quite
straightforward, Let's Get Free.

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:27.040
Such freedom dreams are global in scope.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.930
They connect police
violence in the inner city

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:34.930
of Los Angeles to that of the
favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.550
They conceptualize, as did
the Black Panthers in Oakland,

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.010
and Fanon in the context of the

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.490
Algerian Independence Movement,

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:48.370
a revolutionary humanism
that sees ghetto and colony

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:53.230
as part of a world system of
colonialism and imperialism,

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.783
and it insists on crafting liberation

00:53:56.783 --> 00:53:59.593
through such global interconnections.

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:04.280
My own interest in homelessness, evictions

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.430
and housing precarity in
the United States was shaped

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:12.450
by an encounter many years
ago in Kolkata, India,

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.920
the city in which I grew up and which was

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.503
the subject of my doctoral
dissertation and first book.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:23.060
My research on gendered
poverty and urban displacement

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:26.500
entails ethnographic
engagement with some of

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.850
the poorest communities I will ever know.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:34.540
Those squatting in the
liminal spaces of the city

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.273
with a tenuous hold on
livelihood and shelter.

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:44.930
It was there that one day, a
young man called Ranjin decided

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:49.570
that it was time for him
to ask me some questions,

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:53.930
after having put up for about
a year with my questions

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:57.570
and he wanted to ask me
questions about America,

00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:59.840
the richest country in the world.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.203
He asked, among other
things, the following.

00:55:03.107 --> 00:55:05.377
"Are there people like us there?

00:55:05.377 --> 00:55:07.977
"I've heard that there are
lots of homeless in America

00:55:07.977 --> 00:55:10.137
"How can that be the case?

00:55:10.137 --> 00:55:12.237
"Why doesn't the government
simply allow them

00:55:12.237 --> 00:55:16.833
:to take over vacant lands
like we have, to build homes?

00:55:17.767 --> 00:55:21.217
"Aren't they citizens,
don't they have rights?"

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.230
In the face of all my
explanations, Ranjin insisted,

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:29.773
if one's a citizen, one can't be homeless.

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:32.930
Ranjin's question has stayed with me

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:37.520
because it not only exposes
the lie of American prosperity

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.980
but also the lie of liberal democracy,

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.983
and its assumptions of freedom.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.530
So it is with Ranjin's question in mind

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:49.970
that I want to in closing
turn to Los Angeles

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:53.340
and provide you with a
glimpse of some of the issues

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.780
that animate my current research.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.070
In the United States, the
unfinished project of freedom

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:03.963
is closely linked to
questions of space and place.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.630
The sociologist Douglas
Massey, who co-authored

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:12.510
a vitally important book
titled American Apartheid,

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:17.510
reminds us that residential
segregation is the linchpin

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:22.120
of racial stratification
in the United States.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:26.740
The history of urban planning
in 20th century America

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.370
is the story of how this segregation

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:32.020
was produced and maintained.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:35.400
Suburban expansion went hand in hand

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:39.700
with the redlining of black
and brown communities.

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.120
Here is one of the many redlining maps

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.200
produced by federal government agency

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.460
the Homeowners Loan Corporation,

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:49.860
in the 1930s for Los Angeles.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:53.410
Consider this map alongside this one,

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:57.990
of environmental racism, and
you will begin to understand

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:02.727
why Ruthie Gilmore reminds
us that racism is, I quote,

00:57:02.727 --> 00:57:07.547
"the state-sanctioned production
of group differentiated

00:57:07.547 --> 00:57:10.657
"vulnerability to premature death."

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:16.570
Today, the places once inhabited
by redlined communities

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:19.550
are the frontiers of gentrification.

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:22.877
South Los Angeles, Boyle Heights.

00:57:22.877 --> 00:57:25.650
Working class communities of color

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:29.020
are being pushed to the
far edges of urban life,

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.700
to the inland empire, to Antelope Valley.

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.620
They're being pushed there
not only by high rent

00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:39.730
but also through a whole
set of municipal ordinances

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:42.760
that criminalize poverty and in particular

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.253
criminalize low-income rental households.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:49.960
So did you know that in
the city of Los Angeles

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.643
it is now illegal to live in your car?

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.370
Did you that if you're
a tenant in a building

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.790
governed by a nuisance
abatement ordinance,

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:05.420
you might be evicted
if you have called 911

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:08.003
more than once during the year.

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:12.810
This is not market-driven displacement.

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:16.440
I call it racial
banishment, and it is part

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.310
of the long history of the forced removal

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:22.160
of people of color, from settler colonial

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.900
occupation and slavery to urban renewal

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.463
to today's militarized borders.

00:58:29.565 --> 00:58:32.800
But it in the face of
such racial banishments

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.580
that poor people's movements
in cities such as Los Angeles

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.723
are insisting on freedom.

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.100
In exactly two weeks from now,

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.403
California will vote on Proposition 10,

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:49.100
which if it passes, will repeal

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:53.040
statewide restrictions on rent control.

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:56.190
Tenants have been organizing
to build renter power

00:58:56.190 --> 00:59:00.863
and to remind us that the
rent is too damn high.

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:06.740
Communities from Los Angeles
and South LA to Santa Ana

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:09.570
are creating community land trusts

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:13.993
and reactivating lost
histories of collectivism.

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.050
In Boyle Heights, social
movements are fighting

00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:22.460
gentrification and displacement,
including the influx

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.823
of hipster coffee shops and art galleries.

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:29.483
In the words of LA CAN, let's get free.

00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:34.280
My work as a scholar,
and the work we try to do

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.230
at the Institute on
Inequality and Democracy

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:41.430
proceeds from a commitment
to abolition democracy.

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:43.440
By abolition, I do not simply mean

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.680
the end of the prison-industrial complex.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:51.680
I mean abolition as redistribution,
reparation, revolution

00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:56.830
and above all, what W.E.B. DuBois in 1935

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:00.230
described as black reconstruction.

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:03.540
A new state, a new public imagination,

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.480
built through the uprising of those

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.610
who have been denied freedom,

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:11.740
those who have been denied personhood.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:15.450
This is, as post-colonial
theorist Paul Gilroy notes,

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:18.660
history from the slave's standpoint.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:23.053
This is freedom, from the
standpoint of forgotten places.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.250
My closing point is this,
that as we do this work,

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:32.500
there is no obvious solidarity

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.053
between academia and banished communities.

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:41.950
Our public university itself
stands on occupied land,

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:46.073
land expropriated from
indigenous communities.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.320
We, scholars of freedom, are embedded

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.623
in the institutions of racial capitalism,

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.360
and so I leave you with a thought

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.633
that if we, the public universities,

01:00:59.715 --> 01:01:02.580
are to participate in freedom dreams,

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.580
then we also have to insist on
decolonizing the universities

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.370
and the decolonization of knowledge,

01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:13.730
on a reconstruction of our canon,

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:17.960
on a reckoning with who
gets to be at the university

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.653
and on what terms.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:24.470
For the students in the
class, you might recall

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:28.860
that one of the assignments
I asked you to consider

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:33.310
was to listen to a bit of
hip-hop, and I hope you did that.

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:34.400
Yes?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.650
I asked you to listen to a
song by the rapper J. Cole,

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:42.200
a song called "Neighbors,"
which speaks to the theme

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.503
of racial banishment and
the limits of integration.

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:50.360
J. Cole belongs to a tradition
of hip-hop that foregrants

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.000
what Michelle Alexander has
called the new Jim Crow,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.850
the forms of carcerality
and criminalization

01:01:56.850 --> 01:02:00.883
that perpetuate racial
segregation in the United States.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.270
In his latest album,
K.O.D, J. Cole raps about

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:10.670
knowledge and power, about
the curriculum that tricks us.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:13.757
He says, "One thing about the men

01:02:13.757 --> 01:02:17.067
"that's controlling the
pen that write history,

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:20.327
"they always seem to
white out their sins."

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:26.450
The dream of freedom means
changing who controls the pen.

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:31.010
It means getting very
serious about urban histories

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:35.890
and urban futures that
center forgotten places.

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:37.003
Thank you.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:40.904
(audience applauding)

01:02:40.904 --> 01:02:45.904
- Everyone, Ananya Roy.

01:02:49.914 --> 01:02:50.747
Thank you.

01:02:52.328 --> 01:02:53.840
Thank you everyone, and for our guests

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.100
and four fantastic presentations.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.193
I'd like to mix it up for just a minute,

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:02.470
after four terrific presentations,
to take a deep breath.

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:04.380
Let's take two minutes,

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.680
Each of us in the room are
sitting next to someone else,

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.430
and if you could, lean over
to someone sitting next to you

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:15.600
and ask them a question, take
a deep breath if you'd like,

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.250
stand up for a minute and shake it out.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:21.190
We're gonna bring some microphones around,

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:23.800
and open up the conversation
to everybody in the room

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.040
but more than anything, and
for students especially,

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.780
to begin to animate the
conversation around some of the

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:33.500
terrific ideas that were just
presented here on the stage.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.700
Let's take two minutes everybody,

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.750
if you'd like, get up and
shake around for a minute

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:38.033
and then we'll carry on.

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.773
Thanks everybody, I think we can bring,

01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:45.750
bring the microphones back

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:50.750
online, and what I'd
like to ask after those

01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:53.870
terrific presentations, I'm gonna turn to

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:56.684
our guests this evening,
maybe to see if there's

01:03:56.684 --> 01:03:59.590
something that's come up
between your presentations

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:00.860
that give you a thought or the basis

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.360
for a question to one another.

01:04:04.532 --> 01:04:05.753
Seanna, you were leaning in.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:09.673
- I have a specific set
of questions for Lauren.

01:04:12.108 --> 01:04:17.108
I was thinking, one way to
interpret your work is that it's,

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:21.010
for me, it kind of shows
some of the difference

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:24.010
between creativity and
freedom, 'cause it's

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:29.010
such a remarkably creative set
of interventions and ideas,

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:32.170
but I was wondering,
from your perspective,

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:36.100
while you were following
people or while you were

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.963
assisting them in Get
Lauren, did you feel free?

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.430
And how did you help your subjects

01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:47.490
to retain or regain their independence

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:51.763
after this kind of hierarchical
relationship with you?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.850
- I think was made those performances work

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.410
was that it was actually more complicated

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:02.990
than just me having control,
because on one hand,

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:05.060
yes I see them and they don't see me,

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:08.240
or I'm controlling everything
and I can do whatever I want,

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.210
but on the other hand,
and maybe because of

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:12.170
the role I chose to
take in the performance,

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:14.860
I'm tethered to them so
they move wherever they want

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.710
and I have to run after them
and try to catch that bus

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:20.740
or, you know, they're just
sitting there and watching TV

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.500
and every once in a while, might ask me to

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.730
make them some popcorn,
and I'm sitting on the edge

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:27.130
of my seat, waiting for the
next thing they might want

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.100
and maybe there's an
eight-hour time difference

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.230
'cause they're in another country

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:35.230
and I'm up at 4 AM, so I think that,

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:40.040
that relationship of us both
having some amount of control

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:44.958
and some amount of lack
of it, bound us together

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:48.470
and made it more complicated than just

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:50.573
one person watching another.

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:55.290
And I think maybe that's trying to get at

01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:57.743
some of these systems of
control and surveillance

01:05:57.743 --> 01:06:01.590
that we're within, yeah,
so maybe Google's watching

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:04.090
or the government or whoever,
but even those networks

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:09.090
are so complicated that it's
not, it's not so simple.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:13.040
The structures that are put in
places, who holds the power,

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.940
and I think I tried to start to pull apart

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.090
that messiness and understand.

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:20.060
- [Seanna] But would you
end up agreeing with me

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:23.380
or resisting that, your
work kind of shows that

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.250
innovation and freedom are not identical?

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.183
It's highly innovative, highly
innovative relationships,

01:06:31.859 --> 01:06:34.840
not free on either end,
and that you can be

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.210
on the bottom of a power
relationship or on the top

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:40.230
of a power relationship
and neither can be free.

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.360
'Cause some of what you
said just suggests thaT,

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.430
I'm wondering if you agree.

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:46.830
- Yeah, I would agree, and
I think the other part too,

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:51.560
that there's, even if
you're on the bottom,

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.730
there's space to find creativity,

01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:56.930
and that may or may not
satisfy a desire for freedom

01:06:56.930 --> 01:07:01.130
but it's, I think it's something,
it's some sense of agency.

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:02.563
That's more than nothing.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.834
- Well, if I could maybe jump in there,

01:07:06.834 --> 01:07:10.282
because I would say that you are enacting

01:07:10.282 --> 01:07:14.650
your artistic freedom in that
work, as well as creativity,

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:16.520
in the way that you framed it initially,

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.100
which is freedom within constraints

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.640
that you yourself construct.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.590
Although they're not
entirely constructed by you,

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:27.330
but they're chosen constraints,

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:32.330
so within that work, even
if you take up a position

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:37.470
that is constrained or
not necessarily in control

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:42.550
or entirely free, it's
your own construction

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.170
within your own sort of system,
your own artistic system

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:52.170
which you yourself are
constructing within your, you know,

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:57.123
freedom as an artist, so
that's how I would understand.

01:07:59.832 --> 01:08:01.810
- I think there's another
part which I didn't,

01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.290
there's another part of the
explanation about these projects

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:06.920
which is especially when you're using

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.570
some of these technologies like there are,

01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:11.840
the creative act itself
might have some freedom to it

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.710
but I'm, for example, putting
an app in the app store,

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:16.340
and just to get the app in there

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.600
was this whole process of negotiation,

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.510
and then by doing so,
maybe I've outsmarted Apple

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:25.460
and I've gotten my slightly
subversive app into their store

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.010
but I'm holding up and
continuing this system

01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:32.120
where they get to say which
software is acceptable to users,

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.020
which is appropriate and which is not.

01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:40.610
- One of the points that comes
up in Seanna's presentation

01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:42.950
that's echoed in a couple of the others

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:47.090
is the idea that freedom
is a concept that evolves,

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.850
it isn't just a thing or a fixed moment.

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:52.520
In the legal sense,
it's a set of principles

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.880
that evolve and change in
time, in a disciplinary sense

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.720
the arts as we know
them go through changes

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.540
agreed on by larger audiences
or members of the community

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:07.030
and I'm just wondering
how that kind of a notion

01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:10.120
might relate to where
and how those communities

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.120
sit within cities physically,
including the idea

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.170
of the arts themselves
as evolving communities

01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:20.940
in different parts of the
city, and the relative degrees

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:24.513
to which freedom are or aren't
available to those members.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.950
- The part where you said,
for me, underlying that

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:33.950
is sort of something that is
perhaps more foundational,

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.100
and that goes back to
the closing points of

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.730
Seanna's presentation, the closing point

01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:42.570
of Andrea's presentation, so Seanna,

01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:45.880
you left us with what I
thought was a very beautiful

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.880
and optimistic call to think
about deliberative speech

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.810
and the ways in which we
might be able to listen,

01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:58.530
even to that which is not spoken,

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:01.553
and particularly in the context,
for example, of strikes,

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.860
and Andrea ended with the
current historical conjunction

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:11.860
which we find ourselves, and
the particular regime in place

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:17.250
and the various assaults on the most basic

01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:21.740
of democratic freedoms,
and I'm wondering then

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:26.340
what it means to think about,
and this is a rather obvious

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.250
and perhaps cliched question,
about what it then means

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:31.800
for us to think about
the freedom of speech

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.000
and who is entitled to
the freedom of speech,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.940
but also what that means then
if we are to listen carefully

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.440
and to speak with and
even listen to silence,

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.740
since one thing, and I'm going to say this

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.230
very bluntly and crudely,
it's one thing when it's

01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:49.230
striking workers with
whom we feel solidarity

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:53.257
and we see as making
possible, as you note,

01:10:53.257 --> 01:10:56.720
our intellectual work, and it's another

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.843
when it's right-wing nationalists.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.313
Or is it not?

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:09.840
- [Seanna] Well, I think it's
really important to listen

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:16.163
and not to think that listening
is a sign of agreement,

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.470
but that we can't make progress together

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:26.620
until we understand each
other, and that does involve

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:30.453
trying to figure out why
people think what they do.

01:11:32.073 --> 01:11:37.073
So I do think it includes listening to

01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:42.610
right-wing nationalists and
also responding to them directly

01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:47.810
and candidly, but yeah, I
am gonna take that view.

01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:53.300
- I also think that this
relates to the question

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.860
that Brett just asked me,
because in the sort of

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.205
the communities that I was talking about,

01:11:59.205 --> 01:12:00.540
so if you talk about
banishment communities

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.440
that have faced organized abandonment,

01:12:05.415 --> 01:12:09.010
they would argue that certain
forms of speech and action

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:12.750
have sought to erase
them, as we have seen with

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:17.293
the erasure of transgender
identity in people, personhood.

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:20.350
Right, so this is the
dispossession not only of lands

01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:24.090
in cities, but this is the
dispossession of personhood.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.670
It's a sort of violence, it's an erasure

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:29.683
of the very grounds of existence.

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:35.450
So I'm trying to figure out what listening

01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:39.970
in those contexts means,
given this sort of

01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:43.970
profound inequality, which
to me is at the very core

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:47.710
of liberal democracy, and
so how then do we listen

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:50.690
or particularly, if the
means of communication

01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:53.506
which in this case we might call the media

01:12:53.506 --> 01:12:58.330
in the United States, are
also thoroughly eroded,

01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:02.160
how then, what are the spheres
within which we listen,

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.160
what are the means through which
we might be able to listen?

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:12.090
- [Seanna] Well, I agree with
you that the corporate control

01:13:12.090 --> 01:13:17.090
of the media, as well as the
normalization of positions

01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:21.400
that are associated with
the erasure of communities

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:26.400
is appalling, and an aspect
of changing that is to

01:13:26.649 --> 01:13:30.393
engage in a variety of forms
of anti-trust of the media,

01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:32.780
to look at greater sources.

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:35.900
I encourage everyone to
read different newspapers

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.913
than the ones they normally read.

01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:42.010
Not just because there are lots of stories

01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:44.810
that are not being told, but because

01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:47.360
you need to understand what
other people are thinking

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.590
and reading and consuming,
and then asking people,

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:53.550
what stories do you
think aren't being told?

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:54.760
Why aren't they being told?

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.330
Why don't you know the
answers to that question?

01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:59.880
Why didn't you know
before you came tonight

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.560
that it's become illegal
to live in your car?

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.550
How is that not something that was on

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:06.393
the front page of the LA Times?

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:12.380
I think starting, everyone
demanding to know these things

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.700
and engaging in legal reforms

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.100
is part of the way I would
try to approach that.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.100
- One of the points very much touched on,

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:29.870
really in different ways
across the four presentations

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:34.710
is almost a plea for forms of agency.

01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:36.850
Listening, in fact, can be thought of

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:39.910
as a form of agency, in its own way,

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:42.420
That action as we know it might fit in

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.380
how we operate within discipline,

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.040
in relation to contemporary technologies,

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.810
in a complex urban space
like a global city,

01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:53.300
and that's one of the things
that's being touched on

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.940
in the design of a course
like that, like this one,

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.240
to think of a member of an audience

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.240
as a form of agency and
not simply a setting

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:06.330
for a spectacle or an event to play out,

01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:09.400
to be simply received by
members of that community,

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.800
but that to come together in a room

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.050
is a kind of agency that allows
for the asking of questions

01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:18.670
in addition to whatever one
might be put on the stage

01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:20.460
to kick off a larger conversation.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:22.300
I use that all as a little segue

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.840
to what I hope has taken place

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.490
while the conversation has begun here,

01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:29.070
which is we've got a couple of microphones

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:32.350
that ought to be moving
around the room already.

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:34.030
I asked you to take a minute or two

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.430
to rehearse a couple of questions,

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:39.200
or to comment to one another,
your neighbors nearby,

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.510
about things that you've seen and heard.

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:42.950
I'm gonna ask the students especially

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:44.400
to kick off the kind of questions

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.500
that can carry the conversation forward.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.930
Please.

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:50.910
- [Student] So my question's
for everyone on the panel.

01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:54.030
If we believe we're free,
does it actually confine us

01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:56.350
and not allow us to see
how we impose surveillance

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:58.700
on ourselves, and not allow us to see

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:00.610
how we internalize and regurgitate

01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:04.113
capitalism and other
oppressive institutions?

01:16:05.272 --> 01:16:06.170
So in a sense, how can we critique

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:08.010
when we are in Plato's cave

01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:10.573
and perhaps have no real
conception of freedom?

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.140
- I couldn't understand...

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.256
- I think the first part of the question

01:16:15.256 --> 01:16:18.610
was a bit hard to hear, so
hold the microphone close.

01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:21.160
The first part of the
question especially was hard.

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.670
- [Student] So if we believe we're free,

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:26.870
does it actually confine
us and not allow us to see

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:29.740
how we impose surveillance on ourselves

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.650
and not allow us to see how
we internalize and regurgitate

01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:35.883
capitalism and other
oppressive institutions?

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.413
- That was easier to
hear, the second version.

01:16:43.804 --> 01:16:46.209
- I could still se a
repetition of the question.

01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:48.785
I am kind of new so it's really difficult,

01:16:48.785 --> 01:16:50.435
but you guys might have heard it.

01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:53.970
- Freedom in the context of

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:56.050
being embedded in capitalism, right?

01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:58.280
How can we think of ourselves as free

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.360
if we are very much a part of
these systems of capitalism?

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.520
Is that the question?

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.350
I'm sorry to oversimplify it.

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:07.063
All right, okay.

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:13.890
- I'll start by saying a
couple of standard things.

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:16.820
None of us will be free
until all of us are free.

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.670
We're not gonna experience full freedom

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:24.670
until everyone is correctly
empowered to live their lives,

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.595
but we can appreciate a part of freedom

01:17:28.595 --> 01:17:33.595
by exercising our imagination
and our critical thinking,

01:17:34.206 --> 01:17:35.039
to imagine what it would be like

01:17:35.039 --> 01:17:36.883
to live with each other in a better way.

01:17:41.112 --> 01:17:42.480
- So I would follow on
that, so one of the concepts

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.580
I like using in my work
is I try to think about

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:49.180
whether abolitionist
urban planning is possible

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.123
and whether it's possible to be at

01:17:51.123 --> 01:17:53.520
a public university, which
see as an institution

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.080
of racial capitalism,
and is it possible for us

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.200
to advance the work of social justice?

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.960
It's a concept that comes
both from post-colonial theory

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.920
and from black studies,
is the idea of doubleness,

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.810
that we are on the one
hand cogs in the machine,

01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:10.223
and yet we have the
possibilities of insurgency.

01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:14.410
That we are part of the
system and yet we have

01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:19.016
the ability to say no, right,
to these structures of power,

01:18:19.016 --> 01:18:23.360
and that is not as simple
as individual agency.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.020
To me this has to do with projects

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:30.020
of collaboration and solidarity
with the freedom struggles

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.980
that we enlist ourselves
in and that we insist on

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.720
becoming a part of, and on thinking about

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.010
how the very terrain of disciplines

01:18:38.010 --> 01:18:40.240
has been shaped by these struggles

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.148
and therefore when we belong,
we're not just belonging,

01:18:43.148 --> 01:18:46.292
as Andrea's presentation made it clear,

01:18:46.292 --> 01:18:48.807
to a generic notion of capitalism

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:53.410
but to the ways in which
our very fields of inquiry

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:56.910
have been shaped by
this political economy,

01:18:56.910 --> 01:19:00.070
so I'm very interested in the
ways in which I see myself

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:04.787
not as innocent, but very
much a part of these systems,

01:19:04.787 --> 01:19:08.290
but yet from within
it, from the very heart

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:11.080
of imperial power or racial capitalism,

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.960
being able to not only advance a critique,

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.713
but think about imaginations
and practices of liberation.

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.410
But that's, as I said, for me personally,

01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:24.580
that comes through the
difficult and patient work

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:29.580
of solidarity with what I
called forgotten places.

01:19:32.972 --> 01:19:35.970
- So my tradition of practice
is institutional critique,

01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:40.490
which I understand as a
kind of critically reflexive

01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:44.000
critique of one's own
interests and investments

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.560
and privileges in the specific fields

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.763
and institutions of one's activity,

01:19:49.936 --> 01:19:52.210
and the way that I think
about the possibility of that,

01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:54.860
partly is the possibility that's rooted in

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.670
always what's a partial
freedom, a relative freedom,

01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:02.670
a relative autonomy, of one
field relative to another field,

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:09.920
of a particular set of practices or values

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.920
or discourses or
institutions as they develop

01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:20.860
in relationship to other fields,

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:25.860
so that's why I went down
that road in my presentation.

01:20:35.491 --> 01:20:37.400
Working with the notion
of relative autonomy

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.220
and applying it to freedom...

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:48.163
Within the framework of capitalism, yeah.

01:20:52.437 --> 01:20:55.990
(audience laughing quietly)

01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:57.543
How do I do that exactly?

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:05.180
You know, to the extent that we're up here

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.903
with our particular
discourses abour freedom,

01:21:08.903 --> 01:21:13.310
whether they're disciplinary
or politically rooted,

01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:16.650
we're up here because we're enabled by

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:20.450
the conditions and traditions
of this institution

01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:24.230
and our individual fields,
our particular field,

01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:27.073
to develop and articulate those critiques.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.300
And no, it's not a total freedom,

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.180
it's a relative freedom
within a set of constraints

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:39.820
that we have to challenge
ourselves to work within, to test,

01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:46.100
to reproduce, to defend to the
greatest extent that we can.

01:21:49.150 --> 01:21:54.150
From my perspective, in an
embedded, sort of site-specific

01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:59.750
and also reflexive way,
because as sort of pressing

01:22:01.256 --> 01:22:06.256
and terrifying the threats
from outside of our fields

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:14.540
and institutions are, I
think there's threats...

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.230
The threats from within our institutions

01:22:21.230 --> 01:22:25.979
that weaken our institutions
and make them vulnerable

01:22:25.979 --> 01:22:30.979
to attacks from white supremacists,

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:39.460
that make them vulnerable
to corruption by plutocrats,

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:47.460
are in fact, the threats that
we have the power to engage

01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:51.343
most directly and most effectively.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.900
- Yeah, I think, if we're
talking about freedom

01:22:57.900 --> 01:22:59.420
in the sense of free will, even if you can

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:03.610
take off capitalism or
you take off a particular

01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:05.433
government or political structure,

01:23:06.503 --> 01:23:08.030
just the expectations that we have

01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:10.107
of each other socially, limit us.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.960
I'm not rolling on the ground right now,

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.403
I'm sitting in a chair
just like everyone else.

01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:20.350
So I think maybe it's more
helpful to think about

01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:23.430
agency or as Andrea
said, what can we change?

01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:27.550
So maybe, yes, you're not free
of the system of capitalism,

01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:30.180
you're not free of the
inequalities that we have

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.310
all around us, but if you
can start to see them,

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:35.460
then you can also start to
see, what can you change?

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.360
What can you do?

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.773
So what action is there
some freedom to maneuver?

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.795
- Terrific, you right here.

01:23:45.795 --> 01:23:47.697
- [Student] Thank you.

01:23:47.697 --> 01:23:49.240
I just wanna say, I love public education.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.023
Thank you ladies for
fortifying it in California.

01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:56.420
So I'm a two-time Bruin, went to LA USD

01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:58.490
and I'm a teacher in LA USD now,

01:23:58.490 --> 01:24:01.430
so our teachers are heading into a strike

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:03.483
with more and more momentum each week,

01:24:04.799 --> 01:24:06.990
and we're taking issue
with the encroachment

01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:11.990
of big business in K-12 public
education, specifically.

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:18.500
It seems incompatible,
you have big business

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.410
where the primary principle
is greed over everything else,

01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:26.410
and public education where
it's human development

01:24:26.410 --> 01:24:30.843
before anything else, so let me ask you,

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:34.880
given this encroachment of big business

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:39.880
in K-12 public education,
what are the links between

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:45.200
public education and
freedom in a democracy?

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.460
And I also want to say, Professor Roy,

01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:52.870
as I was listening to you, I
couldn't help but reminisce

01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:56.000
on Professor Jacqueline
Leavitt, rest in peace.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.700
She had a tremendous impact on me,

01:24:58.784 --> 01:25:00.384
and you two, Professor Shiffrin.

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.838
You guys understand my
question, or should I...

01:25:03.838 --> 01:25:04.671
- I got your question.

01:25:04.671 --> 01:25:05.504
- We got it.

01:25:05.504 --> 01:25:07.000
- I think they got it.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:07.833
- Thank you.

01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:12.140
- [Seanna] I'll go first again.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:12.973
- Yes.

01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:18.400
- [Seanna] You asked
about what we think about

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.400
the relationship between public education

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.970
and democratic freedom.

01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:24.810
I won't speak for everyone
else, but I'll say

01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:27.630
that I think it is one
of the most important

01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:30.700
foundational aspects of a democracy,

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:34.610
that we fund all of our
citizens as children

01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:39.610
and all residents as
children, to be together,

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.260
to be together and to learn together.

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:46.770
And the reason why
that's vitally important

01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:50.800
is because we're then going
to try to cooperate together

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.060
and govern together.

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.200
The whole point of a democracy is that you

01:25:58.684 --> 01:25:59.840
live with one another and
cooperate with one another

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.430
and the ideal of public education

01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:07.430
is to introduce all different
kinds of people to each other

01:26:07.775 --> 01:26:10.650
and to give them new experiences

01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:12.580
that are different from the experiences

01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:14.820
that they get in their own homes.

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:19.240
That is, to ask children to
learn how to cooperate with

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:24.240
one another, just based on the
fact that they're residents.

01:26:25.573 --> 01:26:30.400
And so, I think that you can't
really have a vital democracy

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.530
unless you have a vital
public education system

01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:35.480
that everyone is asked to be a part of,

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:41.090
but it will only work, and
this relates to Ananya's work,

01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:45.440
if we don't allow residential
segregation to introduce

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.500
the separation that public
education is supposed to solve,

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:53.715
and I grew up in Los
Angeles and I was part of

01:26:53.715 --> 01:26:58.290
the desegregation
movement, and it is one of

01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:01.200
the best things that ever happened to me.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.950
Getting on a bus and meeting people from

01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:06.610
different neighborhoods
and different walks of life

01:27:06.610 --> 01:27:10.580
was the most important part
of my education as a person,

01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:13.700
and I think one of the
worst things that we did

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:17.905
was to eliminate
desegregation in education

01:27:17.905 --> 01:27:21.613
and to fail to solve
residential segregation.

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:28.293
- I agree.

01:27:29.312 --> 01:27:32.479
(audience applauding)

01:27:34.675 --> 01:27:35.760
- So I just wanted to build on that

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.090
because defending and
fighting for, quite literally,

01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:41.930
the public university has been for me

01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:44.010
one of the most important
things I do in my career,

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:46.590
so I was on the faculty at Berkeley

01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:49.580
when the massive tuition hikes happened,

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:54.150
and we were quite literally
on strike, at the barricades

01:27:54.150 --> 01:27:56.630
in solidarity with students and workers

01:27:56.630 --> 01:28:00.113
as they occupied buildings on campus.

01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:04.610
And I think that those
uprisings were important

01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:07.840
because it made it clear
to the state legislature

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.750
that we were not going to be defeated,

01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:13.510
that we were gonna fight
for higher public education,

01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:17.990
and I say this at the same
time as we were also fighting

01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:20.150
for the decolonization of the university.

01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:22.860
So we recognize precisely
that while we're defending

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.920
public education, we have
to think about the ways

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.400
in which residential
segregation then shapes

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.560
the nature of public education.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.170
As we fight for the public university,

01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:35.994
we've got to think about who gets to be at

01:28:35.994 --> 01:28:37.550
the public university, and does this

01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:40.347
really look like the state of California?

01:28:40.347 --> 01:28:44.620
And if not, then how do we change that?

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:47.100
But the point that,
the reason why I smiled

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.420
when you asked that question, is because

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:53.290
I ended by referring
to the work of DuBois,

01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:55.800
and his idea of black reconstruction

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:58.870
and one of the most beautiful
passages in that book,

01:28:58.870 --> 01:29:03.870
written in 1935, is when
DuBois talks about schools,

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:08.870
public schools as a shining
example of black reconstruction.

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:11.610
The story he tells is of how in the south,

01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:13.530
after emancipation with the formation

01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:16.900
of the Freedman's Bureau,
there was a hunger

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:20.610
among freed slaves for
education for their children,

01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:23.830
and what existed primarily
in the south were not

01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:26.573
what he calls the common
school or the public school.

01:29:28.025 --> 01:29:29.360
And it is out of the meager resources

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.540
of the Freedman's Bureau that
we get in the American south

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:37.007
the public school as we
now know it in the south,

01:29:37.007 --> 01:29:42.007
and for all children of
all races and all classes.

01:29:43.015 --> 01:29:47.860
And he talks about sort of
a state of reconstruction

01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:51.030
built out of the uprising of the black man

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:54.530
with these dreams of
freedom, and for him then,

01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:56.510
the formation of the public school

01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:59.400
in the part of the country
where it didn't have precedence

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.200
was one of the most important parts

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.433
of reconstruction and democracy.

01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:09.510
- [Student] I have a question
over here, right here.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.810
So I think one thing that connects all of

01:30:13.810 --> 01:30:18.810
the four speakers is
that, a desire for freedom

01:30:19.238 --> 01:30:21.300
or a desire to step outside of these

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.610
social, economic and political systems

01:30:23.610 --> 01:30:27.110
that restrict that freedom,
but I think my question is

01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:30.960
is how can we find freedom within that,

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.787
or can we find freedom at all?

01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:58.270
- [Student] Hi, I'd like
to ask a follow-up question

01:30:58.270 --> 01:31:01.160
to that, because it seems
like all of these things,

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.360
in talking about freedom, we
have to talk about bravery

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.480
and the opposite side of that, like fear,

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:11.710
so how do you face that fear

01:31:11.710 --> 01:31:13.770
when you're handling these situations,

01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:15.320
when you're putting yourself on

01:31:16.203 --> 01:31:18.080
the brink of what's your security

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.860
to face up against some of these issues?

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.230
- That's such a great question
and I think it sort of

01:31:23.230 --> 01:31:26.120
begins to, gives us a different angle

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.670
on the questions we're hearing.

01:31:28.741 --> 01:31:31.040
So Seanna raised Colin Kaepernick,

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.850
and for a while my pinned tweet

01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:38.170
was about what it might mean
for social justice-oriented

01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:40.193
urban planners to take a knee.

01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:43.170
What would be the sacrifices

01:31:43.170 --> 01:31:45.323
that we are willing to undertake?

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.520
Because his act of
defiance, his insistence

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:55.520
on making visible black
death, has come at a price.

01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.550
And one can say, of course,
now it's all been made right

01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:02.350
by Nike, and let's not talk about Nike

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.823
and racial capitalism, right?

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:08.043
But that aside, it's quite clear

01:32:08.043 --> 01:32:13.043
that Kaepernick will not play
football again in the NFL.

01:32:14.876 --> 01:32:16.000
And what it's made evident is of course,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.463
the plantation economy that the NFL is,

01:32:19.822 --> 01:32:24.250
so he's taken a knee and
there's been a sacrifice

01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:28.020
and so I think that is a
very important question

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.300
around what are those sacrifices

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:32.920
and one sees extraordinary sacrifices

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.960
on the front lines of freedom.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:39.050
I'm very interested often
in what tenured faculty,

01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:41.070
who I think are some of the most protected

01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:44.290
livelihoods and bodies in
the country at the moment,

01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:47.130
what is the knee, are we
willing to take a knee

01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:48.633
and for what purpose?

01:32:49.871 --> 01:32:53.038
(audience applauding)

01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:59.230
- [Student] Hi, hello,
and thank you to everyone

01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:01.750
for sharing their perspectives on freedom.

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:04.120
This question's primarily
to Professor Roy,

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.740
but feel free for anyone to answer it.

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:10.530
What role does architecture
play in designing

01:33:10.530 --> 01:33:13.023
more equitable and more free cities?

01:33:14.565 --> 01:33:16.731
- And you're asking a person
who's not an architect.

01:33:16.731 --> 01:33:18.031
(laughing)

01:33:18.031 --> 01:33:21.180
There's always this
fight between architects

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.340
and urban planners about
who produces the city.

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.450
And I hope you all noticed
his Dodgers t-shirt.

01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:29.473
Yeah? Okay.

01:33:34.279 --> 01:33:36.850
So I think the question
about the role of architects

01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:39.030
or urban planners goes
back to the questions

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:40.980
we've heard repeatedly.

01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:44.950
So if we think about
architecture and urban planning

01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:47.530
as professions and disciplines
that have a history

01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:51.673
somewhat different than,
perhaps, the history of art,

01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:54.960
but if we subject them to the same sort of

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.350
institutional critiques, then we arrive

01:33:58.350 --> 01:34:02.020
at a quite dismal place around our role

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:04.123
in designing equitable cities.

01:34:05.049 --> 01:34:07.100
So I can't speak about
and for architecture,

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:09.533
but particularly can't
speak for architecture.

01:34:09.533 --> 01:34:11.457
I can speak about it.

01:34:11.457 --> 01:34:13.390
But let me talk about urban planning,

01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:16.170
and particularly because
this quarter I'm teaching

01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:18.690
the Histories and Theories
of Urban Planning class

01:34:18.690 --> 01:34:20.687
that all first year master
students in urban planning

01:34:20.687 --> 01:34:23.240
and all first year PhD students take,

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.140
and my students keep
wanting me to give them

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:28.659
a message of hope, and I'm
like, there is no hope.

01:34:28.659 --> 01:34:30.981
(audience laughing)

01:34:30.981 --> 01:34:34.480
So to me, that place of
agency then, to call it that,

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:39.480
comes from a place of
critique and a historitization

01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:45.610
that recognizes that the
landscapes of segregation

01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:47.840
that my students and I want to dismantle

01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:51.453
were produced by our profession.

01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:56.010
These weren't unintended effects,

01:34:56.010 --> 01:34:58.363
these weren't, oops we made a mistake.

01:34:59.770 --> 01:35:02.570
This was the intention of urban planning

01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:05.060
for much of the 20th century.

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:07.300
And if we start from that place,

01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:11.390
then we get to a different
set of discussions

01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:14.840
about the agency of urban
planning and urban planners

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.210
in building equitable landscapes.

01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:20.053
One of the things I'm very
interested in at the moment,

01:35:20.944 --> 01:35:22.610
taking a cue from the
movement of Black Lives

01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:25.250
and their national
platform, is how we must

01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:28.810
think about reparations,
and I like to think

01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:32.248
about reparations not just as acts

01:35:32.248 --> 01:35:35.290
in relation to specific communities,

01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:37.360
but what might it mean for the discipline

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.580
and profession of urban
planning to make reparations

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:44.570
for the redlining and environmental
racism that we produced?

01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:49.080
If that's a starting point, how
then do we think differently

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.280
about our role in
producing equitable cities

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:55.223
not as good intentions,
not as benevolence,

01:35:56.606 --> 01:36:01.010
but from a place that
recognizes our history

01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:02.403
in introducing segregation.

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:07.777
- [Student] I had a question over here.

01:36:07.777 --> 01:36:09.400
So there were a few comments
that I heard you guys make

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.370
for the questions and
also from the speakers

01:36:11.370 --> 01:36:14.510
about how there's no possible
way that we can be free

01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:18.380
until everyone has freedom,
but I personally think

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:21.550
that with all the
unspoken rules in society

01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:24.380
and the belief that
people have in their own

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:26.360
aberrant definitions of
freedom, there's no way

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.310
for all of those things to
align, so I'm not saying

01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:32.590
there's a point to giving
up that fight for freedom,

01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:34.963
but do you think there's
freedom in resistance?

01:36:37.913 --> 01:36:38.746
- [Seanna] Sure, well.

01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:43.300
What I meant to be saying
is that I don't think

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:47.470
we can fully achieve our
potential to be free together

01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:51.162
until everyone is enabled, for example,

01:36:51.162 --> 01:36:54.890
to live free of intense
material insecurity,

01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:59.400
or the risk of discrimination
or coercion or domination,

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:04.400
but all of us in a variety
of ways, can be partly free.

01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:07.967
We can exercise freedom of thought,

01:37:07.967 --> 01:37:12.100
we can exercise freedom of
speech to limited degrees,

01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:16.180
subject to a variety
of insidious influences

01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:18.430
on our minds through advertising,

01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:23.258
through limited channels of communication,

01:37:23.258 --> 01:37:28.258
but we all have that ability to engage in

01:37:28.530 --> 01:37:32.800
various forms of freedom,
including resistance

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.780
and the way I like to be a
little more hopeful, perhaps,

01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:41.770
is to think that we probably
aren't going to achieve

01:37:41.770 --> 01:37:45.560
full justice in our lifetime,
but we're gonna see progress

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:50.560
if we try, and we try as a
collective, and contributing

01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:57.720
to our freedom and the
freedom of future generations

01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:01.600
is a way of being free,
it's a way of being

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.600
part of a historical project
that culminates in justice,

01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:09.533
assuming we solve the
climate change problem.

01:38:09.533 --> 01:38:12.407
(audience laughing quietly)

01:38:12.407 --> 01:38:16.100
But all these efforts to be
free are, I agree with you,

01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:18.793
an aspect of exercising freedom.

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.200
And I want to say this one other thing

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.760
to the person who asked
the question about bravery.

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.974
I want to say that all
of you who have spoken

01:38:27.974 --> 01:38:29.670
have been very brave.

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:33.156
I know that it's very
hard as a student to talk.

01:38:33.156 --> 01:38:35.510
I'm a shy person, it's
hard for me to be here

01:38:36.939 --> 01:38:40.160
but although you might
start thinking about

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.510
the large sacrifices you might make,

01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:45.530
I want to encourage you to
use the freedom that you have,

01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:49.490
you all have the freedom
to participate in classes,

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:51.770
to talk to friends, to talk to colleagues,

01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:55.380
to talk to faculty members,
and all of those conversation

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:57.590
where you ask "What's on your mind,"

01:38:57.590 --> 01:39:01.410
rather than what you think
you should say are always,

01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:04.210
you can start to kind of push the envelope

01:39:04.210 --> 01:39:05.790
and ask yourself, what am I really

01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:09.540
gonna be free to be able
to do, and you'll practice

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:13.710
being a citizen and participating
in this collective project

01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:16.693
of aspiring to liberation.

01:39:20.388 --> 01:39:23.555
(audience applauding)

01:39:26.826 --> 01:39:28.330
- [Student] I have a question.

01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:29.580
I'm sorry to...

01:39:32.157 --> 01:39:34.990
So my question was
mostly from Lauren's work

01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:40.020
about Buddhists subverting the messages

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:43.060
that the software industry gives us,

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:45.600
and I was just wondering
if any of you guys

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.770
really had an opinion
about the contrast between

01:39:49.770 --> 01:39:53.680
the message that the
tech industry gives us,

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.820
which is that we're giving
you this new gadget,

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:59.590
it's gonna free you,
and the actual effects

01:39:59.590 --> 01:40:03.570
that the industry has on the
communities it's embedded in,

01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:07.240
which tends to be this very
extreme social stratification

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.590
between the engineers who work there

01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:13.230
and the people who live
within the communities

01:40:13.230 --> 01:40:14.680
that are now being displaced.

01:40:19.266 --> 01:40:21.800
- Yes, I think it's a huge problem.

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:25.400
I think one of the
things that the industry

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.780
has worked really hard to
do is to elevate the people

01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:31.530
making these technologies,
to make them seem very elite

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:36.570
when actually, a lot of you
are sort of hackers already

01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:38.770
in the way that you figure
out how to use your apps

01:40:38.770 --> 01:40:41.000
and it doesn't work or it
doesn't update and you figure out

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.632
how to reappropriate it
for your own purpose.

01:40:44.632 --> 01:40:45.960
Or maybe some of you have learned to code

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.250
or learned to design or
learned to build things,

01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:50.490
and so it's not that
different but they want to

01:40:50.490 --> 01:40:54.050
draw this line between the
user and the developer,

01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:57.050
user and a producer, and I think that

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:58.960
one of the best things you can do

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.570
is to start breaking down that line,

01:41:01.570 --> 01:41:03.481
because as soon as that doesn't exist--

01:41:03.481 --> 01:41:05.786
(audience applauding)

01:41:05.786 --> 01:41:06.619
Yeah!

01:41:06.619 --> 01:41:07.870
Because as soon as that doesn't exist,

01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:09.360
then it doesn't make sense anymore

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.690
for just a small group of people

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:14.023
to live in Silicon Valley
or actually, San Francisco.

01:41:16.210 --> 01:41:19.900
- Can I just say that
someone who doesn't study

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.413
technological capitalism,
that studies cities in which

01:41:23.413 --> 01:41:26.233
technological capitalism takes root,

01:41:27.221 --> 01:41:31.700
on one hand we can think
about the forms of enclosure

01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:35.650
that have been put at
work, an enclosure of

01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:39.200
the digital commons, but
an enclosure of our cities

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.800
so I spend much of my academic career

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:45.640
in Berkeley and Oakland and San Francisco,

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.850
and the San Francisco Bay
area has been devastated

01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:51.270
by technological capitalism.

01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:54.240
The forms of gentrification
and displacement

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.310
that have been unleashed,
not just simply by

01:41:57.310 --> 01:42:00.450
technological capitalism
as in big tech companies,

01:42:00.450 --> 01:42:04.120
but the state subsidies,
right, to these companies

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.260
are incredible, and there
are some very important

01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.880
propositions on the ballot,
local propositions on the ballot

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.880
in San Francisco coming up,
particularly around a tax

01:42:14.530 --> 01:42:17.850
on tech companies that would help fund

01:42:17.850 --> 01:42:21.980
shelters for the homeless, and the CEOs

01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:23.930
of some of our favorite companies,

01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:26.370
and I'm thoroughly complicit
here because I use Twitter

01:42:26.370 --> 01:42:29.990
all the time, but the
CEO of Twitter and others

01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:33.593
have had some of the most
horrible things to say

01:42:33.593 --> 01:42:36.690
about homeless men and
women, and have taken

01:42:36.690 --> 01:42:41.070
very strong positions
against any sort of taxation

01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:44.550
of tech wealth, particularly to help those

01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:47.403
who are facing housing
precarity and homelessness.

01:42:48.438 --> 01:42:50.180
So this remains a very real concern,

01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:53.340
sort of the Silicon
Valley effect, if you will

01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:56.386
on some of the processes that I was

01:42:56.386 --> 01:42:57.786
talking about earlier today.

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.960
- Everyone, I'm gonna
have to wrap it up now.

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:03.003
I've just had a chance to see the clock.

01:43:03.891 --> 01:43:05.390
I want to thank everybody
for coming in this evening,

01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:06.470
as we do every week.

01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:09.410
I'd like to close the session
and turn to our guests

01:43:09.410 --> 01:43:11.460
to see if any of you have anything to say

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.740
as a closing statement,
offer you the opportunity

01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:17.080
to say something if it
hasn't been said yet.

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:20.640
And otherwise, we will
close the evening out.

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:23.540
Is there anything that any
of you would like to...

01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:25.610
- I guess I just wanted to say
that I've been sitting here

01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:30.610
feeling like the vastness
of the collective inequality

01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:34.990
and disparity is sometimes overwhelming,

01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:37.360
and this question of how can we be free

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.010
until everyone's free, and
when is that gonna happen,

01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:44.580
and where is the hope, and I think for me,

01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:47.840
thinking about my own work,
a lot of it comes out,

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.940
I'm obsessed with this idea of control

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:52.710
and social expectations, and
a lot of that comes out of

01:43:52.710 --> 01:43:55.340
an experience of when I
was a really young child

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:59.250
and I felt coerced into doing something

01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:03.710
by an older adult, and
ever since just fascinated

01:44:03.710 --> 01:44:05.810
by this idea that nobody
was holding me down

01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:07.740
but I felt I had no other options,

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:09.840
and so for me sometimes I see myself

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:11.670
playing out the same
dynamic, I'm setting up

01:44:11.670 --> 01:44:14.220
these systems so someone can control me,

01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:17.810
and I've made that kind
of, set this all up

01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:19.233
for myself in some way.

01:44:20.575 --> 01:44:22.060
And on one hand, I can
think that it's twisted

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:24.470
and on the other hand I
think, well, I found some way

01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:27.870
to have some piece of control
back, some kind of agency,

01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:30.990
even if I'm replaying out these things,

01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:32.770
to mean I have some hand in it now.

01:44:32.770 --> 01:44:35.010
So maybe one thing I've
been thinking about

01:44:35.010 --> 01:44:39.140
with all this conversation
is, we absolutely need to

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:42.560
keep thinking about how
do these larger system,

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.430
what role can we play within them

01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:46.525
and how can we change them?

01:44:46.525 --> 01:44:47.930
At the same time, how can
you get a handle on something

01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:50.050
so that you do feel like
you have a sense of power

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:51.683
to actually enact the change?

01:44:52.857 --> 01:44:53.826
- Thank you.

01:44:53.826 --> 01:44:54.737
Andrea?

01:44:54.737 --> 01:44:57.904
(audience applauding)

01:45:02.554 --> 01:45:03.387
- Well there were
question after question of

01:45:03.387 --> 01:45:06.520
how can we be free, how
can we find freedom,

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:11.520
and I was coming to this from
a kind of critical perspective

01:45:11.890 --> 01:45:14.820
on freedom, that is the forms of freedom

01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:19.390
and discourses of freedom that
are also highly ideological

01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:22.830
and partial and have
existed over centuries

01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:24.513
as forms of privilege.

01:45:25.410 --> 01:45:28.940
So the important point
of, we can't be free

01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:32.630
until everyone's free, I
was on a panel years ago

01:45:32.630 --> 01:45:36.950
about censorship that wasn't
picketed but leafleted

01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:41.138
by adjunct faculty who
had tried to organize,

01:45:41.138 --> 01:45:45.490
and I began that statement
by quoting Eugene Debs,

01:45:45.490 --> 01:45:48.840
the American socialist,
who said famously...

01:45:50.199 --> 01:45:51.980
Oh god, what did he say?

01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:53.373
Now I can't remember.

01:45:54.683 --> 01:45:55.516
Oh, come on.

01:45:55.516 --> 01:45:57.333
Oh, don't do this to me.

01:45:58.470 --> 01:46:01.667
The last line is, "As long
as there's a soul in chains,

01:46:01.667 --> 01:46:04.677
"as long as there's a man
in chains, I am not free,"

01:46:06.348 --> 01:46:08.907
but "As long as there is
a lower class, I am of it.

01:46:08.907 --> 01:46:12.587
"As long as there is a
criminal element, I am in it.

01:46:12.587 --> 01:46:16.402
"As long as there is a man
in chains, I am not free."

01:46:16.402 --> 01:46:17.485
- [Brett] Wow

01:46:18.325 --> 01:46:21.595
- So I'll close with that.
(audience applauding)

01:46:21.595 --> 01:46:23.178
- Seanna or Ananya?

01:46:25.408 --> 01:46:26.647
- [Seanna] I just want
to say the following.

01:46:26.647 --> 01:46:29.020
These are such important topics,

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:32.340
and I've been kind of
urging that we think about

01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:36.980
more conversation, but the
question that the student asked

01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:39.840
reminded me of the fact that

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.430
technology has empowered
conversations between us

01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:45.940
internationally and
notionally, immediately

01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:50.940
in ways that were inconceivable
40 or 50 years ago,

01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:56.020
but it has also created
intense social expectations

01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:58.240
of certain kinds of immediate exchange,

01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:59.610
and there's an argument to be made

01:46:59.610 --> 01:47:03.790
that the quality of our discourse
has really deteriorated.

01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:07.080
We write fewer letters,
we write quicker emails,

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.473
we write 160-character communications,

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.400
and there's another side to
the technological capitalism

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.630
which is that all of these changes

01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:21.500
were made in a non-democratic way

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:24.560
and mostly by companies
for their own profit,

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:27.210
and if we're thinking a little bit

01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:31.040
about democracy and bringing
democracy to corporations

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.360
as a way to think about improving
the discourse between us,

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.850
but more practically, 'cause some of you

01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:38.930
want a practical thing,
let me just say this.

01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:41.450
It feels weird that we've
been having this conversation

01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:46.220
about conversations, but (laughing)

01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:48.070
very few of us in the room have talked.

01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:49.960
If anyone wants to talk
to me about this stuff,

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.980
you're welcome to come to my office hours.

01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:54.572
They're on the web, I'd love to meet you

01:47:54.572 --> 01:47:56.470
and talk to you and hear what you thought.

01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:57.447
- Thank you.

01:47:57.447 --> 01:47:59.917
(audience applauding)

01:47:59.917 --> 01:48:00.750
Thank you.

01:48:01.831 --> 01:48:03.410
Ananya, any closing?

01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:08.410
- So, I wanted to end with a
very flawed form of freedom

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:12.560
that we live with and
which serves as a premise

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.200
for this sort of gathering
which is academic freedom

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.037
and with the ascendance of Mr. 45,

01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:24.773
I refuse to call him President,

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.460
I think it's become
ever more apparent to me

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:32.350
that academic freedom
is important, precious.

01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:35.110
It's always been thoroughly limited

01:48:35.110 --> 01:48:38.460
and as I said, deeply
flawed, and yet in many ways

01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:42.080
the power that we hold is
that of academic freedom,

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.860
not just those of us
who are tenured faculty

01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:47.350
but in belonging to
this incredibly powerful

01:48:50.486 --> 01:48:52.670
knowledge-producing
institution, we are a part

01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:54.510
of academic freedom, and I would ask us

01:48:54.510 --> 01:48:57.980
to think about how we use that freedom

01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:02.403
to make possible wider
projects of freedom.

01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:05.576
- Perfect, thank you Ananya, thank you.

01:49:05.576 --> 01:49:07.898
(audience applauding)

01:49:07.898 --> 01:49:10.210
thank you everybody so much for coming in.

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:12.460
Please join me in thanking Seanna, Andrea,

01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:15.681
Lauren, and Ananya for
coming in this evening,

01:49:15.681 --> 01:49:16.580
for a terrific conversation.

01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:19.873
Thank you everybody, we
will see you next Tuesday.
