00:00:05.478 --> 00:00:08.964
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.434
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:18.520
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So
Shad, I thought maybe

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.900
we could begin with how you
got started on the investing

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.610
journey?

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.320
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Well, my father

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.016
was in the advertising
business for most of his life,

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:30.390
and he recommended to me that
I buy some Central Airlines

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.390
with some money I made in the
summer on a construction job.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600
So I bought 200 shares
of Central Airlines

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.610
at $2.25 for $450.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.560
And I met the Chief
Executive Officer,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.050
whose name was Lamar Muse.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.160
And they came over to my
parents' house one time

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.860
and had dinner.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.070
And my mother's dog bit
his wife on the nose.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.345
They didn't leave, but
it went to show you

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:57.400
he was a good sport
and resilient.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.000
So that was something
kind of funny.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.430
But anyway, the stock went up.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.800
It was acquired about a year
and a half later by Frontier

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.660
Airlines for $14 a share.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.146
So $2.25 turned into
$14 pretty quickly.

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:12.895
And I just thought,
this beats sitting out

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:16.460
in the sun carrying
forms around.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.680
And I was hooked for life.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.792
And that was a good
success to start with.

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:21.250
I had a lot of
failures after that.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.090
But I kind of figured
it all out eventually.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.391
Maybe I have, I don't know.

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:24.890
We'll see.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.134
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Wow.

00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:28.002
So did you start
investing right away, or--

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:29.960
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Well, I bought a little.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.668
So I'd hear something,
and I'd buy stock,

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.600
and just hearing
something about a stock

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.584
isn't a very good
investment system,

00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:37.500
because you hear it from
people who don't know

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.555
what they're talking about.

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.929
It took a while to figure out
who did know what they were

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.350
talking about and who didn't.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.260
But I'm always fascinated by
it and always interested in it.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.770
And you know, I kid
around about myself,

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.805
but my wife took me to
this event every year

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:54.515
called "Art About Town."

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.400
And you would bid
on paintings, and I

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.470
would bid on paintings
for less than I

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.724
figured the frame value was.

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:01.640
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Less
than the frame value?

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.710
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Less than the frame value,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.001
because I was a value investor.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.230
And so people would say, well,
did you make money doing it?

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.710
I said, no, I never
recognized a penny--

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.240
they're all horrible.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.268
But at least, I had
some cheap frames.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.020
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Wow.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.450
Shad, I think somewhere
in the mid '70s,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.574
you also started a banking or
a brokerage operation, right?

00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:25.990
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
I worked for this firm called

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.780
Schneider, Bernet &amp; Hickman.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.220
And I was a Syndicate Manager.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.547
I would bid the new issues.

00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:32.130
I would look at the
new issues and try

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.320
to get the firm into the deals.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.850
And then I left
there, and you know,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.580
I wanted to start
my own firm, which

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.530
I called Rowe and Company,
Investment Bankers/Brokers.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.030
We really were just
a brokerage firm

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.280
and did a little investment
banking, but not much.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.920
And then I did that and
traded for the firm's account

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.770
and made a little money.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.592
And then in 1985, I
decided to start a fund

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.300
to share the joys of
short selling, which

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.940
I was doing a lot of,
because the skyline in Dallas

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.460
was just pure cranes--

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.930
like it is here, now.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.060
But you know, there were
see-through buildings

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.809
everywhere, and I
figured somebody bad was

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.940
going to happen, so I
started short selling.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.690
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
Were you short selling

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.359
stocks or real estate?

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.900
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Well, stocks--

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.402
bank stocks, real estate stocks,
real estate-related stocks.

00:03:19.402 --> 00:03:21.360
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: What
was the thesis, there?

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.750
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: The thesis

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.900
was it was terribly
overbuilt, and everyone

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.180
was going go broke, which
I was absolutely right on.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.880
And they did.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.100
And so I wouldn't
say that was fun,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.012
but it was good to be right.

00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:36.720
In fact, if I'd saved
my money and waited

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.550
until things really
broke down, I

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.930
could have made some great buys.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.970
And it just shows how every
dark cloud has a silver lining

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.732
kind of deal.

00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:47.110
So I could've done--

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.234
it's just a matter of which
side you're looking at it.

00:03:50.234 --> 00:03:51.900
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
Do you think getting

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.170
the timing right was important
with the short selling?

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.150
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Of course it was, sure.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.835
And you know, you know
what I found out was that--

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:04.660
if you buy stock, and it goes
down, the most you can lose

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.550
is the money that you put up.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.690
And as it goes down some more,
you have a smaller problem,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.200
and you don't worry about.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.390
But if you short a
stock, and it goes up--

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.570
you're just sick, you
can't even breathe,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.694
because you can have
unlimited loss potential-- you

00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:22.770
could die and be incapacitated
and lose every dime you have.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.870
There's an overpriced stock
service I took for a while--

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.890
late '80s-- and they
recommended shorting Microsoft.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.770
And every couple of
months, they'd say,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.720
hold for a better exit point.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.520
Well, hell, they
lost all their money.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.640
So it's not a good
solid business,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.250
and when I was doing it,
interest rates were high,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.495
real rates were high,
and broker's call

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.479
was about where the prime was.

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.770
So if you put up treasury
bills and then shorted stock,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.870
you'd get a broker's call
on the short position, which

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.600
would mean that you'd be
up 15% when you started,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.655
and it was pretty good.

00:04:58.655 --> 00:05:00.630
And now, of course, you
have to pay to borrow them,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.190
so you're down when
you start, so there's

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.910
a big difference, there.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.610
I didn't figure that
out until later,

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.031
but that's why it
was attractive.

00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.030
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Right,
and taxes also were--

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.615
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Oh,
taxes were also the same.

00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:12.240
There were the same
taxes on dividends

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.170
and interest and short sales,
and short-swing profits

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.490
and long-term profits.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.680
Everything was taxed the
same, so it didn't matter.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.470
And so that was another
little added factor.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.580
Plus, you really
never had to cover.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.250
You could take the money
and pair the trades off,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.780
you know what I mean--

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.280
cover it versus the
box, which would

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.740
mean you could
buy it back-- hold

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.544
a long position and short
position, all at $0.25 a share

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.085
or something.

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:38.460
You'd never have to
pay taxes for it.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.180
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
Could you explain

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.620
that a little bit, Shad, for us?

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.786
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Sure.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.940
You know, if you're shorting
versus the box of stock,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.137
you would borrow the
shares that you had bought

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:53.970
and deliver them against
your short position

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.710
or hold them against
your short position.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.361
So you would have covered,
but not recovered.

00:05:58.361 --> 00:05:59.860
But everything would
be blocked out,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.366
and you could just
keep the tax money.

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:05.850
And then that was outlawed
in the Tax Rule of 1985.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.785
But that made it a little
bit better business then.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.076
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So you
were getting paid to borrow,

00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:13.190
the taxes were
favorable, and the market

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.014
was not fairly valued
according to that.

00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:17.430
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: No, and
there was a lot more retail

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.720
investing then than there
was the last few years.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.100
So not as smart.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.400
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So why
did you give up short selling?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.649
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
it becomes all-consuming.

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:30.990
You know, you'd think you'd
feel better about it as you

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.690
get older, but it hurts worse.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.782
And my mother,
typically, would just

00:06:36.782 --> 00:06:38.490
always try to be
optimistic about things,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.537
and one time, she said--

00:06:39.537 --> 00:06:42.120
Shaddie, don't worry, I'm sure
something terrible will happen.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.844
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:43.844 --> 00:06:45.510
And that didn't make
me feel any better,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.360
but that was sort of the idea.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.920
You know, you were looking
for bad outcomes all the time,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.010
which, you know,
it's a happier life,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.292
if you're looking
for good outcomes.

00:06:55.292 --> 00:06:57.750
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: And so
after you gave up short selling,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.989
you moved on to finding small,
local companies in Texas.

00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:02.780
Can you talk to us a
little bit about that?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.363
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Well, actually,

00:07:04.363 --> 00:07:06.680
in the time between
Central Airlines--

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.240
I also owned small companies,
I owned Southwest Airlines

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.700
when they had three and
then four airplanes--

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.980
so I knew something about
the airline business,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.432
and I knew something
about advertising business

00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:17.890
a little bit,
because of my father.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.790
And so I was sort of set up--

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.240
I owned some things
on those lines.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.610
And I find that one kind
of door leads to another,

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.110
and everything is
kind of connected.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.870
We're all connected.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.230
And so, between my father--

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.260
and you know, who I'm much
more friendly toward now

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.290
than I was when he was
alive, unfortunately--

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.440
but you could kind of get a
feel for different businesses.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.034
So in the end, the shorts would
eventually turned into longs.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.700
I bought back-- I
owned-- it was short--

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.610
WPP Group in 1991, and
then covered in '92

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.180
and covered in '91 and
then ended up buying it

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.090
and made a lot on it.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.392
And Southwest Airlines,
I did very well on.

00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:01.850
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
So when did you

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.944
buy your first shares
of Southwest Airlines?

00:08:03.944 --> 00:08:05.360
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: About 1974.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.500
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: 1974?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.360
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: That's about--

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.520
I still have some.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.880
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: You
still have the same shares--

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.005
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: No,
no, not the same shares.

00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:14.702
I sold most of it, but the
stuff is very valuable.

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:15.998
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Wow.

00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:20.015
Would you know how much the
revenues have compounded by

00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:21.390
or the stock price
has compounded

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.160
by since you bought it?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.118
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Oh, it was probably 27%.

00:08:24.118 --> 00:08:24.830
It was huge.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.480
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
20% over 30+ years.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:26.740
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Yes.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.860
It's amazing what it did.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.090
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: What
was it about how Southwest

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.230
that got your attention?

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.890
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Well, Lamar Muse.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.820
He's the same guy that was
the head of Central Airlines.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.205
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Right.

00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:35.720
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: And
so I felt like I knew him.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.531
And it was obvious to me that
they were doing something

00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:39.530
better, faster, cheaper.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.988
They were flying between Dallas
and San Antonio and Houston

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:44.570
on a tight schedule and
doing it for not much

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.470
than the price of a bus ticket.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.900
So the traffic was expanding.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.109
They were stimulating the
market, and it was growing.

00:08:50.109 --> 00:08:51.691
And they did that
everywhere they went

00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:52.880
all over the United States.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.460
And now, they've gone abroad.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.409
And you know, it's
a better story.

00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:57.950
They have one airplane
that they fly.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.117
They just threw an
engine out, I saw.

00:09:00.117 --> 00:09:01.200
It was on the news, today.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.499
But it was just a once in
a lifetime kind of deal.

00:09:07.499 --> 00:09:09.290
And to do it in an
airline is very unusual,

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:14.075
because really it never has
shown loss in all these years.

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:16.481
And other ones went
broke all the time.

00:09:16.481 --> 00:09:18.230
But they didn't put
their customers first.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.676
They put themselves first.

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:22.550
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: And
their employees, too.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.150
They treat--

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.780
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Yeah,
they treat everybody well.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.370
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
--very well, yeah.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.570
So around 15 years ago, maybe,
or a little older than that,

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.040
you changed your outlook again--

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.590
focusing on companies
that can scale--

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.024
do things faster, better,
cheaper for the customers.

00:09:36.024 --> 00:09:37.190
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Yeah.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.606
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: How did
this change happen, and maybe,

00:09:39.606 --> 00:09:41.340
give us some examples?

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.710
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
it was part of an odd man

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.460
out kind of thing.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.550
You know, if you own
stock in a company,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.360
you're kind of second rate
compared to the management.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.620
You know, they don't
always tell you the truth,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.000
and they're manipulating you.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.250
But if you think the company
is really doing something

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.080
for the stakeholders, for the
shareholders, for the customers

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.510
than for themselves, you
feel a lot better about it.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.670
So I feel better as an
investor if I've invested

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.840
in a company like that.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.990
So better, faster,
cheaper, and for-- and

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.500
not to-- the customer, and to
the delight of the customer.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.799
And be on a scale
that if it works in--

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:20.340
oh, and another
thing in advertising,

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.214
I did-- this WPP Group
I talked to you about,

00:10:22.214 --> 00:10:25.470
where Martin Sorrell
just left, he got fired.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.120
But he said that the
word globalization

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.601
is a misnomer, that the better
word is Americanization.

00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:34.100
People all over the world really
want to live the way we do,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.810
here.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.393
I don't know whether
you believe that.

00:10:36.393 --> 00:10:38.185
I think there's something to it.

00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:38.660
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Yeah.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.760
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: So
if it's a success here,

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.610
it can be a success elsewhere.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.810
And that's certainly
been the case of airlines

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.490
and of Starbucks,
Amazon-- you know,

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.680
all these companies operate
throughout the world.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.470
And you know, you used to talk
about the law of large numbers.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.140
Well, hell, you need
to own a stock that

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:57.980
has a large number,
because there

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.688
are a large number of
people in the world

00:10:59.688 --> 00:11:03.110
and a large number of
square miles to cover,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.860
and you've got to get out there
before someone beats you to it.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.290
I think these big companies
have a huge advantage, now.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:13.820
Rather than big, cumbersome
oafs, like they used to be,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.160
they're really big and
strong and powerful,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.227
and they just win-win-win.

00:11:18.227 --> 00:11:20.310
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So
following up on that, Shad,

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.180
recently I think you
wrote about the necessity

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.250
of large numbers--

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.590
that large numbers are not
just needed to compete,

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.112
but to actually succeed.

00:11:29.112 --> 00:11:30.320
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Right.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.131
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
So can you talk to us

00:11:31.131 --> 00:11:32.130
a little bit about that?

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.130
Why do you think large
numbers are a necessity?

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.520
And maybe give us an example
of a company that you think

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.807
has efficiency going for it?

00:11:38.807 --> 00:11:41.223
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: We can't
talk about Google, can we?

00:11:41.223 --> 00:11:41.586
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Uh.

00:11:41.586 --> 00:11:43.044
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: I'm teasing.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.980
Well, all of them, really.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.400
You know, Southwest Airlines
now is going to Mexico.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.940
They're going in the Caribbean.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.150
They're big enough
to do it, and no one

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.430
would sit aside
and let Southwest

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.664
do to them what they did.

00:11:56.664 --> 00:11:58.705
I mean, Southwest, I think
couldn't happen again,

00:11:58.705 --> 00:12:00.890
because people are just smarter.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.710
I think that board
compositions have changed.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.660
I think the people
are more attentive.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.400
And you know, the kind of
dull, kind of half senile Chief

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.215
Executive Officer who sits
there and acts like a dictator--

00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:13.840
they're over.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.040
And women on the boards
have helped, I think.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.015
And there is just
more visibility,

00:12:19.015 --> 00:12:22.904
and it's hard to be as
secretive as people used to be.

00:12:22.904 --> 00:12:24.320
I think that
governance is better,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.050
and I think the opportunities
are better perceived.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.440
And investors
aren't any smarter,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.239
but I think the whole investment
situation has improved.

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:36.280
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: And
I think you also stressed

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.110
on efficiency, right, Shad?

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.739
And you say that Costco is not
just efficient, but elegant.

00:12:41.739 --> 00:12:43.530
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Oh yeah, it's great.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.730
It's fun to be there,
fun to shop there.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.290
You save money.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.405
You get great products,
you get great value.

00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:52.880
You see the same people there.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.647
And I think the shopping
is sort of an adventure.

00:12:55.647 --> 00:12:56.355
It's kind of fun.

00:12:56.355 --> 00:12:59.270
And they put things in the
store just to get you back.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.228
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: How
did you approach Costco

00:13:01.228 --> 00:13:02.870
as an investment decision?

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.029
Did you--

00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:06.070
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Well, I liked going there.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.640
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: OK.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.345
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: It's
probably as simple as that.

00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:10.636
I thought, if I like it,
other people probably like it,

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:12.722
and they do.

00:13:12.722 --> 00:13:15.360
You want to save money,
you want to get value--

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.860
you don't care about
the brand name.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:25.096
I mean, the brand-- what
is it, Kingwood, is it?

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.695
It's great stuff.

00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:28.070
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
The Kirkland?

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.670
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Kirkland.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.680
Well, I'm losing my
mind, here, but yeah.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.560
It's really good.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.780
I like everything about it.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.720
One time, I was at
this investment group,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.754
and the deal on the
dinner we were going to

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:43.920
was that the person who had
the worst bottle of wine

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.610
had to buy dinner.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.660
And so I went, and I
took a bottle of wine

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.236
that my wife had picked out
from Constellation Brands.

00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:51.860
I can't remember the
name of it, but it

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:57.280
was a 92 on the wine or
whatever board, or something.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.290
But anyway, I heard the
waitress complaining and saying,

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:04.130
this wine is flawed,
the cork is no good.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.095
And then they didn't put
wrap it up in tin foil,

00:14:07.095 --> 00:14:07.970
so I know what it is.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.195
I said, all right, I give
up-- it's me, I'll buy dinner.

00:14:11.195 --> 00:14:16.250
And I wrote a letter
to Jim Sinegal,

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.300
saying that I'd had this
horrible experience.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.930
And by golly,
Constellation Brands

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.910
sent me a gift
certificate for Costco

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.616
to give me my money back.

00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:30.990
You know, I just made
a huge profit on it

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.291
and bought more stock.

00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:35.540
And then I did the same thing
to McDonald's and talked

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.500
about something terrible
that happened there.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.090
And I got a form letter back--

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.450
sorry for your bad
experience and just nothing.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.090
But you know, that's sort
of a heroic response--

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.750
just going overboard,
bending over backwards

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.930
to make people happy.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.900
And if the customer comes
first, you get ahead.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.134
And if it doesn't,
you get behind.

00:14:56.134 --> 00:14:58.050
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So
I think when you said--

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.466
customer comes
first, I'm reminded

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:01.850
of another one of your
nice characterizations

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.500
about stage one companies,
stage two companies,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.000
and stage three companies.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.019
And these aren't to do
with size of the company

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:08.935
or age of the company.

00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:10.455
They're with how the company--

00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:11.960
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: How they act.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.293
In stage one-- everything's
new-- you're doing something

00:15:14.293 --> 00:15:16.250
better, faster, cheaper
for the customer.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.630
Your stock is soaring.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.088
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Can you
give us examples of each stage?

00:15:20.088 --> 00:15:23.467
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well, any
little company that takes off.

00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:26.050
Southwest Airlines has been kind
of stage one the whole career

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.186
it's had.

00:15:28.186 --> 00:15:30.950
And stage two is maybe
like a Starbucks,

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.600
where they start selling
tea and different food

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.500
and trying to get more
money from the same person.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.730
And stage three is most airlines
and banks and everything else,

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.135
where there's no question
they're out to get you.

00:15:46.135 --> 00:15:47.510
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
So how do you

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.335
detect this change between
stage two and stage three, Shad?

00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:53.960
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well, I'm
a customer, just like you are.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.918
It's obvious, isn't it?

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.204
That's what I think.

00:15:59.204 --> 00:16:01.370
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So what
are the hallmarks, Shad,

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.695
of a great business?

00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:05.820
Like, these stage two,
stage one kind of business--

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.390
what are the hallmarks?

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.280
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Well, I would

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.240
love to find a business that was
doing something better, faster,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.900
cheaper on a scale that
could be taken globally,

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.940
that I'd seen it work in
the United States, that

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.230
had great management.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.021
You know, I don't know
how you define that,

00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:18.380
but you know it when you see it.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:24.410
And some valuation that somehow
you could think was reasonable.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.210
And that sounded like that--

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.900
I was laughing the other day
about that David Allan Coe

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.050
song.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.992
You know, what was it--

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.450
I think your song is perfect,
but you haven't said anything

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:40.680
about mama or trains or being
drunk or falling off the bus--

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.370
but all the
ingredients are there,

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.070
just like the ingredients are
there for a perfect stock.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.440
And you're always looking
for the perfect stock.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.950
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
Do you do you

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.930
focus on capital
intensivity at all, when

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.360
you look at a great company?

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.140
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Capital
intensiv-- capital what?

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.730
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
Capital intensiveness--

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.240
how they use their
balance sheet.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.680
Are those things you look at?

00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.490
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Well, I look at it.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.172
But I presume they
know more than I do,

00:17:01.172 --> 00:17:02.630
so I'm not too
judgmental about it.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.660
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: OK.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.076
So let's invert
that a little bit.

00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:07.550
You know, like Carl
Jacobi and Charlie Munger.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.932
So what are some things you
want to avoid in a business?

00:17:09.932 --> 00:17:12.140
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
If you were still short,

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.250
I'd want the same thing.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.454
You know, if it's not doing
better, faster, cheaper,

00:17:15.454 --> 00:17:16.579
it's doing something worse.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.470
It irritates people.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.160
They don't like it, and
business is going down.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.099
And it has no
potential overseas,

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.420
because it has no potential
in the United States.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.746
You'd invert it, and it
would be perfect inversion.

00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:31.870
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Are
there industries or sectors

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.920
that you would avoid?

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.780
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
I don't think that way.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.821
I think of the ones that
I would be attracted to.

00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:38.680
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: OK.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.250
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
And clearly, technology

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.299
is an area--

00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:43.840
home building is
kind of interesting,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.820
because all the Millennials
are living at home,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.540
and their parents are
getting tired of them.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.100
And I think they'll buy
houses at some point.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.090
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Technology
and home building are sectors--

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.050
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Yeah,
kind of the whole modern home,

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.470
you know, the smart home.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.440
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Right.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.370
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: So
I know this guy that runs

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.167
a [? Pull-T-- ?]

00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:09.000
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
[? Pull-T ?] group, yes.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.625
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Yeah, and then I

00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:12.624
don't think it matters
too much, but they're all

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:14.920
going to have it, when
the technology finally

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.340
brought in house to--

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.790
bring the house
into the modern age.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.190
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: If it can
continue on another Charlie

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.530
Munger-ism--

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.139
we learn more from our
mistakes than our successes.

00:18:26.139 --> 00:18:28.180
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: I
oughta know a lot, then.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:30.699 --> 00:18:32.490
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So
after short selling,

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.156
you know, once you
moved to being a long

00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:36.300
and being a consumer
focused investor,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.144
what are one or two
mistakes you've made

00:18:39.144 --> 00:18:40.310
that you want to talk about?

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.810
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: One of those,

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.060
I don't want to talk about.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.809
And the smaller companies--

00:18:45.809 --> 00:18:48.100
there was a company in Dallas
called Employers Casualty

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.120
Insurance Company that
did workers compensation.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.637
And it was a cheap, cheap stock.

00:18:52.637 --> 00:18:54.220
And it had always
been a great company

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.150
and had a great balance sheet.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.955
And the management
wouldn't talk to me.

00:18:57.955 --> 00:18:59.920
And I presumed that meant
that it was so good,

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.160
they didn't want to
share the information.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.540
And so I bought it.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.590
And they wouldn't return the
phone call, and it went broke.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.520
That's a bad example, or
a good example of that.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.030
Another one-- you know, I had
some success with Southwest

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.740
Airlines several times.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.830
And I got very interested
in Greyhound buses.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.550
And even my wife said, what
are you thinking about--

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.300
no one rides a bus.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.610
And you couldn't
see that no one was

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.330
on the buses, because
the windows were tinted.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.420
So that was a painful one.

00:19:34.136 --> 00:19:36.010
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So
you probably picked up

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.056
a lot of trading techniques as a
short seller, looking at price,

00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:43.247
volume, maybe margin
calls, technicals.

00:19:43.247 --> 00:19:44.330
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: No.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.581
I didn't learn anything.

00:19:45.581 --> 00:19:48.064
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:48.064 --> 00:19:49.480
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
So do you look

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.510
at anything other
than the customer

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.630
experience and fundamentals
when you invest in a business?

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.005
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Well, it's

00:19:57.005 --> 00:19:59.680
nice if the stock is off
for the wrong reason.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.120
That's always a good one.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.740
They're panicked
about something--

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.156
the shareholders
are panicked over

00:20:05.156 --> 00:20:07.030
something they shouldn't
be panicked over.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.280
That's a good reason to do it.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.200
You get a better
bargain that way.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.240
But I think in the
long term, it doesn't

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.990
make that much difference
when you buy it,

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.110
if you buy the right company.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.170
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So let's
focus on that a little bit--

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.000
the valuation, right.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.710
How do you approach
valuation when

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.540
deciding to buy a business?

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.950
What is an upper bound
you're willing to pay?

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.519
How do you arrive at that?

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:31.060
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Well, I'd just

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.760
want to see how you can pay
10 times what you thought it

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.040
was eventually going to earn.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.880
That would be OK with me, if
you had a pretty high degree

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.110
of confidence in it.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.174
Because with interest
rates where they are,

00:20:43.174 --> 00:20:45.340
you've got to think what
you can do with your money.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.620
And if people say,
well, the market

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.640
is very overpriced,
and the NASDAQ

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.510
sells at 33 times earnings
or whatever it sells at--

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.740
well, you know, what's the
yield on a 10-year government?

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.385
3%-- that's 33 times earnings.

00:20:58.385 --> 00:21:00.397
And that's the most
they're going to earn.

00:21:00.397 --> 00:21:02.480
So the companies have a
chance to earn a lot more.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.080
So I think stocks are
probably cheap relative

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.567
to your choices of what
you can do with the money.

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:09.775
Real estate isn't any better.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.970
Farming-- well, I don't know
what you're going to do.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.650
But your choices are limited.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.320
You know, stock is people,
it's real estate, it's capital,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.880
it's machines.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.460
It's being put together
by smart people,

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.000
working and creating
value and growing--

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.670
pretty exciting.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:32.310
And it doesn't excite people
very much, now, but it will.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.070
They haven't thought it through.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.880
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So once
you buy a stock, ideally, Shad,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.110
you never want to sell it.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.800
You write fairly well that
selling creates two problems,

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.760
right?

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.250
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Right.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.780
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: The tax
problem, and the problem when--

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.440
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Then you pay taxes,

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.620
and you've got to
replace the investment.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.649
You've got to be right twice.

00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:53.440
All you've got to do
on a real growth cycle

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.859
is to be right once.

00:21:55.859 --> 00:21:57.400
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
But sometimes you

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.490
still have to sell, Shad.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:59.040
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Sure.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.414
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: And do
you sell because the situation

00:22:01.414 --> 00:22:04.280
changes, or do you sell also
sometimes because the price

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.862
runs up too much?

00:22:05.862 --> 00:22:06.820
How do you think of it?

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.319
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
I've done a little bit of that.

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:12.620
You know, this WPP Group,
which I bought years ago--

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.370
I sold some in 2000.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.870
It was selling at a crazy price,
and didn't get it all sold,

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.280
but I kept it.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.694
And then you know I knew
Martin Sorrell and watched him.

00:22:21.694 --> 00:22:23.110
But then I watched
other companies

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.840
come along, like this one.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.400
And you know, it was hurting
their business very badly.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.040
So I eventually sold it.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.864
And I made good sales, too.

00:22:36.864 --> 00:22:38.280
That would be a
reason-- you know,

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.040
if the business is
fundamentally changed

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:46.079
by technology or by something
that they haven't done.

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:48.620
That would be the reason to sell
it, or the management's bad,

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.810
or something had changed
that you could see.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.580
But not because it didn't show
relative strength or something

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.070
crazy like that.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.720
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Shad, if we
can shift gears a little bit,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.120
you've spoken about the
need for pension funds

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.180
to be simple in their
investing process.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.890
And recently, there
have been incidents

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:11.134
of funds that have invested
in exotic foreign agriculture

00:23:11.134 --> 00:23:13.850
and things that
didn't work out well.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.300
Why do you think this
happens, and what

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.847
can be done to improve this?

00:23:19.847 --> 00:23:22.430
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: If you'll
think of yourself as a stock,

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.000
I think it helps.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.310
You know, you have more money
coming in than going out,

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.220
hopefully, and you all are
in there to buy stocks,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.169
and your estate grows.

00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:32.460
And you get a better job or
you don't get a better job,

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.480
but you're spending
less than you're saving,

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.266
then you're grow up and you're
going to be rich old guy

00:23:39.266 --> 00:23:41.600
or girl or whatever.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.395
And that's the way it works.

00:23:43.395 --> 00:23:45.020
And these pension
funds have more money

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.920
going out than coming in.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.190
And compound interest is the
eighth wonder of the world,

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.966
but when it's working against
you, you can't beat it.

00:23:52.966 --> 00:23:54.965
That's what's happening
in these pension funds--

00:23:54.965 --> 00:23:57.480
they promise more
than they can deliver.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.080
And so they're saying
they're making money--

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.780
or they're only 75% funded,
or something like that.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.410
But really, they're
going to go broke.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.400
And you can be an
alarmist about it.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.150
I got fired--

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.983
I was the Chairman of
the Texas Review Board

00:24:12.983 --> 00:24:15.140
for 12 years or something.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.870
And you know, Governor
Perry finally fired me.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.670
He got tired of listening,
tired of hearing me.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.522
But compound interest
is a wonderful thing

00:24:25.522 --> 00:24:27.230
to have on your side
and a terrible thing

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.205
to have working against you.

00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:30.830
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
Do you think that's

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.977
likely to change in the
coming years, the way--

00:24:32.977 --> 00:24:34.560
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Oh, sure, it'll

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.657
change-- like, the sun will
come up in the west or the east

00:24:38.657 --> 00:24:39.490
or wherever it does.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.150
You know, no.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.056
They're immutable laws.

00:24:44.056 --> 00:24:45.540
It isn't going to change.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.924
Behavior isn't going to change.

00:24:47.924 --> 00:24:49.590
People get hold of
other people's money.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.131
They like it.

00:24:50.131 --> 00:24:53.914
It gives them power, and
they want to be smart.

00:24:53.914 --> 00:24:55.830
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So
Shad, one of the books,

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.380
I think, that have
really influenced

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.994
you has been "Money
Masters," by John Train.

00:24:59.994 --> 00:25:01.160
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Yeah.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.950
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: What
about the book influenced you?

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.241
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
he's a good money manager.

00:25:06.241 --> 00:25:09.140
And he understood
the distinctions

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.140
that investors were
making in their minds.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.140
It's just a good survey.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.595
And nothing's
changed since then.

00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.720
No one had ever studied
investment managers before.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.780
They were just kind of
like clerks, or something.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.040
Then they became kind of
larger than life, sometimes,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.030
and it became
interesting to people.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.335
But the thing I
found interesting--

00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:30.870
he's very thoughtful,
and one time I said,

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.870
after studying
all these people--

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.210
value investors
and all this-- how

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.400
did you become a
growth stock manager,

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.180
at, like, T. Rowe Price?

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.700
And he said that value
investors are really

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.950
kind of glorified accountants.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.360
They're looking at the gap
between their perceived value

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.474
and what the assets
are going to be worth

00:25:49.474 --> 00:25:51.140
and its market
capitalization and trying

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.795
to close the difference.

00:25:52.795 --> 00:25:54.170
And then when they
do it, they've

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.550
got to go buy something else.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.050
So it's a constant
turnover process.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.240
If you ever make a mistake,
you pay a lot of taxes,

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.180
and you've lost all your money.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.690
But a growth stock
investor, which, he said--

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.980
that suited his nature--

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.322
you're really kind
of a futurologist--

00:26:07.322 --> 00:26:09.530
looking in the future and
trying to figure out what's

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.400
going to happen.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.760
He said that suited his
nature, so that's what he did.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.796
That makes perfect sense to me.

00:26:15.796 --> 00:26:18.120
And it requires fewer
people, and you just

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.790
have to be right a couple
of times in your life.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.831
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: When
we were speaking earlier

00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:25.940
with one of your
colleagues, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.160
you spoke about the
spectrum of investors--

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.830
short sellers, activists,
long only investors.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.350
Do you want to
share that with us?

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.810
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: I was just

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.960
saying that short sellers really
think that they're the smartest

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.970
people on Earth,
that they're much

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.960
smarter than these managements.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.030
And they're so smart, they'll
risk their whole stash

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.120
to prove they're right.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.539
And they either go broke
or have nervous breakdowns

00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:49.580
or just shoot themselves.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.160
I mean, I know a guy who
tried to just killed himself.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.990
But it's a terrible life.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.860
And then the next ones are the
activist investors-- activists.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.860
They think they're smarter
than management, too.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.070
They're going to tell
them how to do it.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.620
So they just get in
there and start saying,

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.440
do this, do this, do that.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.880
And we want to sell the company
and want to make these fees.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.870
And then--

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:12.700
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
The value investors.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.033
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: And
then the value investors I've

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:16.064
already talked about.

00:27:16.064 --> 00:27:16.980
You can rank them all.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.064
And then the growth stock
investors just think--

00:27:19.064 --> 00:27:20.480
this company is
smarter than I am,

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.650
they know the business
better than I do,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.060
plus it's a great business.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.976
And it if isn't,
I'll get out of it.

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.395
That's how you have a
slight advantage, there.

00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:29.520
You want to put yourself
on the side where you have

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.720
an advantage, and they don't.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.170
So if you perceive that
there's a long term

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.347
future for the business--

00:27:35.347 --> 00:27:37.180
they're doing simply
better, faster, cheaper

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.300
and for the customer, you can
buy it at a reasonable price,

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.560
and if you're wrong,
you can sell it--

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.690
that's a pretty good deal.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.360
And that's one I
think I want to take.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.550
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So Shad, I
want to get a little personal

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.810
with this question for you.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.850
So around two decades ago,
you were diagnosed with

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:58.580
Parkinson's.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:58.790
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Yeah.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:59.700
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
Shortly afterwards you

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.300
considered shutting
down your fund.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.502
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Yeah.

00:28:02.502 --> 00:28:04.960
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: But then
you chose not to shut it down.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.332
Maybe you should
walk us through that.

00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:08.790
And also, after
that, you've stated

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.830
that having Parkinson's
has actually

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.220
made you a better person.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.590
Can you talk to us--
why you feel that?

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.490
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Well, Michael J. Fox,

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.210
I'm on his board.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.760
He calls up-- Parkinson's is
a gift that keeps on taking.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.390
But I think it makes you
a little humble and more

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.325
appreciative of what you
did have going right.

00:28:26.325 --> 00:28:28.120
You have to make
adjustments to it.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.554
But my first reaction was what
the hell is going on here?

00:28:32.554 --> 00:28:34.470
And I thought, well,
I'll do everybody a favor

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.270
and shut the fund down.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.620
And I gave all the money back.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.060
I had some stocks that
were hard to get out

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.183
of-- they were illiquid.

00:28:40.183 --> 00:28:42.590
And so I dragged my
feet and then decided--

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.447
what else am I going to do?

00:28:44.447 --> 00:28:46.905
So I changed my mind and have
had a good record ever since.

00:28:46.905 --> 00:28:48.363
I had a good record
the whole time,

00:28:48.363 --> 00:28:55.200
but yeah, it changes
your life a little bit.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.250
And you appreciate the
things that go your way,

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.020
and the things that
don't, you don't

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.780
worry as much about,
which is meaning to say--

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.170
I'm kind of a completely
pleasant personality-- is not.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.740
But you know, I think investing
is a matter of finding out

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.380
who you are and where
you fit in the world

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.140
and how it all fits together.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.170
You know, I don't know
whose saying it is,

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.670
but-- if you don't
know who you are,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.680
the stock market is an
expensive place to find out--

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.635
is true.

00:29:24.635 --> 00:29:28.420
But if you fit your nature
with your investment style,

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.540
and it makes economic sense,
you can probably do pretty well.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.534
If you think of
yourself as a stock--

00:29:34.534 --> 00:29:36.450
where you have more
coming in than going out--

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.366
and so you're doing
something with the money--

00:29:38.366 --> 00:29:40.770
in other words, you're
managing your cash flow--

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.430
you're going to end up
being a rich old guy or girl

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:44.720
or whatever.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.410
And that makes sense to me.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.010
So I feel like the
game is going my way.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.800
And I feel like that's
the way anybody who

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.270
thought about it should go.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.930
And if you listen
to the television--

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.390
the stocks are
under accumulation,

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.840
it's breaking out, it's breaking
down, it's lacking support--

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.890
I'm selling, I'm selling,
buy-sell, buy-sell.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.050
Just pay a lot of commissions
and dealer spreads

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:12.480
and lose your money
and talk more.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.700
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: So
Shad, before we open it up

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.710
to the audience for
questions, I want

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.590
to ask you one question
that we ask all our guests.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.650
What is some advice you would
give the personal investor,

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.540
someone who's starting their
journey today, maybe investing

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.420
their first few dollars and
trying to make compounding

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.510
work for them?

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.670
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
I'd say the same thing--

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.692
who are you, what do you like?

00:30:37.692 --> 00:30:41.570
You know, are you a
cheerleader, or are you a booer?

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.320
Do you know you want
the home team to win,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.861
or do you want the
home team to lose?

00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:46.390
And pick companies you like--

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.850
you like the
management, you think

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.100
they have a bright future,
you like dealing with them,

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.990
you think they're good people,
and just sit on it and own it.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.350
And think of yourself as a
partial owner of a business,

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.725
just like you're the owner of
your entire business, which

00:30:57.725 --> 00:30:59.250
is your life.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.010
So that's kind of
Warren Buffett 101,

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:05.746
combined with a little pop
psychology and my experience.

00:31:05.746 --> 00:31:06.870
And that's what I would do.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.302
That's what I'm trying to do.

00:31:09.302 --> 00:31:10.219
Does that makes sense?

00:31:10.219 --> 00:31:11.260
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Yeah.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.226
No, thank you, Shad.

00:31:12.226 --> 00:31:13.350
Thank you so much for that.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.650
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Fun being here.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:15.840
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: I
think we'll open it up

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.756
to audience questions.

00:31:16.756 --> 00:31:18.930
And I have a few more
in case we have time

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.720
at the end of
audience questions.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.130
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: All right, yeah.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.546
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:31:22.546 --> 00:31:25.720
That's very inspiring.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.240
So I have a question about the
large number as a necessity.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.420
I was wondering if you
think there is the risk

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.110
of the anti-trust once
the company goes large,

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.734
and the large member goes--

00:31:39.734 --> 00:31:40.900
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Sure.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.800
That's a terrifying
aspect of it.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.840
But usually the
litigation starts

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.950
coming when they're trying
to use the government

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.240
to protect themselves from
competition or something.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.396
So I don't know.

00:31:56.396 --> 00:31:57.270
It'll be interesting.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.000
I watched another
company the other day,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.730
talking on the television
about its issues and problems.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:10.080
But I think that these
congressmen and these state

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.260
legislators, they're so busy
that they don't have time

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.657
to understand
anything very clearly.

00:32:15.657 --> 00:32:17.490
And you know, if the
business is still good,

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.160
and will probably
survive and do fine.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.750
And they have
constituencies that--

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:31.172
people vote, and so I don't
worry about it too much.

00:32:31.172 --> 00:32:33.005
I'm worried about it
some, but not too much.

00:32:33.005 --> 00:32:35.140
I think it's overrated.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.336
Does that makes sense?

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:38.460
That answers your question?

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.751
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it makes sense.

00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:40.440
Thanks.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.320
AUDIENCE: You talked about
better, faster, cheaper.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.140
What is one business that's
better, faster, cheaper

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.380
that you would like to own,
but you don't because of price

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.710
or whatever other reason?

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.490
And I have a second
part question.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:54.960
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: I
don't have any of those.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.692
I bought them.

00:32:55.692 --> 00:32:57.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.530
AUDIENCE: What is
something that you

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.090
owned in the past that is
no longer, better, faster,

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.090
cheaper, and why?

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.826
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Well, let's see--

00:33:05.826 --> 00:33:08.350
McDonald's.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:12.540
And you know, they're getting
beaten by lots of people, now.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:18.390
And PetSmart, which
has started selling

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:19.550
very expensive products.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:24.524
You save money-- put your dog
up at the warehouse stores,

00:33:24.524 --> 00:33:28.460
and put them down and add
more functions in them.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.731
But it was not as
good a company--

00:33:30.731 --> 00:33:32.480
what they could do to
the dog or do to you

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.050
or how they could trick you.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.250
But really, I'm just trying
to find the ones that are good

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.455
and hold them.

00:33:41.455 --> 00:33:42.652
I sold WPP, which--

00:33:42.652 --> 00:33:44.110
I don't know, what
I made, 33 times

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:50.100
on my money-- and the
reason was the competitors,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.930
online competitors were
doing it better, faster,

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.080
cheaper, and getting
more for the money.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.720
And you watch regular
television, now, and the ads

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.020
on it for drugs that--

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.560
you know, the side effects
might be that you'll

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.160
die, crying for your mother.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.860
They're just
terrible, off-putting.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.405
And so, an ad that
applies to you directly--

00:34:13.405 --> 00:34:15.639
that you and you only see--

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.951
that's structured, that
will tell you something

00:34:17.951 --> 00:34:20.159
that you want to hear seems
like a better deal to me.

00:34:22.223 --> 00:34:23.889
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
I think you had also

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.409
written about CarMax,
which, back in the day,

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:28.889
was excellent pricing, right?

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.041
But with discoverability, now--

00:34:31.041 --> 00:34:32.790
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Yeah, the advantage

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:37.440
is gone, because everybody
knows what everybody paid

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.311
for everything.

00:34:38.311 --> 00:34:40.852
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: Because of
internet and Kelley Blue Book.

00:34:40.852 --> 00:34:43.305
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Sure.

00:34:43.305 --> 00:34:45.630
AUDIENCE: One last question.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:49.380
We had Mr. Schwab visit us,
I think, about two years ago,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.850
from Charles Schwab.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.389
And he talked about
how, in his words--

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:57.280
Charles Schwab
continues to deliver

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.000
their services to
their customers

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.060
better, faster, cheaper.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.400
How do you think about Charles
Schwab, say, compared to,

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.079
say T. Rowe, which you do on?

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:07.870
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
Compared to T. Rowe?

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:08.720
PRANESH SRINIVASAN:
T. Rowe, yeah.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.780
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: I
got a good price on T. Rowe.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.400
I'm really to get out of it.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.900
AUDIENCE: Do you think Charles
Schwab does better, faster,

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.700
cheaper?

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.770
You are in that
industry, so probably you

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:17.950
know better about who does?

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.730
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
I think that right now T. Rowe

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.720
Price probably does
better, because they're

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.920
focused on growth companies.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.840
And the market isn't
paying the premium

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.960
that its certainly capable of
paying for those companies.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.200
I can remember-- I was not in
the market at that time, but--

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.690
the Nifty 50 were induplicable
companies that would always

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.530
be in people's
portfolios, regardless,

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.070
and had always
grown to-- they all

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.910
sold at 100 times
earnings, 1973.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.260
So I think that sort of
thing can happen again--

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.200
maybe have a World
50, World Nifty 50.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.770
You know, you talk
about Bitcoin--

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:55.130
well, hell, Coca Cola stock
used to be like Bitcoin.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.700
Or the technology
companies are like that.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.800
I think that could
easily happen.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.270
And I think that these
companies can make the--

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.470
you know, they know more about
their businesses than I do,

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.650
and they can buy them for
stock or buy them for cash,

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.094
and everybody turns into
a Warren Buffett, kind of.

00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:21.010
I mean, what did we learn
from Warren Buffett.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:26.460
I mean, he started out with,
you know, delivering papers

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.680
and turned that into
becoming the richest

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.730
guy in the world for a while.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:34.590
And what did he do-- he just
had an obsession with money

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:37.490
and never spent it,
and just compounded,

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.306
compounded, compounded.

00:36:39.306 --> 00:36:44.520
AUDIENCE: I always wonder
about nonprofit investments.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.850
And when I think of
Buffett or Gates and a lot

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.090
of philanthropic
investments, you

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.610
know-- is it in the
context of philanthropy

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:54.600
versus giving away.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.630
What's this actual investment
and being able to manage it?

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.080
And I always wondered
what the thought process

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.190
is when the rich decide to
go one way or the other.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.945
And I'm just curious
to hear your thoughts.

00:37:07.945 --> 00:37:09.820
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
On accumulating money?

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.650
AUDIENCE: Philanthropy,
or you know,

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.730
investment in change in the
context of larger good--

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.372
how do investors think about it?

00:37:22.372 --> 00:37:24.580
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: I
think about it all the time.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.710
And I don't--

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:31.770
I'm usually disappointed by
what I discover about what

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.730
was really happening.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.504
I mean, you know people
get old, and they

00:37:35.504 --> 00:37:37.170
want to have hospitals
named after them,

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.279
and they want to
invest in health care.

00:37:39.279 --> 00:37:41.820
And the health care people are
just charging more every year.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.194
And it's become
too big a burden.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.460
Not to complain about it, but
yeah, I think it's an issue.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.580
You know, you don't want
to die with all your money.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.790
And you'd rather have you
decide what to do with it

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.950
than let someone else
decide what to do with it.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:58.910
Certainly.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.590
any one is going to do better
than the government, probably.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.320
But I think it's a big issue.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.250
We don't live forever,
because we all think we will.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:11.659
Yes, ma'am.

00:38:11.659 --> 00:38:12.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.230
I wonder what's your advice
about risk controlling

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:21.510
for personal investors who don't
have much time to investigate

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.080
what's going on in the market.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.935
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Well, you'd

00:38:23.935 --> 00:38:25.560
beat 90% of the
investors, if you just

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.070
bought the S&amp;P 500 index
from Vanguard or Fidelity

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.640
or something like that.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.140
That's what most
people ought to do,

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.723
then they wouldn't worry about
what the individual stocks are.

00:38:34.723 --> 00:38:37.360
You know, you put 90% of your
money in those index funds

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.570
and then play with other money,
just like your play money

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.300
and have fun with it.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.264
I mean-- my advice.

00:38:45.264 --> 00:38:46.680
AUDIENCE: I really
enjoy your sort

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.520
of three stage model
on how companies

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.060
sort of get fat and then
get lazy and then, you know,

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.370
get eaten.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:39:00.420
One question I have
is how frequently

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.220
do companies that
you've purchased

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.860
turn into a different stage?

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.960
Or obviously, you're
trying to buy ones

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.685
that always stay in stage one.

00:39:08.685 --> 00:39:09.570
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE:
That's very hard to do.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.690
AUDIENCE: --worse case--
end up in stage two, but--

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:12.120
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Because they're

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.540
successful in stage one,
and that leads to problems.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.456
Just like with people.

00:39:15.456 --> 00:39:18.630
It's just exactly like a person.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:24.880
And you know, at some point,
the company is successful,

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.470
and it wants to
do something else.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.553
And the individual wants
to do something else that

00:39:28.553 --> 00:39:30.480
didn't make them the
money in the first place.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.530
And this is exactly
the same thing.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.960
So you want to make enough
money so that your comfortable

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.293
and you get your needs taken
care of, but that's enough,

00:39:37.293 --> 00:39:41.580
probably, unless it becomes
a game or an obsession.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.500
But you're right, exactly.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.150
It is the same thing
as with a person.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.450
AUDIENCE: Can I ask you a
brief follow-up, which is--

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.530
in a profile of
you from 2016, you

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:56.130
mention that you aim
to have about 15 stocks

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.750
in your portfolio
at any given time,

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.880
and you sort of sell off the
worst performing one every year

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.060
and try to replace it.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.226
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Yeah.

00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:05.220
AUDIENCE: And that
incidentally you also

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.210
mention that by concentration,
only about six of them

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:12.990
make up about 70% of the
actual portfolio by value.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:15.222
Is that a fairly constant
sort of performance metric?

00:40:15.222 --> 00:40:17.430
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
it just is what happens.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.596
This is what happened to me.

00:40:18.596 --> 00:40:20.922
But I'd like to--

00:40:20.922 --> 00:40:22.880
I'm probably at about 12
or 13 stocks, at most.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.710
And most of the money
is in very few stocks.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.740
But you want to be
diversified to the point

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.240
that you've got the odds in
your favor, but not to the point

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.820
that you don't
keep up with them.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.150
And I'm being a little bit
more disciplined about it

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:41.640
than I used to be, but
it's hard to sell a stock

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.392
once you have a profit in it.

00:40:43.392 --> 00:40:45.850
It's hard to sell it, pay the
taxes, make up the net worth,

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:50.070
and pay the dealer spread
and make the money back.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.500
So what you tend to do is
own some other companies

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.340
at low cost.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.000
But you know, if you
want to step out,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.570
you've got to sell them.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.790
And they've got to fit what
you really think is happening.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.490
I mean, I was saying the
same thing 10 years ago,

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:09.250
but my portfolio has completely
turned over since then.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.990
And the reason is I have
better companies now, I think--

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.014
knock wood.

00:41:16.014 --> 00:41:18.430
AUDIENCE: As companies grow,
the culture is very difficult

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.876
to maintain, right?

00:41:19.876 --> 00:41:21.167
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: What is?

00:41:21.167 --> 00:41:23.890
AUDIENCE: Especially when
bureaucracy creeps in.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:29.170
What made you believe that
Southwest will continue keeping

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.232
its culture in the future?

00:41:31.232 --> 00:41:32.690
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Its culture?

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.530
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.970
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Well,
they've got a good guy--

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.122
Gary Kelly, who's running it.

00:41:39.122 --> 00:41:41.770
They've always had good
Chief Executive Officers.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:47.470
But it's hard to change
a culture for the worse,

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.900
and it's hard to
change for the better.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.600
And you know, I like to
pick on American Airlines,

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.140
but it just seems like they
invariably do the exact thing

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.390
that I don't want them to do--

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.120
like, changing a reservation.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.600
Southwest, they let
you change your time.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.530
American Airlines-- you
have to buy another ticket.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.480
By the time they
tag their penalties

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.460
and everything else
on you, it was stupid.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.150
I don't understand it.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:18.795
And so who is your
fidelity owed to?

00:42:18.795 --> 00:42:20.920
It's owed to your customer
and to the shareholders.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.050
You know, you've got
stakeholders in any business,

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:25.270
and you've got to
treat them right.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.150
And a lot of times these
professional managements

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:30.160
get hold of these
companies, and they think

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.540
they're the ones to be served--

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.039
they need to serve
themselves first.

00:42:33.039 --> 00:42:36.791
And everybody can see that,
and they react against it.

00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:38.290
And they don't share
in the business

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:41.879
and they go on, which
is fine, I guess.

00:42:41.879 --> 00:42:42.920
It makes plenty of money.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.890
But it could have made
more and had more fun

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:50.740
and contributed to
society, rather than not.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.150
AUDIENCE: If I may
ask another question--

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.060
I understand that
for a short seller,

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.139
it's hard also because
you not only need

00:42:58.139 --> 00:42:59.680
to get your decisions
right, you also

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.931
need to get your timing right.

00:43:00.931 --> 00:43:02.138
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: Right.

00:43:02.138 --> 00:43:04.000
AUDIENCE: As a value
investor, you know, I

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.460
guess you're not supposed
to time the market.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.520
And we know, it's very hard.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.550
But I keep wondering, because
for example, as of right now,

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:16.960
we are in, like, a
late part of the cycle.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.660
I wonder, being
understanding and we

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.190
should not timing the market--

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:25.190
one, if there is a
strategy you think you

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.490
master would deal
slightly differently

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:30.380
than the beginning of the cycle?

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.430
I don't know-- it's kind of a--

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.900
FREDERICK "SHAD" ROWE: I'm
glad to know that we're

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:33.990
at the end of the cycle.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.830
I found that our from you.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.230
I don't know that we are at all.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:39.200
I don't have any idea.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.360
I think that from the time
I've been in the business,

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.090
the general public's attitude
is much less interested

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.890
in the stock market.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.100
And there are fewer
shares or fewer companies

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.650
that are public.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.270
There are better
companies, now--

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:56.910
they're better run.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.740
And it's just as competitive,
and they make more money.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.745
The profitability is higher.

00:44:01.745 --> 00:44:04.120
I think stocks are a heck of
a deal relative to what else

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.100
you can do with your money.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.600
And if you get a few of those
other things right-- you know,

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.800
the better, faster, cheaper
and for the customer

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.512
and to the delight
of the customer,

00:44:14.512 --> 00:44:16.720
and if it works in the United
States and can be taken

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.260
internationally--

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.520
I don't see how you miss.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.020
And when you find
out, I hope you'll

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.401
call me and tell me about it.

00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:23.650
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: All right.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.410
I think we are out of time.

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:28.250
Thank you so much, Shad, for--

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.590
FREDERICK "SHAD"
ROWE: Is that OK?

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:29.870
PRANESH SRINIVASAN: --coming
and speaking with us.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.670
I think we should all--
really enjoyed it.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:34.720
[APPLAUSE]
