Stearns:
My name's Geoff Stearns.

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:06.767
I work also
on the syndication team.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:09.334
I guess you're hearing
lots of people

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:10.634
from syndication today.

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:12.534
I primarily work
on the video player.

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:15.234
So normally
when you would see

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:19.067
a YouTube video,

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:21.334
uh, on a Web site
that is not YouTube,

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:22.701
it's probably
playing back

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:24.033
in one of the players
that I work on.

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:25.868
So we have
a few different players.

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:27.701
I think you've heard
a little bit about them.

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:30.100
I'm gonna talk about two players
in particular.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.033
One is the standard
embedded player,

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:33.934
which is probably the one
that you're all familiar with

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.267
and the one
that you've seen,

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.868
you know,
around on the Internet.

00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:39.901
And then the chromeless player,
which has probably

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:41.334
been mentioned
a few times today already,

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:43.400
which is our sort of super
customizable player.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.667
So let's get started,
I guess.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.100
I guess first of all
I wanted to talk

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.701
a little bit
about the embedded player.

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.400
Now, the chromeless player--

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.834
Uh, well, let me back up.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.634
So the embedded player
generally, I feel,

00:00:55.634 --> 00:01:00.000
would probably be okay
for probably 99%

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.767
of your needs,
in my opinion.

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:04.267
The chromeless player
is exciting and all,

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:05.767
but the embedded player

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:07.234
really brings everything
together.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:10.701
So the embedded player,
you guys have all seen it.

00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:13.367
Let me show you
a quick example of it

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:17.501
just to show
a little demo here.

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:19.300
Oops, I already
have this open.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.567
So this here
are a few examples

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.834
of videos embedded
using our embedded player.

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.534
And you can see there's
a couple different layouts

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:29.968
and color options
you can make.

00:01:29.968 --> 00:01:31.834
We can even watch
a couple videos here

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:33.267
that are pretty funny.

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:39.434
Do we have audio?

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:44.634
Yes? No?

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:47.300
There it goes.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.501
Yeah, I think
they just turned it up.

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:05.801
[techno rock music]

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:10.133
[video game sounds
of hitting and punching]

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:12.067
[shouting indistinctly]

00:02:25.634 --> 00:02:27.434
[man growling]

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:30.267
[laughter]

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:32.067
So there's not really
a lot of point in that.

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:34.033
I just wanted to show it to you.
It's pretty funny.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.701
Um...

00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:38.534
The one thing
to sorta get outta this

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:40.033
is you can see that
with the embedded player

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.033
there's a lot
of customization options, okay?

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:44.267
You can set the color
of the control bar.

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:47.100
You can add a border
around it if you want to.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.067
These down here, we sorta
call this the genie menu.

00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:52.100
Although it used to look
more like more of a genie thing.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.434
Now it's just sort of
a slide forward thumbnail menu.

00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:57.701
You can enable this
or disable this if you want.

00:02:57.701 --> 00:02:59.367
A lot of people ask,
you know--

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:00.868
I actually talked
to someone recently

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:02.501
who said they really wanted
to use the embedded player

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:04.501
but they hate how it shows
these related videos

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:06.067
that could be, like,
a competitor,

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:08.667
or it could be, you know,
a random spornography

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.868
or something like that,
and you might not want that.

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:12.200
And you can disable it.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.234
So I'll go through
that stuff in a minute.

00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:17.267
Um, a couple other examples
of videos

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:19.167
and just a couple of other
videos that are kinda fun.

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:20.767
So we'll watch those.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.901
[jingling sound]

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:24.834
[man speaking foreign language]

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:42.067
[bottles jingling
"Mario Bros." theme song]

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:56.000
Stearns: Does anyone here
have this much free time?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.501
No?

00:03:57.501 --> 00:04:01.934
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:04.667
Yeah?

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.133
I'd volunteer
our parking garage

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:10.501
if anybody wants
to do this later.

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:13.400
All right, so let's take
a quick look at--

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.067
[audience chuckling]

00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:19.334
Uh...

00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:22.200
So let's take a quick look
at the options

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.334
that you have available
for the normal embedded player.

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:29.033
If you go to our YouTube site
on the code.google.com site,

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:32.000
we have a couple of pages that
relate just to the player thing.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.033
So we have
YouTube player tools here.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:35.734
There's a page
called "player parameters"

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.167
that talks about the different
customizations you can do.

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:40.033
And then we have
some JavaScript and Flash APIs

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:41.334
and the chromeless player stuff.

00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:43.300
So this is, like,
your one resource place

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.467
for anything you want to know
about the players.

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:49.801
So quickly
I'll step through this stuff.

00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:51.434
This is a list of all
the different parameters

00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:52.767
you can use
on the player.

00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:54.734
And a lot of people
sort of gloss over

00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:57.100
or maybe don't realize that you
can actually customize them.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.834
And it's really easy
to customize the player.

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:01.167
All you do is you go
to the YouTube site.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:03.167
Just give you
a quick example here.

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:06.868
You pick the video
that you want.

00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:08.901
Grab the embed code here.

00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:10.534
And when you stick it
in your page,

00:05:10.534 --> 00:05:12.701
or whatever you're
putting it into here,

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:14.767
all you have to do
is modify a few variables.

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:16.968
So you could notice
there's the URL to the player

00:05:16.968 --> 00:05:18.400
in two places here.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.200
There's this one here.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.701
And this has
a few parameters.

00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:24.200
Now this part right here
is the actual URL to the player.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.801
And if you just use
that plain URL,

00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:27.400
you'll just get
the normal standard player

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.234
that's just the gray that
you've probably seen a lot.

00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:31.467
But all these other
variables here, uh,

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:33.334
are extra things
that you can customize.

00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:34.901
And you can actually
come in and change these.

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.067
So like color one,
color two right here,

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:38.300
these are just hex values.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.734
So you can set them
to any hex value you want.

00:05:40.734 --> 00:05:42.968
Color two is the color
of the control bar,

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.934
and then color one
is the color of the border

00:05:44.934 --> 00:05:47.334
or sort of like the secondary
color of the player

00:05:47.334 --> 00:05:48.601
if you turn the border on.

00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:50.701
HL is a language.

00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:53.501
We support I don't know
how many languages.

00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.367
Maybe 18 different languages
right now?

00:05:55.367 --> 00:05:57.033
So you can actually
tell the player

00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:59.534
to be whichever language
we support.

00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:02.400
We're always adding
new languages.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.667
I think by default
it's whatever user language

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:06.834
you used when you got
the embed code.

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:09.167
FS is a new one
that I haven't documented yet,

00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:11.300
but I'll tell you guys
about that in a second here.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.067
Um, so that's how
you edit that.

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:17.334
Let me go back
to my page here.

00:06:17.334 --> 00:06:19.334
All right, so really quickly I'm
just gonna run through these,

00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:21.033
'cause these are pretty useful
for most people.

00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:24.634
So the rel argument is,
like I said earlier,

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.067
it's to turn on or turn off

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:27.567
the related videos
in the player.

00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:29.200
So either when you push
the menu button

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.367
or when the video ends,
if you set rel to zero,

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:33.901
then you don't see
those related videos.

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:36.133
Autoplay just lets the player
autoplay when it loads up.

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:38.634
You guys can see certain sites
like Digg uses that one,

00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:39.934
you load a video on Digg.

00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:41.400
You can set it to loop.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.868
So if you want to have a video
just loop forever,

00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:44.701
you can set loop to one
and it'll loop forever.

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:46.667
All these values, if they're
like a Boolean value,

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:48.200
it's either one or zero.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.100
So make sure you don't put
like "true" or "false" in there.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.167
It actually has to be
a one or a zero.

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:55.334
Enable JSAPI and player API ID
are kinda special ones.

00:06:55.334 --> 00:06:57.367
I'm gonna talk about those
in a little bit.

00:06:57.367 --> 00:07:00.100
Disable KB just disables
the keyboard controls.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.701
A lot of people don't know
that the players

00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:03.501
have some keyboard controls.

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.934
They're listed out here.

00:07:04.934 --> 00:07:06.834
So you can use spacebar
to play and pause the player.

00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:08.501
Or you can use
your left and right arrow keys

00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:10.868
to jump ahead or jump back
to the beginning.

00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:12.567
And then up and down
arrow keys

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:16.133
change your volume
up and down.

00:07:16.133 --> 00:07:18.167
EGM is kind of a weird one.

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:19.601
I don't want to spend
too much time on that.

00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:20.901
But it basically
makes it so that

00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.167
if you set EGM to one,
when you hover over

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:25.234
the video player
with your mouse,

00:07:25.234 --> 00:07:27.334
it brings that little menu up
over the video.

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:29.734
So it lets you kinda,
I guess,

00:07:29.734 --> 00:07:31.467
helps discoverability
a little bit.

00:07:31.467 --> 00:07:32.901
The border one or zero

00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:34.467
turns on that border
that's around the player.

00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:37.100
And you can set that
on or off.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.167
And then color one, color two
is what I already mentioned

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.033
for setting the colors.

00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:43.000
And then there's a few other
example usage here.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.501
And there's another example
of the video player

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:45.868
with a blue border.

00:07:45.868 --> 00:07:46.968
So I think a lot of people,

00:07:46.968 --> 00:07:48.300
they ask
for the chromeless player.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.200
But really this player
is really, really flexible

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.267
and would probably suit
most of your needs.

00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:53.534
And then this way
you don't have to build

00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:55.701
your own control setup
since we already have our,

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:58.734
you know, pretty standard
controls already set up there.

00:07:58.734 --> 00:08:00.767
Another thing to notice
is that this site--

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:02.501
this player also allows you
to set the player

00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:03.834
any size you want.

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:06.067
So it doesn't have to be,
like, a standard 4x3.

00:08:06.067 --> 00:08:07.701
You can actually set it
to, like, wide-screen

00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:10.033
like the last video
I showed you guys.

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:12.000
Or you can shrink it
or make it bigger.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.501
You know, pretty much
whatever size you want,

00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:15.934
the player will just fill
whatever size you give it,

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:17.934
which is nice.

00:08:17.934 --> 00:08:20.000
There's not a way to set
the quality yet.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.501
Sorry.

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:26.834
Um, let's see here.

00:08:26.834 --> 00:08:28.534
All right,
so let's go back.

00:08:28.534 --> 00:08:30.234
So...

00:08:30.234 --> 00:08:32.133
let me go back
to my examples here.

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:35.834
Oops.

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:37.667
All right, one more video
and then we'll move on.

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:39.100
This one's good.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.100
So the FS parameter, actually
it's not documented yet.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.701
But I added full screen
functionality

00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:44.434
to the embedded player
last week.

00:08:44.434 --> 00:08:46.133
So you guys can now
use your embeds.

00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:48.234
If you just go and get
the new code from the Web site,

00:08:48.234 --> 00:08:50.601
you can watch stuff
in full screen now.

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.100
man: A slightly larger balloon,
an 80 inch.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.467
Stearns: It looks like
the projector's kinda

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:54.801
screwing it up
a little bit.

00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:56.767
But really it should--
it would fill the whole screen

00:08:56.767 --> 00:08:58.334
if it was
on a normal display.

00:08:58.334 --> 00:09:01.934
man: I keep the rubber band
with me.

00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:04.000
Stearns: This guy's name
is Billoon45,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.834
and he's a balloon fetishist.

00:09:05.834 --> 00:09:08.200
This was his second attempt
at trying to climb

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.734
inside of a balloon.

00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:13.467
[chuckles]

00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:14.801
Gunther likes this guy.

00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:16.601
This guy is basically like
the patron saint

00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:19.100
of the YouTube web developers
for the most part.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.300
man: Oh, forgot the glasses.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.267
They gotta come off.

00:09:26.267 --> 00:09:28.334
Well, my head's inside.

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:34.200
Whoa.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.767
Stearns: I think there's only
one end of it, I guess.

00:09:36.767 --> 00:09:40.033
I think it's, like, a big
South American weather balloon

00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:41.334
or something like that.

00:09:41.334 --> 00:09:43.100
He actually tells you
what it is.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.601
man: My arm.

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:47.701
My head's inside.

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:58.767
Whoa.

00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:00.434
Darn it.

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:03.334
That's the last thing
I need now.

00:10:03.334 --> 00:10:06.567
Not fucking cooperating.

00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:07.834
Oh, great.

00:10:07.834 --> 00:10:09.767
I'm becoming trapped
in the balloon.

00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:11.434
Drat!

00:10:11.434 --> 00:10:15.334
Oh, I hate this.

00:10:15.334 --> 00:10:17.767
Oh, darn it.

00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:20.267
Oh.

00:10:20.267 --> 00:10:22.033
Blast it.

00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:24.767
I can still breathe.

00:10:24.767 --> 00:10:29.334
Hmm.

00:10:29.334 --> 00:10:32.767
Hmm, I gotta get
out of this balloon.

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:35.601
[groaning]

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:38.334
Drat it.

00:10:38.334 --> 00:10:42.667
[groaning]

00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:44.868
Let's find me
a spot here.

00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:52.000
[groaning]

00:10:57.267 --> 00:10:58.901
Stearns: I think that's
my favorite part right there

00:10:58.901 --> 00:11:03.234
when he does
the little shimmy.

00:11:03.234 --> 00:11:05.367
man: I ripped the balloon.

00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:15.000
Drat dog.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.968
Hate that.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.667
Stearns: This guy's awesome.

00:11:18.667 --> 00:11:23.534
[audience chuckling]

00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:24.868
This is fantastic.

00:11:24.868 --> 00:11:27.734
All right.

00:11:27.734 --> 00:11:29.267
He does a lot
of confessionals too.

00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:31.334
I highly recommend his channel.
It's really good.

00:11:31.334 --> 00:11:33.667
Um, it's Billoon45
is the name

00:11:33.667 --> 00:11:35.200
if you guys
want to look it up.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.834
So anyway,
so really quickly,

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:39.000
the full screen mode
that's there now,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.334
any new embeds that you grab
from the YouTube site

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:43.834
should have
the full screen embed.

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:46.033
But you do have to do
a little bit of special stuff.

00:11:46.033 --> 00:11:47.400
If you have, like,
an existing Web site

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.167
that uses our embed code,
you have to add

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.234
an allow full screen
parameter and attribute

00:11:52.234 --> 00:11:53.634
to your embed code.

00:11:53.634 --> 00:11:55.133
And if you guys want to see
what that looks like,

00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:56.934
you can just grab any embed code
from the YouTube site

00:11:56.934 --> 00:11:58.367
and you'll see it in there.

00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:00.667
And then there's another
player parameter called FS.

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:02.534
And you set that
to either one or zero

00:12:02.534 --> 00:12:04.834
to either show or hide
the actual full screen button.

00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:07.434
So we do that because
a lot of our old embed code

00:12:07.434 --> 00:12:09.300
didn't have the
"allow full screen" parameter.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.701
So if we showed the button,
the button just wouldn't work.

00:12:11.701 --> 00:12:14.567
So in some cases
we'll actually hide the button

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.000
on sites that don't support
the full screen embed code.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.667
So have some fun with that.

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:23.534
Um, all right.

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:26.234
It's hard to think
after watching that video there.

00:12:26.234 --> 00:12:27.801
Let's go back
to the thing.

00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:30.334
All right, so another thing
that I want to talk about

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:31.767
is the JavaScript
and Flash API.

00:12:31.767 --> 00:12:34.467
So in the embedded player
and in the chromeless player,

00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:36.701
they both can support
a JavaScript API

00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:38.267
for controlling the player.

00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:39.701
And they can also support
a Flash API.

00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:41.000
So if you're working
with ActionScript,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.968
you can load the player
into your ActionScript app

00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:45.000
and have pretty much
full control

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.667
over the players that way.

00:12:46.667 --> 00:12:49.834
The APIs are pretty much
identical, with some exceptions

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:51.467
as to how you initialize
the player

00:12:51.467 --> 00:12:53.434
when you load it
into a Flash app,

00:12:53.434 --> 00:12:57.100
which I guess is probably
to be expected a little bit.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.067
I want to
kinda briefly go over

00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:00.534
the JavaScript API reference,

00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:03.267
and I'll get more into this
a little bit later.

00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:06.467
So the key thing
to know about, I guess,

00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:08.133
for using the JavaScript API--

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:09.467
Let me actually
show the demo first,

00:13:09.467 --> 00:13:10.934
and then we'll
get back into it.

00:13:10.934 --> 00:13:12.634
So this is, like, a really quick
demo page I set up.

00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:14.501
This is actually linked
off of the bottom

00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:16.434
of the JavaScript
reference page

00:13:16.434 --> 00:13:18.100
on the code.google.com site.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.667
So this is just
a normal embedded player

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:20.734
embedded on a page.

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.234
And I have
some HTML controls here

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:25.000
that enable JavaScript
controls to the player.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.467
So I can hit play,

00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:28.367
and the player
will start playing.

00:13:28.367 --> 00:13:30.000
You have pretty good
support over it.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.634
I can hit pause.

00:13:31.634 --> 00:13:35.100
You can mute it
or un-mute it,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.701
which I think my sound
went away again.

00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:39.067
But that's okay.

00:13:39.067 --> 00:13:40.901
[rock music]

00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:42.868
You can seek around
within the player.

00:13:42.868 --> 00:13:44.968
So you can seek
to any time you want.

00:13:44.968 --> 00:13:48.734
You can seek ahead to, uh,

00:13:48.734 --> 00:13:50.501
say, like, 150 seconds.

00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:52.801
So you can see ahead
to points in the video

00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:54.167
that haven't loaded yet.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.200
So if you guys have noticed,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.067
YouTube uses sort of like
a custom streaming method,

00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:00.400
I guess you would call it.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.033
All of our videos
are progressive download.

00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:04.033
But the way
that we serve them

00:14:04.033 --> 00:14:05.400
is that we can actually
start playing them

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.834
from any point
in the video.

00:14:06.834 --> 00:14:09.267
So you can actually
jump ahead in the video

00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:10.400
and start playing points

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.868
that haven't actually
downloaded yet.

00:14:11.868 --> 00:14:13.334
And it'll just make
a new request to the server

00:14:13.334 --> 00:14:14.767
and start downloading it.

00:14:14.767 --> 00:14:16.567
And you can see that happening
here where I jumped ahead.

00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:18.667
Or I can, like, jump back
to here that hasn't loaded,

00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:20.467
and it'll just jump
to that point and start loading.

00:14:20.467 --> 00:14:22.434
So the JavaScript API
along with, you know,

00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:24.434
just the player controls
give you access to that.

00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:26.267
So you could actually
have a player that loads,

00:14:26.267 --> 00:14:27.634
start playing it
from the middle of the video

00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:29.067
if you wanted to,
and let it play, like, a segment

00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:30.534
and then stop it
or whatever.

00:14:30.534 --> 00:14:34.801
So you can do lots of really
fine granular control there.

00:14:34.801 --> 00:14:37.000
And then you can
see down here

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.634
I have some numbers
being put out here.

00:14:39.634 --> 00:14:41.200
So one of them
is the duration

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.067
where I grab the duration
from the player.

00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:45.200
The other one is the current
time of the video.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.334
So you can key events

00:14:46.334 --> 00:14:47.834
according to how
the video is playing

00:14:47.834 --> 00:14:49.734
and what the current time
in the video is.

00:14:49.734 --> 00:14:51.901
You can also get
how many bytes have loaded,

00:14:51.901 --> 00:14:53.501
how many bytes are total.

00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:55.100
And then the start bytes,
which is, you know,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.467
in the case where you
start it from the middle,

00:14:56.467 --> 00:14:57.901
you can know
what the start bytes are.

00:14:57.901 --> 00:14:59.501
So if you wanted to,
you could recreate

00:14:59.501 --> 00:15:01.501
the seek bar here
using that data.

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:03.200
So you could have your own
custom seek bar or whatever

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.734
if you wanted to,
and that really comes into play

00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:06.968
when you're using the chromeless
player for the most part.

00:15:06.968 --> 00:15:09.767
There's also ways
to get and set the volume,

00:15:09.767 --> 00:15:12.901
um, and mute it.

00:15:12.901 --> 00:15:14.834
Uh, and I think that's it.

00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:18.033
We'll go through that stuff
in a little bit.

00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:20.133
So...

00:15:20.133 --> 00:15:22.767
this is our JavaScript API
reference.

00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:24.400
All the functions
are listed out here.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.133
You have play, stop, pause.

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:27.801
I'm not gonna go
through all of them

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:30.067
'cause they're probably
pretty self-apparent I think.

00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:33.033
Um...

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.334
Seek to--

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.367
One thing to note
when you're seeking with videos

00:15:36.367 --> 00:15:39.000
is that the FLV format
has a limitation

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.067
to where you can seek to
in that you can only seek

00:15:41.067 --> 00:15:43.501
to a key frame
within the video.

00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:44.968
And if you're familiar
with video,

00:15:44.968 --> 00:15:46.701
you know that there's not
a key frame every second,

00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:48.167
or every frame even.

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:49.501
The key frames
are usually spread out.

00:15:49.501 --> 00:15:51.100
And in my experience,
key frames on YouTube

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.100
are usually between
two seconds all the way up--

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.667
I've seen them as far apart
as 15 seconds unfortunately.

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:58.567
So we have been working
a little bit

00:15:58.567 --> 00:15:59.934
on getting that
closer together

00:15:59.934 --> 00:16:01.701
and trying to set up
a standard way of saying

00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:03.834
any video should only have
key frames

00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:06.234
at a maximum as far apart
as two seconds,

00:16:06.234 --> 00:16:07.901
which makes seeking
a little bit better.

00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:09.767
But in some cases,
with older videos that haven't,

00:16:09.767 --> 00:16:11.567
you know, that were encoded
a long time ago,

00:16:11.567 --> 00:16:14.367
you might see a little bit
worse performance in that case.

00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:16.100
So that's something
to worry about.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.267
If you call seek to

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:18.734
and say you want to go
to seconds--

00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:20.100
like, 15 seconds
into the video,

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.133
and the first key frame
before that happens to be

00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:23.567
at, like, seven seconds,

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.167
they player will always jump
to the key frame

00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:26.734
before the time
that you requested.

00:16:26.734 --> 00:16:28.434
So the user will always see

00:16:28.434 --> 00:16:30.200
the content that you
intended them to see.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.133
But they might see a little bit
ahead of that time as well.

00:16:33.133 --> 00:16:34.934
And you guys could do
some trickery where, you know,

00:16:34.934 --> 00:16:37.033
you seek to 15,
and if it doesn't go to 15,

00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:38.434
you could, like,
hide the player

00:16:38.434 --> 00:16:40.067
and mute it or something
until it gets to 15

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:41.400
and then show it.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.167
So, I mean, you guys
could sort of hack together

00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:48.133
a real sort of accurate
seek time thing.

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.968
The allow seek ahead parameter

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.267
is just the way
to allow you to either

00:16:52.267 --> 00:16:54.367
tell the player--
allow the player to jump ahead

00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:56.234
and make a new request
to the server

00:16:56.234 --> 00:16:58.200
or only seek within the part
that's already downloaded.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.100
So you can actually
genuinely build, like,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.501
a seek bar that works
the same way that ours does.

00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:05.167
Um...

00:17:05.167 --> 00:17:08.334
Everything else here
is pretty standard.

00:17:08.334 --> 00:17:12.000
Um, the add event listener
is the way that you listen

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.734
to state changes
in the player.

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:15.434
So when the player loads,
you can--

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:18.100
you can set up a listener
for this on state change event.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.901
So any time
the player state changes,

00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:21.501
like, if the user
plays it or pauses it

00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:23.834
or the video ends,
you can listen for that state

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.000
and then act upon it.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.667
So you can know
when the video ends

00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:28.434
or if the user paused it.

00:17:28.434 --> 00:17:30.000
You could also compare
the current time

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.334
to the duration
of the video as well

00:17:31.334 --> 00:17:33.167
and find it out that way.

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:34.801
But the events are probably
a little cleaner.

00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:36.734
And then
there's an error event,

00:17:36.734 --> 00:17:38.634
which this only has
one error listed,

00:17:38.634 --> 00:17:40.234
but there's actually two
different errors you can get.

00:17:40.234 --> 00:17:42.601
One would be if the video
has been taken down,

00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:45.133
or if it's now private,
or something like that.

00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:49.267
And the other one
is if the video is, uh,

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:51.501
has embedding disabled,

00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:53.267
which I believe
is a 101 error.

00:17:53.267 --> 00:17:55.634
But I haven't updated
the documentation yet.

00:17:55.634 --> 00:17:57.334
The way that this works

00:17:57.334 --> 00:17:58.901
is when you load the player
in the page,

00:17:58.901 --> 00:18:00.434
you have to add
a player parameter

00:18:00.434 --> 00:18:02.167
in order to enable
the JavaScript API,

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:03.667
called enable JSAPI.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.734
You set it to one.

00:18:05.734 --> 00:18:07.300
And what this does
is it tells the player

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.467
that you want the JavaScript API
to be turned on.

00:18:09.467 --> 00:18:11.367
And so by default
it's turned off

00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:13.033
so we don't call
random JavaScript functions

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:14.634
on everybody's pages.

00:18:14.634 --> 00:18:16.100
Once you call that,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.634
when the player
loads on the page,

00:18:17.634 --> 00:18:20.000
it's going to call
this function called

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.501
"on YouTube player ready"

00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:25.167
which is mentioned right here.

00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:26.901
Right here.

00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:28.901
So what you do
is you specify this function

00:18:28.901 --> 00:18:30.934
called "on YouTube player ready"
in JavaScript on your page.

00:18:30.934 --> 00:18:33.033
Once the player loads, it calls
on YouTube player ready,

00:18:33.033 --> 00:18:35.300
and that's how you know
the player is ready.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.968
Um, there is a certain case

00:18:36.968 --> 00:18:38.934
where if you have more
than one player on your page,

00:18:38.934 --> 00:18:40.734
you might not know
which one is ready.

00:18:40.734 --> 00:18:43.601
So there's another variable
called player--

00:18:43.601 --> 00:18:46.267
"player API ID,"
which is right here.

00:18:46.267 --> 00:18:48.367
And you basically just set that
to any string that you want.

00:18:48.367 --> 00:18:50.501
It should be, like,
a unique string, obviously.

00:18:50.501 --> 00:18:52.467
And what happens
is when the player then calls

00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:53.834
on YouTube player ready,

00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:55.501
it'll pass that string
back to that function.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.901
So you know which
of your players is ready

00:18:56.901 --> 00:18:58.567
and which ones
are still initializing.

00:18:58.567 --> 00:18:59.701
Yeah?

00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:04.734
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:19:04.734 --> 00:19:06.767
Stearns: Um, so the--

00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:07.934
Yeah, so the question is

00:19:07.934 --> 00:19:09.367
is there a way
to stay in full screen

00:19:09.367 --> 00:19:10.667
and jump from video
to video?

00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:12.334
In the normal embedded player,
no, there's not.

00:19:12.334 --> 00:19:14.534
There's no way to load
a new video at this point.

00:19:14.534 --> 00:19:16.200
It is something
that I want to add,

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.200
but I don't know how long
it'll be until that's added.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.901
With the chromeless player,
you could do that.

00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:22.534
So in the chromeless player,
it doesn't have

00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:24.200
native full screen
functionality that we do.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.567
But if you load
the chromeless player

00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:27.767
into your own SWF
and make that go full screen,

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.033
then you could load a new video
into the chromeless player,

00:19:30.033 --> 00:19:31.467
and it would stay
in full screen,

00:19:31.467 --> 00:19:32.767
and you could load
the new video.

00:19:32.767 --> 00:19:34.234
So you guys could do, like,
a full immersive

00:19:34.234 --> 00:19:35.868
full screen mode where they
never have to leave

00:19:35.868 --> 00:19:39.300
and load whatever videos
you want.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.801
Um, let's see.

00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:43.234
So that's pretty much it.

00:19:43.234 --> 00:19:44.801
There's a lot of other
example code on this page

00:19:44.801 --> 00:19:46.300
to get you started.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.734
And the demo that I showed
is down here at the bottom

00:19:47.734 --> 00:19:50.634
where the sample stuff is at.

00:19:50.634 --> 00:19:53.534
So let me show you
a couple other demos

00:19:53.534 --> 00:19:57.267
using the embedded player.

00:19:57.267 --> 00:19:58.767
So here's something
that I put together

00:19:58.767 --> 00:20:00.534
after I made the API.

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:03.267
This was sort of inspired
by a mashup I saw a while back

00:20:03.267 --> 00:20:05.601
on the Internet called--

00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:07.067
It was using a video
called "Rendezvous,"

00:20:07.067 --> 00:20:09.534
and it a guy--it's an old
classic video apparently

00:20:09.534 --> 00:20:11.100
of a guy who races
through Paris

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.767
going really, really fast
in a car.

00:20:12.767 --> 00:20:14.434
And somebody had taken
a Google Maps thing

00:20:14.434 --> 00:20:15.801
and had planned out his route

00:20:15.801 --> 00:20:17.434
and synchronized it
with the video.

00:20:17.434 --> 00:20:18.834
Only it was, like,
fake synchronization

00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:20.133
where you had to, like,
start the video

00:20:20.133 --> 00:20:21.467
and then start the map
at the same time

00:20:21.467 --> 00:20:23.267
and hope that
they were synched up.

00:20:23.267 --> 00:20:24.667
So I did this video
as sort of--

00:20:24.667 --> 00:20:25.868
kind of a parody of that,

00:20:25.868 --> 00:20:27.133
but then also
sort of a showcase

00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:29.400
of what you can do
with the embedded player API.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.801
So what this does
is it takes this race

00:20:32.801 --> 00:20:37.133
that goes down
a really twisty street here

00:20:37.133 --> 00:20:39.868
in San Francisco,
and it sort of synchronizes

00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:43.801
the guys' travel down the street
on this Google Map.

00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:45.601
[crowd cheering]

00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:48.167
So unlike the other mashup
that I had seen,

00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:50.367
this one actually
synchronizes it with the player.

00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:51.767
Since we're using
the player API,

00:20:51.767 --> 00:20:54.300
we already know
where the player position is

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.567
when you're playing stuff back.

00:20:55.567 --> 00:20:57.100
So if I back up here,
you'll see the map

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.234
will stay synchronized with it
and back up with it.

00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:01.334
So I can actually drag this
and, like, jump ahead,

00:21:01.334 --> 00:21:02.734
and the map will always
stay synchronized

00:21:02.734 --> 00:21:05.868
exactly with where
the guy is in the video.

00:21:05.868 --> 00:21:08.300
So this isn't real GPS data.
I wish it were.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.701
That would make it
really cool.

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.167
I actually set up--

00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:12.767
There's sort of like
a debug mode on the map's code

00:21:12.767 --> 00:21:14.033
that I borrowed
from the other guy

00:21:14.033 --> 00:21:15.934
where you can just kinda
click on the map in an area

00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:18.067
and it'll follow
where you're clicking.

00:21:18.067 --> 00:21:20.701
So you can, you know, plan out
the area you want to go to.

00:21:20.701 --> 00:21:22.901
And then I just sort of manually
tweaked it a little bit.

00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:24.767
man: Whoo.

00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:26.334
Stearns: And if you view
the source of this page,

00:21:26.334 --> 00:21:28.300
all the source is there,
you guys can look at it.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.868
Uh, the URL's right here
if you can see that.

00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:32.834
It's linked
on my presentation.

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:34.667
So if you grab
my presentation,

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:38.234
you can see it.

00:21:38.234 --> 00:21:42.234
Okay, let's go back
to this here.

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.901
All right,
so here's another thing.

00:21:44.901 --> 00:21:47.501
This was actually started
as, I think, a 20% project

00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:50.234
of a Google engineer
down in Mountain View.

00:21:50.234 --> 00:21:53.100
They wanted to have
a debate tool,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.467
I guess you could call it,

00:21:54.467 --> 00:21:56.501
where they wanted to watch
these presidential debates,

00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:57.901
and then add
a sort of transcript,

00:21:57.901 --> 00:22:00.501
and then also have a sort of
interactive feature to it

00:22:00.501 --> 00:22:02.567
where, you know,
if a politician said something

00:22:02.567 --> 00:22:04.400
in their debate,
you could look it up

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.934
and then, you know,
add the transcript later

00:22:05.934 --> 00:22:07.501
saying, you know, "This
isn't necessarily accurate."

00:22:07.501 --> 00:22:09.400
You know, "There might be
some other stuff here."

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.701
Or, you know,
"This is accurate.

00:22:10.701 --> 00:22:12.501
And in addition,
here's some more information."

00:22:12.501 --> 00:22:14.334
So there's a few different
videos here.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:15.767
And you can actually pick one.

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.334
And you have this transcript
for the video

00:22:17.334 --> 00:22:19.300
that goes along next to it.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.701
And you can jump around
by either clicking here,

00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:23.400
and you can jump around
the video.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.801
Or if you just watch
the video,

00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:26.534
this transcript will stay
synchronized the whole time

00:22:26.534 --> 00:22:27.701
while you're watching it.

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:30.567
It's a pretty nice
use of it I think.

00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:31.701
man: And especially Mexico.

00:22:31.701 --> 00:22:33.467
Southern Mexico,
it was a disaster.

00:22:33.467 --> 00:22:35.667
It destroyed the entire
agricultural economy.

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:37.801
Guess what happened,
they all came north.

00:22:37.801 --> 00:22:39.467
If NAFTA had worked
so well as--

00:22:39.467 --> 00:22:41.667
Stearns: Oh, my God.

00:22:41.667 --> 00:22:43.601
Um, let's see.

00:22:43.601 --> 00:22:45.267
And then this is
sort of the same idea.

00:22:45.267 --> 00:22:46.901
This was, uh--

00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:49.767
Michael Geary actually
came up to us at Google I/O

00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:52.467
a few weeks back
and saw the demos.

00:22:52.467 --> 00:22:53.901
And I think
he went home that night

00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:56.767
and coded this into
a jQuery plugin the next day,

00:22:56.767 --> 00:22:58.033
and showed up at our booth
and said,

00:22:58.033 --> 00:22:59.601
"Hey, look what I made.
It's pretty cool."

00:22:59.601 --> 00:23:00.801
So this is really neat.

00:23:00.801 --> 00:23:02.667
This is sort of like
a presentation tool

00:23:02.667 --> 00:23:04.200
where he took a video--

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.767
I believe he gave a talk
at Google a while back

00:23:06.767 --> 00:23:08.934
about YouTube map mashups

00:23:08.934 --> 00:23:10.367
where he did
some election maps

00:23:10.367 --> 00:23:12.601
using YouTube Maps
and the maps API.

00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:14.701
woman: All right,
so this is Mike Geary.

00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:16.067
So I originally--

00:23:16.067 --> 00:23:17.667
Stearns: So he made
this little tool.

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:19.067
And this is actually
a jQuery plugin

00:23:19.067 --> 00:23:20.334
that you can take

00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:22.167
and add a bunch
of pointers to your video.

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:24.434
And this is, you can see,
it's, like, an hour-long video

00:23:24.434 --> 00:23:25.834
of the presentation.

00:23:25.834 --> 00:23:27.834
And as it goes through,
this will follow along.

00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:30.000
You can see it just
changed there on its own.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.534
And then in this
big area here,

00:23:31.534 --> 00:23:33.234
it actually loads in
a URL that you give it,

00:23:33.234 --> 00:23:34.934
or it could load, you know,
it could load a slide

00:23:34.934 --> 00:23:36.834
of your presentation
if you wanted it to.

00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:38.534
Or in his case,
he actually loads

00:23:38.534 --> 00:23:41.167
different HTML pages
and the actual Maps demos

00:23:41.167 --> 00:23:43.367
that he's talking about
in the apps.

00:23:43.367 --> 00:23:48.801
Like, if you look at
Iowa maps API map,

00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:52.400
you can see
this actually loads

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.267
the thing that he's talking
about in the thing here.

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.000
And this is actually
a live Google Maps thing.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.868
So you can move it around
and play with it and zoom in

00:23:57.868 --> 00:24:00.033
and actually play with it
while the talk is going on

00:24:00.033 --> 00:24:01.434
while you're listening
to the talk.

00:24:01.434 --> 00:24:03.100
So I thought this was
a really nice use

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.367
of the player API.

00:24:04.367 --> 00:24:05.734
And it always
stays synchronized

00:24:05.734 --> 00:24:08.367
as the video plays.

00:24:08.367 --> 00:24:10.100
And the source code
is all there.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.367
I think it's anno two,
but I guess he called it--

00:24:13.367 --> 00:24:14.767
And like I said,
it's a jQuery plugin.

00:24:14.767 --> 00:24:16.167
So if you're using
jQuery already,

00:24:16.167 --> 00:24:17.801
it's really easy
to get started and using it.

00:24:17.801 --> 00:24:20.767
You just basically
set your stuff up and go.

00:24:20.767 --> 00:24:22.834
Um...

00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:24.667
All right.

00:24:24.667 --> 00:24:28.167
So...

00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:30.367
Um, the Flash API,
does anybody use Flash?

00:24:30.367 --> 00:24:31.701
Anybody care about Flash?

00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:33.000
Should I go over
the Flash stuff?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.701
All right, there's
a good number of people.

00:24:34.701 --> 00:24:36.100
So I'll talk about it
a little bit.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.501
There's not really
a lot to talk about.

00:24:37.501 --> 00:24:38.868
Everything that's in
the JavaScript API

00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:40.968
that I mentioned is also
available in the Flash API.

00:24:40.968 --> 00:24:43.801
So it's pretty much
the same thing.

00:24:43.801 --> 00:24:45.400
The one caveat
is that our players

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.033
are written
in ActionScript 2.

00:24:47.033 --> 00:24:48.501
I'm sorry.

00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:50.033
But we do that
so we reach more people.

00:24:50.033 --> 00:24:51.501
So I know all you guys
are probably using

00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:53.000
crazy ActionScript three.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.200
You can still embed the player
in ActionScript three,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.634
but it takes a little bit
of extra work.

00:24:57.634 --> 00:24:59.434
So you're probably familiar
if you're a Flash developer

00:24:59.434 --> 00:25:02.601
that AS 2 cannot talk
directly to an AS 3 SWF.

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:04.667
So you have to write
some sort of wrapper

00:25:04.667 --> 00:25:06.567
that uses either
external interface

00:25:06.567 --> 00:25:08.767
or a local connection
to talk between the SWFs.

00:25:08.767 --> 00:25:11.300
I've seen a few people do it.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.667
I think this presentation--

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:14.400
or one of these demos
I'm gonna show does it.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.267
So it is possible.

00:25:16.267 --> 00:25:17.767
And there's
a lot of talk about it

00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:19.234
on our GData API forum

00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:20.667
if you guys are interested
in checking it out

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:22.934
and you want
to get on there.

00:25:22.934 --> 00:25:24.567
Um...

00:25:24.567 --> 00:25:26.200
The only difference really
with the Flash API

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.434
is how you load the player.

00:25:27.434 --> 00:25:29.100
So you actually load it
into a movie clip,

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.667
and then you can call this

00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:32.567
"is player loaded" call.

00:25:32.567 --> 00:25:34.334
You basically have to set up
some sort of loop or something

00:25:34.334 --> 00:25:36.501
that checks
until it's loaded.

00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:38.400
And then when it's loaded,
it'll let you know,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.868
and you can start calling
all the API calls.

00:25:44.868 --> 00:25:47.567
Um, okay.

00:25:47.567 --> 00:25:50.501
So the chromeless player.

00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:52.601
The chromeless player,
I can actually claim

00:25:52.601 --> 00:25:56.267
that I designed
the chromeless player.

00:25:56.267 --> 00:25:57.868
The visual design, that is.

00:25:57.868 --> 00:25:59.467
And that's because it doesn't
have a visual design.

00:25:59.467 --> 00:26:01.601
All it has is a logo.

00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:05.033
So to show you an example
of the chromeless player

00:26:05.033 --> 00:26:08.100
I suppose...

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.567
[clears throat]

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:12.534
Here it is.
Ta-da!

00:26:12.534 --> 00:26:14.467
Hold the applause, please.
No applause.

00:26:14.467 --> 00:26:19.100
[laughter]

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.067
All right, so the idea
behind the chromeless player

00:26:21.067 --> 00:26:23.701
was that we wanted
to give people

00:26:23.701 --> 00:26:26.501
as much control
over our player as we could,

00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:28.601
within reason obviously.

00:26:28.601 --> 00:26:31.534
So we still want to add
all of our cool features,

00:26:31.534 --> 00:26:35.200
like, you know,
annotations and things and--

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.901
Excuse me.

00:26:36.901 --> 00:26:40.734
And all the fun stuff.

00:26:40.734 --> 00:26:42.634
And also hopefully
make it easier

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:46.367
for you guys to develop
with our things,

00:26:46.367 --> 00:26:48.067
with our videos,
I should say.

00:26:48.067 --> 00:26:49.634
So the chromeless player
has all the same controls,

00:26:49.634 --> 00:26:51.200
JavaScript controls,
Flash controls,

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.100
as the embedded player does,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.901
only it doesn't have
all the extra stuff,

00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:56.434
like, you know,
the related videos

00:26:56.434 --> 00:26:59.367
and the color settings
and the control bar and things.

00:27:02.601 --> 00:27:04.734
All right.

00:27:04.734 --> 00:27:09.267
So, um,
that's pretty much it.

00:27:09.267 --> 00:27:12.267
I want to show you guys
some demos

00:27:12.267 --> 00:27:14.801
'cause I already have
this one up.

00:27:14.801 --> 00:27:16.334
This one was
a pretty recent thing.

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:19.634
This was done
by a little agency

00:27:19.634 --> 00:27:22.701
in, I don't know, I think
Philadelphia or something.

00:27:22.701 --> 00:27:24.234
And this is for JCPenney.

00:27:24.234 --> 00:27:26.667
And they did, like,
a little karaoke machine.

00:27:26.667 --> 00:27:29.534
And you can actually
start singing.

00:27:29.534 --> 00:27:30.901
And what it does is it--

00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:33.000
They basically capture
their own video,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.534
and it's a Flash app
obviously.

00:27:34.534 --> 00:27:35.934
It's, like,
a full page thing.

00:27:35.934 --> 00:27:39.334
I think it's actually AS 3.

00:27:39.334 --> 00:27:44.567
And let's do
"Ballroom Blitz" I guess.

00:27:44.567 --> 00:27:47.767
And it records you--

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:49.334
I guess it'll record me.

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:50.801
I don't know,
I'll have to like--

00:27:50.801 --> 00:27:52.968
I'll have to scoot down here.

00:27:52.968 --> 00:27:54.267
Oh, no.

00:27:54.267 --> 00:27:57.067
Well, it didn't find
my webcam properly.

00:27:57.067 --> 00:27:59.067
Whoops.

00:27:59.067 --> 00:28:01.133
We don't want
to watch that one again.

00:28:01.133 --> 00:28:02.501
man: Watch the balloon again.

00:28:02.501 --> 00:28:04.100
Stearns: Yeah.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.167
I'm gonna bring a balloon
to this thing next time.

00:28:07.167 --> 00:28:08.701
Let me open that up again.

00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:10.300
All right,
I'll just show you guys one

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.601
that somebody has made.

00:28:11.601 --> 00:28:13.901
So what they do is they
basically record the camera

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:15.200
in their app.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.834
They send it up to--

00:28:16.834 --> 00:28:19.734
They can sort of transpose
and sort of--

00:28:19.734 --> 00:28:21.267
I don't know, I guess
"transpose" isn't the word.

00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:24.133
They can sort of mash up
all these sort of different,

00:28:24.133 --> 00:28:27.968
uh, effects and things
that they've done

00:28:27.968 --> 00:28:30.701
that are similar to, like,
what you can do in iChat

00:28:30.701 --> 00:28:32.567
if you have the most
recent version of iChat.

00:28:32.567 --> 00:28:34.834
And then they send it
to YouTube.

00:28:34.834 --> 00:28:38.167
And then they play it back
using the chromeless player.

00:28:38.167 --> 00:28:39.901
So this is the chromeless player
loaded into their app,

00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:41.200
and then they have
their own custom UI.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.300
You know, it's real simple,
just play/pause.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.167
And then you can listen
to all these people singing.

00:28:45.167 --> 00:28:46.868
So it's like
a karaoke app.

00:28:46.868 --> 00:28:49.567
man singing softly:
And I ran.

00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:52.434
I ran so far away.

00:28:52.434 --> 00:28:56.000
Stearns: Yeah, not everybody
really gets into it as much.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.267
man singing:
I couldn't get away.

00:29:02.167 --> 00:29:03.734
Stearns: We could find
a good one I guess.

00:29:03.734 --> 00:29:05.133
Let's find somebody good.

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:06.434
This guy looks like a pro.

00:29:06.434 --> 00:29:10.200
[laughter]

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.534
Yeah.

00:29:11.534 --> 00:29:13.601
man singing:
I'm all out of love.

00:29:13.601 --> 00:29:16.000
I'm so lost without you.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.801
I knew you were right

00:29:17.801 --> 00:29:20.367
believing for so long.

00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:22.234
in falsetto:
I'm all out of love.

00:29:22.234 --> 00:29:24.467
I'm so lost without you.

00:29:24.467 --> 00:29:26.901
I knew you were right.

00:29:26.901 --> 00:29:30.367
Rachel, come back.

00:29:30.367 --> 00:29:34.601
Ahh-ah-ah!

00:29:34.601 --> 00:29:37.534
Get this thing
out of my face.

00:29:37.534 --> 00:29:39.734
Stearns: Yeah, so--

00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:40.934
[laughter]

00:29:40.934 --> 00:29:42.634
So the way
that this works, I believe,

00:29:42.634 --> 00:29:44.601
is they capture frames
of the video, or the video,

00:29:44.601 --> 00:29:47.501
and then add their effects on
the client's side using Flash.

00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:49.000
And all these effects
that you see,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.234
like the stars
flying around things,

00:29:50.234 --> 00:29:52.334
I think are actually done
in Flash

00:29:52.334 --> 00:29:53.734
using, you know,
just random things.

00:29:53.734 --> 00:29:55.067
And then you can do,
like, different stuff.

00:29:55.067 --> 00:29:56.767
And you can actually
manipulate bitmap stuff

00:29:56.767 --> 00:29:58.734
really well in Flash, so.

00:29:58.734 --> 00:30:00.200
And then they take that
and they send--

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.734
they compile the video
on their server,

00:30:01.734 --> 00:30:03.467
and then suit it up
to YouTube using the API

00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:05.133
and then load it
back through the API

00:30:05.133 --> 00:30:08.100
into their app there
and display it all.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.767
So it's a really nice use.

00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:11.734
I have a few other demos
of the chromeless player

00:30:11.734 --> 00:30:13.667
that I want
to show you guys too.

00:30:13.667 --> 00:30:16.167
If you're not up to writing
your own player that uses it,

00:30:16.167 --> 00:30:20.167
there's a really popular player
called JW FLV player

00:30:20.167 --> 00:30:21.868
that some of you
may have heard of.

00:30:21.868 --> 00:30:23.033
It's pretty popular.

00:30:23.033 --> 00:30:24.767
If you don't recognize
these controls,

00:30:24.767 --> 00:30:26.734
you probably will see it around
the Internet at some point.

00:30:26.734 --> 00:30:28.667
It's a really popular
just sort of really generic

00:30:28.667 --> 00:30:30.834
FLV player that plays
pretty much anything.

00:30:30.834 --> 00:30:33.300
And it's really, really
customizable.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.167
So when I did
the chromeless player,

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:36.701
I told this guy about it.

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:38.701
And he was interested
to get the chromeless player

00:30:38.701 --> 00:30:39.868
into his player.

00:30:39.868 --> 00:30:41.334
So you can actually
use this player now

00:30:41.334 --> 00:30:44.234
to play YouTube videos because
it uses the chromeless player.

00:30:44.234 --> 00:30:46.033
[David Hasselhoff's
"Jump in My Car" plays]

00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:52.334
So he chose also a really
awesome video to demo this.

00:30:52.334 --> 00:30:56.067
Hasselhoff singing:
Jump in my car.

00:30:56.067 --> 00:30:59.834
I want to take you home.

00:30:59.834 --> 00:31:03.601
Come on and jump in my car.

00:31:03.601 --> 00:31:08.467
It's too far
to walk on your own.

00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:10.033
women singing:
No, thank you, sir.

00:31:10.033 --> 00:31:11.334
Hasselhoff singing:
Oh, come on.

00:31:11.334 --> 00:31:12.734
Stearns:
And you can see here

00:31:12.734 --> 00:31:14.067
it's really customizable.

00:31:14.067 --> 00:31:15.334
And you can go through here
and customize

00:31:15.334 --> 00:31:16.501
pretty much anything.

00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:17.801
You can auto start.

00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:20.868
He actually has
a full screen option here too.

00:31:20.868 --> 00:31:22.234
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:31:22.234 --> 00:31:23.934
Stearns: No.

00:31:23.934 --> 00:31:25.167
man: Too much of it.

00:31:25.167 --> 00:31:26.701
Stearns:
What, you don't like this?

00:31:26.701 --> 00:31:28.601
You don't like The Hoff?

00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:30.567
[song begins again]

00:31:30.567 --> 00:31:33.100
Uh, and I'm not
really sure why,

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.133
but the YouTube logo
gets really big on this one

00:31:35.133 --> 00:31:36.501
when it goes full screen.

00:31:36.501 --> 00:31:38.234
But you can actually call
set size on the player,

00:31:38.234 --> 00:31:39.434
and set it to the size,

00:31:39.434 --> 00:31:41.167
and the logo should stay
the small size.

00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:42.934
So he must be doing
something funky with that.

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:46.467
But you should be able
to get that fixed there.

00:31:46.467 --> 00:31:48.634
So that's sort of an example
of the chromeless player.

00:31:48.634 --> 00:31:50.567
So going full screen.

00:31:50.567 --> 00:31:51.834
So, like, you can see this.

00:31:51.834 --> 00:31:55.100
And if you were
to customize this player

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.767
to allow, you know,
to load new videos,

00:31:56.767 --> 00:31:58.133
then you could have
a full screen player

00:31:58.133 --> 00:31:59.501
that just always stays
full screen,

00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:01.801
and just always loads
new videos as they sit there.

00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:03.267
Hasselhoff singing:
How can you say that?

00:32:03.267 --> 00:32:04.534
We've only just met.

00:32:04.534 --> 00:32:06.901
Stearns: Yeah.

00:32:06.901 --> 00:32:08.167
It's a good video.

00:32:08.167 --> 00:32:10.367
You guys should watch that
at some point.

00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:12.801
man: Is it possible to detect

00:32:12.801 --> 00:32:15.067
the exit of the full screen?

00:32:15.067 --> 00:32:16.534
Stearns: So is it possible

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:17.934
to detect the exit
of the full screen?

00:32:17.934 --> 00:32:20.033
Yes, if you're using
Flash, you can.

00:32:20.033 --> 00:32:22.434
Whatever the container
movie clip is,

00:32:22.434 --> 00:32:23.968
there's an on full screen event
that gets fired,

00:32:23.968 --> 00:32:25.634
and it tells you if it's
going into full screen

00:32:25.634 --> 00:32:27.000
or exiting full screen.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.133
man: What about in files
using JavaScript?

00:32:29.133 --> 00:32:30.868
Stearns: No.

00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:33.033
Our player doesn't have that
built in either.

00:32:33.033 --> 00:32:35.834
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:32:35.834 --> 00:32:38.734
Stearns: Right, I mean,
it could be as simple

00:32:38.734 --> 00:32:41.901
as making a SWF that proxy's
the JavaScript calls

00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:43.467
to the JavaScript
into our player

00:32:43.467 --> 00:32:44.834
and that also has

00:32:44.834 --> 00:32:47.000
the on full screen event handler
and, like, that's it.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.667
So it would be
a pretty simple SWF

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:50.000
if that's all you wanted.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.200
man: Would the events
that are defined by RealPlayer

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.701
be allocated out--

00:32:54.701 --> 00:32:57.067
Stearns: You'd have
to do it yourself.

00:32:57.067 --> 00:32:58.968
man: So we'd pretty much
have to recreate everything--

00:32:58.968 --> 00:33:00.901
Stearns: Yeah, but that API's
not that big.

00:33:00.901 --> 00:33:02.868
So it wouldn't be
that difficult.

00:33:02.868 --> 00:33:04.400
There's another question
back there.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.868
man: Yeah, what's the advantage
of using the chromeless player

00:33:06.868 --> 00:33:10.968
[continues indistinctly]

00:33:10.968 --> 00:33:13.033
Stearns: Um, well,
the difference is that

00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:16.434
we don't allow people
to access our FLVs directly.

00:33:16.434 --> 00:33:18.000
You have to jump
through a lot of hoops to do it.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.968
And it's not supported by us,
and we really discourage it.

00:33:21.968 --> 00:33:23.968
The reason being
is that we have--

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:25.934
We give a lot of users options
when they upload their videos.

00:33:25.934 --> 00:33:27.234
Like, they'll only want this
to be available

00:33:27.234 --> 00:33:28.834
in this country,

00:33:28.834 --> 00:33:31.667
or maybe they only want their
friends to be able to see it.

00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:33.501
And if you go
to the FLVs directly,

00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:34.767
you bypass all of that.

00:33:34.767 --> 00:33:36.200
So our players are, like,
the gateway.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.267
So our players are sort of,
you know,

00:33:38.267 --> 00:33:40.634
playing the cop
to our FLV things

00:33:40.634 --> 00:33:42.801
to enforce people's options.

00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:44.300
So you could in fact
piss off your users

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.667
if they went to your site
and you started playing

00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:47.000
their private videos,
and they'd be like,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.267
"What's wrong with you guys?"

00:33:48.267 --> 00:33:49.734
So it's better to use
the chromeless player

00:33:49.734 --> 00:33:51.234
or the embedded player.

00:33:51.234 --> 00:33:53.501
And then we won't send you
nasty illegal letters either.

00:33:53.501 --> 00:33:54.801
[laughter]

00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:57.100
Small--small footnote there.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.501
Um, any other questions
before we keep going?

00:33:59.501 --> 00:34:01.267
All right, I'll leave some
time at the end for questions.

00:34:01.267 --> 00:34:02.767
Actually, how much longer
do I have?

00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:04.901
15 minutes.

00:34:04.901 --> 00:34:06.734
I think so.
All right.

00:34:06.734 --> 00:34:09.133
A few more examples.

00:34:09.133 --> 00:34:11.367
This is a company
called Slide.

00:34:11.367 --> 00:34:13.634
They do a lot
of Facebook apps and things.

00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:16.033
They have a way that you can
customize the chromeless player

00:34:16.033 --> 00:34:17.968
and then put it
on your site I think.

00:34:17.968 --> 00:34:19.601
So they have, like, a bunch
of skins you can choose.

00:34:19.601 --> 00:34:22.534
I like this one 'cause
it's got lots of bling.

00:34:22.534 --> 00:34:25.200
Then you can, like,
pick a video you want.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.667
And it basically
looks like this,

00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:28.000
so you can have, like,
a custom player,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.667
and it plays
in their player.

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:31.400
Whoops, this actually
makes you save it

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.767
before you can play it.

00:34:35.767 --> 00:34:39.734
No, skip.

00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:42.167
So here's my video,
and then I can hit play.

00:34:42.167 --> 00:34:46.267
[man singing, crowd cheering]

00:34:46.267 --> 00:34:49.100
Stearns: So that's about it
for that one.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.734
Um, let's see.

00:34:50.734 --> 00:34:53.067
Here's another example
of someone

00:34:53.067 --> 00:34:56.133
who had made a custom UI

00:34:56.133 --> 00:34:59.634
using all Flash.

00:34:59.634 --> 00:35:02.133
So this is actually a SWF that
loads the chromeless player.

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:04.200
Again, sort of like
the JW FLV player.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.534
And they have their own thing.

00:35:05.534 --> 00:35:06.934
So what they have
is they have it set up

00:35:06.934 --> 00:35:08.934
so you can actually pick
a YouTube user channel,

00:35:08.934 --> 00:35:12.400
or user favorites,
or playlist, or whatever,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.501
and then put in, you know,
either the user name

00:35:14.501 --> 00:35:17.501
or maybe, like, a keyword,
I think, or something like that.

00:35:17.501 --> 00:35:19.234
And it'll actually make you
a player

00:35:19.234 --> 00:35:20.400
that you can embed
on your site.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.601
And then that player
will play, like,

00:35:21.601 --> 00:35:22.834
all your favorite videos,

00:35:22.834 --> 00:35:24.367
or a specific user's videos
if you want.

00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:25.467
So it's kinda cool.

00:35:25.467 --> 00:35:26.834
So these are, like,
playing videos

00:35:26.834 --> 00:35:28.834
from Big Cat Rescue.

00:35:28.834 --> 00:35:30.534
One time I was showing this
at a talk,

00:35:30.534 --> 00:35:32.067
and there was a video
of a tiger

00:35:32.067 --> 00:35:33.901
carrying around
a severed cow head.

00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:35.234
And it was really gross.

00:35:35.234 --> 00:35:36.601
[laughter]

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:38.300
I just thought I would
share that with you guys.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.033
woman: Like any youngster,
Hope just had to show off--

00:35:41.033 --> 00:35:42.601
Stearns: That didn't look
like a big cat.

00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:43.901
That looked
like a house cat.

00:35:43.901 --> 00:35:45.968
All right, anyway,
one more quick thing.

00:35:45.968 --> 00:35:47.834
This one was done by a guy
I used to work with

00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:49.801
that I thought
was kinda neat.

00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:52.300
There's a whole sort of--

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:57.100
Whoops, why is that there?

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:01.734
So there's this whole sort of,

00:36:01.734 --> 00:36:03.834
uh, sort of subculture
on YouTube, I guess,

00:36:03.834 --> 00:36:07.300
that videotape records
and 45s and things.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.334
They put a camera and point it
at their 45 and play it.

00:36:09.334 --> 00:36:10.701
So they have, like,
all this really cool, old,

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:12.601
like, reggae, and ska music,
and stuff.

00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:13.667
[cat meows]

00:36:13.667 --> 00:36:15.634
And apparently cats meowing.

00:36:15.634 --> 00:36:17.300
I guess that's
on the record.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.133
So he set this up so it's
sort of like a little,

00:36:19.133 --> 00:36:21.501
like, a jukebox thing
where it'll play one thing.

00:36:21.501 --> 00:36:23.400
And then when this is done,
it'll start playing

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.133
the other one automatically
and then load a new video.

00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:26.734
And there's a few
different users where, like,

00:36:26.734 --> 00:36:28.534
all their videos
are just this stuff.

00:36:28.534 --> 00:36:30.033
So you can just pick
the username and then play it.

00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:31.834
I thought this
was kinda neat.

00:36:31.834 --> 00:36:35.033
And it uses, you know,
the volume.

00:36:35.033 --> 00:36:36.367
And if you don't like a song,

00:36:36.367 --> 00:36:38.000
you can just start playing
this one.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.200
And then when this one
starts playing,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.767
the other ones stops and--

00:36:41.767 --> 00:36:43.567
I don't know,
it's kinda neat.

00:36:43.567 --> 00:36:46.801
Really simple,
but interesting, I thought.

00:36:46.801 --> 00:36:48.767
Um, all right,
so that's it.

00:36:48.767 --> 00:36:50.968
So I was gonna do
a demo here really quick

00:36:50.968 --> 00:36:52.934
of the JavaScript stuff,
but I think I went over it all.

00:36:52.934 --> 00:36:56.834
So why don't we just jump
right to questions.

00:36:56.834 --> 00:36:59.300
And then if you guys
have questions

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.834
about the JavaScript stuff,
I can answer them

00:37:01.834 --> 00:37:03.367
and sort of
do the demo that way.

00:37:03.367 --> 00:37:04.601
Question over here, yeah?

00:37:04.601 --> 00:37:06.133
man: Sorry, I have
a JavaScript question.

00:37:06.133 --> 00:37:07.300
Stearns: Oh, no problem.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.133
man: I've seen some examples

00:37:09.133 --> 00:37:11.534
of people putting
their own logos on the videos,

00:37:11.534 --> 00:37:13.834
which I imagine is somewhat
of a sensitive topic.

00:37:13.834 --> 00:37:17.400
What's the Google policy
on that?

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.267
Stearns: Um, so disclaimer.

00:37:19.267 --> 00:37:20.667
I'm not a lawyer, obviously.

00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:24.667
But, uh, if you're using
the chromeless player,

00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:26.267
it's gonna have
our logo on it.

00:37:26.267 --> 00:37:27.834
Or the embedded player's
gonna have our logo on it.

00:37:27.834 --> 00:37:29.434
So usually if you see somebody
that's using that

00:37:29.434 --> 00:37:30.834
with their own logo,
they're probably not using

00:37:30.834 --> 00:37:32.000
one of our players.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.501
So it's, like,
totally unsupported

00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:34.834
by our terms of service,

00:37:34.834 --> 00:37:36.901
and it's a violation of
our terms of service, I believe.

00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:38.400
You know, unless they have
some special arrangement.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.901
But to my knowledge,
I don't think we even do

00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:41.634
special arrangements
like that.

00:37:41.634 --> 00:37:45.167
So it's probably way bad.

00:37:45.167 --> 00:37:47.033
Don't do it.

00:37:47.033 --> 00:37:48.968
Any other questions?

00:37:48.968 --> 00:37:50.834
In the very far back there,
yeah?

00:37:50.834 --> 00:37:55.567
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:37:55.567 --> 00:37:57.734
Stearns: So the question is what
kind of control do you have

00:37:57.734 --> 00:37:59.300
over the bit rate the videos
are encoded at?

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.300
And the answer
is absolutely none.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.200
YouTube encodes them
at our own bit rate,

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.634
so whatever we want
when the user uploads it.

00:38:06.634 --> 00:38:08.434
If you look at
the YouTube site lately,

00:38:08.434 --> 00:38:10.100
you'll notice that we do have
on some videos

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.000
a high quality mode.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.868
So you can actually watch them
at a higher quality.

00:38:13.868 --> 00:38:16.501
So I think the default size
is somewhere around

00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:19.667
320x240 for, like, the small,
classic sort of YouTube sizes.

00:38:19.667 --> 00:38:21.734
And then we have
bigger sizes from there.

00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:23.968
And then you'll see different
sort of bigger quality stuff

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.901
on, like, iPhones
and Apple TVs and things.

00:38:25.901 --> 00:38:27.934
But we don't, I believe,
don't give access to those

00:38:27.934 --> 00:38:29.868
in the API stuff.

00:38:29.868 --> 00:38:31.501
So at some point
down the road,

00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:33.267
we will be adding high quality
to the embedded players,

00:38:33.267 --> 00:38:34.801
but it's a matter
of seeing the feature

00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:36.601
mature and stabilize
on the site first

00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:38.734
before that happens.

00:38:38.734 --> 00:38:41.100
The thing is that when we add
new features on the site,

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.601
we have to let them
sort of settle in.

00:38:42.601 --> 00:38:44.033
'Cause if we add them
to the embedded player

00:38:44.033 --> 00:38:45.467
and add them to the API,

00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:47.467
then you guys get really mad
if we ever change them, right?

00:38:47.467 --> 00:38:48.868
So we want them to be solid

00:38:48.868 --> 00:38:50.400
before we push them
out to you guys

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.234
and you guys
start using them.

00:38:52.234 --> 00:38:54.033
Any other questions?

00:38:54.033 --> 00:38:55.968
Yeah, green shirt I think
had his hand up first.

00:38:55.968 --> 00:38:59.000
man: So what's the policy
on displaying

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.534
in-video advertisements
embedded in--

00:39:01.534 --> 00:39:03.000
Stearns: So the question is

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.334
what's the policy on embedded--
putting in-video advertising

00:39:05.334 --> 00:39:06.667
on the players?

00:39:06.667 --> 00:39:09.367
And I believe
it's totally forbidden.

00:39:09.367 --> 00:39:10.634
man: So--

00:39:10.634 --> 00:39:12.767
Stearns: You mean our policy
or can you do it?

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.033
man: No, your policy.

00:39:14.033 --> 00:39:15.567
Stearns: Our policy.

00:39:15.567 --> 00:39:19.200
I think we may at some point.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.501
So I guess--I suppose
we reserve the right.

00:39:21.501 --> 00:39:22.667
I think it's in the terms.

00:39:22.667 --> 00:39:24.000
Nickeal could probably
answer that question

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.834
if you guys want to ask him
specific stuff.

00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:27.367
And his talk's actually next.

00:39:27.367 --> 00:39:28.968
And he'll be able to sort of
explain the terms of service

00:39:28.968 --> 00:39:31.767
and give you some better--
Maybe?

00:39:31.767 --> 00:39:33.634
No?

00:39:33.634 --> 00:39:37.234
Nickeal's not a lawyer,
but he can--

00:39:37.234 --> 00:39:39.367
But he knows it really well.

00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:42.234
So feel free to ask him,
unless there's somebody better.

00:39:42.234 --> 00:39:43.701
Is there anybody better
that's here?

00:39:43.701 --> 00:39:45.100
No.
Nikeal's your man.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.234
Nikeal's your man.
Go ask him.

00:39:49.234 --> 00:39:50.634
Next question.

00:39:50.634 --> 00:39:52.834
Uh, I don't know which one
was you first?

00:39:52.834 --> 00:39:54.234
All right, go ahead.

00:39:54.234 --> 00:39:56.167
man: Um, with a lot
of your examples

00:39:56.167 --> 00:39:57.701
you showed exactly
what I was looking for

00:39:57.701 --> 00:40:00.467
which was the time-based events.

00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:04.701
If the key frame is not there,
is it still accurate such that--

00:40:04.701 --> 00:40:06.767
I don't care
if there's a key frame or not.

00:40:06.767 --> 00:40:09.667
But I do care that if
when I'm listening to it

00:40:09.667 --> 00:40:11.067
that it tells the right time.

00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:12.534
Stearns: Uh, it does.

00:40:12.534 --> 00:40:14.601
So if you seek to 15
and it goes to 10,

00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:16.634
it'll tell you
that it's at 10.

00:40:16.634 --> 00:40:19.234
man: But if I'm listening
to see where it's at,

00:40:19.234 --> 00:40:22.934
will I be told it's at ten
because there's no key frame?

00:40:22.934 --> 00:40:25.367
Stearns: Um, you will--

00:40:25.367 --> 00:40:27.567
Well, you're basically told

00:40:27.567 --> 00:40:29.367
exactly where it's at.

00:40:29.367 --> 00:40:31.167
So, like, whatever you're
seeing on the video

00:40:31.167 --> 00:40:34.000
and whatever time that is,
that's what time the API says.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.501
So if you tell it
to go to 15,

00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:36.834
and there's
no key frame at 15,

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.334
but there is
a key frame at 12,

00:40:38.334 --> 00:40:40.000
the player goes to 12
and the API tells you

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.567
that it went to 12.

00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:43.701
man: And thus going forward
I'll know it's at 13, 14, 15?

00:40:43.701 --> 00:40:44.868
Stearns: Right, right, right.

00:40:44.868 --> 00:40:46.367
And then it goes up
from there as it goes.

00:40:46.367 --> 00:40:47.367
Uh, yeah?

00:40:47.367 --> 00:40:48.567
man: So I'm having problems

00:40:48.567 --> 00:40:51.167
resizing the YouTube player
in Flash.

00:40:51.167 --> 00:40:52.334
Stearns: Okay.

00:40:52.334 --> 00:40:54.000
man: And I'm not sure exactly

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.200
when you're supposed
to do it.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.667
[continues indistinctly]

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:00.200
Stearns: So I think there was
a bug about this

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.601
that I was tracking.

00:41:01.601 --> 00:41:03.567
Are you the one that posted that
on the forum actually?

00:41:03.567 --> 00:41:04.701
Somebody posted it.

00:41:04.701 --> 00:41:06.133
The thing is
is that if you set up--

00:41:06.133 --> 00:41:08.000
There was a bug in the player
where if you set an interval

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.067
to pull the player too often,
it was basically saying

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:12.167
it was ready before
it was actually ready.

00:41:12.167 --> 00:41:14.300
man: Your example
was every two--

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.200
Stearns: Right,
I think in Flash

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.267
my example code was using
an on enter frame event,

00:41:18.267 --> 00:41:20.701
and I think I was using, like,
31 frames per second or so.

00:41:20.701 --> 00:41:22.734
And that was okay for me,
and I never saw the bug.

00:41:22.734 --> 00:41:24.300
But I was able
to reproduce it,

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.901
and I think
I just fixed it yesterday.

00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:29.367
So you'll probably see it
in a push next week probably.

00:41:29.367 --> 00:41:30.734
So it should be fixed
next week.

00:41:30.734 --> 00:41:32.167
And then you should be able--
as soon as you call--

00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:33.834
As soon as the player's ready
you can call set size,

00:41:33.834 --> 00:41:35.567
and it'll work.

00:41:35.567 --> 00:41:37.834
Uh, another question
over here maybe?

00:41:37.834 --> 00:41:40.133
man: Question,
with the chromeless player,

00:41:40.133 --> 00:41:43.434
the whole video frame
becomes effectively a button.

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:45.601
You can click there
and it'll launch YouTube

00:41:45.601 --> 00:41:47.234
to that video's homepage.

00:41:47.234 --> 00:41:48.701
&gt;&gt; Stearns: Right.

00:41:48.701 --> 00:41:50.334
man: My question, is there a way
to disable that or change that?

00:41:50.334 --> 00:41:51.834
Stearns: No,
and I think it's part

00:41:51.834 --> 00:41:53.234
of the terms of service
is that you have to have

00:41:53.234 --> 00:41:54.467
a link back to YouTube.

00:41:54.467 --> 00:41:55.834
So I think that's why
that's there.

00:41:55.834 --> 00:41:57.200
man: All right, so I think

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.033
the following question
will probably be "no" as well.

00:41:59.033 --> 00:42:02.033
But in the sharing menus,

00:42:02.033 --> 00:42:04.033
the event code
could be link.

00:42:04.033 --> 00:42:07.467
There's no way to control
the Google to that URL is there?

00:42:07.467 --> 00:42:08.734
It's always back to YouTube.

00:42:08.734 --> 00:42:10.501
Stearns: Yeah, it always goes
back to YouTube.

00:42:10.501 --> 00:42:11.767
If you use
the chromeless player though,

00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:12.968
it doesn't even have that.

00:42:12.968 --> 00:42:14.734
So you could in theory
build your own link.

00:42:14.734 --> 00:42:16.567
Like, in fact that
Rock Your Look site,

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:18.434
they actually when you get
a link to a video,

00:42:18.434 --> 00:42:20.334
it gives you the link
to the Rock Your Look site

00:42:20.334 --> 00:42:21.901
to the specific video
you were watching,

00:42:21.901 --> 00:42:23.734
not to YouTube.

00:42:23.734 --> 00:42:25.434
Uh, another question?

00:42:25.434 --> 00:42:27.534
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:42:34.534 --> 00:42:36.901
Stearns: Yeah, okay.

00:42:36.901 --> 00:42:40.868
As long as you're, you know,
nice to us, it's cool.

00:42:40.868 --> 00:42:43.067
There was another question
back there I think, yeah?

00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:44.434
man: Yeah, are there any plans

00:42:44.434 --> 00:42:46.400
for an ActionScript 3 player--

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.534
Stearns: Um, yes, but it's
probably still some time away.

00:42:49.534 --> 00:42:53.133
man: What's that next version
of ActionScript?

00:42:53.133 --> 00:42:57.367
[continues indistinctly]

00:42:57.367 --> 00:42:59.801
Stearns: Yeah, ActionScript 3
is, like, the latest version.

00:42:59.801 --> 00:43:02.234
It's a different--
it's not compatible with AS 2,

00:43:02.234 --> 00:43:04.234
which is what our players
are written in.

00:43:04.234 --> 00:43:06.133
So you have to have
a new version.

00:43:06.133 --> 00:43:08.367
Any more questions?

00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:10.634
Do you guys wanna watch
more Billoon videos?

00:43:10.634 --> 00:43:11.834
[laughter]

00:43:11.834 --> 00:43:14.067
There's a question
in the back there.

00:43:14.067 --> 00:43:17.400
man:
Question on the frame size.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.767
When we upload a video
that is set in wide-screen,

00:43:21.767 --> 00:43:27.567
can we, in the chromeless,
show that in its true size?

00:43:27.567 --> 00:43:30.300
Stearns: Um, you can.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.701
Um.

00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:34.300
It's a recent thing
where YouTube

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.634
used to force all videos
to be 4x3.

00:43:36.634 --> 00:43:38.701
And I believe there's been
a recent change

00:43:38.701 --> 00:43:40.067
to where we don't
do that anymore,

00:43:40.067 --> 00:43:41.434
but I don't know
if it's every video

00:43:41.434 --> 00:43:43.634
or only, like,
certain popular videos.

00:43:43.634 --> 00:43:44.934
I'm not exactly sure.

00:43:44.934 --> 00:43:46.601
We are moving
in that direction though.

00:43:46.601 --> 00:43:48.200
So very soon,
if not already,

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.033
you will be able
to upload, like,

00:43:50.033 --> 00:43:52.501
a 16x9 video and it'll stay
at whatever aspect ratio

00:43:52.501 --> 00:43:54.067
you upload it at.

00:43:54.067 --> 00:43:56.100
So the players,
including the embedded player

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.167
and the chromeless player,
are set up in a way

00:43:58.167 --> 00:44:00.601
that you basically set
the viewport size,

00:44:00.601 --> 00:44:03.267
and then the video,
no matter what the aspect ratio

00:44:03.267 --> 00:44:05.133
of the video is,
it just tries to fill up

00:44:05.133 --> 00:44:07.467
as much of the space
that you give it as possible.

00:44:07.467 --> 00:44:09.234
So if, like, the video is--

00:44:09.234 --> 00:44:10.734
If you set
the chromeless player

00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:12.667
to be 16x9
and the video is 4x3,

00:44:12.667 --> 00:44:14.267
you'll just automatically
get black bars

00:44:14.267 --> 00:44:16.234
on the left and right side.

00:44:16.234 --> 00:44:17.501
Same thing if it's, like,
you know,

00:44:17.501 --> 00:44:18.901
a really tall
and skinny video.

00:44:18.901 --> 00:44:20.868
You'll get black bars
on the, you know, the side.

00:44:20.868 --> 00:44:22.868
I should say bars on the top
and bottom, I guess.

00:44:22.868 --> 00:44:24.734
Or, yeah.
You guys know what I mean.

00:44:24.734 --> 00:44:26.167
Another question.

00:44:26.167 --> 00:44:27.901
man: The videos that were
uploaded, say,

00:44:27.901 --> 00:44:32.834
six months ago have
the resolution of DVD encoding?

00:44:32.834 --> 00:44:35.400
Stearns: Um, they may be,
but I don't know.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.200
We have a lot of videos,
so it could take a while.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.534
Um, but it's something
that I would like to do.

00:44:41.534 --> 00:44:44.934
So it could take a while,
but, yes.

00:44:44.934 --> 00:44:46.868
Another one in the back?

00:44:46.868 --> 00:44:49.801
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.334
Stearns: Uh, that's a good
question, and I don't know.

00:44:58.334 --> 00:45:00.133
Um...

00:45:00.133 --> 00:45:01.801
Oh, so the question was that--

00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:05.033
Do all of the videos get encoded
at the same bit rate,

00:45:05.033 --> 00:45:07.300
or do we sort of sense
the quality of the video

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.100
and then encode it
at a lower bit rate?

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.467
Um, I think that
for the high-quality stuff

00:45:11.467 --> 00:45:13.167
we sort of check and see
if the video

00:45:13.167 --> 00:45:15.300
would actually benefit
from being high-quality.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.234
Like, if somebody uploads
a crappy source version,

00:45:17.234 --> 00:45:19.434
we might not waste time making
a high-quality version of it,

00:45:19.434 --> 00:45:21.033
'cause it wouldn't really help.

00:45:21.033 --> 00:45:23.501
But I think, like,
the standard, you know,

00:45:23.501 --> 00:45:25.868
320x240 size,
I'm not actually sure

00:45:25.868 --> 00:45:28.868
if it's a standard bit rate
for all of them.

00:45:28.868 --> 00:45:31.300
It might be a good question
to ask--

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.167
Actually, I don't know
who would know that.

00:45:33.167 --> 00:45:35.400
Probably some of the engineers.
Which one?

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.167
You think John?
Yeah, John would know.

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.467
If you see John Harding
out front,

00:45:38.467 --> 00:45:41.400
the guy that did the talk first,
he may know that.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.133
Um, any other questions?

00:45:45.133 --> 00:45:46.901
Last chance.

00:45:46.901 --> 00:45:49.767
Okay, I will be around,
in the lobby probably,

00:45:49.767 --> 00:45:51.868
for the rest of the time.

00:45:51.868 --> 00:45:54.701
I think we have a break
right now for about 15--

00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:57.100
19 minutes or something,
'cause we're stopping

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.901
a little bit early,
so feel free to wander out.

00:45:58.901 --> 00:46:00.167
Go to the bathroom.
Get a snack.

00:46:00.167 --> 00:46:01.734
Uh, thanks for coming.

00:46:01.734 --> 00:46:04.467
[applause]
