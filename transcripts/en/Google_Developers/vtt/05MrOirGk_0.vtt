KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.655 --> 00:00:04.200
We are on site in San Francisco
at the Founder World event.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.410
Joining me in studio
today is Tony Capasso,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.950
founder of Construction
Automation.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.750
Tony, how are you?

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.050
TONY CAPASSO: I'm good.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.580
How are you doing?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.500
KORY JEFFREY: Thanks
for joining me.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.840
TONY CAPASSO: Yeah.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.650
Thank you for having me.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.550
KORY JEFFREY: So tell me
about Construction Automation.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.341
TONY CAPASSO: Sure.

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:19.450
So my background is construction
and real estate development.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.070
And I've seen this common
theme of there being

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.140
a shortage of skilled workers.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.970
Obviously, as we all
know, real estate

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.140
is super expensive and
almost unaffordable.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.680
So I aim to solve
those problems, which

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.180
I think are massive global
issues with construction.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.900
And I think the
future of construction

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.280
is going to heavily
involve robotics.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.990
So I did a bunch of research
into thinking how I can totally

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.380
transform the industry
by kind of combining

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.330
3D printing, robotics into
the building industry.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.335
So there's a huge opportunity,
but that's my aim to solve.

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:55.710
KORY JEFFREY:
Sounds really cool.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.660
So is it 3D printing of
particular materials?

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.839
Or is it a different
way to 3D print?

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:01.630
TONY CAPASSO: Sure.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.099
So initially, it's going to
be a heavy focus on concrete.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.200
So it may be a little
tough to imagine.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.830
But basically, I'm
combining a concrete pump,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.490
which is the
material which would

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.240
get pushed through
to the nozzles,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.210
a robotic arm, which
has sensors on it,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.289
is very precise, and
autonomous mobile base unit.

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.080
And the three of them
combined will kind of

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.440
drive around construction
sites and extrude the concrete

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.466
and build walls with
almost no labor.

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.840
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.850
So the idea is it would set
the foundation without having

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.744
to do the forming?

00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:33.160
TONY CAPASSO: Well,
the foundation

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.640
is pretty much flat work.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.710
So that would be
poured conventionally,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.060
just using regular man hours.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.590
So this would be kind
of a hybrid version.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.270
But the vertical
walls could actually

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.530
be printed with no labor at all.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.700
So it would be a
hybrid of a masonry

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.200
wall and a concrete wall, but
there's no form work required.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.410
So that's where the labor
saving comes into play.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.460
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.850
So how far along are you guys?

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.340
TONY CAPASSO: I've built
some little prototypes, kind

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.560
of desktop versions of it, with
a Mecanum kind of vectoring

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.890
robot and an arm on top of it.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.350
And have done little samples to
kind of do a proof of concept.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.039
And now I'm raising a
funding round, basically,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.775
to do everything at full scale.

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:13.150
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.770
So prior to this,
you were actually

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.760
in the project management
of construction.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.009
Talk to me a little bit
about the transition from one

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.050
to tech entrepreneurship.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.160
TONY CAPASSO: Sure.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.890
So again, my family
immigrated from Italy.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.190
And they were all
amazing contractors.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.160
My father started his
own business here.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.781
And we're one of the largest
subcontractors in Connecticut

00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.280
right now.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.730
We do a lot of work
for Yale University

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.500
and a lot of public schools.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.220
So my background
isn't technology.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.700
It's actually an end user,
and seeing the problems

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.540
with construction, which
is, I think, great for me,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.310
because I have an
expertise in a domain.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.180
And I'll really be able to get
that product market fit instead

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.219
of building something that
let's say a user wouldn't want.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.010
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.210
Makes a lot of sense.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.200
Not a technology in search
of a solution, right?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.770
That's cool.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.519
And so you've had some
highlights as well.

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.020
I believe you won a TV show.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.820
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.861
TONY CAPASSO: Yeah, sure.

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:09.990
So when I started
with this idea,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.050
I got introduced to Tim
Draper, who is a venture

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.030
capitalist, Draper Associates.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.580
And he also started a school
called Draper University.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.680
And it takes early
stage startups

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.180
and kind of coaches them through
the entrepreneurship process.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.590
At the same time,
it was a TV show.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.790
It was called "Startup U."

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.150
And it was on ABC Family.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.090
And I got cast for the show.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.050
So after the 10 episodes,
we pitch our businesses.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.610
So it's kind of like a
hybrid of "The Real World"

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.196
mixed with "Shark Tank."

00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:42.180
And it was a really
cool experience.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.910
So at the end of it,
we pitch to a room

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.770
full of venture capitalists.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.395
And they all vote on
the idea that they

00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:48.160
think is the most
forward thinking,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.750
and I guess the right team.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.180
And I ended up winning some
funding for my company.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.670
KORY JEFFREY: That's awesome.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.650
Congratulations.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.270
So you just came
off the main stage,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.120
talking to thousands of people
here, all interested in tech

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.954
entrepreneurship in some way.

00:04:01.954 --> 00:04:02.870
What was your message?

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.390
What were you talking about?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.890
TONY CAPASSO: I
think my message was

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.840
to make startups great again.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.050
So I actually had
some hats made up

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.940
that say, "Make
Startups Great Again,"

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.780
And it was kind of a
play with Donald Trump,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.700
"Make America Great Again."

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.490
But I think that's
the important thing.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.930
You see a lot of startups
that just do one thing that's

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.830
a little bit better.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.800
And they're not reaching
far enough out there

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.950
and really pushing the envelope.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.096
So I think what I'm working
on was pretty flattering.

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:35.470
Tim said to me that it might
have been one of the largest

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.050
markets he's ever invested in.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.150
And if I am able
to succeed, this

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.770
is just such a
massive disruption

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.490
to literally the world's
oldest industry, right?

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.422
So I think, shoot
for the stars, right?

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:50.130
KORY JEFFREY: Real
disruption rather than

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.040
incremental difference.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.956
TONY CAPASSO: Exactly.

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:52.780
KORY JEFFREY: Cool.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.210
So you know, you're going to see
a lot of different technologies

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.710
here.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.769
Obviously, there's thousands of
people here, a lot of demoing.

00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:00.310
Is there anything
besides 3D printing

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.140
that really gets you excited
in the technology space today?

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.610
TONY CAPASSO: I think virtual
reality is pretty interesting.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.090
I think it has some
really cool applications.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.110
I've used it a couple times.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.830
You put it on and you really
almost forget where you are

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.960
or what you're doing.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.580
And I also see that as
being integrated well

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.170
with the construction industry.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.010
So being able to walk
into a building that's

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.380
half of the way done and be able
to see the finishes on the wall

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.810
or something like
that really helps you.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.690
It's going to streamline
the whole process.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.210
KORY JEFFREY: Do you have a
favorite Google technology?

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.100
TONY CAPASSO: Gmail.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.835
KORY JEFFREY: Gmail?

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:37.960
TONY CAPASSO: Gmail
is my favorite by far.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.155
KORY JEFFREY: You
use it all the time?

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:39.770
TONY CAPASSO: Yeah.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.550
KORY JEFFREY: Me too, actually.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.630
TONY CAPASSO: That's by far.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.340
KORY JEFFREY: That's good.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.960
That's awesome.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.630
Well, thank you very
much for joining me.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.960
TONY CAPASSO: Yeah, thank you.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.120
KORY JEFFREY: And thank
you guys for joining me

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.280
on site at Founder World.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.480
My name is Kory.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.230
