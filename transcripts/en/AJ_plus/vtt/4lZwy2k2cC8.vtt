00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Abolishing ICE might be one of the most progressive – and attention-grabbing – talking points that's made it

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.120
onto the platforms of several midterm election candidates in 2018.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.500
We should protect families that need our help, and that is not what ICE is doing today.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.720
And that’s why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:27.260
We need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.700
with something that reflects our morality.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.860
And we can replace it with a humane agency that is directed toward safe passage.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.860
But is it a realistic demand? Can ICE be abolished? And what does “abolishing” ICE even mean?

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.540
Do we really want to live in a country where there's this massive force, this mass police force,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.580
that surveils us every single day and whose job is solely to hunt immigrants and expel them from this country?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.800
Hey guys, I’m Sana, and this Sunday we’re talking about why there’s a call to abolish a government agency –

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.460
and what that means for the future of people in this country, documented and undocumented.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.260
In the spring of 2018, news spread about children being separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.300
as a part of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy for non-authorized crossing.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.500
"The United States cannot have an open border to every illegal alien family and minor on the face of the earth."

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.740
And it was ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, that came under particular scrutiny.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.500
ICE detention facilities have been detaining children who were separated from their families by Customs and Border Patrol under Trump administration orders.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.160
With horrifying stories of family separation becoming widespread, the call to “abolish ICE” likewise became widespread.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.740
Now, it might feel like the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has been around for a long time,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.320
but the truth is, you’re probably older than the agency itself.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.580
After the September 11th attacks and the declaration of a global “War on Terror,” the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.080
George W. Bush administration went into full reorganization of governmental agencies and practices.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.500
The priority became so-called “counter-terrorism.”

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.320
A major part of that reorganization – and a major part of the history of ICE – was the introduction of the Department of Homeland Security.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.900
The DHS was tasked with doing whatever it needed to do to keep the country safe –

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.740
and part of keeping the United States safe was securing its borders.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.160
Prior to 2003, immigration in the United States was handled by the Immigration and Naturalization Service

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.380
agency, or INS, which was first under the Department of Labor and then the Department of Justice.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.580
But it was absorbed into the DHS, and doing so made immigration a matter of national security, to counter terrorism.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.660
And once it was absorbed by DHS, the INS was split into three agencies.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.220
One was Customs and Border Protection, another was Citizenship and Immigration Services,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.660
and finally Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aka ICE.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.100
It’s worth noting that the reason why immigration was made such a big part of the Department of Homeland

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.640
Security is because the administration relied on immigration laws to respond immediately

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.240
to the 9/11 attacks – which were carried out by visitors on short-term visas.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.380
Greisa Martinez, deputy executive director of United We Dream, adds a bit more

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.360
about the roots of the agencies that were created after the attacks.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.100
They were created out of fear, irrational fear. It was based on Islamophobia and xenophobia,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.940
which really means people didn't like Muslims at that time, and they thought that this was something that they needed to protect themselves.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.860
And while ICE has a few different functions, its most controversial function has been the arresting, detaining and deporting of undocumented immigrants.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.420
I also want to point out that ICE wasn’t just big under the Bush administration – it expanded a lot under the Barack Obama administration.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.340
Over the course of 13 years its budget increased from $3.3 billion to $6.1 billion,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.000
and the number of agents it employed tripled.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.520
Today, ICE’s primary duties – arresting, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants –

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.520
have caught the attention of a lot of Americans, and that’s the springboard for calls to abolish ICE.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.360
But it’s worth noting that ICE didn’t start detaining families or kids or parents in the spring of 2018.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.260
The agency has been conducting raids, arrests and detentions since it was first established.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.640
And for most of its existence, it’s been accused of inhumane, unjust and unethical treatment of people.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.700
According to the ACLU, ICE tactics “take away even the right to a fair hearing in court”

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and “implicate the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.280
the constitutional guarantee of due process and the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and freedom

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.740
from discrimination based on race, ethnicity and national origin.”

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.000
A 2018 report put together by several human-rights groups found that more than half of ICE

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.760
custody deaths in recent years could have been prevented with adequate medical care and attention.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.020
And the tactics that ICE is renowned for include arresting undocumented parents after they’ve dropped

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.460
their kids off at school, mass raids, picking up anyone, anywhere – including in sanctuaries like churches –

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.240
as well as separating families and keeping people, including kids, in cages.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.260
Martinez, herself, remembers what it was like growing up with the looming fear of ICE that permeated through her neighborhood.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:15.180
I grew up in an undocumented home. I was one of four daughters, with two undocumented parents,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.680
and I've grown up with ICE in my life. It's kind of like the boogeyman of the immigrant community.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.460
When people talk about ICE and these agents, you imagine, like, men in like these green-and-blue uniforms

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.060
coming to your home in the middle of the day that will separate you from your family.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.380
This is something that is embedded in the culture of immigrants in this country.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.880
Dennis Rivera is a 19-year-old undocumented Houston resident originally from Honduras, and was detained by ICE for two months.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.120
Dennis had gotten into an incident with another student at school, and when he went to go report it, the school

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.180
officer ended up sending him to a local jail, where he was put in immigration custody.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.720
So what does it mean to abolish ICE? According to Martinez, it means first and foremost defunding ICE.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.700
"What we're actually asking for right now and what we need is for these agencies that get billions of dollars

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.020
of our tax money to be defunded, for us to take the money away. The money that allows them to

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.580
have these cages, the money that allows them to have these detention camps,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.700
and the money that allows them to deport people.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.500
It’s critical to point out that because the call to abolish ICE has been adopted by so many

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.560
different people and interest groups, specifically on the wide-ranging left,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.900
there’s not really agreement on what “abolishing ICE” really means.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.280
For some, it’s about restructuring the three immigration agencies under DHS.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.040
For others, it’s stopping deportations, closing detention centers, defunding ICE and Border Patrol,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.880
and giving asylum to the undocumented. And for others, it’s going back to the way things were before 2001.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.640
But in an interview with AJ+, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told us that the problem isn’t just with the agencies,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.300
but also with the underlying ideology that criminalizes immigrants and immigration from the get-go.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.700
When we talk about replacing it with a system, we need to talk about really having a system that is safe,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:52.660
that documents people effectively, that is also not rooted in the discrimination system that our

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.100
immigration system was initially built on. The first immigration law in the United States was the Chinese Exclusion Act.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.980
The first law about immigration in the United States was, “How do we exclude a specific type of people?”

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:09.320
And putting immigration under a department dedicated to countering terrorism doesn't match up to, well, the facts.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.020
A 2015 study found that immigrants were way less likely to commit crimes than those born here.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.680
The study emphasized that this also held true for young, undocumented Salvadoran, Mexican and Guatemalan men.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.880
Another study, a 2017 one by the Cato Institute, found that undocumented immigrants were 44%

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.220
less likely to be incarcerated than those born here, and legal immigrants were 69% less likely.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.620
So there are two parts to abolishing ICE: There’s the policy part, which may involve getting rid of

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.960
the agency or reforming it, and that’ll be tough to implement without congressional support.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.000
Then there’s the part to abolishing ICE that’s undoing over a century of institutionalized

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.040
criminalization of immigrants, especially those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.200
And for Dennis, who just enrolled for classes at University of Houston

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.380
while his immigration case is ongoing, there’s no question about ICE’s future.
