00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.520
Hello I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
Today I Found Out YouTube channel.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.580
In the video today, we're looking at where
the at symbol came from and how it was decided

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.640
to use it in email.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.910
Ubiquitous today, until its use in email addresses,
the @ symbol was never really all that popular,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.030
with this very fact being one of the reasons
it was chosen to be used in electronic message

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.950
addresses in the first place.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.949
So where did the @ symbol come from?

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.490
The earliest known example of @ is found in
the 1345 Bulgarian translation of the 12th

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.859
century Manasses Chronicle, which gives a
brief synopsis of the history of the world

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.050
up to the end of the 11th century.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.889
In it, @ was used as the symbol for “amin”
(amen).

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:46.569
No (presently) known surviving instance of
@ occurred again for a little over two centuries.

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:50.870
Seemingly independently “invented,” yet
another early example, this time of a proto-@

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.019
(with just the outside swoosh, but lacking
a defined center a), was used on a 1448 Spanish

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.579
registry, Taula de Ariza, referencing a shipment
of wheat from Castile to Aragon.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.761
The earliest example of a full @ used in such
a commercial setting was discovered in 2000

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:11.660
in a letter written by a Florentine merchant,
Francesco Lapi, on May 4, 1536.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.970
In this letter, Lapi used @ to denote a unit
of measure – an amphora (clay jar) of wine,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.830
which is equivalent to about 1/13th of a barrel.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.930
According to professor Giorgio Stabile of
Sapienza University of Rome, the discoverer

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.410
of the letter in question, the flourish around
the a for amphora was just one of many examples

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.670
of such embellishment of script found in Florence
at the time.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.030
From here, Dr. Stabile theorized it was Italian
merchants who popularized the symbol, with

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.940
it traveling along with traded goods invoices
and receipts throughout Europe.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.270
However, whether it really was the Italians
who popularized the symbol isn’t clear.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.580
For instance, also during the 16th century
the @ symbol in Spain had progressed beyond

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.060
the aforementioned 1448 proto-@ into the fully
developed one, being used as the shorthand

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.350
symbol for the unit of measure called an arroba,
then equivalent to about 25 pounds or 11.3

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.350
kg.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.920
(The arroba is generally thought to have derived
from the Arabic ????? pronounced ar-rub, which

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
meant “a quarter.”)

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.280
Whatever the case, from here @ evolved to
mean in a commercial setting “at the price

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.110
of”- i.e. 26 bags of flour @ $1 (so a total
of $26 for the purchase).

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.599
The symbol was also occasionally used in other
contexts, such as used to signify the French

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.540
à at least as early as the 17th century.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.499
It should be noted here that before the discovery
of the 1345 and 1536 instances, it was generally

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:34.299
thought (and many still posit, including the
Oxford English Dictionary) that medieval monks

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.409
were the ones that invented the symbol to
use in place of the Latin ad, which meant

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.870
at, toward, by and about.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.670
Lacking in any hard documented evidence pre-dating
the preceding instances, the idea behind this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.620
theory is that the simple expedient of combining
the two letters (essentially an a with the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.060
older ? form of the letter d) into a single,
smaller mark would have saved time and materials

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.120
during a period in history where every copy
of every book had to be written out by hand.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.620
Many other such shorthand symbols were created
for just this reason.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.989
For instance, the ampersand (&amp;) is shorthand
for the Latin “et,” meaning “and.”

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.690
Another such classic shorthand was using “X”
for “Christ.”

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.799
The “X” in this case is actually the Greek
letter “Chi,” which is short for the Greek,

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:17.799
meaning “Christ”.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.069
Scholars began using this particular shorthand
about a millennium ago.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.980
In any event, the @ symbol labored in relative
obscurity for several hundred years until

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.760
one fateful day in 1971.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.939
In that year, engineer Ray Tomlinson was implementing
his own version of a little program called

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:34.939
SNDMSG.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.559
SNDMSG ran on the TENEX operating system and
was, essentially, just one of many flavors

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:44.500
of single-computer email- in other words,
an electronic mail system only capable of

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.180
sending messages from one user to another
on the same computer.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.849
While this might seem absurdly useless given
the way people often use computers today,

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.599
back then programs like this were incredibly
handy.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.419
For instance, the AUTODIN system created in
the early 1960s had a facility for sending

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.409
messages between users and, at its peak, handled
nearly 30 million electronic messages per

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.409
month.

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:13.469
MIT’s Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS),
also created in the 1960s, had a similar system

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.830
that allowed its numerous users to login from
some terminal and, among other things, exchange

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.320
messages stored on this single machine.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.670
Tomlinson thought it would be interesting
to improve SNDMSG such that it could not only

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.530
be used for sending messages to other users
who could login to the same machine, but also

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.100
be used to send messages from one computer
to another via the budding ARPANET.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.630
Tomlinson stated he just thought this tweak
to SNDMSG “seemed like a neat idea.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.600
There was no directive to ‘go forth and
invent email’.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.240
The ARPANET was a solution looking for a problem.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.330
A colleague (Jerry Burchfiel) suggested that
I not tell my boss what I had done because

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.610
email wasn’t in our statement of work.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.660
That was really said in jest because we were,
after all, investigating ways in which to

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.820
use the ARPANET.”

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.590
While writing the code for this, Tomlinson
had to decide how to designate that a message

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.640
should be sent to another computer on the
network, rather than a local account.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.590
He fatefully settled on @, a symbol that only
made it on the standard keyboard in the first

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.070
place because of its usage in commerce.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.380
Why did he choose @ over some other symbol?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.760
For starters Tomlinson stated, “I looked
at the keyboard, and I thought: ‘What can

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.450
I choose here that won’t be confused with
a username?’

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.020
If every person had an ‘@’ sign in their
name, it wouldn’t work too well.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.210
But they didn’t.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.800
They did use commas and slashes and brackets.”

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.610
That left just a few symbols to choose from
that weren’t being commonly used.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.720
He noted that, at the time, “The purpose
of the at sign (in English) was to indicate

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.390
a unit price (for example, 10 items @ $1.95).”

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.390
So,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.430
"it made sense.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.500
[@] didn’t appear in names so there would
be no ambiguity about where the separation

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.330
between login name and host name occurred…
[@] also had no significance in any editors

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.670
that ran on TENEX.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.220
I was later reminded that the Multics time-sharing
system used [@] as its line-erase character.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.200
This caused a fair amount of grief in that
community of users…"

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.280
The resulting format was loginname@host (and
later loginname@host.domain once the DNS system

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.280
was developed).

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.500
And so it was that what is generally credited
as being the first true network email, at

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.030
least as we think of it, was sent in late
1971 by Tomlinson.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.760
Of this momentous occasion, Tomlinson said,
“The first message was sent between two

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.210
[DEC-10] machines that were literally side
by side.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.481
The only physical connection they had (aside
from the floor they sat on) was through the

00:06:27.481 --> 00:06:28.481
ARPANET.

00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:31.900
I sent a number of test messages to myself
from one machine to the other.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.100
The test messages were entirely forgettable
and I have, therefore, forgotten them.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.710
Most likely the first message was QWERTYUIOP
or something similar.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.860
(Essentially quickly randomly typing gibberish
on the keyboard.)

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.670
When I was satisfied that the program seemed
to work, I sent a message to the rest of my

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.740
group explaining how to send messages over
the network.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.060
The first use of network email announced its
own existence.”

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:06.930
And the rest, as they say, is history.
