music welcome to the world

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769

liked it but why is that what is it

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900
liked it but why is that what is it
 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.290
liked it but why is that what is it
about music that we enjoy and what

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300
about music that we enjoy and what
 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.750
about music that we enjoy and what
effects does music have on our brain

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760
 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.790

about the science of music let's explore

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030
about the science of music let's explore
 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.920
about the science of music let's explore
the mathematics behind the musical scale

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930
 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.650
where did that come from well it turns

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660
where did that come from well it turns
 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.210
where did that come from well it turns
out that its origins lying all the way

back in ancient Greece

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780
back in ancient Greece

if you stretch out a piece of string

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760
if you stretch out a piece of string
 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.830
if you stretch out a piece of string
attach it at two points and pluck it you

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840
attach it at two points and pluck it you
 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.170

hear a note but what happens if we take

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180
hear a note but what happens if we take
 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.450
hear a note but what happens if we take
another string exactly half the length

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460
another string exactly half the length
 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.410
another string exactly half the length
and played that one instead it's the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420
and played that one instead it's the
 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.600
and played that one instead it's the
same notes but just one octave higher

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610
same notes but just one octave higher
 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.910
same notes but just one octave higher
this was the simple idea that Pythagoras

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
this was the simple idea that Pythagoras
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.219
this was the simple idea that Pythagoras
discovered back in ancient Greece to

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229
discovered back in ancient Greece to
 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.630
discovered back in ancient Greece to
find more notes between these two

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640
find more notes between these two
 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.609
find more notes between these two
Pythagoras divided up the string using

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619
Pythagoras divided up the string using
 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.800
Pythagoras divided up the string using
different fractions and it's this idea

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810
different fractions and it's this idea
 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.960
different fractions and it's this idea
that the musical scale of today is based

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970
that the musical scale of today is based
 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:31.740
that the musical scale of today is based
on so Pythagoras use mathematics to find

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750
on so Pythagoras use mathematics to find
 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.570
on so Pythagoras use mathematics to find
intervals between notes that sounded

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580
intervals between notes that sounded
 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.639
intervals between notes that sounded
good but why do some notes sound nice

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649
good but why do some notes sound nice
 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.830
good but why do some notes sound nice
together while others don't for example

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840
together while others don't for example
 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.600
together while others don't for example
play AC major chord

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270
and it sounds quite nice in music this

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
and it sounds quite nice in music this
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.890
and it sounds quite nice in music this
is called a consonant sound

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900
is called a consonant sound
 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.990
is called a consonant sound
however pick a bunch of random notes and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
however pick a bunch of random notes and
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.490
however pick a bunch of random notes and
try and play those together as a chord

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
try and play those together as a chord
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.539
try and play those together as a chord
and

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549
 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.340
and you get what's known as a dissonant

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
and you get what's known as a dissonant
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590
and you get what's known as a dissonant
sound and amazingly it does seem as

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600
sound and amazingly it does seem as
 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.120
sound and amazingly it does seem as
though we naturally have a preference

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
though we naturally have a preference
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.580
though we naturally have a preference
for one sound over the other even for

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
for one sound over the other even for
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.440
for one sound over the other even for
month old babies were found to prefer

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
month old babies were found to prefer
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.899
month old babies were found to prefer
consonant sounds to dissonant ones and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
consonant sounds to dissonant ones and
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.609
consonant sounds to dissonant ones and
the reason for this well it might

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
the reason for this well it might
 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.990
the reason for this well it might
actually be because of the babies

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
actually be because of the babies

dissonant sounds so from a survival
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.320
dissonant sounds so from a survival
standpoint it makes sense that we find

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
standpoint it makes sense that we find
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.120

these sounds to be distressing as it

that we don't like these types of sounds

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
that we don't like these types of sounds
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.320
that we don't like these types of sounds
simply because notes that are close
