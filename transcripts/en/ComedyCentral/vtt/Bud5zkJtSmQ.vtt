00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.534
- Good job.

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:02.769
Let's go ahead and keep moving.

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:03.737 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're gonna lunge
to the side for one.

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.406
(laughs loudly)

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.042
One, squeeze your abs.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.478
(laughs loudly)

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.047 align:start size:84% position:16%
- A cackle a day keeps
the cankles away.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.949
(audience laughs)

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:16.783
- Sup Paul?

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.019
- Nothing much, Daniel.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.189
- I do 30 of these a day,
it's great for the abs.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.627
- Yeah, I don't believe in
doing abdominal exercises.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:32.732
(bones crunch)

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.067
(audience gasps)

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.169 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I don't know
weightlifting, is that bad?

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.437
(audience laughs)

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.872 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Now, can somebody
tell me why women have

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.241 align:start size:81% position:19%
to make everything
so much harder?

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.610 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just another CrossFit
girl spending

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.945
Valentine's Day
with her barbell.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.548
(audience laughs)

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.582
(bone cracks)

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:50.850
(audience gasps)

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.786
Now do chin-ups in
your oven mitts.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.087 line:0%
- Hi, my name is Vicky.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:56.289 line:0%
(laughter)

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.560 line:0%
And I have breast cancer.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.430 line:0%
(laughter)

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.599
- Breast cancer is never funny.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.736
- Yay, anybody else wanna share?

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.937
Yes?

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:12.172
- My name is Daniel.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.841
(laughs loudly)

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.145
And my hair is thinning.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.149
(laughs uncomfortably)

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.286
And I'm really allergic to cats.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.854
(audience laughs)

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.289
And I'm dead inside.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.356
(audience laughs)

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.458
Very good, very good.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.392
(audience laughs)

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.260
Bunch of disease-riddled snobs.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.497 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm more of a laughter
Pilates guy anyway.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.500
(rock guitar chord)

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.673 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well howdy,
Prancercising princess.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.142
- Howdy Daniel,
nice to meet you.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.110
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.377
I appreciate you coming.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.313
My season starts in
three days and I need

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.781
to get in tip-top shape.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.250 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, Prancercise
is the answer.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.318
I'm telling you, Daniel,

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.652
there's nothing like it.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:00.920
- I only have three days,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.223
so I think I'm gonna
need larger weights.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.925
Is Prancercising based
on your love for horses?

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.460
- What's not the love?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
Strength, endurance,
and vegetarians.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.431
(audience laughter)

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.699 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What's the best music
to Prancercise to?

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.701
- I love Motown.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.503
Do the Prancercise walk first,

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.037
from side to side.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.005
Let's go.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.740
(upbeat music playing)

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.774
- I'm ready to pick up the pace.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:22.709
- Alright.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.077
The next mode is the trot.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.311
(audience laughs)

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Don't sneak up on
someone Prancercising.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.617 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The trot is
similar to the walk.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.821
- Guys, we want you
to be Prancercising.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.757 align:start position:0%
Guys, if you don't Prancercise,
you're prancer-fired.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:40.693
(audience laughs)

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.262
(upbeat music continues)

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:45.098
(audience laughs)

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.240
- Thank you.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.543 align:start size:88% position:13%
My body feels incredible
Prancercise lady.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.478
- Remember, Daniel,

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.480
keep on prancin'!

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.149
(audience laughs)

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.317
Keep prancin'!

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.953
Keep on prancin'!

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.154
Keep on prancin'!
