INTERVIEWER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.500
We have a very special
guest with us today.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.750
He is a graduate
of Harvard College

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.760
and Stanford Graduate
School of Business.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.940
He has also founded
Housatonic Partners,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.860
which is a private equity firm
with offices in Boston and San

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.130
Francisco.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.480
Interestingly, he
has written one

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.410
of those rare and
special books, which

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.060
has won claim from none other
than Warren Buffett and Charlie

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.180
Munger.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.450
The book is called
"The Outsiders."

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.040
And we are thrilled that the
author, Mr. William Thorndike,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.970
is here with us,
in person, today

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.670
to talk about "The Outsiders."

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.230
Welcome.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.980
WILLIAM THORNDIKE:
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.130
INTERVIEWER: So I
guess to kick it off,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.560
why don't you give
the audience here

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.480
and the thousands on YouTube
an elevator pitch of the book

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.481
and what it's all about.

00:00:58.481 --> 00:00:59.396
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: OK.

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:00.310
Great.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.655
So I think the best analogy for
the book is duplicate bridge.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:08.000
So how many of you play bridge?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.461
That's a rather low penetration.

00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:15.580
That would be zero.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.080
So duplicate bridge is an
advanced form a bridge in which

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.740
a group of teams of
two show up in a room,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.100
they're divided into tables
of four, each of which

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.620
is then dealt the
exact same cards

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.230
in the exact same sequence,
minimizing the role of luck.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.220
Then at the end of the evening,
the team with the most points

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.970
wins.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.740
So I would contend, over
long periods of time,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.330
within an industry,
it's duplicate bridge.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.010
So if one company materially
outperforms the peer group,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.450
that's worthy of study.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.550
So the eight companies and CEOs
profiled in the book, they each

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.500
fit that pattern.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.660
They had to meet two tests.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.010
The first was an absolute test.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.140
They had to have better
performance relative to the S&amp;P

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.400
than Jack Welch had
during his tenure at GE.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.410
And then the second test
was a relative test.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.830
They had to materially
outperformed the peer group.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.480
And so if you look across
that group of eight, seven men

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.740
and one woman, by
definition, they

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.770
had to do things
differently than the peers.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.640
But it turned out that the
specific actions that they

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.140
took, the things that they
did, were remarkably similar

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.610
across the eight.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.160
So they competed in a wide
variety of industries,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.120
ranging from manufacturing, to
defense, to consumer products,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.270
to financial services, and
across very different market

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.450
cycles, but the specific
actions they took

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.100
were remarkably
similar to each other.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.620
And the primary area of
overlap was in the area

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.599
of capital allocation.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.640
And so I think the easiest
framework for thinking

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.562
about capital allocation is
that to be a successful CEO,

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:54.020
over long periods
of time, you need

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.530
to do two things well--
you need to optimize

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.540
the profits of the
business you're running

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.300
and you then need to invest
or allocate those profits.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.140
And again, I think
the framework for that

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.640
is there only three ways that
business can raise capital

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.020
to invest.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.670
It can cap it's internal
cash flow, it can raise debt,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.629
or it can issue equity.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.086
And then there are
only five things

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:18.590
you can do with that capital.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.590
So you can invest in
your existing operations,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.451
you can buy other companies,
you can pay down debt,

00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:26.826
you could pay a
dividend, and you

00:03:26.826 --> 00:03:28.034
could repurchase your shares.

00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:29.190
That's it.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.780
So over long periods
of time, the decisions

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.620
CEOs make across
those alternatives

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.670
have an enormous impact
on per share values.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.520
So if you took two companies
with identical operating

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.450
results, same level of
revenue and the same level

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.900
of profitability, and two
different approaches to capital

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.310
allocation, over
long periods of time,

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.540
they drive two very
different per share outcomes

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.400
for their share holders.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.310
Second piece is that if you
looked at this group of eight,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.580
they fit an interesting
sort of personal profile.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.160
So all eight were
first time CEOs.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.360
So very surprising finding.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.420
Over half were under 40
when they got the job,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.915
only two had MBAs, four
had engineering degrees.

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:16.040
And as a group, if you were
reaching for adjectives

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.290
to sort of try to
describe them, you

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.940
would not use the traditional,
CEO adjectives of charismatic,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.140
strategic, and visionary.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.450
Instead, you'd use
other adjectives

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.650
like pragmatic, flexible,
opportunistic, dispassionate,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.660
rational, analytical.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.682
Words like that.

00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:41.390
So they fit a slightly
different profile.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.490
So I'll stop there,
but that's a bit

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.005
of an overview of some of
the themes in the book.

00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:48.630
INTERVIEWER: William,
picking up on how

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.030
you describe their personality.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.040
You're saying you
would not associate it

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.190
with charisma and so on.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.720
You also mentioned,
early on, Jack Welch,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.320
who's arguably one of the most
celebrated CEOs in business

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.520
history.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.860
But I remember reading in
your book, and correct me,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.450
if I'm mistaken, you say
that Jack Welch does not even

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.390
belong to the same zip code
as Henry Singleton, who

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.170
is one of the CEOs
profiled in your book.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.000
Can you say more about that?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.271
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: I mean,
Jack Welch was a great CEO.

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:22.770
Period.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.840
And it's the reason that
he was the benchmark used

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.820
as one of the two
tests for selecting

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.390
the eight for the book.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.870
But if you look at his-- so
his returns are extraordinary.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.740
He ran GE for 20
years and he averaged

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.910
about a 20% compound
annual return

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.600
across that period of time,
which is extraordinary.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.280
However, his tenure coincided
with a record bull market run

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.550
and a broader stock markets.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.966
So I think really
the way to frame

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:56.870
that is, how did he perform
relative to the broader market?

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.700
And he meaningfully
outperformed the market.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.790
3.3 times the S&amp;P over
the time he was there.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.250
But if you look at that metric,
relative performance compared

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.570
to the S&amp;P across
a CEOs tenure, I

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.680
think these eight materially
outperformed Welch.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.930
And Singleton is
an interesting case

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.930
because he's got such an
interesting background.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.263
We could spend more time on him.

00:06:22.263 --> 00:06:25.020
But he, by that same
metric, outperformed the S&amp;P

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.180
by 12-fold over a much
longer, nearly 30 year tenure

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.500
at a company called Teledyne.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.580
INTERVIEWER: I want to maybe
pause on Singleton for a second

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.960
before we move on because
you said that he was not just

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.230
a pioneer in stock buybacks,
he was much more than that

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.300
because he sort of
built a framework

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.550
in thinking about them.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.750
And later on, in
your book, you also

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.020
mention the straw buyback
approach versus sucking hose

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.050
buyback approach.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.819
Can you share more
on that with us?

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.110
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: So I'll
give you a little background

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.060
on Singleton first.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.385
INTERVIEWER: Yes.

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:06.885
Sure.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.429
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: So Singleton
is a very interesting case

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:12.970
and I think it would resonate
particularly with this audience

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.210
because he had advanced
math background.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.730
So he was an undergraduate,
earned his Masters and PH.D.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.010
in electrical
engineering from MIT.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.620
While at MIT for his
PH.D. dissertation,

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.390
he programmed the
first computer at MIT.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.720
So when he was 23
years old, he won

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.750
an award called The
Putnam Medal, which

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.580
is awarded to the top
mathematician in the country.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.220
So he's very capable, competent,
mathematician, engineer.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.388
He designed an inertial
guidance system

00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:50.512
that is still in use in
commercial and military air

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.011
crafts.

00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:55.460
So he had this extraordinary
career before he became a CEO.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.880
And during the 60s, and
70s, and end of the 80s,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.974
he ran a conglomerate
called Teledyne.

00:08:01.974 --> 00:08:03.640
And what's interesting
about Singleton--

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.598
and he had extraordinary
returns in doing that,

00:08:05.598 --> 00:08:07.720
but what's interesting
is the range he

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.890
showed as a capital allocator.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.990
So for the first 10
years, he ran Teledyne.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.820
Conglomerates were sort
of the social media

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.200
companies of their day.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.450
They traded extremely high P/Es.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.900
And so Singleton used
the inexpensive currency

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.870
of his high PE stock
to buy 130 companies.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.710
So he was an active
issuer of shares.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.919
At the very end of
the decade, 1969,

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.610
a couple of the
larger conglomerates

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.679
missed earnings dramatically and
the entire sector got pounded.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.380
So PE multiples came
down across the group

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.030
and Singleton never
bought another company.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.790
He fired his business
development team,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.373
the group that was going out and
finding acquisitions for him.

00:08:50.373 --> 00:08:53.820
Instead, he'd focused on
optimizing his existing

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.270
businesses and then he
began a pioneering program

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.570
of repurchasing his shares.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.620
And over the next
dozen years, he

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.610
repurchased 90% of his
shares outstanding.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.610
So he showed this
amazing to sort

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.590
of pivot it as the opportunities
presented themselves

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.600
and the result was this
extraordinary return over a 28

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.860
year period at the helm.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.220
So that didn't answer.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:19.720
So buyback.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.780
So in that second
period, the last dozen

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.260
years when he bought
in 90% of his shares,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.109
he had an approach to
that that is wildly

00:09:27.109 --> 00:09:29.400
different than the way most
public companies repurchase

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:29.990
shares today.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.390
Corporate America, as a group,
is a completely ineffective

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.670
repurchaser of its shares.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:45.430
So last year, 2014,
corporate America

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.930
set the record for most capital
allocated to share buybacks

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.170
and they exceeded the
record that was set before,

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.300
in October of 2007.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.350
So the absolute trough
for buyback volume

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.380
by corporate America was in
the first quarter of 2009.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.910
So corporate
America, as a group,

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.430
has a perfect record of
buying high and effectively

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.460
selling low.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.480
And not surprisingly,
the returns aren't great.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.140
And if you look at the
way buybacks are typically

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.410
implemented in public companies
in the US, it's not surprising.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.010
So the typical way
that works is the board

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.910
will authorize an
amount of capital

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.535
that can be deployed
for repurchasing shares.

00:10:25.535 --> 00:10:26.910
And that will then
be implemented

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.580
in even, quarterly
increments, usually designed

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.980
to offset option grants.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.180
So there's very little net
shrink of the share base.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.180
And not surprisingly,
that approach rarely

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.450
produces interesting returns.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.825
If you look at
what Singleton did

00:10:39.825 --> 00:10:41.366
and what the other
CEOs in the book

00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:42.740
did when they
repurchased shares,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.580
it was a very, very
different approach.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.970
They went long periods of
time without doing anything

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.340
and then they would repurchase
large chunks of stock

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.680
when they felt it
was inexpensive.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.550
Singleton did that
through tender offers,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.464
which is unusual, but
that was his method.

00:10:59.464 --> 00:11:01.880
Most of the others in the book
used open market purchases,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.170
but, in any case, a
very different approach.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.070
INTERVIEWER: Similarly, everyone
looks at Berkshire Hathaway

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.640
over the years.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.380
A lot of acquisitions
have happened

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.540
when the price to book
ratio was two or above.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.200
And the few buybacks
that have happened,

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.500
have happened at
lower valuations.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.770
So the question is,
these outsider CEOs,

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.970
they're all sort of following
the similar framework of doing

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.260
buybacks or issuing
stock managers,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.700
increasing the intrinsic
value for their shareholders.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.960
But it doesn't sound like a very
difficult thing to understand,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.670
it sounds like a
very simple thing.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.860
And yet it's simple,
but hard since you

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.760
said most of the corporate
America is not doing that.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.750
I want to get to know your
thoughts on why that does not

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.372
happen more often.

00:11:55.372 --> 00:11:56.330
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.850
So it's this distinction Buffett
has between something that's

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.774
simple, simple to understand,
versus easy, easy to actually

00:12:05.774 --> 00:12:06.440
implement or do.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.510
I think you guys are old enough
to remember the late '08 early

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.390
'09 period after
Lehman Brothers failed.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.570
Do you remember that period?

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.460
So that was a
legitimately scary period.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.240
And the stock market
fell dramatically,

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.230
but there were active scenarios
for the financial system going

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.070
into sort of a freeze.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.710
Falling off a cliff was
the analogy that was used.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.220
And so corporate
America, as a group,

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.060
reacted in a way that's
not irrational to that.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:46.450
They generally focused on
paying down debt and husbanding

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.340
resources, given
the uncertainty.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.430
So not irrational at all.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.792
But if you looked at the two
outsiders CEOs, the two CEOs

00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:57.000
from the book who are still
active during that period

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.690
of time, their actions
were entirely different

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.580
than that pattern.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.270
And so the two CEOs
that were still active

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.250
are Warren Buffett,
at Berkshire Hathaway,

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.290
and a guy named John
Malone, who runs

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.350
a complex of companies centered
now around Liberty Media.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.150
And for both of them,
the 18 to 24 months

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.010
following the fall of Lehman
was the most active period

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.507
in their career.

00:13:21.507 --> 00:13:23.090
So while the rest
of corporate America

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.970
was husbanding
resources, and sort

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.450
of standing by the sidelines,
and healing balance sheet,

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.930
they were aggressively deploying
capital, buying companies,

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.120
repurchasing shares.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.330
But that's easy to
intellectually understand,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.080
but it requires a
certain temperament

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.880
to be able to actually
implemented it

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.070
in the heat of really
difficult times.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.300
INTERVIEWER: Sure.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.660
So picking up on what you
said about John Malone.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.040
And reading your book,
I noticed this trend

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.395
with the [INAUDIBLE]
and Tom Murphy

00:13:56.395 --> 00:14:03.510
as well, where there was
this idea of roll ups,

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.810
acquiring companies and
then sort of improvising

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.980
their operating metrics.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.510
And less in Tom Murphy's case,
but more in John Malone's case,

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:19.750
debt has had to play
a significant role.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:26.460
My question to you is-- when the
whole sector, media, was doing

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.010
well and you see a
long runway, maybe one

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.460
can look at that and
the long term value

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.730
it will bring to shareholders.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.410
But do you think the
same sort of philosophy,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.910
and the same sort of valuations,
and the same perspective

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:48.720
towards debt would make sense
today when a lot of things

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.839
of changing in
media for example?

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:53.130
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: I think
that's a very good question.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.090
With the exception
of Warren Buffet,

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.680
although we can come
back and talk about that,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.160
all the CEOs in the
book were users of debt

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.780
in some form or fashion.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.230
Some of them quite aggressively.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.540
But their use of
debt and their degree

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.810
of aggressiveness
in deploying debt,

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.510
was very much related to the
underlying predictability

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.150
of their business models.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.820
So the most active user of debt,
by a wide margin in the book,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.280
was John Malone.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.720
But John Malone, over the course
of the time that the book focus

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.100
on, was focused in
the US cable industry

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.300
before the advent of
satellite delivery of program.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.660
So effectively, a
regulated monopoly business

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.780
with very predictable,
recurring revenues.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.190
Utility like recurring revenues.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.550
So Malone recognized
that predictability.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.670
So as an example,
you could go back

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.780
and trace the severe
economic downturns

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.740
while Malone was running TCI.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.250
Cable subscribers grew
throughout all of them

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.586
over his tenure.

00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:56.960
So he's a bit of
a different case

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.590
than Capital Cities,
which was focused

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.720
on advertising supported media.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.610
So their largest
cash flow source

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.710
was TV stations at a time
when network TV was much more

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.500
dominant than it is now.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.000
I think, today, it's a
very different situation.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.580
And so, always,
your lens, I think,

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.490
in using leverage
has to be-- you

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.410
have to have a degree of
confidence in your projections

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.660
for cash flows
going forward, even

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.940
in times of economic stress.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.540
And then you need to have an
appropriate amount of leverage

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.120
for that perspective,
that set of projections.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.940
And so now you, I think, have
a much harder time getting

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.050
comfortable with
the sort of leverage

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.305
that Capital Cities
used, occasionally,

00:16:37.305 --> 00:16:39.430
to fund acquisitions for
those sorts of businesses.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.265
Today, it wouldn't sense.

00:16:41.265 --> 00:16:42.890
INTERVIEWER: So you're
basically saying

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.810
that what happened
in hindsight, it's

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.520
the framework and principles
that have to remain consistent,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.530
it's not those specific actions
that need to repeat themselves.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.790
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Exactly.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.727
That's a fair characterization.

00:16:56.727 --> 00:16:59.060
INTERVIEWER: So that leads
me to my next question, which

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:05.030
is not only were these outsiders
CEOs themselves, contrarians,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.740
and they did remarkably
well for their shareholders,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.869
but along the way, that also,
as you write in your book,

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:15.109
created a diaspora
of alumni from these.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:18.619
Can you talk more about that,
and how you think about that,

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.050
and why that happened?

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.008
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:28.450
So I think there's a bit of
an analogy with ducklings.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:33.270
So there's this
concept with ducklings

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.210
that they imprint
on the first thing

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.790
that they see when they're
born, which, the vast majority

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.070
of the time, is their mother.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.990
And they then follow that.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.180
But every now and then, you'll
read stories of a duckling

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.645
is born and a young girl happens
to walk between the duckling

00:17:52.645 --> 00:17:53.270
and the mother.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.270
And the duckling will
imprint on the mother

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.780
and follow her around.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.196
So I think in business, there's
a similar phenomenon where

00:17:58.196 --> 00:18:01.580
people are unduly
influenced by early mentors.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.220
I should say disproportionately
influenced by early mentors.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:11.220
And so these companies had very
strong cultures and people who

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.310
grew up in those
cultures were sort of

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.490
indoctrinated into
these frameworks,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.280
these ways of thinking
about capital allocation.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.220
And those who subsequently
left to run other businesses,

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.490
brought those
frameworks with them.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.300
And as an investor, it was
a very productive thing,

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.927
to follow the alumni.

00:18:27.927 --> 00:18:29.760
INTERVIEWER: So what
are some names to that?

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.640
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: There's a
company called General Cinema,

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.889
the only Boston based company.

00:18:37.889 --> 00:18:41.110
I'm from Boston, so the
only one for my local area.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.042
The former CFO went to
run an electric utility

00:18:44.042 --> 00:18:46.000
in the Northeast, a
totally different business,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.820
and had extraordinary returns
doing that, but in a very

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.030
different setting.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:55.080
There are numerous along alumni
who came out of Capital Cities

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.700
and went to run
other businesses.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.219
INTERVIEWER: Bob Iger.

00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:01.010
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: The
best known of which,

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.381
right now, is the current
CEO of Disney Bob Iger.

00:19:03.381 --> 00:19:05.130
He's a Capital Cities
alum and is actually

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.100
still very close to Tom Murphy.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.310
Tom Murphy, who's
now in his early 90s,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.291
is still an active mentor
for Iger at Disney.

00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:15.040
So it'd be any number
of examples of that.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.600
So that's a pattern
that's definitely

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.000
proven to be fruitful
over time for investors.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.460
INTERVIEWER: So on that
theme, if you take,

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.810
say, Danaher, as an example.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.900
Even if it's an outsider
CEO, but they find a company

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.680
that might be subjective
to cyclical headwinds.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.640
So I'm thinking of Colfax
in my mind right now.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.445
WILLIAM THORNDIKE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:42.445 --> 00:19:46.910
INTERVIEWER: Would it be fair
to just pay a high multiple

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.470
or pay a high valuation
even in a cyclical industry,

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.870
but generally, an outsider CEO.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:58.700
So how should investors
think about valuations

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.310
along with the characteristics
of the industry

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.312
and the management?

00:20:02.312 --> 00:20:03.270
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.180
So interestingly, it
would be logical to expect

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.990
that capital allocation ability
would trade at a premium,

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.640
but it's interesting.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.910
If you look at the actual
data, often it doesn't.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.530
And I think there are a
couple reasons for that.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.550
One is, this
approach to thinking

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.060
about capital allocation,
one of the hallmarks of it

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.260
is a focus on minimizing taxes.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.940
Over long periods of time,
optimizing around taxes

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.330
can have an enormous impact
on shareholder value,

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.080
but optimizing
around taxes often

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.780
correlates with complexity.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.570
So it often makes
those businesses harder

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.200
to understand.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.830
Also, these CEOs generally
did not spend a lot of time

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.690
on investor relations.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.450
They didn't view that as
a good use of their time.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:56.130
So the combination of complex
structures, use of leverage,

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.560
and not a lot of time explaining
results to Wall Street,

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.650
occasionally produces
inefficiency, even

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.402
in the best capital allocators.

00:21:03.402 --> 00:21:05.360
[INAUDIBLE] and I were
talking before about how

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.366
this would be true as recently
as 2012 in the Berkshire

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:08.990
Hathaway stock.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.610
And there would
be other examples.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:16.770
Colfax is an interesting case
because it's a mini me, so

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.976
to speak, of Danaher,
which is run by the Rales

00:21:18.976 --> 00:21:20.350
brothers, Mitch
and Steven Rales,

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.933
who have just an
extraordinary record.

00:21:21.933 --> 00:21:23.940
Clearly an outsider
group, they're sort of

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.140
starting over again with
a very similar approach

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.380
in this company Colfax.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.760
The initial acquisitions there
are in industrial businesses

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.570
which are cyclical.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.930
And Colfax, in
particular, has faced

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.062
sort of a perfect
storm of issues

00:21:38.062 --> 00:21:40.270
in some of their end markets
and the stock as reacted

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.860
accordingly.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.040
And so I think it's
an interesting time

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.210
to be looking at a
business like Colfax--

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.930
run by a proven
outsider team like that

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.390
after the stock has been hit
hard for what may or may not

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.380
be one time reasons.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.670
I don't have a point of view.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.230
But I would be studying it,
if I was focused, full time,

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.380
on the public markets.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.680
I think it's an interesting
potential situation.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.900
INTERVIEWER: Thanks.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.770
And Will, I remember,
your book, in one

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.560
of the first few
chapters, profiled a CEO,

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.080
who, very soon after
joining, shrunk the company

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.370
by about half.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.020
They lost rights to
their company jet

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.820
and they sold one of the biggest
divisions of the company.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.820
And yet you profile this person
as one of the most successful

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.010
CEOs ever.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.846
Can you share with
us your thinking

00:22:31.846 --> 00:22:33.720
around that a little
bit more for the benefit

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.552
of the audience?

00:22:34.552 --> 00:22:35.510
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.340
So that CEO is a guy
named Bill Anders.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.930
He's interesting because he
has an unusual background.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.550
So he was trained as
an engineer, also,

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.800
he was then a test pilot in
the Navy, and an astronaut.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.450
And he flew an Apollo mission.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.330
And, in fact, there's
a very famous picture

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.180
that I'm sure you've all
seen of the Earth from space.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.070
It's sort of this iconic
image from the 1960s.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.020
And Anders actually
took that picture

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.100
out the window of
the Apollo capsule.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.260
So he had this
interesting career.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.879
He didn't enter the private
sector until is mid 40s

00:23:08.879 --> 00:23:10.170
and then he went to work at GE.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.500
He went through the
GE training program,

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.666
was a contemporary of
contemporary Welch's, and then

00:23:13.666 --> 00:23:17.410
he was eventually hired to run
a defense oriented conglomerate

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.500
called General Dynamics.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.800
And he was hired to run
General Dynamics in the 12

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.280
months following the
fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.300
So fall of the Berlin
Wall the early 1990s

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.900
threw the entire defense
industry into chaos.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.610
The traditional model of
building a large weapon systems

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.745
to deter a Soviet threat
was, all of a sudden,

00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:38.370
out the window.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.480
So very unclear what
those businesses

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.990
are going to look like.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.720
And Anders came in and did a
fair amount of analytical work,

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.310
working with Bain
&amp; Company actually,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:51.070
and determined that
defense businesses,

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.220
to survive and thrive
in this new environment,

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:59.330
were going to have to either
build on market leading

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.800
positions or sell
businesses that did not

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.050
have market leading positions.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:08.850
So he began to aggressively
divest those businesses that

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.390
had weaker positions.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.610
So he ended up selling off a
large chunk of the company.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.970
He then went out to try to
build around the company's

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.300
core franchises, one of which
was its fighter plane business.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.360
So General Dynamics made the
F15, which is a long time--

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.240
and he went to the
number two player

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.900
in that market,
Lockheed, to see if you

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.036
could buy Lockheed's business.

00:24:32.036 --> 00:24:35.390
And he went to sit down
with the Lockheed CEO.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.620
And the Lockheed CEO
says, we're not for sale,

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.420
but we'd love to
buy your business.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.270
We'll pay you.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.160
And he named an
extraordinary price.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.840
And Anders, without
blinking an eye,

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.330
moved forward to sell
their largest business

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.580
because he just saw that
there was no-- he had done

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.770
all the math, all the work.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.314
He knew, exactly, what the
cash generated by that business

00:24:56.314 --> 00:24:56.980
would look like.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.727
And when he was paid
enough of a premium,

00:24:58.727 --> 00:24:59.810
he was willing to sell it.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.014
And so he end selling
that business.

00:25:02.014 --> 00:25:04.430
So the company, at the end of
this series of divestitures,

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.460
was less than half its size.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.730
And meanwhile, he'd been
optimizing the businesses,

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:12.130
so he generated enormous
cash from improved operations

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.010
and from these assets sales.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.630
And he then did two
interesting things.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.330
He had a very savvy
tax adviser who

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.580
helped him design a series
of special dividends

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.455
that were characterized
as return of capital.

00:25:25.455 --> 00:25:27.730
So they were shielded
from any capital gains tax

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.855
so that he was able to
distribute a lot of proceeds

00:25:29.855 --> 00:25:33.730
directly out to shareholders
in a tax advantaged fashion.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.590
And he used the balance
of the excess cash

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.290
to repurchase 30% of shares.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:42.440
So the net of all that was just
extraordinary value creation

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.140
for the shareholders,
but in a situation

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:49.360
where the company itself, by
any metric, revenues, cash flow,

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.250
employees, shrunk
very dramatically.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.637
So it's an interesting case.

00:25:53.637 --> 00:25:55.095
INTERVIEWER: I want
you to say more

00:25:55.095 --> 00:26:00.050
about that from an institutional
imperative point of view.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.240
CEOs generally want
their company revenues

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.710
to grow, they want their
own influence to grow,

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.320
they want to have a good sort
of corporate office, and so on.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.060
And here's someone sort of doing
that in the opposite direction

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.780
almost, at the surface level.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.320
And this is a theme
that I find comes up

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.250
again and again in your book.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.920
Tom Murphy left
a prestigious job

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.880
to go and start a radio station.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.460
He had no experience there.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.520
Warren Buffett, himself,
he left Wharton to study

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.360
in The University of Nebraska.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.410
And one could argue that a
lot of what Singleton did also

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.240
seemed counter intuitive.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.880
So there's a contrarian,
almost rebellious streak

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.910
that one sort of
senses in these CEOs.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.650
What do you think
gives them the strength

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.110
to act the way they do?

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.320
WILLIAM THORNDIKE:
It's a good question.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.150
So the word I would
use to characterize

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:02.020
that sort of strain of
independence is iconoclastic.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.920
So these guys were iconoclasts.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.319
They were intentionally--
comfortable

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:10.110
doing things different
than the peer group.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.350
And what drove their
confidence, their ability

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.070
to have these
contrary positions,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:22.130
was that it was rooted in deep,
analytically based conviction.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.770
So as a group, the group is
very quantitatively oriented.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:28.780
As I said, four
engineers, two MBAs.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.650
They did their own
analytical work

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.250
around major
corporate decisions,

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.750
including acquisitions
and buybacks.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.760
They did not rely on
an internal finance

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.960
team or external advisers,
bankers, and consultants.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.130
And they were solving for the
problem of value per share.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.490
They were very, very focused
on optimizing value per share.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.550
And so, occasionally,
that mindset

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.425
would give them conviction
around some sort of an action.

00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:58.372
It could be stock repurchase,
a large acquisition,

00:27:58.372 --> 00:27:59.330
or a large divestiture.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.705
And when they had
that, they were

00:28:00.705 --> 00:28:02.945
prepared to move forward
because they, themselves,

00:28:02.945 --> 00:28:06.090
had the conviction coming
out of their own thinking,

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.610
their own work.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:08.360
INTERVIEWER: Sure.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:08.860
Thanks.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.960
And finally, I'm
sure the question

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.250
about who are the
modern outsider CEOs

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.340
is going to come up.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.250
So I'm going to
pause myself on that

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.640
and it'll come up
during our discussion.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.240
But before we open it up to the
audience, I wanted to ask you,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.120
if you look at a CEO
who wants to improve

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.140
the intrinsic value per share,
but let's say their horizon

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.630
of doing this is
not a few years,

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.290
but maybe decades
or even centuries.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.500
And I'm thinking of
someone like Jeff Bezos.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.120
A comment that's been
attributed to him

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:54.420
is he's sort of said
your margin is my lunch.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.290
How does one think
about a CEO like that

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.252
in the context of outsiders?

00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:01.210
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:05.120
So I think a common trait
across this whole group

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.999
was optimizing for long
term value per share.

00:29:07.999 --> 00:29:09.790
I should have emphasized
that, [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.000
That's very true.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.890
Long term, I would define in the
context of sort of from today

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.050
looking forward
three to five years.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.679
I think that's really kind of
the visible business future.

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:21.720
I think decades and
centuries is harder, at least

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.530
in most businesses.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.740
Particularly in
your business, it

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.560
would be hard to
look out that far

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.260
and make decisions
accordingly, I think,

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.270
in most of your business lines.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.370
So I think that's a more
realistic time frame.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.880
I think Amazon is
a fascinating case

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.320
and Bezos is a fascinating case.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.630
So if you said-- So you guys
have an exceptional business.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.630
It's been extraordinarily
well lead.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.320
But if I was put on the spot
and asked to name an outsider

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.420
CEO among the traditional-- the
technology CEOs in the last 25

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.610
years, Bezos would be
the first choice for me.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:57.627
And it would be
because-- and I can't

00:29:57.627 --> 00:29:59.710
say that I've studied the
company in great detail,

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.900
but I have read annual reports.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.090
And I believe he's optimizing
for per share values

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.060
5 to 10 years out.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.435
And he can afford
that time frame

00:30:08.435 --> 00:30:10.685
because he owns such a large
percentage of the company

00:30:10.685 --> 00:30:11.310
himself.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.290
So he has the ability
to tune out the noise

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.340
by virtue of having
so much ownership

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.330
concentrated his own hands.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.420
So I think he's an
interesting case.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.550
INTERVIEWER: And who
are the other CEOs

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.570
in today's market or
today's businesses that seem

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.090
like the outsider CEOs to you?

00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:31.410
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: So you
mentioned the Rales brothers

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.860
at Danaher and Colfax.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.760
I think they very
definitely fit the model.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.400
There's a wonderful CEO
named Nick Howley who

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.810
runs a business called TransDigm
that focuses on specialized

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:42.860
aircraft components.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.290
And he's done an extraordinary
job building value there.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.770
There is a CEO name
Mark Leonard who

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.880
runs a very interesting
software business in Canada

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.350
called Constellation Software
using many of these principles.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.890
I believe, controversial
as it is at the moment,

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:05.010
that Mike Pearson at Valeant,
although it's still early days,

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.350
has many of these traits.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:10.030
And this is a very interesting
case to watch unfold.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.490
There's a reinsurer
called Arch Re that

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.530
runs its business very much
along these lines, I think.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.920
There are a series of sort
of mini Berkshire insurance

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.940
companies, Markel
Insurance, Fairfax,

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.360
White Mountains, Allegheny.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.300
They are built
along similar lines.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.360
There's a home builder,
of all things, called MVR.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.740
So I could go on, but there are
current, contemporary examples

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.490
that I think embody
these traits very well

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.260
across a variety of industries.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.210
INTERVIEWER: Sure.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.770
So maybe along
the lines of that,

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:48.100
for the individual
investor on average,

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.150
if they are willing
to put in the time

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:55.800
to study-- additional time than
it would take to just invest

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.780
in an index fund,
let's say, what

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:04.220
would be your advice in how to
approach investing, in general?

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.010
And from a spin on the
outsider's perspective,

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.465
how could they go on
identifying these in foresight

00:32:11.465 --> 00:32:13.062
rather than hindsight?

00:32:13.062 --> 00:32:14.020
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.200
So I think your first qualifier,
[INAUDIBLE], is very important.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.580
So I think if you're
going to actively manage

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.180
your own retirement
portfolio, you

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.640
have to be committed to
putting in the time to do that.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.310
And it has to be something
that, intellectually, you

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.000
enjoy doing because
otherwise, you're

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.120
going to be better off with
index fund type solutions,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.580
I think, longer term.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.870
But if that does
fit for you, then I

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.160
think you have a question around
portfolio construction, which

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.379
is, I think, a very personal,
temperamental thing.

00:32:41.379 --> 00:32:43.170
Are you going to be
concentrated or are you

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.520
going to be diversified?

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.392
There are sort of
arguments for both.

00:32:47.392 --> 00:32:49.100
So I think those are
things that you just

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.020
have to sort out for
yourself with advice

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.180
from people you respect.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.000
As to identifying--
so there are two ways

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.300
to invest in outsider CEOs.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.225
One is to keep a list of the
proven outsider CEOs, some

00:33:01.225 --> 00:33:02.350
of whom we've talked about.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.830
And you can start with
Buffett and Malone.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:08.090
And then systematically track
the value of their stocks

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.340
and have some parameters
around when you might buy it.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.006
I mean, Buffett has
given you parameters

00:33:12.006 --> 00:33:14.430
about when he'd by Berkshire,
so you can start there.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:18.362
But you guys create algorithms--
if Berkshire is ever

00:33:18.362 --> 00:33:20.820
trading at 1.2 times, it ought
to flash red on your screen,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.945
and you ought to put some
in your personal account.

00:33:22.945 --> 00:33:23.470
That's easy.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.280
So I think there's
some things like that

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.165
with existing, known outsiders.

00:33:28.165 --> 00:33:29.790
You ought to have
them on a watch list.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.400
And as I say, from time to
time, they systematically

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.150
trade at discounts to their
peers, crazy as that is.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.415
So you ought to be set up to
wait for those opportunities.

00:33:38.415 --> 00:33:42.240
In terms of recognizing
new outsider CEOs,

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.940
I think that's a
hard thing to do.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.690
I think they need to
have been in the seat

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:50.630
for at least five years to have
enough in the way of actions

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.360
taken to be able to have a
point of view on whether they're

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.471
really outsiders.

00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:55.970
So in the first
five years, you just

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:57.451
don't have enough data to go on.

00:33:57.451 --> 00:33:59.200
Pearson's right around--
it's interesting,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.730
he's right around five years.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.410
I think in those five
years, the early markers

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.020
are interestingly qualitative.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.790
I think vocabulary means a lot.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:11.270
So I think it's very
interesting to hear

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.096
how a CEO talks
about their business

00:34:13.096 --> 00:34:15.179
or how they write about
it in their annual report.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:19.880
And so I think you get extra
credit if you use the words per

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.719
and share consecutively a lot.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.300
That's just starting there.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.940
If you're optimizing things
per share as opposed to just,

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.370
we're going to grow revenue,
we're going to grow profits.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.269
Every time someone says that,
picking the word-- connection

00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:32.949
with profits, you'd like to hear
them say per share immediately

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:33.760
afterwards.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.752
Because just
growing profits, you

00:34:35.752 --> 00:34:37.510
can actually
destroy lot of value

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.010
growing the business, growing
profits, growing revenues.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:46.270
And I think a focus on
the use of the word cash

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.040
gets extra credit.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.949
So people who are
optimizing around free cash

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:54.590
flow instead of net income.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.940
And if people talk about
their unit economics

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.070
and they use words like
internal rate of return

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.110
when they're justifying
investment decisions,

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.820
extra credit, I think.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.756
So I think there's
some things that you

00:35:05.756 --> 00:35:07.630
can pick up about-- I'll
give you an example.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:11.030
So we invest in the
cell tower business,

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.960
which is an excellent business.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.090
And there are two, dominant
public companies-- American

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:17.246
Tower and Crown Castle.

00:35:17.246 --> 00:35:19.370
And I have years of going
to investment conferences

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.036
and hearing those two
companies present.

00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:22.675
Both have been
great, great stocks

00:35:22.675 --> 00:35:23.800
over a long period of time.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.890
But their approaches
to capital allocation

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.280
and to running their
businesses are very different.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.890
American Tower is
the largest player

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.290
and, historically, if you sit
at one of their presentations,

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.650
they'll talk about number
of towers, revenue,

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.630
what they call tower
cash flow, and EBITDA,

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.490
which is the use of
the metric of cash flow

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.365
that they talk about.

00:35:42.365 --> 00:35:45.420
And they've done a great
job building their business.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.210
If you then sat in on Crown
Castle's presentations

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.960
over time, you'd see that
they evolved over time

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.830
under a CEO who was an
engineer at a different metric.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.870
And evolved over
time, but eventually,

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.828
they would just say,
we're running our business

00:36:00.828 --> 00:36:04.450
to optimize for one thing
and that's recurring

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.175
free cash flow per share.

00:36:07.175 --> 00:36:09.051
And so they had moved
to a single metric that

00:36:09.051 --> 00:36:11.175
was differentiated from
what others in the industry

00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:11.700
were doing.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.450
And if you really
understood the business,

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.980
you'd see the power of that.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.620
Every piece of
that would give you

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.540
an indication of how they
would behave if their stock was

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.790
trading at a high multiple,
a low multiple, how they'd

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.080
think about new
builds, how they'd

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.121
think about acquisitions.

00:36:26.121 --> 00:36:29.547
So I think you can learn a lot
from metrics and vocabulary.

00:36:29.547 --> 00:36:31.130
INTERVIEWER: And do
you think one also

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:35.190
has stuff to learn from how
they structure their capital

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:36.610
allocations structure?

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:40.220
For example, becoming a
REIT, R-E-I-T, for example,

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.100
versus not.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.350
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: I think so.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.360
I think, potentially, yes.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.735
Again, I think it comes down
to how they talk about that.

00:36:46.735 --> 00:36:49.690
I think the REIT structure
can make a lot of sense,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.490
but you'd love to
hear them justifying

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.510
that in quantitative,
per share terms.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.450
What exactly are
the benefits of that

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.430
for shareholders, longer term?

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.940
Why is that going to produce
higher per share values

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.082
than a non REIT format?

00:37:05.082 --> 00:37:06.540
INTERVIEWER: I was
hoping you would

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.665
share your opinion on that.

00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:10.123
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: I think it
varies by industry, honestly.

00:37:10.123 --> 00:37:12.450
INTERVIEWER: No, in the
examples-- American Tower

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.012
and Crown.

00:37:13.012 --> 00:37:14.720
WILLIAM THORNDIKE:
They're all REITS now,

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.930
so they've all
made that decision.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.638
And I think it's a
very rational decision

00:37:17.638 --> 00:37:19.740
for that kind of a business.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.970
It wouldn't have been as
rational earlier on, when

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.730
they were growing more rapidly.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.480
INTERVIEWER: Because
they had to reinvest.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.438
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:37:27.438 --> 00:37:29.320
It's just the dynamics
of those recurring,

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.904
capital intensive
businesses, I think.

00:37:30.904 --> 00:37:33.028
But I think at this stage,
for both of them, that's

00:37:33.028 --> 00:37:34.119
a very rational decision.

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:34.910
INTERVIEWER: Great.

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.989
So I have a bunch of
audience questions for you.

00:37:36.989 --> 00:37:38.030
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Great.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.321
INTERVIEWER: The first one,
you shouldn't be surprised.

00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:41.622
You're at Google.

00:37:41.622 --> 00:37:43.760
The question is,
how do you think

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.852
about Larry Page, and Alphabet,
and the framework of outsiders?

00:37:47.852 --> 00:37:48.810
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.970
So I admit, I'm a
little embarrassed.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.150
I don't really know all
the details of Alphabet.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.340
So I'm very intrigued.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.940
Obviously, thinking about
Google more generally--

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.400
it's just an extraordinary
company that you guys work for,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.150
an extraordinary business.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.530
And phenomenal value
has been created

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.530
and I think you guys
seem very well positioned

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.700
in your major business
lines going forward.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:16.430
I think the issue
for Google is--

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.510
so I'll give you an analogy.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.650
Charlie Munger once wrote
about the difference

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:29.190
between CBS and Capital Cities
in the heyday of the TV station

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.810
business, 1960s
and 70s, when those

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.370
were basically
incredibly profitable,

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.590
oligopoly businesses.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:43.707
And Capital Cities ran this very
lean, frugal, optimizing sort

00:38:43.707 --> 00:38:45.290
of a structure around
those businesses

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.240
while maintaining
leadership positions

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.480
for its news broadcast.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.080
So investing in the product.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.140
But CBS divested outside
of the core business,

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.340
it bought The New York
Yankees baseball team,

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.940
it bought a toy
business, it built

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.920
this landmark headquarters
building called

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.050
Black Rock, you can
still see it in New York,

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.790
had a corporate structure with
tons of presidents, and vice

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.550
presidents, and co presidents.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:12.960
And Munger referred to CBS as of
prosperity blinded indifference

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.870
to costs and he
contrasted that with-- so

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.720
I think the issue for Google
is, you guys are so incredibly

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.590
profitable that you don't have
to make capital allocation

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.190
trade offs.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.290
You can kind of do it all.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:24.690
You can sort of try things.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:29.120
And so I think the issue is
that as the business inevitably

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.200
matures, all businesses
mature, even yours,

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.780
that may be a decade
down the road,

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.480
will you be able to
think analytically

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.580
about optimizing across a
scarcer opportunity set?

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.570
Because the problem with
technology companies,

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:48.970
historically, is that they
don't stop investing in R&amp;D,

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.870
even after the returns
from those investments

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.140
are very poor because
the founders just

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.240
have that in their DNA.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.096
So I think the test
will be for Larry--

00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:02.470
those investments are still
very productive for you guys.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:06.180
The YouTube acquisition was
an excellent acquisition.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.450
So I think it's early to
tell and the conundrum

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.870
is that there will be challenges
posed by your very success

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:17.420
today as to whether-- I think
we'll learn a lot about Larry

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.110
in the next decade
as capital allocator.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.290
He's done an extraordinary
job getting the business

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:25.000
to this point in time and it
will be interesting to see.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:25.750
INTERVIEWER: Sure.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.370
So the next question.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:31.460
He wants you to discuss the
lack of a control group.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.960
Or flipping it around,
discussing the survivorship

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.080
bias displayed in
"The Outsiders."

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.038
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.120
The lack of a control group.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.203
So is a question that's
come up from time to time.

00:40:45.203 --> 00:40:50.490
And so the question
is, are there examples

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:55.144
of CEOs who have pursued
these strategies and not

00:40:55.144 --> 00:40:55.810
been successful?

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.120
Is there a survivorship
bias-- they sort of

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.450
got knocked out early.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:03.044
And the reality is, we weren't
able to find any in our work.

00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:04.210
We weren't able to find any.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.960
But listen, I think
it's a valid question.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.120
What's striking is that--
so one of the investors who

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:15.460
I've gotten to know,
after the book came out,

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.138
about working on this project
has a high level stats degree.

00:41:19.138 --> 00:41:20.596
And I raised this
question with him

00:41:20.596 --> 00:41:25.060
and he said it that, for him,
the strength of the correlation

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.300
was such that he was very
comfortable with the value

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.830
of the findings of the data.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.420
But I think it's
a valid questions.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.700
I think it's a valid question.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.830
INTERVIEWER: Fair enough.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:40.360
And is there any
opportunity for activist

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:45.270
investors to motivate non
outsider CEOs to behave

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:49.036
in an outsider like behavior?

00:41:49.036 --> 00:41:51.410
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: The short
answer is yes, but sort of a

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.270
qualified yes.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:56.810
I think that activism is
very popular at the moment,

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.990
but there are very different
approaches to activism.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.070
And the world of activists
divides into two camps--

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:07.600
those who are sort of optimizing
around short term outcomes

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.950
and those who are more focused
on longer term outcomes.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.890
So ValueAct and
[INAUDIBLE] would

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:14.240
be examples of the latter.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.730
And there would be plenty
examples of the former.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:20.590
And I think that group of
activists, the longer term

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:23.440
group of activists, has had a
very positive impact on capital

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.077
allocation trends over time.

00:42:25.077 --> 00:42:26.660
And they have been
able to demonstrate

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.700
that they can come in
and, working productively

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.870
with the management team,
make changes that are very

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.595
beneficial for shareholders.

00:42:32.595 --> 00:42:36.490
I think the shorter term group,
the data is much more mixed.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.840
I think it's very
dependent on-- and its

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.090
very dependent on the CEO and
the board in any given case.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.650
But generally, I
think activism is

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.180
a positive for more
rational capital allocation.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.050
INTERVIEWER: Sure.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:53.280
And I have to ask for
those of us in the room--

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.800
and actually, you're going
to have a much wider audience

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.680
even on YouTube.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.600
For the folks who
are not necessarily

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:05.130
professional investors,
who are not finance majors,

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.630
but who are maybe students
or individual investors--

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:10.120
so this is a continuation
of my previous question.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.830
What is your general
advice to them

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.430
about how to invest and
be successful in long term

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:16.932
investing horizons?

00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:17.890
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Yes.

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:19.090
So that's a good question.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:21.340
So I think a lot of
it comes back to that

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.680
question I asked earlier.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.360
[INAUDIBLE], you
enjoy investing.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.455
Intellectually, it's something
that obviously is stimulating

00:43:30.455 --> 00:43:31.660
and engaging for you.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.120
That's not true for everybody.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.120
So I think if you're going to
manage your own account, which

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.970
is, I think, a
wonderful thing to do,

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:41.550
you have to really
enjoy that activity

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.242
and be interested in putting
in the time to do that well.

00:43:44.242 --> 00:43:45.700
I think, otherwise,
you should look

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.890
at more passive alternatives
for managing your assets.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:54.680
And it's really hard, long term,
to beat intelligent indexing.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.860
Just from a cost
efficiency perspective.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.440
The other alternative, which
can be indexed investing,

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.800
is if you can find a very
good manager with a very

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.010
good long term record.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.930
And if you can identify
a manager like and stick

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.680
with them, you can earn
significant returns over time.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.860
It's hard to do that.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.244
It's hard to find them.

00:44:15.244 --> 00:44:17.410
It's hard to stick with
them when they under perform

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.090
because even the best
managers will have

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.298
periods of under performance.

00:44:20.298 --> 00:44:22.360
And the worst time
to leave them is

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.430
when they're under
performing, but every fiber

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.590
of human instinct is to leave
them at that exact juncture.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.660
So it's hard to resist that.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.432
The third alternative is to
manage the account yourself.

00:44:33.432 --> 00:44:34.890
And that can be
the most rewarding,

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.181
both in terms of returns and
personally, but you really

00:44:37.181 --> 00:44:40.160
have to be wired, I think, in a
certain way to want to do that.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.380
And people in this room maybe
self selected a bit for that.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.622
INTERVIEWER: Sure.

00:44:44.622 --> 00:44:45.455
Any other questions?

00:44:45.455 --> 00:44:49.133
AUDIENCE: Is there any advice
to suggest you hire Madoff?

00:44:49.133 --> 00:44:51.489
Long term, leading the market.

00:44:51.489 --> 00:44:53.530
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: Not
long enough term, clearly.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.990
And I think you need to
understand the strategy

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.200
and make sure it
resonates for you.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.035
I think there were questions
about the strategy there.

00:45:03.035 --> 00:45:05.660
Lots of sophisticated investors
looked at Madoff over the years

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.674
and didn't
participate, so I think

00:45:07.674 --> 00:45:08.840
there were worrying signals.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.890
But that would argue for
a portfolio of managers.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.890
AUDIENCE: Should I grab
a mic or something?

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:16.220
AUDIENCE: Or you can
just repeat the question.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:16.320
INTERVIEWER: Yes.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.361
I'll repeat the question.

00:45:17.361 --> 00:45:19.240
AUDIENCE: So your
work share focuses,

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.510
very narrowly, on sort of
increasing value per share,

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.762
which is the game as
it's played today.

00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:25.220
I'm just curious
on your thoughts--

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.240
there's a growing
amount of people talking

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.890
and many point at Robert Reich's
new book about how it's sort

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.880
of missing this larger dynamic.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.720
That when you focus
so narrowly on that,

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.660
it's caused a lot of
political distortions

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.550
and it's caused a lot
rent-seeking behavior

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.680
in various cases that actually
is making capitalism, overall,

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.410
less efficient.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:45.880
So in some ways, your
book could be a handbook

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:49.030
for driving the helm in the fast
lane, if you by that argument.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.410
I'm just kind of curious of
how you think about that larger

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:52.660
balancing act and what
responsibility, if any,

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.864
those CEOs should be
taking about that?

00:45:54.864 --> 00:45:55.780
AUDIENCE: It was loud.

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.470
You don't need to repeat it.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:58.599
INTERVIEWER: Great.

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:00.140
WILLIAM THORNDIKE:
So first of all, I

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.390
think that's a great question.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:05.180
So I think there's an important
distinction between optimizing

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:09.090
per share value in the short
term, which I would define

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:11.360
is 24 to 36 months
in the public market,

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.820
versus longer periods of time.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.780
So the average tenure
of the CEOs in this book

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.360
is over 20 years.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.220
I believe that
over longer periods

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.720
of time, that one
metric captures a lot

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.860
of other important
things, including

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.160
some things that Reich
should be focused on.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:32.030
So you cannot have exceptional,
long term per share performance

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:37.510
unless you are delighting
your customers,

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:42.860
you have an employee base
that's loyal and fulfilled,

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:47.760
and you're not treading
outside of societal norms

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.319
and parameters around
environmental behavior--

00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:52.110
realizing those are
going change over time.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.120
So what was acceptable
in the '60s and '70s

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.536
would be different
now, but you've

00:46:55.536 --> 00:46:57.070
got to play within those rules.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.470
So I think as a long
term, as a single metric,

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:02.820
it's pretty good at picking
up all of those things.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:07.200
And I think it's hard to
measure performance in some

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.980
of these other areas precisely.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.160
So are you
environmentally sensitive?

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.590
Are you really taking
care of your employees,

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.230
both while they're
employed for you,

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.800
and afterwards in the retirement
programs, and health programs,

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.300
the other benefits
you're providing?

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.340
Are there other ways of being
a good corporate citizen?

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.220
So I think it works pretty
well, long term, across those

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:29.720
dimensions.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.260
Short term, it can be
the antithesis of that.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.550
If you're optimizing short
term cash flow per share,

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.140
benefits plans are one of the
first places you would look.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.611
You would look at raising
your prices aggressively

00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:45.610
to existing, loyal customers
because they're not

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.140
going to turn
immediately and you

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.595
can get 12 to 24
months of-- there

00:47:48.595 --> 00:47:49.970
are a lot of things
you would do,

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:53.430
if your goal is just to
optimize 24 month out cash flow.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.160
But that's a way of
thinking about that.

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:02.760
INTERVIEWER: So questions?

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.820
AUDIENCE: At the time
of Henry Singleton,

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:10.125
it was very rare for a
company to buyback stocks.

00:48:10.125 --> 00:48:13.570
Right now, almost every
company would buyback stocks.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.740
Another example, 3G capital.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.240
They are using like
a zero based budget.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.570
And I read that
other food companies,

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.380
they are doing roughly
the same thing.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.740
So does that mean
that, in the long time,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.280
this outsider technique is
going to be used everybody,

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.549
so that this outsider mentality
would not be that valuable?

00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:38.340
WILLIAM THORNDIKE:
That's a great question.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.800
That's a great question.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:43.660
So I think the answer goes
back-- so both of those pieces.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.320
So let's look at
the buybacks first.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.840
So we talked earlier
about buybacks.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.670
So buybacks are very
popular right now.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.342
But because of the way
they're being implemented,

00:48:53.342 --> 00:48:54.800
I think it's unlikely
they're going

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.890
to create significant
value, generally,

00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:59.260
across corporate America.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:03.490
I think those who are
more targeted and bolder

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.910
in their approach
to buybacks, are

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.159
going to continue to be able
to create value that way.

00:49:07.159 --> 00:49:10.450
So I think a lot of it has to
do with your approach to that.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.160
So that's in the
case of buybacks.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.450
3G is just fascinating.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.158
It's just fascinating
to see what they're

00:49:15.158 --> 00:49:16.780
doing across these industries.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.095
And I don't know-- I'm
curious to see what that's

00:49:21.095 --> 00:49:22.720
going to look like
five years from now,

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.200
but have proven, across a
range of businesses now,

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.640
the ability to grow cash flow,
increase margins through zero

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:38.340
based budgeting, reducing
costs without material

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.110
declines in revenues.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:43.050
In many cases, they
haven't shown the ability

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.841
to grow revenues, but
they were in business

00:49:44.841 --> 00:49:46.470
that were pretty mature anyway.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:51.410
So I think it's early days
still in seeing how that's

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.340
going to play out over
time, but the early data

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.012
is very interesting.

00:49:56.012 --> 00:49:57.720
And I think it's an
interesting question.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.180
I think it's an
ethical question.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:03.260
Because a company may
have been very prosperous

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.550
over a long period of time,
like CBS in the example

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:09.910
I talked about before, and it's
created a corporate structure

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:13.660
that just grew organically
over time, like Kudzu,

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.890
but isn't necessarily
rational relative

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.450
to the business itself,
and sort of grew

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:23.180
because of
institutional momentums,

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:30.570
is it ethical to streamline
those businesses so that they

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:33.090
run more efficiently, if it
doesn't change the customer

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:34.530
experience?

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:35.090
I don't know.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.720
I think that's a really
interesting, ethical question.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.240
I think you could certainly
make an argument that you're not

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:45.760
necessarily doing a favor for
those in bloated hierarchies

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.056
to protect their
jobs at ad infinitum.

00:50:48.056 --> 00:50:49.680
I'm not sure that's
better for society.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.300
I'm not sure that
what 3G is doing isn't

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.740
the right long term-- even
though it causes dislocation,

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.970
it's very unfortunate for
those who lose their jobs,

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.430
it's unclear to
me that that's not

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:02.800
good for society, longer term.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.341
I don't know.

00:51:03.341 --> 00:51:05.154
I think it's an
interesting question.

00:51:05.154 --> 00:51:07.570
INTERVIEWER: So the question
has gone into more specifics.

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:08.720
Let me just repeat it.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.570
The question is, how do
you characterize Facebook

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:13.040
and Oracle in the framework?

00:51:16.347 --> 00:51:17.930
WILLIAM THORNDIKE:
I just don't really

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:19.596
have enough knowledge
of either company,

00:51:19.596 --> 00:51:21.970
honestly, to answer that
question intelligently.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:24.910
I know that Oracle
has been acquisitive

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.946
over a long period of time.

00:51:26.946 --> 00:51:29.070
And I believe, although I
haven't studied the data,

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.780
that that's been a
very accretive activity

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.260
for shareholders.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.190
So that would argue that they've
been effective in acquisitions,

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.970
which is a major potential
conduit for capital allocation.

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:45.949
Facebook, it's
extraordinary what's

00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:46.990
gone on in that business.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:52.010
And their primary capital
allocation channel

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.160
has been internal growth.

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.260
They've been funding
internal growth.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.430
That's a very
prudent thing to do.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:56.780
That's been true for Google.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.470
Impossible to argue that that
hasn't been a great high IRR

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.902
activity for-- but at some
point, the growth levels out.

00:52:01.902 --> 00:52:03.360
And the question
then becomes, what

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.651
do you do with the excess cash?

00:52:04.651 --> 00:52:07.552
And I think it's early to tell,
but the WhatsApp acquisition--

00:52:07.552 --> 00:52:09.760
You guys would be better
able to evaluate that to me.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.160
I mean, that seems
completely insane to me

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.640
on normal financial
metrics, but I

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.700
don't think normal financial
metrics necessarily apply.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.140
But we'll be able to calculate
the IRR on that three years

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:20.640
from now.

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.014
It'll be very
interesting to see.

00:52:22.014 --> 00:52:24.530
When you guys did the YouTube
acquisition, by the way,

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.239
it was also a possible
to justify it.

00:52:26.239 --> 00:52:27.780
That's been a
phenomenal acquisition.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.070
So I think the
world that you guys

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:30.486
play in is a little
bit different,

00:52:30.486 --> 00:52:32.120
the metrics need
to be different.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.536
AUDIENCE: That was
also long term.

00:52:33.536 --> 00:52:34.820
It lost money for a long time.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:35.903
WILLIAM THORNDIKE: It did.

00:52:35.903 --> 00:52:38.340
It did, but ultimately-- I
mean, I give a lot of credit

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.094
to Eric Schmidt and Larry.

00:52:40.094 --> 00:52:41.635
Whoever was involved
in that, I think

00:52:41.635 --> 00:52:43.950
they were thinking about
that very analytically.

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:45.950
They had a longer term-- they
had a point of view on that.

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.699
They had conviction,
and they acted on it,

00:52:47.699 --> 00:52:49.195
and it created a lot of value.

00:52:49.195 --> 00:52:52.662
It's different than what I'm
really able to evaluate though.

00:52:52.662 --> 00:52:55.120
INTERVIEWER: So with that,
thank you so much for being here

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.950
and for taking our questions.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.110
Please to have you.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:58.940
WILLIAM THORNDIKE:
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.606
Nice to be here.

00:52:59.606 --> 00:53:02.290
