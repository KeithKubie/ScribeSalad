00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.360
A ball is shot into the air
from the edge of a building,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.500
50 feet above the ground.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.800
Its initial velocity
is 20 feet per second.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.960
The equation h--
and I'm guessing

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.340
h is for height-- is equal to
negative 16t squared plus 20t

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.890
plus 50 can be used to
model the height of the ball

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.029
after t seconds.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.570
And I think in this
problem they just

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.361
want us to accept this
formula, although we

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.210
do derive formulas
like this and show

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.260
why it works for this type of
problem in the Khan Academy

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.230
physics playlist.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.975
But for here, we'll just go
with the flow on this example.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:34.350
So they give us
the equation that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.150
can be used to model the height
of the ball after t seconds,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.730
and then say about
how long does it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.380
take for the ball
to hit the ground.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.010
So if this is the
height, the ground

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.070
is when the height
is equal to 0.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.070
So hitting the ground
means-- this literally

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.120
means that h is equal to 0.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.790
So we need to figure out at
which times does h equal 0.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.810
So we're really
solving the equation

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:07.230
0 is equal to negative 16t
squared plus 20t plus 50.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.320
And if you want to simplify
this a little bit-- let's see,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.480
everything here is
divisible at least by 2.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.231
And let's divide
everything by negative 2,

00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:17.396
just so that we can get rid
of this negative leading

00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:18.030
coefficient.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.230
So you divide the left
hand side by negative 2,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.870
you still get a 0.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.580
Negative 16 divided
by negative 2 is 8.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.020
So 8t squared.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.760
20 divided by negative
2 is negative 10.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.940
Minus 10t.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.830
50 divided by negative
2 is minus 25.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.465
And so we have 8t squared minus
10t minus 25 is equal to 0.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.840
Or if you're comfortable with
this on the left hand side,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.214
we can put on the
left hand side.

00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:44.970
We could just say
this is equal to 0.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.650
And now we solve.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.310
And we could complete
this square here,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.470
or we can just apply the
quadratic formula, which

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.090
is derived from
completing the square.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.150
And we have this
in standard form.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.340
We know that this is our a.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.530
This right over here is our b.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.890
And this over here is our c.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.420
And the quadratic formula
tells us that the roots--

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.039
and in this case, it's in
terms of the variable t--

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.540
are going to be
equal to negative b

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.950
plus or minus the
square root of b squared

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.900
minus 4ac, all of that over 2a.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.435
So if we apply it, we get
t is equal to negative b.

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:26.850
b is negative 10.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.300
So negative negative 10 is
going to be positive 10.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.800
Plus or minus the square
root of negative 10 squared.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.030
Well, that's just positive
100, minus 4 times a,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.600
which is 8, times c,
which is negative 25.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.630
And all of that over 2a.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.730
a Is 8.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.180
So 2 times 8 is 16.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.520
And this over here,
we have a-- let's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.425
see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:56.300
The negative sign,
negative times a negative,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.890
these are going to be positive.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.310
4 times 25 is 100,
times 8 is 800.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.290
So all that simplifies to 800.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.250
And we have 100 plus 800
under the radical sign.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.370
So this is equal
to 10 plus or minus

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.780
the square root of 900,
all of that over 16.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.450
And this is equal to 10 plus
or minus-- square root of 900

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.110
is 30-- over 16.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.160
And so we get time is equal
to 10 plus 30 over 16,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.940
is 40 over 16, which is
the same thing if we divide

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.950
the numerator and denominator
by 4 to simplify it as 10 over--

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.040
or actually even better, divide
it by 8-- that's 5 over 2.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.160
So that's one solution,
if we add the 30.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.410
If we subtract the 30,
we'd get 10 minus 30.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.480
Or t is equal to 10 minus 30,
which is negative 20 over 16.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.470
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 4,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.010
you get negative 5 over 4.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.740
Now, we have to remember,
we're trying to find a time.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.346
And so a time, at
least in this problem

00:03:57.346 --> 00:03:58.970
that we're dealing
with, we should only

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.094
think about positive times.

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:02.222
We want to figure out
how much time has taken--

00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:04.430
how long does it take for
the ball to hit the ground?

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.891
We don't want to
go back in time.

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.890
So we don't want our
negative answer right here.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.470
So we only want to think
about our positive answer.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.820
And so this tells us that the
only root that should work

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.010
is 5/2.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.140
And we assume that
this is in seconds.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.929
So this is in 5/2 seconds.

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:20.970
I wouldn't worry too much
about the physics here.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.595
I think they really just want us
to apply the quadratic formula

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:24.880
to this modeling situation.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.630
The physics, we go
into a lot more depth

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.730
and give you the conceptual
understanding on our physics

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.530
playlist.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.590
But let's verify that we
definitely are at a height of 0

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.620
at 5/2 seconds, or
t is equal to 5/2.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.540
This expression right over here
does give us h is equal to 0.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.160
So we have-- let's try it out.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.830
We have negative 16
times 5/2 squared

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.820
plus 20 times 5/2 plus 50.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.420
This needs to be equal to 0.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.005
So this is negative
16 times 25/4 plus--

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:07.920
let's see, if we divide
20 by 2, we get 10.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.260
If we divide 2 by 2, we get 1.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.120
So 10 times 5 is going to be 50.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.460
Plus 50.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.610
This needs to be equal to 0.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.700
Negative 16 divided
by 4 is negative 4.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.350
4 divided by 4 is 1.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.650
So you have negative 4
times 25, which is 100.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.680
Plus 50-- oh, sorry.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.880
Negative 4 times
25 is negative 100.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.780
Plus 50, plus 50
again is equal to 0.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.972
And so we have negative
100 plus another 100.

00:05:36.972 --> 00:05:38.930
Well, that's definitely
going to be equal to 0.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.370
We get 0 equals 0.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.950
And it all checks out.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.320
We hit the ground
after 5/2 seconds.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.090
Or another way to think
about it is 2.5 seconds.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.930
t is equal to 5/2
seconds, or 2.5 seconds.
