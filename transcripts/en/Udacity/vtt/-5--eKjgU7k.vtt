What operator did we use on our attendance field to transform it, and

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.130
what does it do?

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.470
In other words, what data type was our attendance field initially and

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.450
what data type did it get transformed into?

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.590
You can use any place on the internet to find the answer but

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.050
I highly suggest using the Mozilla Developer Network, or MDN to

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.300
find the most up to date and accurate documentation under JavaScript language.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.630
Answer in the box below.
