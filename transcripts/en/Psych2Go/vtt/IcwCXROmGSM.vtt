00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.540
It's popular relieved that long-distance relationships never work out

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.439
But sometimes absence does make the heart grow fonder and people learn to take their partners less for granted when they're not always around

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.200
It's also worth noting that some couples far away from each other feel closer than couples who live with each other

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.280
Because they're more willing to communicate their problems with one another. It all boils down to one word: Effort.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.720
Here's six tips on maintaining long-distance relationships

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.119
1. Give them a personal gift to hold on to.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.729
Before the two of you depart give each other something you can hold on to and remember one another by

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.750
A few examples you may be inspired by include exchanging nightlights, stuffed animals, jewelry, hoodies or mugs

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.860
What you decide to give your partner doesn't have to be big or expensive

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.040
Instead focus on how the object has served to bring meaning into your life.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.480
2. Set routines and learn about each other's schedules.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.970
Time zones can be tricky, but learn to appreciate the differences.
This can teach you the value of patience and remind you that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.000
relationships don't thrive or grow from moments of instant gratification

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.809
Once you and your partner gets settled in and adjust to your new lifestyles, let each other know about your schedules and routines

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.869
Depending on how much of a difference your time zone is

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.149
You may need to take turns accommodating to each other's availability to set up Skype dates or phone calls

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.810
It may sound daunting

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.240
But once the two of you figure out a rhythm that works for the both of you the rest will set sail.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.169
3. Build trust and try not to jump to conclusions or assume the worst.
Life can be unpredictable.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:49.059
So sometimes things come up such as family emergencies, working overtime or illness that may interrupt your usual communication patterns

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.860
rather than worrying about whether your partner is cheating on you or if they've grown bored of the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.189
relationship and may be spending more time with their friends know that there's no actual proof or evidence to back up those anxious thoughts.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.909
Build trust with your partner and ask each other how you're feeling, rather than bottling up insecurity and making the walls bigger

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.339
Getting answers directly from your partner is better than over analyzing and filling in those gaps yourself.

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:18.939
4. It's not about how often you talk to each other, instead, focus on quality communication.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.979
Consistent communication is important when the two of you are apart from each other, especially when the physical aspect of the relationship is absent

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.780
But too much of it can also backfire and leave the two of you feeling smothered or burnt out

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.900
rather than texting each other every hour of the day, find balance and moderation and focus on the quality of your

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.630
conversations instead of how frequently the two of you talk

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.540
You may come to find that the more you talk to each other the more you end up talking about the same things in circles

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.209
Rather than delving into a meaningful conversation that makes you appreciate each other's intellect ideas and perspectives.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.660
5. Make time to see each other, but know that every visit may not be ideal, and that's ok.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.970
When you visit each other you may want to make the best out of your time together and plan to do exciting things

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.560
But we're all human so allow room for flexibility instead of perfection

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.679
There may be times when you're exhausted from traveling back and forth and just want to stay in and watch a movie with your partner

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.030
Or perhaps there's a delay in your flight that may bleed into your dinner reservations

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.200
Doing fun activities and bonding with your partner is important but sometimes it's good to just play things by ear and go with the flow

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.850
Remember it's about the company you're with and not necessarily what the two of you do

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.450
6. Embrace the challenges together.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.399
Long distance relationships are difficult, but don't let the challenges tear you apart

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.100
Instead embrace them together

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.010
Sometimes your insecurities may get the best of you

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.510
Consequently, you may believe the two of you would be better off breaking up and meeting new people

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.100
Take a step back and think about why you held on for so long in the first place

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.660
Whether the two of you are apart because you're going to different schools or because of a job promotion

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.199
know that the long distance is only temporary and that you're working on yourselves before the two of you can be together again

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.360
It's a common misconception to think that in order for relationships to work

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.360
One person has to sacrifice their needs and desires for the other

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.360
In reality, this is how relationships often break apart when people feel stifled and can't grow together

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.959
Never lose sight of the big picture and don't give up!

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.190
