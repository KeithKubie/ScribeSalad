00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 Your body consists of many atoms and 7 octalons to be precise. Constitute 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.410
 37 trillion cells in your body which are actually much smaller than you think. 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.679
 The cells that make up your stomach renew every 5 days, and this is logical because stomach acid 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.250
 You can analyze the minerals, the outer layers of your skin known as the skin, known as the skin and fall 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.449
 Every two weeks to 4 weeks, meaning after a year you will lose about 0.7 kg of dead skin 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.710
 Few cells live with you for life These cells are the inner lens cells of your eyes 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 Heart muscle cells, and nerve cells in the cerebral cortex. 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.120
 It is a great responsibility to create and save memory 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.719
 While the brain looks small, all those wrinkles are for good reason. Publish it 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.219
 Your brain will be the size of a pillow. This is good by 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.949
 Of the neurotransmitters that form your memory. On the other hand, studies showed that after 2500 assistance 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.210
 Picture Within three seconds participants can remember if they have seen one of the pictures 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.890
 With accuracy of 92% 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.969
 Do not believe your eyes? Maybe because you're 10% off your day 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.220
 Can actually distinguish between 2.3 to 7.5 million colors. Your nose is capable of distinguishing 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.159
 Between 1 trillion different smells, at the same time your fingers can feel like small hills 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.850
 The size of 13 nm - this 7500X smaller than the diameter of a human hair. And while 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.189
 Do not think too much with your pinky finger but without it you will lose 50% of the strength of your hand 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.369
 The middle fingers help you to tweak and catch things 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.600
 But it is the thumb and the pink that give your hand power 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.200
 Because you tie your right hand to the left, this is about the size of your heart and beating 100,000 times a day 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.829
 It pumps 5.5 liters per pulse, nearly 3 million liters of blood per year 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.140
 If you live for 75 years, 90 Olympic swimming pools will be filled. 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.130
 After your death, the human body decomposes after 4 minutes of your death. 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.070
 This process is called self-digestion. In this process, enzymes and bacteria are oxidized. 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.640
 Actually, about 3-5 pounds of bacteria are formed in the unclean mouth 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.310
 100 million to 1 billion bacteria can grow on all teeth - and you have 32 years 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.720
 Some of us have bacteria in their mouth more than the inhabitants of the earth 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.690
 If this makes you feel weak, do not worry, your bones are incredibly strong! 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.090
 When the pressure tolerance is tested at a rate of one second, a person weighing 83 kg can measure the size of the shoe 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.540
 16,000 people can stand on his bones at one time, is of course, if there is enough space 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.040
 From the bones of our ancestors, we can extract DNA to identify them. but if 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.540
 We took all of your DNA from your body to eat, which could extend to about 10 billion miles 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.920
 You can extend from the ground to Pluto go and back, and if you take both veins, capillaries 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.400
 And arterioles, and their separation 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.500
 For each other you will die 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
