Rob Manning: For the few
people who aren't familiar

00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:06.431
with your work how do
you describe what you do

00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:09.511
and what you do online, or
what you do in education?

00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.927
Sal Khan: Khan Academy is
most known for this collection

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:15.428
of videos that I somewhat famously started

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:17.960
making for my cousins, and
then they caught on, and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.885
people who were not my
cousins started watching

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.843
them, but by the time it
kind of got serious traction,

00:00:22.843 --> 00:00:26.348
and I had quit my former
job in finance to do

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:28.431
this full-time, and set
it up as a not-for-profit.

00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:31.566
Our support has really
kind of allowed us to focus

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.966
on not only the videos,
not only translating the

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.032
videos, but trying to
build an entire interactive

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:39.096
platform so students
can get instruction, do

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:41.550
practice, if they have a
teacher or parent who can

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.099
be their coach. Those folks
will get information on

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:48.765
where the students are at,
what are their strengths,

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.931
what are their weaknesses.
And so, the Khan Academy

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:53.181
on one level it's kind of
free tutoring for anybody.

00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:54.934
It's a not-for-profit, everything is free.

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:57.347
Our mission is a free
world class education for

00:00:57.347 --> 00:01:01.259
anyone anywhere, but on
a deeper level we've kind

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:03.493
of fallen into this situation
and it kind of speaks

00:01:03.493 --> 00:01:07.208
to where we are in history,
maybe, where it seems

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:09.014
like we're a catalyst for
helping people think about

00:01:09.014 --> 00:01:12.212
what a classroom could
be now. I've never been a

00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:14.615
big believer that it should
be virtual only, but it feels

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:17.455
like now the virtual can handle
certain parts of the equation.

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:20.625
It frees up the classroom to do
maybe more interesting things.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:24.622
Rob: And what dimensions
exactly do you think virtual

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:29.758
education or online does
arguably better than

00:01:29.758 --> 00:01:32.865
direct instruction from
a classroom teacher?

00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:40.265
Sal: It's kind of a
careful answer just because

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:45.514
I think the ideal is you
have both. The real ideal

00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:47.595
is if you had a one-on-one
with a human being,

00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:51.589
but that's not practical,
you know, only kind of

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:53.890
lords and dukes had that
hundreds of years ago.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.453
What we're seeing is students
when they are getting

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.427
together with people in
the physical environment

00:02:01.427 --> 00:02:04.510
we think the best use of
that is not the lecture,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.500
the one pace fits all
lecture, the best use of

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.098
that time is for the
human beings to actually

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:09.429
interact. They're all
in the room together.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.148
And so, where online
strength is, is on delivering

00:02:14.148 --> 00:02:17.064
what used to be that lecture
in a way that it's not

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:19.245
one way pace fits all any
more, so that a student

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:20.871
can pause and repeat at their own time,

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.085
at their own pace. If
they're embarrassed by

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:25.254
maybe they're in 8th grade
and they forgot something

00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:27.677
from 4th grade they don't
have to have the guts

00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:29.760
to raise their hand in
class. They can just

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.680
look at those concepts
and no one is going to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.508
judge them. If they're
ready to move ahead they

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.627
can move ahead. Software
is also really good at

00:02:37.627 --> 00:02:40.670
kind of generating exercises,
grading the exercises,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.763
doing a lot of the
logistics that frankly take

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:45.463
teachers away from the
actual teaching part of

00:02:45.463 --> 00:02:48.699
their job, and so what we're
saying is in a traditional

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.234
classroom a lot of a
teacher's time is spent

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:53.427
giving this lecture to
a bunch of students.

00:02:53.427 --> 00:02:55.947
Often times the classroom
is fairly passsive at

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:57.810
those moments. A lot of
the teacher's time is

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.378
kind of the administrative
work of writing exams,

00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:05.450
grading exams, and maybe
10-15% of their time is

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.556
spent with the actual
one-on-one interaction,

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:09.475
or small group interaction with students.

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:13.392
We're saying with technology
we can take a lot of

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:15.456
the information delivery,
we can take a lot of

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:17.977
the logistics, a lot of
the problems, set creation,

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:20.591
and grading off of a
teacher's plate. A 100 percent

00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.242
of their time could be
the one-on-one connections

00:03:23.242 --> 00:03:25.634
with students in the
small group interactions.

00:03:25.634 --> 00:03:29.812
Rob: I wonder is part of
the issue that it's the

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:33.816
sort of one too many
kind of dissemination of

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:36.006
information which tends
to be the prevailing

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:40.828
model of instruction that
is somewhat imperfect

00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:43.660
anyway. It's sort of,
like, whether you're doing

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.057
it the lecture hall in
front of 500 people,

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:47.099
or you've got 500 students online.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.202
Sal: Yeah, and the irony here and

00:03:49.202 --> 00:03:51.962
you're talking to someone who has sat

00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:55.426
down and made 3,000
videos, or 3,200 now, but

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:57.740
the most important part
of an education is not the

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.342
lecture/videos. The most
important part of the education

00:04:00.342 --> 00:04:02.426
is doing problem solving,
interacting with people,

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:04.076
and asking questions and answering other

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:08.014
peoples questions, and
in traditional classrooms

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.943
that tends to get squeezed
out. You get a little bit

00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:13.081
out of it, but it gets
squeezed out by the passive

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:15.962
lecture, so I agree with
you. I think a lecture is

00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:19.265
an imperfect thing. I
think it gets a little bit

00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:21.896
better when you make it
on demand, when you allow

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:24.598
it to cater to a student's
pace, and then technology

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.234
can also understand what's working,

00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:27.666
what's not working. You can
start to collect data on

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:30.099
what's effective, what's
not. Traditional lecture

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.711
gets very little of that
data. Textbooks get very

00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:34.871
little of that data. Now
with online you can have it.

00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:39.015
But I think the main focus
is, and it's a bit of the

00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:40.645
irony here is that the
technology enables the

00:04:40.645 --> 00:04:42.507
classroom to become more
interactive, more human,

00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:45.674
and for me, you know, there
are always these debates.

00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:49.393
Is technology good? Is it a
cure all? Is it a silver bullet?

00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:51.635
Or, is it bad? and, you
know, [unintelligible]

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:54.097
For me the question isn't should or should

00:04:54.097 --> 00:04:56.367
you not use technology. The
question is well, what is

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:59.462
the ideal learning
experience? And you try to

00:04:59.462 --> 00:05:01.473
answer that question. To
me it's, you know, it's

00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:04.566
experience focused on
the student, cater to the

00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:08.427
students needs, works
at the students pace,

00:05:08.427 --> 00:05:11.143
and then when they're with other

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:13.346
human beings they're
interacting with them, and so

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.226
you say, okay, that's the
ideal. Now can we do it?

00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:19.997
and 30, 50, 100 years ago
you couldn't economically

00:05:19.997 --> 00:05:21.997
do it, you would have to
be quite well-off to have

00:05:21.997 --> 00:05:24.669
that type of attention
to personalize education,

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.263
but now I think the
answer is we can do it,

00:05:27.263 --> 00:05:29.591
we can personalize it in a practical way.

00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:35.593
Rob: The instructors
have not been brought up

00:05:35.593 --> 00:05:38.089
obviously, in an online
environment, the vast

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.265
majority of them, but
they have been brought up

00:05:41.265 --> 00:05:43.762
with the concept of
differentiated instruction,

00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:46.480
and I wonder there are
some who would argue

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.846
well, I can adapt my lecture
to students questions,

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:55.722
to blank stares in the
desks that I'm looking at.

00:05:55.722 --> 00:06:00.065
Are there instances where
perhaps in a smaller

00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:02.995
environment where maybe a
lecture can be equal to,

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:06.589
or better than, you know, a
video lecture style of delivery?

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.134
Sal: Yeah absolutely. There
are certain circumstances.

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:11.481
I think if you have a
very small seminar type

00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.848
situation that's highly
interactive than that wins,

00:06:13.848 --> 00:06:16.098
and actually I would say
that's not a lecture any more,

00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:17.710
that's actually what we would want to see

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.418
class time used for. I think there is also

00:06:20.418 --> 00:06:22.675
moments where shared
experience is very powerful,

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:26.265
and I would say that falls
more in the category of

00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:29.629
inspiring, your TED talks
and inspirational speech.

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.260
I think there is value
of having many people in

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.998
the room and having that
shared moment, but I think

00:06:34.998 --> 00:06:39.015
for things that are
intellectually deep, things that

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:41.245
are hard for people to
get their head around,

00:06:41.245 --> 00:06:43.235
some person might get it
faster than another person.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:45.516
I mean me and you we can watch a speech,

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:48.582
a high level speech and
we'll all get it, but

00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:50.491
if we're doing calculus,
we're doing chemistry,

00:06:50.491 --> 00:06:52.490
you might get it faster
than me. I might get it

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.343
faster than you. It's
nearly impossible. Frankly,

00:06:55.343 --> 00:06:58.676
if you get even more than
10 or 15 students to cater

00:06:58.676 --> 00:07:02.172
to where every student is,
and the only information

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.864
that a teacher currently
has is trying to read

00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:08.091
the blank stares, trying
to read how engaged the

00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:09.832
students are, and you
know, there have been

00:07:09.832 --> 00:07:11.739
studies that the average
lecturer is teaching

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:14.346
at the 23rd percentile,
because they're making

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:16.468
sure that no one is falling
behind, and I point out

00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:18.339
you might say, well at least 23% of the

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:20.681
students are getting
it, but the reality is

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:24.144
77% are bored, and then 22% it's

00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:25.645
going to fast for, so you're only catering

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:28.715
to 1%, and so I won't make a blanket

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:32.428
statement that it's always
better, but I will say

00:07:32.428 --> 00:07:35.008
that most of the time
when you have human beings

00:07:35.008 --> 00:07:37.348
together it's better for
them to interact with

00:07:37.348 --> 00:07:39.182
each other, to ask questions
of each other, than

00:07:39.182 --> 00:07:42.368
for them to just kind
of sit passively and be

00:07:42.368 --> 00:07:44.225
given a lecture. And a lot of times when

00:07:44.225 --> 00:07:45.868
people say, well in a
live lecture you can ask

00:07:45.868 --> 00:07:47.742
questions, and I say, yeah absolutely.

00:07:47.742 --> 00:07:50.423
Today in a traditional
lecture hall that's maybe

00:07:50.423 --> 00:07:52.844
5% of class time, and that's usually

00:07:52.844 --> 00:07:54.819
only the bravest people in the class, and

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:56.680
sometimes even the question
might not be appropriate

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.311
for everyone. We'd like
to see where it's 100%

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.151
of the class time, and it's not just

00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:03.011
asking the teacher questions,
it's not just asking

00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:04.764
the TA questions, but it's
also asking your peers

00:08:04.764 --> 00:08:07.506
questions where the
students themselves get

00:08:07.506 --> 00:08:10.992
that deeper experience of explaining
things to their colleagues.

00:08:10.992 --> 00:08:16.928
Rob: You see there still
being a 50/50 split,

00:08:16.928 --> 00:08:18.514
and maybe that's not the
right percentage, but

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:21.351
at least a part that's online,
a part that's in class,

00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:24.259
have you heard people
or what's your response

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:26.510
to people saying, well,
you know, maybe we can

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.764
do more of the discussion
part online as well,

00:08:28.764 --> 00:08:31.379
whether it's through
chat rooms and skyping,

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:35.848
or whatever, what's the
problem, or why should

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:38.381
that remain in the classroom,
or why not, you know,

00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:40.681
ship that into the online
environment as well?

00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:43.009
Sal: I think we should
all experiment on what

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:46.343
type of social experiences,
constructive social

00:08:46.343 --> 00:08:48.225
experiences you can
have online, and I think

00:08:48.225 --> 00:08:51.038
in some domains, you
know, doing skype could be

00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:53.017
very valuable for foreign
language. I mean the

00:08:53.017 --> 00:08:55.697
goal standard has always
been immersion. If you

00:08:55.697 --> 00:08:57.595
can't afford immersion
you skype with somebody

00:08:57.595 --> 00:08:59.762
who speaks that language
and maybe you could get

00:08:59.762 --> 00:09:02.309
interesting results, you
know, we see on our site

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:05.266
we have 60 million students
use the site every month.

00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:07.509
We want them to interact
with each each other.

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:10.390
We want them to answer their
questions. With that said,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.460
and that's incredibly
valuable for someone who

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.133
maybe does not have
someone to interact with.

00:09:14.133 --> 00:09:16.343
They don't have access to a kind of a rich

00:09:16.343 --> 00:09:19.659
environment, but I think
the technology would have

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.846
to go a very, very long
way to come close to

00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:23.803
what you could get with
a very rich classroom

00:09:23.803 --> 00:09:26.538
environment that's led
by an inspiring teacher.

00:09:26.538 --> 00:09:28.594
But when I say led, not
meaning lectured by an

00:09:28.594 --> 00:09:30.673
inspiring teacher, but
really mentored and coached

00:09:30.673 --> 00:09:32.014
by an inspiring teacher.

00:09:32.014 --> 00:09:35.178
Rob: Given that these are a different set

00:09:35.178 --> 00:09:37.676
of skills from teachers,
from what teachers have

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:40.752
been really brought up
in, do you have a vision

00:09:40.752 --> 00:09:45.346
for how to kind of get to
the sort of 21st century

00:09:45.346 --> 00:09:47.293
flipped classroom instructor that

00:09:47.293 --> 00:09:48.757
we would need to do this?

00:09:48.757 --> 00:09:50.487
Sal: Yeah, and it's an open question.

00:09:50.487 --> 00:09:52.846
I don't know 100%, I mean, it's actually

00:09:52.846 --> 00:09:55.309
exciting to be here at a school that is so

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:58.995
focused on education. I
suspect a lot of the answer

00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:01.814
might be for the future
teachers to experience

00:10:01.814 --> 00:10:04.000
it themselves, for them
to understand it, and

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.077
for them to viscerally
feel the difference between

00:10:06.077 --> 00:10:08.588
being lectured at, and
being able to engage with

00:10:08.588 --> 00:10:10.344
the content, and have
conversations with their

00:10:10.344 --> 00:10:13.179
peers, and discuss it
at a deeper level, but

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.059
I think we're just at
the very early stages.

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:19.051
In my opinion it seems
like a lot of the adoption

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.783
is happening faster than
I would have guessed.

00:10:20.783 --> 00:10:23.175
We're being used in 20,000
classrooms right now.

00:10:23.175 --> 00:10:25.427
This is really just over
the last couple of years,

00:10:25.427 --> 00:10:28.260
and we have two people who
engage directly with classrooms.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.268
We're a very small
organization, so it seems like

00:10:30.268 --> 00:10:32.173
there's a hunger out there.
A lot of the teachers

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.130
we talked to this is kind
of the direction they've

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.698
always wanted to be in, they've wanted to.

00:10:35.698 --> 00:10:37.176
They got into the profession
because they wanted

00:10:37.176 --> 00:10:39.759
to connect with students.
They wanted to be

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:42.012
that teacher that takes
that student from a

00:10:42.012 --> 00:10:44.074
certain attitude to where
they're taking ownership

00:10:44.074 --> 00:10:46.261
of their life, and they
found it difficult when they

00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:48.842
have 30 faces that they
have to kind of lecture at.

00:10:48.842 --> 00:10:53.562
Rob: All right, and one
thing that I've heard

00:10:53.562 --> 00:10:57.330
as sort of a concern from
teachers is that there

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:04.058
might be a ... Maybe I'll put it this way.

00:11:04.058 --> 00:11:06.679
The concerns have not
come just from teachers,

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:10.260
but that online learning
often gets sold as

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.925
a cost saving, you know,
is something that we ...

00:11:13.925 --> 00:11:16.649
Public education is
very expensive. What can

00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:20.552
we do to save money? Do
you think it is a viable

00:11:20.552 --> 00:11:22.845
way to do education less expensively?

00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:28.398
Sal: I kind of ... I don't
know, is the simple answer.

00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:30.507
I mean, I know for my own
kids I don't want them

00:11:30.507 --> 00:11:33.865
online only, and I, you
know the way I view it is if

00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:36.291
education was perfect
we should think about

00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:38.348
how we can then, you
know, if we're making a

00:11:38.348 --> 00:11:40.098
great car we can then think
about how to streamline

00:11:40.098 --> 00:11:42.926
the factory or whatever
we're doing, but, you know,

00:11:42.926 --> 00:11:45.046
the reality and there's a million alarmist

00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:46.870
articles that come out
about all the reasons

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.390
why we should worry about
education, and so in my mind

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.317
I would not try to
de-resource the problem.

00:11:52.317 --> 00:11:54.650
I would try to maybe hold resources costs,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.618
or maybe even potentially
increase them, but

00:11:56.618 --> 00:11:59.347
try to get, but try to
have better outcomes,

00:11:59.347 --> 00:12:02.055
and so, I view technology
as much more of given

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.341
whatever resources you
have and it's hard to

00:12:04.341 --> 00:12:06.468
argue that you're ever
putting too many resources

00:12:06.468 --> 00:12:08.507
in education. Given
whatever resources you have

00:12:08.507 --> 00:12:10.344
how do we actually optimize outcomes?

00:12:10.344 --> 00:12:13.923
Rob: You've had a good
time doing the videos.

00:12:13.923 --> 00:12:17.208
I mean, I don't think
you'd do 3,000 of them

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:18.756
if you didn't like doing them.

00:12:18.756 --> 00:12:22.094
Sal: Yes, no. I like
doing them a lot, yes.

00:12:22.094 --> 00:12:24.149
Rob: Do you have any particular favorites

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:27.478
that you were sort of
like, you know, or have

00:12:27.478 --> 00:12:29.502
you heard from people
what are particularly

00:12:29.502 --> 00:12:30.819
fond of a certain video?

00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:32.723
Sal: Oh, you know,
there's a bunch. I mean,

00:12:32.723 --> 00:12:34.322
well I think one of the ... people ask me.

00:12:34.322 --> 00:12:36.222
What's the trick? How do you ... ? and

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.845
I say the video that
I'm doing I could try to

00:12:38.845 --> 00:12:40.800
convince myself that's
my favorite video, so

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.755
that you literally have,
like, you know, you

00:12:42.755 --> 00:12:44.180
hear the energy, you hear the excitement,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.038
and you can't understate
how important those

00:12:46.038 --> 00:12:48.173
cues are for the student.
If the lecturer themselves

00:12:48.173 --> 00:12:52.095
does not care about it the
student immediately ...

00:12:52.095 --> 00:12:53.934
We're very sensitive to
that. If you're saying

00:12:53.934 --> 00:12:56.344
the next step in this
equation, I mean, whose

00:12:56.344 --> 00:12:58.315
going to care about
that, and so I think it's

00:12:58.315 --> 00:13:00.592
very important for the
lecturer themselves to

00:13:00.592 --> 00:13:03.013
feel excited that they get to do this, but

00:13:03.013 --> 00:13:05.179
there's all sorts of
topics. I'm a real big fan

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:07.930
of the cosmology videos.
It was a reason for me

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.173
to learn a lot of cosmology
and really understand

00:13:10.173 --> 00:13:12.180
it, and it's something
that always fascinated me.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.754
But I get into the finance
videos. My whole life

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.027
I was an analyst at an
investment firm, and

00:13:18.027 --> 00:13:20.041
obviously there's a
certain part of me that

00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:22.304
gets very passionate
about that. I love doing

00:13:22.304 --> 00:13:23.875
the history videos. I
love doing ... I mean

00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:25.673
I like doing it all.

00:13:25.673 --> 00:13:28.141
Rob: You get some pushback
from educators who

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.373
are, like, well he didn't
go to education school,

00:13:30.373 --> 00:13:33.682
he didn't, you know,
do you feel like maybe

00:13:33.682 --> 00:13:37.817
teaching is not as hard as
people make it out to be?

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:41.513
Sal: Well no, actually
I think it's probably

00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:43.340
harder than people make it out to be.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.931
And, you know, depending
on what you call a

00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:48.304
teacher it's, you know, you can determine

00:13:48.304 --> 00:13:50.595
whether I am one, or whether
I'm a content creator.

00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:54.762
I don't have to, or I
mean depending on how

00:13:54.762 --> 00:13:57.375
you do it, you know, I
don't have 30 live students

00:13:57.375 --> 00:13:59.549
that I'm trying to cater
to that I'm ... Some of

00:13:59.549 --> 00:14:00.869
them might have some problem at home.

00:14:00.869 --> 00:14:02.929
Some of them have some
issue. Some are struggling.

00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:08.813
That is a nuanced and
deep and important role

00:14:08.813 --> 00:14:12.255
that I am not doing when I
just make a nice resource,

00:14:12.255 --> 00:14:14.624
when I make this nice
video. Hopefully, it's an

00:14:14.624 --> 00:14:16.388
engaging video and gets
people excited about

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:18.598
the subject matter and, you
know, I want to stress this.

00:14:18.598 --> 00:14:21.426
I recently met Wendy Kopp, at dinner, the

00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:24.300
founder of Teach for America, and she was

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.962
telling me that the
single biggest determinant

00:14:25.962 --> 00:14:28.373
of the teachers that they
have, and they studied

00:14:28.373 --> 00:14:30.209
this very carefully. What are the teachers

00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:32.343
that are showing outsized
gains? And most people

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:34.473
think it's going to be
content delivery, and

00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:36.096
there is some correlation. If someone can

00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:38.007
deliver a good lecture
then their students tend

00:14:38.007 --> 00:14:40.285
to do well, but the thing that really

00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:42.394
moves the dial is the
teachers ability to change

00:14:42.394 --> 00:14:44.677
the students mindsets.
To make the students

00:14:44.677 --> 00:14:46.384
realize that they really
have to take ownership

00:14:46.384 --> 00:14:48.173
of their learning, that
they really have to

00:14:48.173 --> 00:14:52.130
start thinking about
their futures, and when

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.846
she said that I was, like,
well I need to quote you,

00:14:53.846 --> 00:14:55.461
and I'm quoting her
right now because that's

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:56.997
very consistent with what we're saying.

00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:59.594
Instead of 5 or 10% of a teacher's time

00:14:59.594 --> 00:15:02.875
being that coach, that
inspiration, and 90%

00:15:02.875 --> 00:15:05.256
being the content delivery we want 100%

00:15:05.256 --> 00:15:07.068
of a teacher's time being that coach, that

00:15:07.068 --> 00:15:09.214
inspiration, that person
in the student's life

00:15:09.214 --> 00:15:11.818
that can change their
mindset, that can change

00:15:11.818 --> 00:15:14.209
their outlook, that can
be that mentor, and that's

00:15:14.209 --> 00:15:16.675
something I'll never be able
to do as a video creator,

00:15:16.675 --> 00:15:18.829
and you need a live human being for.

00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:20.782
Rob: Do you think
there's much of a stretch

00:15:20.782 --> 00:15:24.386
between standing in front
of a group of 25 students,

00:15:24.386 --> 00:15:27.133
and doing an exercise at the board versus

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:30.184
doing an exercise in
a YouTube video that's

00:15:30.184 --> 00:15:31.465
going to be seen at home?

00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:34.703
Sal: You know we've been,
and we're constantly

00:15:34.703 --> 00:15:36.644
looking for folks to make
more and more videos,

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.262
and obviously there's
some incredible teachers

00:15:38.262 --> 00:15:39.640
out there, many, many incredible teachers,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.435
but we found that there's
a certain nervousness

00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:46.150
once you record yourself
and you put it out there

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.889
for the world to see
and comment on, and so,

00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:53.932
yes, there is a difference
when you, I mean I

00:15:53.932 --> 00:15:55.897
actually don't think
about it. When I make a

00:15:55.897 --> 00:15:57.512
video I kind of just imagine
my cousins listening,

00:15:57.512 --> 00:16:00.135
and I think it just makes
it more intimate and warm,

00:16:00.135 --> 00:16:03.634
hopefully, but we have seen
folks who are, I think,

00:16:03.634 --> 00:16:07.096
amazing teachers in
physical form, but when they

00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:09.931
know they're being recorded they
tend to get a little nervous.

00:16:09.931 --> 00:16:13.679
Rob: And I think teachers
are accustomed to making

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:15.850
relationships, or forming
relationships with

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.643
students that they have
right in front of them,

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:22.179
and there's this
uncertainty around well how

00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:25.250
am I relating, how are
students relating to me

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.885
when they see me on their
computer and is that,

00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:31.762
obviously you started
with your cousins, so

00:16:31.762 --> 00:16:33.345
I don't know if you ever
sort of went through

00:16:33.345 --> 00:16:34.636
that period of uncertainty?

00:16:34.636 --> 00:16:36.484
Sal: Yeah. No, I go through
that period of uncertainty

00:16:36.484 --> 00:16:38.650
every time I upload a
video, and this is what's

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.952
exciting these days is I
can upload a video now,

00:16:41.952 --> 00:16:44.317
and within an hour I'll
get 50 comments from

00:16:44.317 --> 00:16:46.897
kids of all ages. I
shouldn't say just kids,

00:16:46.897 --> 00:16:50.405
all over the world, and it matters to me.

00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:52.312
I mean, it really helps me. If you say

00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:54.150
"that really helped, that
was exactly what I needed,"

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.927
I've gotten through
that concept now, and so

00:16:55.927 --> 00:16:58.111
in that way I get much
more direct feedback.

00:16:58.111 --> 00:16:59.842
You know, I've done ... I've never been a

00:16:59.842 --> 00:17:02.894
professional teacher, but
I've done some teaching

00:17:02.894 --> 00:17:05.844
in college and, you know,
I used to give a lecture

00:17:05.844 --> 00:17:08.238
or teach a class and the day would go by,

00:17:08.238 --> 00:17:11.416
no feedback, I'd get
insecure about it. (laughs)

00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:13.402
And that would happen
and maybe at the end of

00:17:13.402 --> 00:17:14.948
the term you might get
one or two students,

00:17:14.948 --> 00:17:16.811
if you're lucky, who
might say, "oh that was

00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:18.787
really helpful, you
know, thank you," but you

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:21.356
don't get that direct
feedback as often, and

00:17:21.356 --> 00:17:23.895
you know, online you get that feedback

00:17:23.895 --> 00:17:25.818
for better or for worse.
Sometimes the feedback

00:17:25.818 --> 00:17:27.971
can be harsh, but once again,
that can only make you better.

00:17:27.971 --> 00:17:31.442
Rob: Would you expect every instructor to

00:17:31.442 --> 00:17:34.564
produce their own content,
or do you think that

00:17:34.564 --> 00:17:36.817
there could be just a standardized

00:17:36.817 --> 00:17:38.950
repository that teachers would draw from?

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.563
Sal: I think both. I mean,
I'd like to see a world

00:17:41.563 --> 00:17:44.400
where every instructor
if they're not happy

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.482
with what they're seeing
out in the world that they

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.894
are creating their own, and say hey, I can

00:17:48.894 --> 00:17:50.694
do better than that,
that persons not covering

00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:52.926
this nuance or this angle,
let me do something.

00:17:52.926 --> 00:17:56.121
With that said, I can
imagine over time the

00:17:56.121 --> 00:17:58.705
content delivery, you know, just as every

00:17:58.705 --> 00:18:00.655
teacher is not writing
their own textbook that

00:18:00.655 --> 00:18:02.806
you kind of start to settle on it becomes

00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:05.060
reasonably resource intensive. Now we can

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.228
actually use data and
analytics to figure out

00:18:07.228 --> 00:18:09.397
which of the videos,
and once again, I think

00:18:09.397 --> 00:18:11.702
the videos in some ways
they're an analogist

00:18:11.702 --> 00:18:13.345
to the text in the
textbook, but we can start

00:18:13.345 --> 00:18:14.983
to measure how effective
is it, how engaging is it,

00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:19.681
and in 5 or 10 years
we won't need thousands

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:22.617
of explanations of factoring a polynomial.

00:18:22.617 --> 00:18:24.954
We could have a handful
that have proven themselves

00:18:24.954 --> 00:18:28.401
to really engage students
and resonate with them.

00:18:28.401 --> 00:18:33.127
Rob: I have one last question,
if I could, which is the

00:18:33.127 --> 00:18:36.823
level of work that this
type of education requires

00:18:36.823 --> 00:18:38.784
as opposed to what
teachers are accustomed to

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.176
doing now. What I've
heard from one instructor

00:18:41.176 --> 00:18:43.933
who does sort of a
hybrid kind of, you know,

00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:46.314
does a little bit of
both, he's like, well the

00:18:46.314 --> 00:18:48.611
classes that have an
online component you really

00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:50.945
have to develop all those
online pieces in advance,

00:18:50.945 --> 00:18:54.292
and then you still have
all of the work of the,

00:18:54.292 --> 00:18:56.234
you know, regular
interaction with students.

00:18:56.234 --> 00:18:59.520
In short, it sounds like it is more work.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.103
It may be worth it, but
do you think that it is

00:19:02.103 --> 00:19:03.650
more work and perhaps worth it,

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.103
or what's your view on that?

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:07.270
Sal: What we're seeing
is, yeah, I think, today,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.656
in most schools especially
I would say public

00:19:09.656 --> 00:19:13.484
schools where a teacher
wants to do something

00:19:13.484 --> 00:19:16.397
in this direction it is
more work for them, today,

00:19:16.397 --> 00:19:18.450
because to some degree they
have to serve two masters.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.987
They have to serve the
traditional master of

00:19:19.987 --> 00:19:21.731
this is the state
curriculum. You have to do

00:19:21.731 --> 00:19:23.399
this in this week, but
at the same time, they

00:19:23.399 --> 00:19:25.613
want to have the flexibility and allow the

00:19:25.613 --> 00:19:27.488
students to work at
their own pace and cater

00:19:27.488 --> 00:19:29.786
to the student, so it is
more work for them, today.

00:19:29.786 --> 00:19:32.182
It's less work then if they wanted to do a

00:19:32.182 --> 00:19:34.695
student centered curriculum
10 years ago without

00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:37.573
any technology. With
that said, the direction

00:19:37.573 --> 00:19:39.736
that everything seems
to be going in is that

00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:41.636
the tools are getting better, you know,

00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:43.358
Khan Academy itself is
nowhere near being a

00:19:43.358 --> 00:19:46.359
perfect tool. We have a
list of 200 things that

00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:48.102
we need to fix about
it, make it easier for

00:19:48.102 --> 00:19:49.768
teachers to use, make
it easier for them to

00:19:49.768 --> 00:19:51.842
plan their curriculum.
We have to add a lot

00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:53.817
more content so that
people don't have to go

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:55.454
and fill in the gaps in other places.

00:19:55.454 --> 00:19:57.403
There's other people
making more and more tools.

00:19:57.403 --> 00:20:01.445
So I suspect as the tools
get better, as kind of

00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:03.957
the curriculum becomes
clearer, I think this

00:20:03.957 --> 00:20:05.848
adoption of the common core is actually a

00:20:05.848 --> 00:20:08.429
huge opportunity because
states have adopted it.

00:20:08.429 --> 00:20:11.925
It hasn't kind of fully gone
into implementation yet.

00:20:11.925 --> 00:20:14.704
I think all of these things
are kind of converged.

00:20:14.704 --> 00:20:16.315
The technology is going
to become more usable,

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.395
and more accessible.
Right now teachers have to

00:20:18.395 --> 00:20:19.903
struggle with trying
to get the laptop cart

00:20:19.903 --> 00:20:21.339
for their class at the right period.

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:23.176
Hopefully, a lot of
those things are going to

00:20:23.176 --> 00:20:24.896
solve themselves over
the next 4 - 5 years.

00:20:24.896 --> 00:20:28.509
So, yes, I would say
it's harder today, but

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:31.375
the teachers think it's
worth it, but I would

00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:33.734
suspect 5 - 10 years from now it might be

00:20:33.734 --> 00:20:35.526
easier than a traditional model.

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.483
Rob: Well thanks. I should
probably wrap up now.

00:20:38.483 --> 00:20:39.982
I could ask you lots more questions.

00:20:39.982 --> 00:20:42.275
Sal: Oh no, no, no, great, great,
yeah, those were great questions.

00:20:42.275 --> 00:20:44.000
Rob: I appreciate it.
