00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:10.333
It’s Christmas day, and hundreds of indigenous Q’eqchi people
have come to the village of San Antonio Secortez

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:14.466
to say goodbye to 
7-year-old Jakelin Caal.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:20.033
Jakelin and her father left this remote
Guatemalan community on December 1st

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.733
and headed north to the United States
in search of the American Dream.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:33.766
But, a week and nearly 200 miles later,
the family’s dream of a better life turned to tragedy.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.966
Jakelin died in U.S. Border Patrol custody,
27 hours after she and her father were detained.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:14.600
Her mother, Claudia, is now
living every parent’s nightmare.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.366
For decades, Maya Q’eqchi communities
like Jakelin’s faced oppression

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:33.333
and systematic displacement
by U.S. - backed dictators.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:39.033
African palm is spreading across the
fertile plains near the Caal’s community.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:45.033
Some subsistence farmers have sold their
small parcels to the palm oil companies.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:49.233
Others say they were pressured,
or even threatened, to sell.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:56.666
Whatever the reason, the result
is less available land for growing corn.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:02:02.833
Jakelin’s father, Nery, saw the plantations
as a rare opportunity to get a decent job.

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:08.433
He and his brother Carlos secured work
harvesting palm fruits on a local plantation. 

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:12.666
But, they discovered that the promising job
was based on exploitation.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:52.866
Jakelin’s grandfather, Domingo Caal,
has worked the land his entire life.

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:59.766
He grows cacao and spices, and has planted a
variety of fruit trees on the family plots of land.

00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:06.766
But one crop is central to the lives of indigenous Guatemalans ...
and this staple is now under threat.

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:29.466
Farmers like Domingo say it’s impossible to
know when to plant their saved corn seeds, 

00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:33.100
as weather patterns have
become less predictable.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.666
Drought and flooding can decimate crops,
and government assistance is non-existent.

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:43.566
And every year, there’s
more pressure on the land.

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:24.900
When farmers like Domingo manage to produce
more corn than their families consume,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.033
they sell the excess
in local markets.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:32.533
Half a year ago, a hundred pound sack
sold for roughly 16 dollars.

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:36.500
Now, farmers are lucky to get
just half that.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.066
That makes purchasing beans, meat
and vegetables much more difficult.

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:47.033
This lack of steady jobs, combined with
smaller corn harvests and disappearing land,

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:54.366
means that families like Claudia’s are often faced with
the most difficult decision a parent can make.

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:19.500
With his options running out, Nery felt trapped …
desperate to find some way forward.

00:05:40.533 --> 00:05:46.766
Nery wasn’t the only one from the surrounding
area looking towards the United States.

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:53.233
The local mayor says 200 families have left
for the border in the past two months –

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:56.100
some traveling with
up to five children.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.300
Organizer Rax Kok works in local
Q’eqchi communities.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.700
He has seen, first-hand, the impact of migration
on indigenous values and culture.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.933
He tries to convince families like the Caals
that there are alternatives to migration.

00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:34.333
But he says he’s fighting a losing battle,
as human smugglers take advantage

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:37.266
of people’s ignorance and desperation.

00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:33.366
The Caal family won’t say how much
Nery paid for his trip, 

00:07:33.366 --> 00:07:39.100
Or whether the coyote gave him a
discount for taking Jakelin along.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.566
But if he’s deported,
there will be large debts to pay.

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:12.100
Nery Caal planned to travel to
the United States alone.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:18.000
But when Jakelin found out he was leaving,
she told her father she wanted to go, too.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.600
She had a special bond with her father
and didn’t want to get left behind.

00:09:30.133 --> 00:09:38.500
The group reaches the tiny cemetery where
Jakelin’s family built a basic tomb over the past few days.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.966
Jakelin’s uncle, Carlos, writes
her name in the fresh concrete,

00:09:42.966 --> 00:09:46.033
ensuring that though she might be gone,
she will never be forgotten.
