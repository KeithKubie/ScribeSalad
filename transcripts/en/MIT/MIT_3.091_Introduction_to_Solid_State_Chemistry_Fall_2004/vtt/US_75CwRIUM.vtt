00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:30.920
OK, let's get started.
One announcement: test three.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.840
It's a celebration of learning.
It's going to be on Wednesday,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.760
which means no lecture.
No lecture Wednesday. Instead,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.690
it's a celebration. Please go to
your rooms as assigned here.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.610
If you are writing at 11 o'clock,
probably in this room right now, and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
those are the room assignments.
They are the same as for test two,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.430
but not the same as for test one.
We moved more people out of 10-250

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.310
to give a little more room here.
And, there's plenty of room in

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.180
these others. Those that write at
one o'clock do not go to the normal

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.050
lecture room 6-120.
We're writing at 26-100.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.930
And, the coverage is right here.
So, that's up on the website. So,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.810
you should know what we are going to
be examining you on,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.680
and the same comments that I made
before: I want to give you feedback,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.560
let you know how you're doing,
whether your study methods

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.440
are effective or not.
It's not an attempt to retest your

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.330
admission to MIT,
or anything like that.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.220
If you do your work, you should do
very well. And if you have not done

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.110
your work, you shouldn't do very
well, and we'll be able to tell you

00:01:47.110 --> 00:02:06.686
so. So, just what we
said in the past.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:53.520
Please take the time to read the
whole exam, do the easy questions

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.050
for you; the ones that you find
easiest, do those first.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.580
But let's be honest, this isn't
high school anymore.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.110
So, I mean, I had people tell me
after the second test,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.640
I had my aid sheet, but I hardly
used it. Well,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.170
think about it. Do you think I'm
going to give you an aid sheet and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.700
then give you a question that
requires you to take something off

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.230
the aid sheet and transfer it to the
answer paper? It's not

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.120
pattern recognition.
I mean, this isn't medical school,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.370
for crying out loud. You've got to
think here. You got to think.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.620
So, this is now the third test.
There's going to be more and more

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.870
thinking, and less and less rote,
although we'll have some confidence

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.120
builders on there.
I don't want to knock people off

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.370
their balance.
So, work parametrically.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.620
Try not to immediately start
punching in numbers.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.870
And, if you don't know how to do a
question in great detail,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.070
write me an outline.
Tell me what you would do.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.230
Either you equate energies,
or minimize something, or maximize

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.380
something. Give us a sense that you
have a grasp of the material.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.530
And, keep your eyes on your own
paper. Our effort is going to be to

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.690
get those graded on Wednesday,
and back to you in recitation on

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.840
Thursday. So,
I think that's,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:35.480
and remember, please bring your five
items.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:24.860
We are having more and more people
showing up minus periodic table,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.730
table of constants, something to
write with; I've had people ask me

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.590
for pens, for calculators,
no one has asked me yet for an aid

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.460
sheet. So, I haven't had to help
anybody on that.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.330
OK? Good. Well,
today what I want to do is start a

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.190
new unit. I want to talk today
about organic chemistry.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.060
Now, this is going to be the most
minimal introduction to

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.870
organic chemistry.
The reason we talk about organic

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.620
chemistry at all is in order to
prepare ourselves for more

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.370
solid-state chemistry,
specifically, I'm going to talk

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.120
about polymers.
And ultimately,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.870
we're going to talk about
biochemistry because even though

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.620
this is solid-state chemistry,
we as living beings are solid-state

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.370
devices. We are made of soft matter.
This is a polymer.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.120
This is a semiconductor,
band gap of two to three electron

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.870
volts.
But it's not made out of three-five

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.620
semiconductor.
Nature has figured out a way of

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.370
doing this without inorganic means.
So, we need to know a little bit.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.120
But if you really want organic
chemistry, you're going to have to

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.870
take 5.12. So,
I can't teach you 50 minutes what

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.620
people teach in one semester.
So, let's get a few definitions

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.370
under our belts.
Organic chemistry is the chemistry

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.120
of compounds containing both carbon
and hydrogen, not just carbon,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.460
carbon and hydrogen.
So, diamond and graphite are not

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.380
organic because they contain carbon
but not hydrogen.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.300
And, what makes these two elements
special that they figure so

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.220
prominently in living organisms?
First of all, hydrogen is the

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.150
element with the lowest atomic
number. And, when it loses its

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.070
electron, it changes character
dramatically. We talked about this

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:35.340
in recent lectures where
we have simply a proton.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:26.260
It's capable of forming covalent
bonds, but when it finds itself in a

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.530
compound forming a covalent bond
with something that's strongly

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.790
electronegative,
it's so denuded of electrons even in

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.060
the covalent bond that that protonic
entity can start mischief and form

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.330
hydrogen bonds.
Carbon is dead center: four valence

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.590
electrons. So,
it's nowhere near metallic.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.860
It's nowhere near nonmetallic.
So, it's got an intermediate value

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.060
of average valence electron energy.
It's very unlikely that carbon is

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.180
going to acquire four electrons and
become C4 minus,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.310
or lose four electrons and become C4
plus. It's a prominently covalent

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.430
player, but it's very small.
And, because it's small, it can

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.550
form multiple bonds.
It forms multiple bonds.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.680
And, we've already seen evidence
where it forms sigma and pi bonds.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.810
So, it can form double bonds and
triple bonds not only with itself

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.930
but with other elements,
notably nitrogen, oxygen,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.230
phosphorus, and sulfur.
And even though silicon and

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.690
germanium hybridize,
because they are not small,

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.150
silicon does not form double bonds.
You will not see silicon analogues

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.610
to carbon compounds throughout.
Yeah, silicon sp3 hybridizes, and

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.070
single crystal silicon has the same
crystal structure as single crystal

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.530
diamond, but that's pretty much
where the similarity ends.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:07:11.526
It's pretty much sp3 hybridization,
and that's the end of the story.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:07:00.360
So, these two have very special
qualities that make them so

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.720
important. And,
I mean, the other thing that carbon

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.090
can do is it can continue to link
with itself and form chains and

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.450
various other structures.
And, we're going to meet a few of

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.810
those today. There are millions of
organic compounds; I'd say billions,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:37.353
billions, and billions.
But we are not going to cover all

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that. We are going to cover the
ones that are most germane to our

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
subsequent discussions of polymers
and biochemistry.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, let's first of all go through
the taxonomy. So,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I mean, I've posted all this on the
website. And it's in the reading.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I have tried to characterize this
in a way that,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
or categorize it so that it makes
some simple sense as opposed to just

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
standing here and barking out a
litany of facts to you.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:56.660
So, the first thing I want to do is
look at the left-hand column called

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:03.330
the alkanes. And,
these are hydrocarbons.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:09.990
The whole thing we're going to look
at is hydrocarbons for starters.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:16.660
And, these, as the name implies,
are compounds that consist of only

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:22.920
carbon and hydrogen.
And the first group that we're going

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:28.760
to look at is the alkanes,
which you can see in the slide.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:34.610
And, these are characterized by sp3
hybridization on the carbon.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:40.460
All the carbons are sp3 hybridized.
And so, that gives us the maximum

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:46.300
possible number of bonds,
maximum number of carbon-hydrogen

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:52.150
linkages. And so,
the chemical term for such compounds

00:08:52.150 --> 00:09:09.366
is saturated. These are
saturated hydrocarbons.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:09:02.570
And, all of these bonds are sigma
bonds. All the bonds are sigma

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:07.140
bonds because they're all single
bonds. So, these are the

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.710
characteristics.
In a general formula,

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.280
if you go through the math,
it's going to be C some sub n number,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.850
whatever the number of carbons in
the molecule, and then if we go

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.420
through sp3 hybridization and put
hydrogens at all the noncarbon

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:44.306
linkages, it'll be H two times the C
number plus two.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.800
And so, these are called alkanes.
And, this is the way you build the

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:41.590
name. The nomenclature is to,
it's going to have an -ane ending,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:47.390
which is going to indicate that
we're talking about sp3 hybridized

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:53.190
hydrocarbons. And then,
in order to indicate the number of

00:09:53.190 --> 00:10:10.846
carbons, we call out the carbon
number by the prefix.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:10:04.590
So, this prefix identifies the
carbon number,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:10.190
and they are shown here actually.
Let's take a look at a set of those.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.790
This is right out of your reading.
And there they are: one, two, three,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:21.390
and so on. And,
it's basically meth-,

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:40.046
eth-, prop- is three, but- is four,
and these are all historical.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:30.690
And, you can go into the reading and
figure out butyric acid is one of

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.380
the elements in rancid butter and so
on. So, there is some historical

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.070
reasons. But,
after you get to four,

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.760
it's strictly the Latin ordinals.
From here on, this is pent, and

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.460
what do we have?
We have hex-, hept-,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.150
non-, dec-, and so on.
So, just go back to your Latin,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.250
and you're going to be fine.
I'm not going to expect you to pull

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.750
these out of memory.
I would tell you C5,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.250
well, what, you've forgotten your
Latin? Was it an admission

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.750
requirement? How many semesters of
Latin did you need in high school to

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.250
get into MIT? None,
OK, so I think I'd better keep that

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.750
in mind. So I will tell you pentane,
and I'll give you the formula: C5H12.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.250
All right, so these are also called,
they are called straight chain

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.750
molecules because we you look at
them a little bit more carefully,

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.290
we will see the following.
Let's have a look at what they look

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.890
like. Oh, before I go,
I just wanted to hearken back and

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.490
show that there is some overarching
theme here. So,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.090
these are three hydrocarbons that
I've chosen: propane,

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.690
which we know is used as a fuel in,
among other things, transportation

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.950
and even domestic barbecue grills.
And, it's a gas at room temperature.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.860
These are all the same. They are
long chains with hydrogen around

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.770
them. OK, these are all symmetric
molecules. Octane,

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.670
which is the principal constituent
of gasoline, is a liquid at room

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.580
temperature. And,
icosane is a solid at room

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.490
temperature. So,
all of these have,

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.400
they are symmetric molecules,
and the only thing that's happening

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.310
as you go to larger and larger
molecules is your increasing

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.220
polarizability,
your van der Waals bonds between

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.130
molecules of the same identity
increases, and you can see that as

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.040
the molecular length increases,
the molecule converts from gas, to

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.880
liquid, to solid.
So, it's something to keep in mind.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.660
So, these are the ball and stick
images. Methane we've met before.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.440
There's the sp3 hybridization, four
bonds, 109¡ apart.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.220
In the case of ethane,
this is C2H6. One of the four bonds

00:12:46.220 --> 00:13:05.240
is a carbon-carbon bond.
It's a sigma bond.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:53.750
OK, and then we go to propane.
So, now we've got C3. So, that's

00:12:53.750 --> 00:13:13.133
what's cueing us in on which of
these to choose.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:13:01.250
But, I want you to note that at
propane, this sp3 hybridization

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:21.966
requires that as we add more and
more carbons, if we're going to put

00:12:45.000 --> 00:13:08.750
one more carbon,
we're going to put it up here.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:28.400
You can see that even though this
thing is straight,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:13:16.250
it, in fact, at the local level is
zigzagging. At the local level,

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:36.366
there is some zigzagging. So, we
want to keep that in mind.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:26.400
The sp3 hybridization gives bonding
along the chain that in fact zigzags.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:32.800
And, this is a 109¡ angle.
And, so, if you are up really close,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:48.733
you say, well,
this is clearly bent.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:25.600
But if you make this long enough,
and you get far enough back, in a

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:32.000
general sense, this is termed
a straight chain.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:56.660
It's a straight chain hydrocarbon.
There is one other thing that is

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.330
similar to what we've seen in the
past in the case of silicates.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.990
And, that's shown here. As long as
we've got 109¡ along this axis

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:10.660
between the other bonds,
there's no specification what

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.330
happens down here.
So, this should remind you of what

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:34.393
happens in a silicate when the
oxygens don't all line up.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:23.570
And so, it's possible to get
disorder. And so,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.150
here you see one case where you have
the hydrogens on adjacent carbons

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.730
not facing one another,
whereas here they are lined up.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.310
So, if I were to look on end from
the left down the chain,

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.890
I would only see one, that all the
hydrogens are lined up.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.460
And we call this configuration an
eclipsed configuration.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.040
This is slightly high-energy,
whereas this is a little bit lower

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.620
energy, staggered.
And, what's the effect of that?

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.200
The effect is not to give us a
straight chain that

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.930
goes in a beeline.
For that, you would have to have the

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.810
eclipsed configuration.
Here's two examples of C17H36.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.680
They're both straight chain, but
because one's twisting a little bit

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.550
more than the other,
and here I'm talking about just the

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.430
carbon-carbon bond twisting.
These are both termed straight

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.300
chain. But, they have different
conformations.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.180
So, this is starting to make you
think about the plurality of

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.060
possibilities even within the same
chemical composition that would be

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.250
present in polymers.
Here, we've only got 17.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.750
Imagine if instead of 17 it became
17,000, what this can do.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:36.250
So, this is an example of what we
mean by straight chain.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.750
But it doesn't mean that it's a
rod-like entity.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:45.250
OK, but I can now show you
something that's not a straight

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.750
chain. So, let's also look at
something called a branched chain.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:16:08.500
Now, that's different.
And, I'm just going to look at one.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:16:00.390
We're going to look at butane.
That's a gas at room temperature.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:05.990
It used to be used as fuel for
cigarette lighters.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:11.590
But I guess that's not PC anymore.
Now you can use it for lighting

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:17.190
candles. I can say that,
can't I? Let's look at butane.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:34.780
So that's number four.
So, all right,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
so just to smooth things along,
it's possible to just write them in

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
a straight line even though we know
these are 109¡.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And, we know that if there's
nothing put at the end of the stick,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
we assume it's hydrogen. So, all of
these are hydrogen,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
carbon hydrogen-linkages.
So, I've got one, two, three,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
four carbons. And, I've got one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
eight, nine, ten. So, this is as it
should be C4H10.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:55.450
And certainly this is identical to
something that could be represented

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:00.900
as follows. All right,
so now I'm going to have the four

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:06.360
outlining a tetrahedron.
So, there is one, two, three,

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.810
four, one, two, three, four, one,
two, three, four. Remember, when

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:17.270
you're in carbon chemistry,
four sticks off of every carbon:

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.610
that's what you're checking.
OK, so this is the linear.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:27.840
But there's another way. There's
another way we can do this.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.070
We can do the following. We can
put - and off one of the carbons.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:38.300
I can put a branch, and then I've
got to use the four stick rule,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.530
so, one, two, three, one, two, so,
one, two, three, four. This has one,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:48.760
two, three, four.
So, now, let's count: one,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:18:07.986
two, three, four, four carbons,
and three, six, nine, ten hydrogens.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:58.660
So, on a formula basis,
this is also a butane. But,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.330
it's a different. As solid-state
chemists, we are very much attuned

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.990
to molecular structure.
And this molecular structure,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:12.660
the linear one is different from
this one. This is a branched one.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.330
So, this one's called iso-butane.
And, the other way to look at it is,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:35.326
well, the backbone is only three
carbons.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:26.660
So, if the backbone is only three
carbons, according to this rule,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.330
this should be some kind of a
propane. Another way to name this

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.990
is to call it a propane.
But, it's got instead of just

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:40.660
hydrogens, one of the propane side
groups instead of being a simple

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.330
hydrogen has this CH3,
which is a methyl group.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:19:03.460
So we could call this one a methyl
propane.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:54.400
And, we could further number the
carbons from left to right.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:14.533
So, the first one is the number one
carbon. The second is number two.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.200
The third is number three, and the
methyl group is attached to the one

00:18:43.200 --> 00:19:07.600
in the second,
so this is two-methyl propane.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:27.000
And, what we have here is two
identical chemical formulas,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:16.400
but two different structures.
And so, we all have sigma bonds

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.790
everywhere. So,
we call these isomers.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:26.230
These are called isomers.
But, they are an isomer of a

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:32.690
particular kind.
They both have the same chemical

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:39.150
formula. But,
what we can do is we can look at the

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:45.610
constitutive groups here.
So, what we can do is say,

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:52.070
here we have, here's a CH3. Here's
a CH3, and here's a CH3.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:58.530
And, that leaves this one,
which is a CH, whereas over here,

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:15.460
I've got a CH3, a CH3, and in the
middle, two CH2's.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
These are units.
Some people call them constitutive

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
groups. So, here,
the constitutive groups are

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
different from the constitutive
groups in the linear configuration.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:31.590
And so, these are called
constitutional isomers because they

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:43.190
have identical chemistry but
different constitutive groups or

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:51.590
constituent groups.
And so, we can see this.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:56.790
The other thing that I need to
introduce you to,

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:01.990
OK, so this is the same.
This is just the methyl propane and

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:07.190
the straight chain butane.
Down towards the bottom, there is

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:12.390
something called ethyl.
And, that's a radical. So,

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:17.590
we need to know the radical
terminology. The radical is a

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:22.790
species with one or more unpaired
electrons, with one,

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:40.113
in some cases more, unpaired
electrons.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.500
So, unpaired electrons living in an
orbital, that's a broken bond.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:19.000
So, this is very highly reactive.
It's highly reactive. OK, so this

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.500
is, if you like,
think of it as a broken bond,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:30.000
highly reactive. So, we need to
know these.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And the ones that we need to know,
are these little units that have

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
just been drawing.
These little units,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
so if I take methane,
with four hydrogens, then I break

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
one of the hydrogens off,
and now I have a single electron

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
sitting here, this is capable of
being attached to some other species.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
In this case,
it was attached to the carbon

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
backbone. So,
this radical that comes from methane

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:22.310
is called the methyl radical.
Another way to denote it is with the

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.930
dot up here indicating that there's
an unpaired electron.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.560
Obviously, the unpaired electron is
on the carbon,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.180
but in the nomenclature of organic
chemistry, people are fairly quick

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.800
to make the necessary change.
So, if you see that, no one is

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.430
suggesting that the electrons attach
the hydrogen. It's just shorthand

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:50.060
for it. This one here,
the CH2, the CH2 that we see over in

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.680
the straight chain butane,
this one is called, in this case

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.540
there is hydrogens above and below.
So, there's two unpaired electrons

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.630
here. So, they can then link up
with carbons on either side.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:09.720
So that would be designated as
follows. Or, if you want,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.810
CH2 with two dots. And, this is
called methylene.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.900
This is the methylene radical.
And then, the only other one that I

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:39.200
really care about in the alkanes is
the one that comes from ethane.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:29.610
C2H6 is ethane,
and so the radical from this would

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:34.220
be C2H5. And,
this is called the ethyl radical.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.840
And, we'll come across some
compounds, one that we meet socially

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.460
is ethyl alcohol where we put the
alcohol functional group on the end

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:48.070
of the ethyl. So,
that gives you an introduction to

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:52.690
alkanes. So now,
let's go back and look at the next

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:57.260
column.
That's the alkenes.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.790
So now are going to look at
unsaturated hydrocarbons.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:06.330
And, the first example is the
alkenes. And these are

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:10.860
characterized by sp2 hybridization.
So, that means at least in one

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.390
place it only takes one.
At least in one place in the

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.930
molecule, there's a carbon-carbon
double bond. And that will give you,

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:24.460
if all we have is the one
carbon-carbon double bond,

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:42.720
it will give us the chemical formula
CNH2N.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:34.770
And clearly, N must be greater than
or equal to two.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:40.550
So, the simplest one is C2H4,
which we've seen already when we

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:46.330
talked about sigma and pi bonding.
This is ethylene, and hydrogens

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:52.110
here. We have sp2 hybridization.
So, we have one sigma bond, and one

00:24:52.110 --> 00:25:09.153
pi bond.
So, the carbon and the hydrogens lie

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
in a plane. This is 120¡.
We've seen all of that before.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
The ethylene is the common name for
it, but the name that's regulated by

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry is following this

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
nomenclature. We take the Eth
because C number is two.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:26.660
And, we add -ene.
So, the formal name for this is

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.330
ethene, not ethylene but ethene.
But, you can use either one. No

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.990
one's going to get very agitated
about it. And then for n greater

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.660
than two, the position of the double
bond is not fixed.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.330
The position of the double bond:
not fixed. So,

00:25:45.330 --> 00:26:04.860
we can show examples of that.
Let's look at, here's one, butene.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:55.810
So, C4H8, so, one is to put the
double bond at the very end.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:01.630
So, I have just got one double bond
in it. There's the 120¡ hydrogen,

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:07.450
hydrogen. Now, one, two, three,
four, one, two,

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:13.270
three, four, one,
two, three, four. So,

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:19.090
this is C4H8. And this is called
1-butene because the double bond is

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:24.540
off of the first carbon.
Or, we can put the double bond

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.630
somewhere along the line.
So, we can do this. So, the double

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.720
bond is not at the very end.
So, we have a methyl group at the

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.810
end: one, two,
three, four, one,

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:44.900
two, three, four, so this would then
be called 2-butene,

00:26:44.900 --> 00:27:04.200
indicating that the double bond
comes off of the number two carbon.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:54.570
So, 1-butene and 2-butene turn out
to be constitutional isomers because

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.140
they've got the same chemical
formula. But they have a different

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.710
mix of constituent groups.
So, let's label this as

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:08.280
constitutional.
These are both constitutional

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.850
isomers. But,
we can zoom in a little bit more on

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:17.420
2-butene and be introduced to,
yet, another type of isomer. So,

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:37.373
I'm going to redraw this because
this has been drawn at right angles.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:26.150
It's colloquial.
We know this thing is zigzagging

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.300
and whatnot. So,
I'm going to redraw the 2-butene.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.460
And, so I'll begin by putting the
double bond. And then,

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.610
that means that I have to have 120¡
angles. And, what turns out here is

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.760
that the double bond goes to carbon,
which has a hydrogen on one side.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.920
And on the other side it has a
methyl group. And, the

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.810
same thing here.
So, now I have a choice.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:57.450
What I can do is I can put the
methyl group up here in the hydrogen.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:03.090
All I've done is redraw this.
All I've done is redraw the

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:08.720
2-butene. And,
I think you can see that I can put a

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:14.360
symmetry plane here.
And, what do I have?

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:33.320
I've got both of my methyl groups
above the carbon-carbon double bond.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:24.150
And, both of the hydrogens below the
carbon-carbon double bond.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:28.300
But another way I could have set up
the structure,

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.460
again, there's the carbon-carbon
double bond. Let's put the 120¡

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.610
angles, will put the methyl group
above the carbon-carbon bond on the

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.760
left side, but below the
carbon-carbon bond on the right side.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.920
And then, we'll do the
complementary positioning

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.830
with the hydrogens.
So, in the case on the right,

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.490
which is also a 2-butene, it's also
a 2-butene. But,

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.160
we can see as 3.091'ers,
we look at structure. Structure is

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.830
really important to us,
and we say, OK, same constituent

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.490
groups, but you can tell what the
electron distribution is going to be

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:07.160
different in the one on the left
from the one on the right.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.830
So, you start thinking, well,
what about their properties? Guess

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.490
what, they have different melting
points. They have different boiling

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.160
points. They have different density.
You can see they're going

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.280
to pack differently.
So, all of this,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.850
and yet they have the same chemical
formula. So, we have to distinguish

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.420
these two. They are not differed by
their constitution,

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.990
but they are different by their
spatial layout.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.570
And, the term that we used to talk
about isomers that are different in

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:45.140
their spatial layout,
spatial arrangement, is

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.710
stereoisomers.
They are constitutionally identical,

00:29:49.710 --> 00:30:00.220
but structurally different.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:30:06.420
Identical constitution,
different spatial arrangement.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:11.850
And so, we've got labels on this.
The one on the right, to indicate

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:17.280
that the various groups are on
opposite sides of the double bond,

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:35.326
is called trans.
So, the structure on the right is

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.500
trans-2-butene,
where the one on the left is

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:12.500
cis-2-butene. So,
now, we've met stereo isomers and we

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.500
know what, oh,
there's one other thing.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:22.500
We can have more than one double
bond as well. We can have more than

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.500
one double bond in an alkene,
more than one double bond in an

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:52.120
alkene.
And, we'll meet a few of these as

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.370
well when we talk about polymers.
If we have two, this is called a

00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:00.620
diene, and if we have three it's
called a triene.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.870
And, we'll look at one of these.
So, for example, we could do

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.120
something like this.
Suppose I gave you CH2,

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.370
you don't mind that I'm going to put
the H on the inside.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:17.620
You'll forgive me? I mean,
this is OK, right? So, you know the

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.870
H's are outboard,
but we're just going to go with it,

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.330
C, all right, what else?
CH, yeah, OK, so what are we going

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:30.990
to do with this one?
I'm not going to give you this one

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.660
to name. I just what you see how it
works, and I'll make sure that we

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.330
focus on the chemistry.
But just for the record: one,

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:44.990
two, three, four, five, so it's got
to be something pent-.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.660
And, it's got to be an -ene because
there's at least one

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.410
double bond here.
And, there are two.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:59.240
So, this is going to be a
pentadiene. And furthermore,

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.080
we can say, this is carbon number
one, carbon number two,

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.910
number three, number four,
number five, and the double bonds

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:13.740
issue from carbon number one and
carbon number three.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.580
So, we could call this 1,
-pentadiene. So, now you see how

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.410
all of this works.
And, it's not so bad.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:28.240
Radicals: what happens if we want
to use just a piece of one of these?

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.080
So, the only one that comes up,
well, there's two actually.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.910
One of them comes from ethylene or
ethene. So, I'm going to put the

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:42.740
hydrogens indicate when I don't have
one. So, I'm going to break this

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.580
bond, throw away the hydrogen,
and use this. So, this is the

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:52.370
radical that comes from ethylene.
Well, you might say,

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:57.120
well, why don't we call this,
since it's the formal name, I'm

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.870
going to use the IUPAC name,
ethene. Well, we can't say ethyl

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:06.620
because ethyl is already taken.
Ethyl is the one that's used over

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:11.370
here for C2H5.
So, we need to distinguish this.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.120
And, the name for this radical when
we take ethylene or ethene is called

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.870
vinyl. And, we'll meet this one
because if we want,

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:25.620
we could then stick onto there
reacted with chlorine and then make,

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:30.120
this is vinyl chloride.
And then, later on,

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.370
we'll polymerize this and we'll make
polyvinyl chloride.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.620
So, vinyl is the radical that comes
from the compound ethylene or ethene.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.870
And then, there's one other one
that comes up in the life

00:33:42.870 --> 00:34:01.906
sciences a fair bit.
If we look at propene or propylene,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.500
so it's got to have a three, so, one,
two, three, all right,

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.500
so this is, if I lose one of the
hydrogens here and make this into a

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.500
radical, the radical that comes from
propene can't be propyl because

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:47.500
that's going to be C3H7.
So, here, this will be called allyl.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:52.500
And, as I say,
this comes up sometimes in the life

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.500
sciences. So,
we may find ourselves referring to

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:23.080
that.
So, I'm giving you the direct path,

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:29.240
the short course in organic
nomenclature for our future work on

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:35.410
polymers, and on biochemistry.
The last one, let's look at the

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:41.580
right-hand column,
which is also unsaturated.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:47.740
That's the alkynes. And, these are
characterized by sp hybridization.

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:53.910
So these, then, are going to be
hydrocarbons containing at least one

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:59.270
carbon-carbon triple bond.
This is the capability of

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:03.810
carbon-carbon triple bonding.
And, it has the general formula

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.360
CNH2N minus two,
**CnH(2n-2)** for N greater than or

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.900
equal to two. And,
the main one that comes up that you

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.450
are apt to meet is simply C2H2,
which has the triple bond between

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:35.700
the carbons, and the sp
gives it the 180¡.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:26.830
It's a linear molecule.
And, this, according to the

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:31.660
nomenclature, should be ethyne
because it's one of the alkynes.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:36.490
But you know this molecule as
acetylene, which is used as a fuel

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:41.330
in such things as welding torches.
And obviously, the carbon-carbon

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:46.160
triple bond has enormous energy.
So, that's one example. OK,

00:35:46.160 --> 00:36:04.920
there's a few others.
One is the aromatic hydrocarbons.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:55.830
We need to know those because we're
going to meet those again,

00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:00.660
aromatic hydrocarbons, and the IUPAC
name is arenes.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:05.490
These are arenes.
And, the prototypical one is

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:10.330
benzene, benzene is the main one
that we need to know and its

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:15.160
chemical formula is C6H6,
so it qualifies as a hydrocarbon.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:33.720
And, people were mystified by it
chemical structure.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:26.760
And it was Kekule who proposed the
following structure.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:33.530
He proposed a hexagon of carbons
with hydrogens off the corners,

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:40.300
and then alternating double and
single bonds. So,

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:47.070
double, single, double,
single, double, single. And,

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:53.840
this is the way things lay until the
20th century, when in the light of

00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:00.610
data it became known from spectral
evidence that first of all,

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:06.300
all carbons lie in the same plane.
All carbons lie in the same plane.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.900
You cannot have that if you've got
alternating double and single bonds

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:30.900
because the single bonds are going
to be coming out at something other

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:20.100
than 120¡. And then,
the second thing that mystified

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.690
people was the finding that all
carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:43.346
the same length.
All carbon-carbon bonds are the same

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.500
length. So, if the Kekule structure
is correct, you have this situation

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.500
where the double bond is the same
length as a single bond,

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.500
and that doesn't sit well.
And so, we had to wait until Linus

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:29.500
Pauling, who in 1931,
proposed that in fact there are two

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:34.500
structures. There are two
structures that involve alternating

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.500
between the structure that I've
drawn here, and the complementary

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.500
structure where the double bonds
move to where the single bonds are

00:37:44.500 --> 00:38:09.160
in the existing structure.
So now, we have two of these.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.490
And he said each of these is a
hybrid. Remember,

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:17.830
Pauling was the one who described
hybridization in carbon in the first

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:22.410
place. So, these are hybrids.
But they are hybrids of a different

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:27.240
type. It's a mixing,
and in fact, he proposed that the

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:32.080
structure resonates between the two.
So, these are resonant hybrids.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.910
And, sure enough,
it's been found that the

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.740
carbon-carbon bond length is on the
order of about 1.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:46.580
7 angstroms. The carbon-carbon
double bond is 1.33 angstroms,

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:52.090
generally.
If you look in some of these alkanes,

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:58.290
but in benzene,
the carbon-carbon in benzene was

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:04.490
found to be on the order of about 1.
9 angstroms, which puts it in

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:10.690
between. So, if you take an average,
we've got three double bonds and

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:16.890
three single bonds.
This is consistent with the notion

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:22.280
of bond order 1.5.
And so, today,

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:26.850
what people do to represent benzene
is, rather than drawing these two

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:31.420
structures, or one of them,
and, say, figure out the rest for

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.990
you, it's to use a molecular orbital
representation.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:40.560
Molecular orbital representation is
as follows. We draw the hexagon and

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.140
a circle inside.
So, this indicates the resonant

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:49.710
hybrid that is present in benzene.
And, it's also present in a few

00:39:49.710 --> 00:40:08.686
other aromatics.
And, the other thing is that what

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
happens in terms of electronic
structure. I'm going to try to draw

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
this. My drawing isn't the best,
but you're stuck with me. What I

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
want to do is to try to look at what
happens in terms of the single and

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
double bonds from the standpoint of
formation with the various orbitals

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
involved. And in particular,
I want to look at what happens with

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
the pi orbitals,
so, one, two, three,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
four, five, six.
Well, let's say for argument's sake

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
that the double bond is where I've
drawn it. So,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
this means this is formed by the
combination of a sigma bond and a pi

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
bond. So, the pi bond involves the
smearing of these two pi orbitals.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
So, let's indicate that with a
little bit of fuchsia chalk.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
There is a single bond next door.
Now, there's a double bond. And,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
this double bond involves the
smearing, again,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
of two pi orbitals,
P orbitals, excuse me,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:54.460
to form a pi bond.
And then lastly,

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.380
there's a double bond across the
lower left here.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.300
And so, the pi orbital is formed.
But when we realize that all six of

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:09.220
these bonds are found to be
identical in length,

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:14.150
then everything is brought together
so that we have equal spacing,

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:19.070
at which point the electrons, all
six of these end up smearing,

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:37.140
hence this concept of electron
delocalization.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
In other words,
the electron is no longer confined

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
to alternating pairs of P orbitals.
But rather, it's moving amongst all

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
six. So, this can move through the
entire structure.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And, you can imagine,
if we, then, go back to graphite,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
go back to graphite, then the
electrons can move through the

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
entire solid, which explains the
observed electronic conductivity in

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
graphite. And,
I think I've got a sketch right here

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
to indicate, oh,
that's just a stick-ball model of

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
the stereoisomers.
OK, so there's a diagram from a

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.500
book.
OK, so the artist that worked for

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:49.500
the publisher did a better drawing
than I did. All right,

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.500
I accept that. But you can see the
delocalization of the electrons here.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.500
And, it doesn't just apply to
something like benzene.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.500
It can apply in a straight line.
And, the recipe is for a conjugated

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:10.000
electron system.
And, what they mean by that is

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
alternating between double or triple
and a single. So,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
whenever you have multiple bond,
single bond, you have the

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
possibility of pulling everything in
tight enough that the electrons can

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
move from one multiple bond to the
next multiple bond.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:59.630
So, this is a conjugated structure.
And here's one that's shown, this

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:05.270
is a straight-line molecule.
And this one is a, I just showed

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:10.900
you a multiple bond and an alkene.
So, this is a 1,3-butadiene where

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:16.540
you have double bond,
single bond, double bond,

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:22.180
butadiene, 1, 3, and what can happen
is this can pull in so that we have

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:26.860
a double bond here. So, this two.
This is a double bond.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.590
This is one. Two times two,
two times two plus one, we have this

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:34.330
is essentially five thirds average
bond order through this linear

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:38.060
molecule. And,
that's what you see up here.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.790
So, you can imagine that happening
in other systems where we have

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.530
alternating single bonds,
double bonds, single bonds,

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.260
double bonds, or it could be even
single bonds and triple bonds,

00:43:49.260 --> 00:44:09.186
multiple, single, multiple, single,
pulls everything in.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:58.380
And all of these will be called
resonance hybrids when they allow

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:03.760
the electrons to move as they do.
Last thing is the radical. Last

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.150
thing is the radical.
The radical here, if we take

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:14.530
benzene, and now I'm going to
indicate that this is the one that's

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:19.920
got the missing electron,
OK? So, there's only one electron

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:25.300
in the orbital.
This radical, which is C6H5 is

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:31.160
called phenyl.
So, we could take something like,

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:37.490
let's build two of these. Let's
take, here's ethene.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:43.830
And, I'm going to break one of
these off, and I'm going

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:49.840
to attach it to phenyl.
So, I can either call this vinyl

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:55.530
benzene, or we could call it phenyl
ethene, right?

00:44:55.530 --> 00:45:01.230
I mean, are you benzo-centric?
So, you could say that this is

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:06.920
vinyl attached onto benzene,
or maybe you are etheno-centric and

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:12.610
so you say this is a phenyl attached
onto the thing,

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:18.300
but neither one of these; these are
both correct, by the way,

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:36.200
but we don't use this. This
compound is called styrene.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:27.830
And, what we're going to do later on
his break this double bond.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:31.660
And, we're going to make
polystyrene. So,

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.490
that's styrene. And,
two others that I'd like you to be

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:39.330
familiar with are we can take and
just simply add methyl groups.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:43.160
So, if you take benzene and add one
methyl group, this will be methyl

00:45:43.160 --> 00:46:01.786
benzene or we could
call this toluene.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:52.840
And, there's the last one I'll
introduce you to,

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:58.690
and that's two methyl groups.
So, this is dimethyl benzene,

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:04.530
or it's called xylene. And, this
whole sequence of benzene,

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:10.380
let's just put benzene up here for
completeness, so,

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:16.230
benzene, toluene, xylene.
This BTX is used as additives to

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:22.070
jet engine fuel to improve the
octane number and improve

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:26.930
performance.
So, let's move to that.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:30.810
So, first of all, a little bit
about Kekule. Kekule is an

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.680
interesting person.
He entered the University of

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.550
Giessen to study architecture but
then he switched over to chemistry.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:42.430
And after his Ph.D. he moved to
Britain. He took a job at St.

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:46.300
Bartholomew's Hospital in London.
And, he would fall asleep on the

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.180
bus going back to his flat.
And the story goes that one day he

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:54.060
fell asleep on the bus,
woke up far beyond where he was

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.920
supposed to get off.
And during the course of that bus

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.780
ride, it occurred to him in a dream
that the way to describe the

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.640
structures of some of the carbon
compounds that were known at that

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.490
time, people could characterize them
by their molecular weight.

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:13.350
So, they knew what the structure
was. But nobody,

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:17.210
until that time, had the vision to
suggest that carbon could link to

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:21.070
itself and form a chain.
So, this is where he first proposes

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:24.800
his chains in 1855.
Then he got a job as a faculty

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.400
member at the University of Kent,
went back to continental Europe, and

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:48.866
one night he fell asleep by the
fireplace. And he was dreaming

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:35.600
about the benzene molecule.
This guy really took his work home

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.200
with him. So,
the story goes that he had this

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.800
vision of a snake biting its tail
and spitting in the dream.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.400
And that's where he came up with
the idea of this Kekule structure of

00:47:46.400 --> 00:48:07.000
- remember, he already had the
courage to put carbons in a line.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:53.600
So now, he's going to fold that line
over onto itself.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.200
And so, he's really been considered
the father of structural chemistry.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.800
And so, I try to abstract, just
keep the noise down.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.400
Three more minutes and then you're
gone. So, what's his formula for

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:24.133
success? Well,
he moved into chemistry from another

00:47:48.000 --> 00:48:11.600
field. So, sometimes this cross
fertilization is good.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.200
And the other thing is he is a
dreamer. And,

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.800
I always tell people,
you got to keep dreaming.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.400
When you stop dreaming, you stop
thinking big. But if you're going

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:41.200
to dream, you have
to get some sleep.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:29.710
I know people in this room don't
sleep enough. So,

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:33.420
I'm going to challenge you to get
some sleep. Especially get a little

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.140
bit of sleep on Tuesday night.
I think you will perform better on

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.850
Wednesday if you've had some sleep
on Tuesday night.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:44.570
The last thing I want to talk about
is anti-knocking agents in

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:48.280
automobiles, and also in aircraft.
If we took only straight chain

00:48:48.280 --> 00:49:07.960
alkanes for gasoline,
they would burn very unevenly.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:57.270
Remember, in an internal combustion
engine, you admit fuel as a vapor.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:02.540
You compress, and then you ignite.
But after a number of firings, the

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.810
engine chamber is hot.
And, if the fuel is too reactive,

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:13.080
it will ignite by itself on the
compression cycle.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:18.360
And, you want staged compression.
It has to be done in concert on cue,

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.700
not before its time.
So, this is an unprovoked firing.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.110
It's called knocking. And you'll
hear that sometimes when you

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:29.520
accelerate up a hill.
You'll hear this pinging sound.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.930
Well, this is knocking. So, the
figure of merit was introduced to

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.350
1927 is called the octane number.
So, it has an iso-octane. See,

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:39.760
it's trimethyl pentane.
Well, you know, that's five carbons,

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.170
and the other three carbons to make
octane are sidegroups.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:46.580
And, they're off of the two,
two, and a four. And then, compare

00:49:46.580 --> 00:50:06.093
that to heptane, which
is absolutely abysmal.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:53.140
So, this is 100.
This is zero. And then,

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.280
you'll take whatever your gasoline
is, and you compare it against this

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.420
standard solution.
In this case, it's 90% of the

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.560
trimethyl pentane,
10% heptane. It ends up with octane

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.710
number of 90. Anything else that
performs in the same manner,

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.850
so when you go to the gas pump and
it says octane 89,

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:11.990
or whatever, that's where it's
coming from. And,

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:15.140
you can use additives to increase
octane. In fact,

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.280
what you are trying to do is to
repress ignition.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.420
High-octane fuel burns less well,
but it burns on cue. That's the

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.210
thing.
So, you could add tetraethyl lead,

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:29.640
which was added for years. It's now
banned, or ethyl alcohol.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:34.070
Ethyl alcohol will raise the octane
rating. And, the way to make a mix

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:38.490
of branched and cyclic alkanes is
catalysis. You use a catalyst of

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:42.920
alumina, silica,
450, 550¡C. It's called catalytic

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:47.350
cracking. And so,
by catalysis, we can direct the

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:51.780
synthesis to get the right mix of
the right structures,

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.446
and thereby improve performance.
Good luck on Wednesday.
