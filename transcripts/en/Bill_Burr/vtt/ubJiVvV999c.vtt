00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.370

Happy to be her brother.
Yeah.
Welcome to the podcast.

16
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:54.360
I told you before we started,

17
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:58.860
I made a major fuck up on my last podcast.
Yes,

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.120
I called the band the specials.
The smiths.
Okay.

19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.580
And oh boy.
I know that is not good at all.

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.020
And I was going on and on about how much I love this set and all that and I

21
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.320
fucked up and I want to apologize to everybody in the,

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.660
actually met the lead singer of the band and the guitarist and the lead singer

23
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:20.360
of the band,
uh,
said,
uh,
he real quick,
it was just like,
all right,

24
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.550
I love the way you say the word cat.
You say it right in.
I was just,

25
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.650
it was like the greatest compliment ever.
Absolutely.

26
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.760
It's like when my buddy Joe de Rosa was in Scotland in a bar at like four in the

27
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.480
morning,
and some Scottish guy said too,
it was like,
Joe,
you can fucking drink.

28
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.510
And he's just like,
it was like the greatest compliment ever.

29
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.500
So I've got to apologize to them.
Okay.
It's,
it's,

30
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.180
it's my fault.
The fucking music I listened to in the eighties you know,

31
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:49.740
I was in the fucking metal and all these skater guys and everything up the

32
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:54.040
street.
My brother hung out with a w stopped her medicine all around bar.

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.190
I'm like,
these guys aren't singing about the devil.

34
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
They're not wearing women's clothes.
I'm not listening to these guys.

35
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:04.680
I mean I always,
you know,
I was very,
I was closed off back then,
you know,
so,

36
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.400
um,
you know,
so you saw it,
you saw when I,

37
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:09.860
I've been taking lessons with you for about one a year and a half or so.

38
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.820
Then you come in and longer than that man.
Yeah,

39
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.290
we used to write is it felt like 10 for you

40
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.400
going in there.
I came in there like the crypt keeper,
like I'll fucking

41
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.790
crunched over and shit,
holding the sticks,
wrong
forums,

42
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.750
everything all jacked up and I got to tell you like,
um,
on here,

43
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.470
besides the fact that you're a good friend of mine,

44
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.530
you're on here because you have a new,
uh,

45
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.480
a new drum instructional video route called getting out of your own way.
True.

46
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.020
Which I actually got to watch a lot of,
uh,

47
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.340
last night and it's all this stuff,
you know,
that you've been teaching me,

48
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:51.960
which was I was basically fighting the kit and yourself.

49
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.650
Yeah.
I was like,
yeah,
it was all crunched over holding the sticks wrong.

50
00:02:55.651 --> 00:03:00.100
I was just playing uphill.
Yes.
Nothing was at the right level.
And uh,

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.770
for the drummers out there who listened to this podcast,

52
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.690
I cannot tell you like this stuff that you showed me just getting me to sit up

53
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:11.320
straight,
hold the sticks right and have shit where I can hit it,

54
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.570
do to my body type.
Yeah.

55
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.800
It's made so much stuff that used to be really difficult,

56
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.400
like borderline effortless now however,

57
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.650
I still suck because at the end of the day,

58
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.690
no matter how much you teach me to sit up straight,

59
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.500
I am still a at the mercy of the talents that I was blessed with.
But I'm,

60
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.250
but I'm still,
you know yeah.
But it's a whole different ball game.

61
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.390
The one I first saw you man.
I mean cause you work your ass off too.

62
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.600
You know it's like I can show you show people how to do things but at the don't

63
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:43.930
put in the work,
nothing's going to change.
You know,
you work your ass off.

64
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.140
So I'm a lunatic Dave.
Yeah,
I know.
I get into shit.

65
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.290
That's my point.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

66
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.980
That's why I always stayed away from hard drugs because I would have like,

67
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.970
I'd have like a fucking monogram coke spoon.
I would just be,

68
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:02.560
I would be a coke heads coke head.
I know if I did it.
So I try to,

69
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.690
I try to send it into a positive areas.

70
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.270
So a,
it's a good plan.
Well,
look,
I gotta ask you,

71
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:13.090
I don't know if I've ever even talked to this talk to you about this,

72
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:17.590
where it's just like,
see,
you grew up in northern California.
You said,

73
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.900
hell of this.
Hello Dad.
I'm sure.
Right?
Yes.

74
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.350
I got made fun of a lot when I moved to La Sacramento Kings Fan.
Maybe

75
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.920
I did see the sharks a bit,
uh,
for hockey when I was a fuck,
I just realized I,

76
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.000
this fucking leather chair,

77
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:33.580
if this is going to make a bunch of noise when I'm moving around like that Benny

78
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.220
Hill sketch,
you'll see that one where he wanted the leather pants,

79
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.550
one of the great sketches.
No,
every time he had to deliver a line,

80
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:43.120
he would walk across the room and it was just the sign of his leather pants and

81
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:46.030
he was sitting down crossing his legs and then the other person would talk

82
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.600
fucking genius.
I'll have to check it out.
Um,
anyways.
Um,

83
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.350
so when you start,
what made you like want to play drums?

84
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:57.520
Like what got you started is what band?
Oh,
what band?
You know,

85
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.690
I don't know if there was a,

86
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.050
I mean I had a friend who was taking drum lessons and I like slept over at his

87
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:05.890
house.
I was like nine or something.
And he's like,

88
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.100
oh my drum teachers coming over to give me a lesson.
And I was like,
oh,

89
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.310
hang out and watch.
And then I was like,
oh,
this seems fun.

90
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.380
And then I sat down and I could just kind of do it.

91
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.370
Like it was like he had that gift.
Yeah.
It was like,
oh dude,

92
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.710
I can kind of do this.
And uh,
I'd never really had that experience before,

93
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:24.400
so I just immediately got hooked.
Uh,

94
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.500
and so I was like nine or 10.

95
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:31.450
So this is like 93 94.
Right.
So this is like God,

96
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:35.670
I'm old when I was 25 and 26.
Yeah,

97
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.710
that's crazy.
Yeah.
But this is like old dude.

98
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.630
But remember when we were setting each other youtube clips about uh,
uh,

99
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.670
um,
I sent you that faith,
no more clip and you sent me the was a skid row.

100
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.360
Is that what it was?
I don't remember.
Probably skewed.
I love skid row.

101
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.600
It was that,
it was like SNL performances and it was like,
oh my God,

102
00:05:55.601 --> 00:06:00.601
skid row on fucking SNL and it was like the same year and it was like check out

103
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.830
the,

104
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.830
we were talking about the shift in music like right around 91 92 I think it was.

105
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.630
And it was like how like right when grunge and all this stuff was coming out and

106
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:14.150
it was just like hair metal to grunge was just like,
you were like,

107
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.240
what the fuck is it was it was abrupt?
Yes.

108
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.560
It was like a how a lot of divorces go down in la where there's like the day

109
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:25.930
after the prenup expires,
Bam,
divorce papers.
Like,

110
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.040
that's the way the musical shift was.
But like as a kid,
I was,

111
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.940
I at that point like,
uh,
what year was that?
When,
when,
when,

112
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.990
I think it was 91.
[inaudible] 92.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's good roll album.

113
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:43.440
I fucking love that out.
Right.
And they were crushing.
Crushing,
yes.

114
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.240
And I was like,
Sebastian voice was just like,
just one of the great front men.

115
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.570
Yes,
absolutely.
Of all time.
And I had,

116
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.720
I didn't see that shift in music coming.

117
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.770
I think away way a lot of those bands didn't where I,

118
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.310
cause I remember when Nirvana came out,
I was like,
what the fuck is this?

119
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.780
And I couldn't really even hear how good a band they were or that first video

120
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.320
they had the teen spirit when he was like doing like,
uh,
uh,

121
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.500
basic solo and he was kind of acting like he was doing the tap on Solo and was

122
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:16.490
clearly making fun of all the guys that I like.
Totally.
I was like,
dude,

123
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:19.040
fuck these guys,
fuck this band.

124
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.240
And it wasn't until I saw them on unplugged and I got in Utero and everything.

125
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:30.050
And I was just like,
wow,
these guys are making like,
this is a beautiful album.

126
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.310
And I,
and it took me,
but it took me like two and a half years of,
of being like,

127
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:36.290
wait a minute.
The 80s or over?
Yeah,

128
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:41.060
because I'm old now because you have that shit juxtaposed right next to each

129
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:45.380
other and you're growing from spandex and lipstick and straightened hair to like

130
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.490
flannel shirts.
And the Glam thing was only about three years.
Okay.

131
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.880
It was right around 85,
86 everybody got there,

132
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.710
started dressing like men again around 87 88 they had a round table meeting and

133
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.410
we're like,
look,
stop blowing up the hair.
Let's go back to,

134
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.940
let's try to get a little more almond brothers here and a little less,
uh,
grease,

135
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:07.250
whatever the fuck they were doing.
But so yeah,

136
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.510
so that was the scene I was growing up and when I started playing was what we're

137
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.410
talking about right now.
So you missed all,
all this shit.
You would just,
you know,

138
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:16.850
10 years old.
I mean,
I mean,

139
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:21.290
I definitely listened to a Shitload of Phil Collins when I was like a little

140
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:25.290
Katie's Phil Collins or row,
like the later stuff that everyone makes fun of.

141
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.450
Well,
Sassoon audio.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
yeah.

142
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.610
I wasn't like listening to that song specifically,
but like to share about that

143
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.910
a little bearded 10 year old days dancing around sue sue,

144
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.280
sue audio.
I did come out of the womb with a beard by the way.
Oh you did?
Yeah.

145
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:46.520
Just always been Harry.
Yeah,
that's what it is.
That's why he went to the drums.

146
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:50.600
You were fucking animal.
That's true.
I've heard that more than once.
Um,
did you,

147
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.100
uh,
so then when,
when,
when you,
uh,
when all that grunge stuff came out,

148
00:08:56.101 --> 00:09:00.540
yeah.
Was that just sort of music to you as opposed to no,
no.
Like being like,
oh,

149
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.360
this is a,
you weren't old enough to realize like,
wow,

150
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.250
we just went from this to that now.

151
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.970
<v 1>Not at all.
That's what I'm saying is like,
because that happened.</v>

152
00:09:09.971 --> 00:09:12.820
I remember listening to sir,
it's actually funny like saying this,

153
00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:15.640
like I listened to so much Phil Collins,

154
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.130
but I would hear like new wave stuff or,

155
00:09:18.131 --> 00:09:20.860
or 80 stuff like tears for fears and be like,
oh,
gross.

156
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.350
And now I love law of that stuff.
Right.
Um,

157
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.030
but at the time it was like the least cool shit ever,
you know?

158
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.190
So I went back to the eighties a bunch of times going,
Oh wow,

159
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:32.320
this man was actually pretty good.
Yeah.
Yeah.

160
00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:37.150
And it's in a lot of that stuff is so interesting and esoteric and weird ways

161
00:09:37.151 --> 00:09:39.820
that you check it out now.
And some of it's aged poorly,

162
00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:41.920
but some of it's aged in like a really cool way.

163
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.770
<v 0>Yeah.
I didn't like a lot of just the sound.
Yeah.</v>

164
00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:48.370
Shit that came out in the 80s whatever that sound was.

165
00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:52.090
I saw somebody sent me a video,
you know,
about how they came up with that,

166
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.140
that sound for the drums,
right.

167
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.960
That was the Phil Collins [inaudible] sent me.
Yeah.

168
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:01.780
That was just a complete accident where there was a Mike on in this studio and

169
00:10:01.781 --> 00:10:04.800
somebody played a Phil.
Yeah.
And it was,
it was,

170
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.460
it was in the control room or something.

171
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.950
<v 1>Yeah.
Phil Collins was apparently the,
there's various stories,</v>

172
00:10:09.951 --> 00:10:13.580
but apparently Phil Collins was playing drums on a one to Peter Gabriel's solo

173
00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:14.990
albums.
Um,

174
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.080
and he was trying out fills or whatever and someone hit the talkback Mike.

175
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.980
Uh,
so if you,
you know,
for people who haven't recorded in a recording studio,

176
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.120
when you're in the control room,
you hit the talkback Mike and they,

177
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.350
you can then hear what the person's saying,
uh,

178
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.450
or if you're in the studio tracking drums,

179
00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:37.610
you can't hear what anyone's saying and the control room,

180
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.210
so they have to hit a talk back mic,
a button so you can hear what's going on.

181
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.660
And basically they went to talk to Phil and they hit the talk back Mike and he

182
00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:49.750
played a drum fill over that and the,
the,

183
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.630
the talkback Mike picked it up and just got super blown out and they were like,

184
00:10:53.631 --> 00:10:57.440
whoa,
that was crazy.
It was like a complete accident.
And that's how that gated,

185
00:10:57.441 --> 00:11:01.490
like Peter Gabriel was like,
I like that sound.
Yeah.
And then,

186
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.410
<v 0>which is probably,
I imagine a cool sound initially.
And then it,</v>

187
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.800
<v 1>it was just overused and then,
and that's how everything happens now.</v>

188
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:13.110
It's totally like in vogue again,
like everyone,

189
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.830
I mean it's sort of starting to get overused now,

190
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.550
but it just went through a whole thing over the past five years where that was

191
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:24.110
super hip again.
Let's go on in my business right now where they just,
they,

192
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.630
I don't know what they just rebooting everything that I already watched that

193
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.820
<v 0>going there,
pointing through imdv to be like,
is this guy still alive?</v>

194
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.240
Do you think he wants to do a WHO's the boss again?

195
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.700
And fucking [inaudible] who's the blog?

196
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:39.460
So I'm trying to think of something more obscure than that.
Um,
she's the sheriff,

197
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.470
is that a show?

198
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.350
That was a show and the only reason why I know that is because a friend of mine

199
00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:47.560
was on it for a couple episodes and he said it one night and it was just like,

200
00:11:47.561 --> 00:11:51.670
dude,
that's one of the great fucking references.
I don't even know what that is.

201
00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:55.400
That was a,
uh,
that beautiful woman who was on,
um,

202
00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.780
Suzanne Somers.
Mm.
Um,
she started it and evidently she was a sheriff.

203
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.710
She's the sheriff and she was just this hottie who was the sheriff.

204
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:10.690
Everybody had to listen to what she did it,
you know,

205
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.810
I think it was for like people who are into like dominatrix and like women tell

206
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.630
them that piece of shit and they're under arrest.
It was sort of something,

207
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.890
there was an underlying sexual thing to everything that was done back then.

208
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.840
You know,
you can't do any of that now.
Now she'd be a fucking hero,
you know,

209
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.620
whatever the fuck I would have or that,
you know,

210
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.660
the pendulums completely swung the other way now.

211
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.600
So every guy's a fucking ticket,
his dick out and peeing on a plant,

212
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.450
blocking a door.
And women are all like,
fucking Joan of arc.
Um,

213
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.800
there's no middle ground.
There's no middle ground.
That's what it is.

214
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:42.100
We're going to go from not listening to women to not vetting any of them and

215
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:45.260
then saying every fucking guy's a complete piece of shit through some of the

216
00:12:45.261 --> 00:12:47.730
shit that's coming.
Like some of these guys got friends of mine now.

217
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.710
It's like literally ex-girlfriend's who are mad that they're famous now.

218
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.410
Totally just coming out,
going like,
oh,

219
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.020
<v 1>lives get ruined.
They're like,
man,
I don't like you anymore,</v>

220
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:56.950
so I'm going to ruin your day.

221
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.590
<v 0>I mean,
well,
the fact that this,
if you're,
if there's gonna be no due process,</v>

222
00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:05.460
I mean,
who is safe?
Yeah,
no one.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

223
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.610
Was emotionally abusive and say,
I've gotta,

224
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.430
I've gotta emotionally abused and like at least 85% of my relationships.

225
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.850
I spent the last fucking week of my own fucking house on eggshells.

226
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.490
We'll back in a good place.
But it's just constantly,
you know,

227
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.150
th th th emotional abuse,
I mean,
women have the fucking market cornered on that.

228
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.520
This is,
this is a different podcast.
So anyways,
that's a different topic.

229
00:13:29.521 --> 00:13:33.550
So you're,
you're,
uh,
you're,
you're,
you're,
um,
uh,

230
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.730
instructional videos on how you put it out.
First of all,
you know,
you're,

231
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.950
you're already ahead of 90% of people.
Just by the way it looks,

232
00:13:40.951 --> 00:13:44.550
the quality of the way it's shot because so much of it is just somebody,

233
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.190
you know,
literally wearing a Gopro,

234
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.400
staring into a mirror while they played drums that you supposed to try to

235
00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:51.570
fucking learn something out of that.

236
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.080
<v 1>That's,
well,
that's exactly why I made this thing.
I mean,</v>

237
00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:58.430
I've been teaching for like 20 years and I work with,

238
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.190
you know,
a lot of pros,
a lot of my contemporaries,

239
00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:05.820
a lot of big name dudes who are out in the real world touring with big bands.
Um,

240
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.800
in addition to me touring and recording and,
um,
I never,
you know,

241
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.630
I always wanted to do an instructional thing,

242
00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:16.340
but with the way technology's evolved with Instagram and youtube and everything,

243
00:14:16.341 --> 00:14:20.540
like everyone's a quote unquote teacher now.
Yeah.
So,

244
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:21.980
um,

245
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.180
<v 0>by the way,
there's,
so there's this inside thing that I always see something,</v>

246
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.500
I think it's fucking amazing,

247
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.370
a drum thing and then I send it to you and you just like,
eh.

248
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.080
You know what that reminds me of is when,
you know,

249
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.470
it's when people come up to me and then they just pick like some,

250
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.690
somebody super popular at the moment,

251
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:43.300
like what do you think is so and so that person is really funny,
honey.

252
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.680
You got to be like,
yeah,
I mean they're up there.
They're,

253
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.260
yeah,
they're on stage doing things.
Yeah.

254
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:54.590
They're saying things that people are really reacting with.
Laughter.

255
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.940
You just have to say straight up facts.
Yeah.
I know what I do.
I just like,

256
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.720
I would never take down another comment publicly,

257
00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:07.721
but on the phone with my friends or which is we fucking eviscerate so many

258
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:11.720
people and then eventually it comes around to us and then we just start trashing

259
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:14.900
each other and just laughing our ass off.
And then the end,
everyone we trashed,

260
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:17.660
we just go,
Hey God bless them.
Bless them.
They're out there.

261
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.000
That's what it's all about.
I do that same shit too.

262
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:23.420
I have text threads with friends of mine where we do with the same same thing

263
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.770
and were just as brutal and work to each other and towards cells.

264
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:27.861
Yet how many jokes,

265
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:30.740
like back in the day when I was working the comedy cellar in New York,

266
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:32.300
how many jokes I lost,

267
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.750
how many shirts I could never wear again and all of this cause we sit,

268
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.470
just sit there and like the guys used to go down and they would watch you on

269
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:42.740
stage and they would be staring at you with like,

270
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.270
it would be Patrice breast is soul.
Oh Man.
A Foss Norton.

271
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:50.210
And they would just stand in there in the doorway.

272
00:15:50.211 --> 00:15:53.330
We could see none of the crowd could see him and you had to like totally commit

273
00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:55.700
to your fucking act.
Wow.
And uh,

274
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.880
I remember Kevin Harmony first fucking came down and he's like 20 years old and

275
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:01.910
they were doing that to him.
And I remember he didn't get rattled.

276
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:04.650
He did a little bit and then the first time and then he didn't have to,

277
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.960
once he didn't get rattled.
And I remember thinking like,
wow man,
this kid is a,

278
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.530
he's got the force.
Wow.
Yeah.
Because I was sitting there,

279
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:15.410
those guys were all my contemporaries.
Sure.
We would like 10,

280
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:18.830
15 years older than Kevin [inaudible] and these guys are my contemporaries and I

281
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:20.930
could find,
I was like,
Oh God,
they're going to stare at me.

282
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.250
And then you almost felt like he deliberately had to say something to bomb or

283
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:28.400
some shit like that.
So I don't know.
Do you guys ever do stuff like,
uh,

284
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.370
do you ever watch to go out and see,
see if like for a comedian to watch a,
uh,

285
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:37.220
a friend of yours bomb?
If not,
if it's like,
if the set means something,

286
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:39.560
but they just stopped it and they try a joke and they just eat shit.

287
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:40.900
It's one of the funniest things ever do.

288
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.720
Like when you watch a friend of yours play drums that go for a fill or
something,

289
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:47.570
if they eat shit on it.
Yeah,
it's totally different.

290
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.480
Just just by the nature of what you're doing.

291
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:53.960
So much of it is just throwing shit against the wall and seeing what sticks.

292
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:56.220
And just being like,
Hey,
I fucking try it like that.

293
00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.140
I love Comedians and I respect Canadians so much because,
you know,

294
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:03.410
I'll go around town and see you or other girls just go out one night and go to

295
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:07.490
the comedy store or something and someone will walk up on stage with a slip.

296
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:10.400
I've seen you do this and a bunch of other people like,
oh yeah,
just like,
Oh,

297
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:13.470
I'm just working some shit out.
Oh yeah.
You know,
like subjects like Ah,

298
00:17:13.471 --> 00:17:15.650
that didn't fucking work.
You know,
and,
and like that,

299
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:16.820
you can't do that with music.

300
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.510
Like people are there to see a show and it something,

301
00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:24.380
it's like you want to,
what about,
what about the,
uh,

302
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:27.350
the jam section?
Isn't that what you guys call it?

303
00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:31.310
When you look at each other then you just wait and like there are,

304
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.320
there are like this,
there aren't a different musical situations.

305
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.670
There's some bands go out and like we're planning exactly like the record.
Sure.

306
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.220
And then there's other people,
like if we play it like the record one more time,

307
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:42.920
I'm going to blow my brains out.
Can we?
Absolutely.

308
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:44.160
And there's certain something else,

309
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.410
there's situations where you can jam and improvise and uh,
you know,

310
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:50.160
like I would do that

311
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.480
<v 1>with the Mars Volta or like,</v>

312
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.750
or like anti master be certain sections where we just go away out into outer

313
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:59.740
space for half an hour.
What was that like when,
when you got that Gig and,

314
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.120
and you had to follow it was crazy.

315
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.670
All of those amazing drummers that were in the band,

316
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:09.660
all the shit that they came up with engine,
you have some except ridiculously,
uh,

317
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.400
a short amount of time to have to learn it and all that.
Um,

318
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.670
basically,
uh,

319
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.410
I got the call to do it and um,

320
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.930
and Juan,
the bass player who,

321
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:28.320
who used to play bass in racer x,
by the way,

322
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.820
for the last I heard of the band.
I don't know who they are.
Okay.

323
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.020
I'm sure I'll fuck up their name on the next podcast.

324
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.810
We'll talk about eighties and SPANDEX and feathered hair.

325
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.910
They're pretty deep into that scene.
But yeah,

326
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.940
so [inaudible] one came over to my studio with a fellow based player.

327
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.370
This Guy Jonathan [inaudible],
really good buddy of mine.
Now.

328
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.390
And John came over just to watch me like so,

329
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.300
so Juan came over and like we plugged in my iPod and he's like,

330
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.130
do you know this song?
You know?
And I'm like,
I don't know.

331
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.370
I'd never played along to this stuff.
I just kind of like the first record.

332
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:02.820
So one's playing with me and John's just sitting there like two feet in front of

333
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:07.710
me just staring at me,
watching me like,
and then Jesus Christ.

334
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:11.430
Yeah,
I know it's stressful and a,
and I never played the music.
I was just like,

335
00:19:11.431 --> 00:19:15.310
I kind of know this thing or you know,
just from being a fan of that crap.

336
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.610
Did you do before then?
Nothing.
It was like,
Hey,
I'm lying.

337
00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:21.300
I'm in line at Starbucks when he called me and then I had to go to a recording

338
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:22.650
session all day and then I was like,

339
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:26.880
I can meet you after I'm done with this session at night.
And then he was like,

340
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:28.230
okay.
And like that,
you know what I mean?

341
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:31.350
How bad did you need that Mars Volta Gig at that point in your career?

342
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:34.470
Was that something like it was huge.
Yeah.
It really put me on the map.

343
00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:38.760
I mean because of the lineage of dudes that were in that band and how like the

344
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:42.840
reputation that band has.
Um,
I mean I,
I'd done things before that,

345
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:47.220
but nothing of that level,
you know,
so,
um,
it was huge.

346
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.930
So I had about two weeks,
you know,

347
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.340
to learn the music and it was a two and a half hour set.
Uh,
you know.

348
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.410
Yeah.
And so what do you,
what did you do?
Shut it out.
Yeah.
Charted everything out.

349
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.750
Um,
how long does it take you to and when,

350
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:05.520
when like how true to the original thing John Theodosia.
Well,
yeah.
Well I'd love,

351
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.630
I'd love John's playing.

352
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.600
I think he's amazing and I think his parts are incredible.

353
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:11.580
I think that first record is really a masterpiece.

354
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.790
So I wanted to do everything that I could in the time that I had to play

355
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:17.760
everything.
Note for note,
cause I think that's really important with that.

356
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.560
It's like,
it's like what situation you're talking about earlier.

357
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:24.561
Like people go to see those songs off that first record and they want it exactly

358
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.780
right.
Like I would want to see that.

359
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.980
So I went out of my way to get everything totally note for note,
which you know,

360
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.980
was easier and more difficult in some certain circumstances.
But um,

361
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.800
there were other,
you know,
other songs where it wasn't really important as much.

362
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.730
Um,
so two and a half weeks to get it together and that and,
and like how,

363
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.260
how often will you jamming with the band?

364
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:51.550
I didn't meet the band until I got to Amsterdam and then we,
I mean me and Omar,

365
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:55.320
the guitar player in one,
like got the three of us jammed a little bit.
Uh,

366
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.660
I went down to Mexico and the three of us played through the arrangements and it

367
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:01.660
was like,
he was like,
yeah,
this is,
Omar was like,
this is fine.
Like you're fine.

368
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.580
But then I went to Amsterdam.
How much of a relief was it to hear that?
Well,
we,

369
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.590
we rehearsed everything without vocals,

370
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.580
which is difficult cause I use vocals to like sort of know where I am in the

371
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:13.414
song a lot.

372
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.850
<v 0>Oh yeah,
I've made that mistake.
I've done that.</v>

373
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.260
So he was like,

374
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.680
<v 1>dude,
you want to,
you know,
you don't even need to be here.
This is fine.</v>

375
00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:25.710
It's all good.
And I was like,
okay great,
but you're still like freaking out,

376
00:21:25.711 --> 00:21:29.910
you know.
So,
uh,
I get to Amsterdam,
meet the rest of the band,

377
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.210
then we run through the set.
And this is kind of funny cause I,

378
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.030
I wrote out all my charts and I put an extra floor,

379
00:21:36.031 --> 00:21:38.490
Tom on my left and like a crash cymbal on my left,

380
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.850
like to the left of the high hat and I just put my charts on the floor,
Tom,

381
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.370
like hoping like no one would see,
you know.
Right.

382
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.070
And I get up halfway through and to go to the bathroom and I came back,

383
00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:51.840
it was all calling.
Oh somebody took it.
Yeah.
And I like look over it one,
he like,

384
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.330
dude,
you don't need that shit.
You're good.
And I was like,
okay.

385
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.860
And then everything was fine.

386
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.210
<v 0>We ran through the ran to the two and a half hours because there's a lot of</v>

387
00:21:59.211 --> 00:22:03.260
visual cues I was going to sink.
But if,
if they like that,
yeah.

388
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.570
If they,
if you went there and they weren't,

389
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.630
well during the first rehearsal wanting it,
note for note,

390
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.120
that must have been something a little bit easier where it's like,
okay,

391
00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:14.870
these guys aren't going to be like Nazis about this and this.

392
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.520
This can be room for me to kind of,

393
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.390
<v 1>yeah.
Pulled based on the situation based on sort of where they were coming.</v>

394
00:22:20.391 --> 00:22:25.310
The situation they were coming out of there were so like exhausted.

395
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.660
Um,
so they were just like,
you know,
this is,

396
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.470
this sounds like they were basically like,
we sound like a band again.

397
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.810
This sounds like a record.
Oh,
cool.
Which is great

398
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.350
<v 0>because I did that first gig.
Yeah.
What was the,
uh,
that was,
um,</v>

399
00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.220
it was in Oslo.
Um,
I love that though,

400
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.250
that those people are great comedy fence.
Oh my God.

401
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.960
I have some of my fucking lunatic.

402
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.450
Some of my all time best friends are from are from Oslo.
So many of them.
Uh,

403
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.340
and so many amazing musicians from there.
It's insane.

404
00:22:55.341 --> 00:22:58.370
My first really good show I ever had in Europe was in Oslo.
Really?

405
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.370
I don't know if it was them or I just finally was just like,

406
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.470
just cause I was too much in my head.

407
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.960
[inaudible] and other places like I'm in a different country.

408
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.620
Are they going to get this right?
I'm talking about shirts.
Do they have shirts?

409
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.020
Yes they do.
They are wearing shirts.
Oh Shit.

410
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:17.000
My timing is completely up and I was so fucking fed up with mediocre sets.

411
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.310
I think that when I was in Oslo I just didn't give a fuck.

412
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.280
And then they were also like picked up on it.
No,

413
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:27.600
they will kind of maniacs where they would like drinking and shit.
Just like,
ah,

414
00:23:27.601 --> 00:23:29.810
these are the kinds of people I hang out.
And then it just Kinda,

415
00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.320
I felt comfortable and uh,

416
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.110
and then the rest of the tour and then I went into Stockholm and I'll let,

417
00:23:36.111 --> 00:23:38.810
and just everything else I've just sort of fell into place.
It's like,
Oh,

418
00:23:38.811 --> 00:23:42.920
just act like you're here,
which are in Oslo.
No,
no,
no.

419
00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:45.710
Act like I'm in America.
Oh gotcha.
Oh gotcha.

420
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.510
Cause then even if they don't get it,

421
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:49.490
you get to play the arrogant American and you're like,

422
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.320
oh you should know everything about my country.

423
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:53.000
And I showed no nothing about yours.

424
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.580
And they almost want you to say that cause you,

425
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:57.440
you feed into their stereotype of like,

426
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.490
yes they are self-involved cunts and we're better than they are and they love
it.

427
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.320
Um,
I jump around a lot.

428
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:09.000
<v 1>No,
that's okay.
I get it.
It's not like I've never listened to this before.
Yeah.</v>

429
00:24:09.001 --> 00:24:13.590
It's a shit show.
So yes.
So that first show,

430
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.640
um,
yeah man,
I was insanely nervous.
Um,

431
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.260
but it went fine.
And then as soon as I was like halfway through the show,

432
00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:24.480
I remember I was like,
yeah,
I'm feeling good luck.

433
00:24:24.481 --> 00:24:27.330
I'm going to try and like put on a little bit of a show here.
Like visually.

434
00:24:27.331 --> 00:24:29.010
Right.
Cause that's always very important to me.

435
00:24:29.011 --> 00:24:32.970
Like there's nothing more boring than seeing someone just up there just like

436
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.590
looking like they're doing their taxes.

437
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.460
<v 0>That's me.
That's how I look.
Not Anymore.</v>

438
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.840
A little bit better,
Dude.
Holy Shit.
Oh,

439
00:24:41.841 --> 00:24:44.370
we gotta talk about videotaping yourself while playing drums,

440
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:49.050
which you made me do.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
My self esteem has never been lower.

441
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:54.270
I've never looked worse doing anything ever.
Even my early standup tapes,

442
00:24:54.271 --> 00:24:58.750
which I have on Vhs,
which I can't even watch.
I don't look as bad.
Yeah.

443
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.650
<v 1>Word slouching.
You know,
like,
but you won't,
so you don't slide this,
you know,</v>

444
00:25:02.651 --> 00:25:05.320
you don't slouch when you,
when you walk around and when you,

445
00:25:05.321 --> 00:25:07.090
when you do stand up,

446
00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.050
<v 0>it's when you sit down that you slapped.
Actually,
you know something.
What I,</v>

447
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.450
my posture is my posture.
I've,
I've learned from my shoulder being fucked up.

448
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.020
Yeah.
Is,
um,

449
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.460
all my weight is on my knees and I've noticed a lot of people do this.

450
00:25:20.461 --> 00:25:24.840
When they stand up,
they actually,
their,
their um,

451
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.310
their hips are forward and you're sort of leaning back like standing like this

452
00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:30.480
and what you're actually supposed to do.

453
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.650
You like to stand up totally straight like this.
Okay.

454
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.950
I feel like I'm puffing my chest out acting like you want to fucking fight.
Yes.

455
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:44.070
Especially coming from where I grew up in such an angry crazy state is outside

456
00:25:45.271 --> 00:25:47.340
of Boston.
Forget about Boston itself.

457
00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:49.560
I was in the suburbs and that shit was fucking nuts.

458
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.520
Stand up straight and then your knees are just slightly bent and your arms are

459
00:25:53.521 --> 00:25:57.500
just hanging down and your shoulders are a little,
you know,
uh,

460
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.970
feel like they're back.
But they're not that just blind.

461
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.670
This is what I have to like learn how to do.

462
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.920
<v 1>But there's,
this is exactly what I've said to you and what I say to everyone,</v>

463
00:26:05.921 --> 00:26:09.910
especially all these big,
big name working pros is it's like if you're slouching,

464
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:15.540
that's your sort of normal goto setting and you think that that's you sitting up

465
00:26:15.671 --> 00:26:19.570
straight.
Right?
So that when you sit up straight or stand up straight,

466
00:26:19.571 --> 00:26:21.520
it feels like you're puffing your chest out.

467
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.480
Cause I thought cognitive disconnect.
So you have to rewire everything.

468
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.450
So it's much more accurate.
So that's,
that's the thing,

469
00:26:28.451 --> 00:26:31.510
when I work on all this technique,
body mechanics stuff with people,

470
00:26:31.511 --> 00:26:35.830
like that's why I tell them to videotape themselves because you can't tell what

471
00:26:35.831 --> 00:26:39.970
you actually look like.
It's brutal.
It's brutal for everyone.

472
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.980
It's brutal for everyone,
including me.
It's never,
it never gets easier.

473
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.510
<v 0>So when something,
I started to talk about it.
So when you were,</v>

474
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:49.080
you started playing drums and everything,

475
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:53.640
I imagine you just sat down and grabbed the sticks the way any other kid would

476
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:57.570
have.
Like when did you start to break down what you were doing?

477
00:26:57.571 --> 00:27:01.710
Did you get hurt or did you just see a video of some guy where he made it look

478
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:02.544
effortless?

479
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.110
<v 1>Good question.
Uh,</v>

480
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.270
I think when I started getting really serious when I was like 14 or 15,

481
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.650
it was a matter of me just constantly going,

482
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.430
how lazy can I possibly be?

483
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:21.490
Like how can I play all this stuff I want to play and just be is like,

484
00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.520
how,
like how,
how can I continually just make this easier on myself?

485
00:27:25.521 --> 00:27:28.340
Like why would I do this if I could just do that instead?

486
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.600
Why do you think he thought that?
I don't know.
Uh,
maybe I'm just lazy.

487
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.750
No,
I was going to say that,
but you're not,
you're,
you're a driven guy.
Sure.

488
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:40.040
I think I've just became obsessed with like efficiency.
Um,

489
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.890
not like for the sake of it in and of itself,

490
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:48.130
but to be like I can play in more or say more or do more of the more efficient I

491
00:27:48.711 --> 00:27:53.000
am,
there's more I can do.
It's more I can say the more you can emote that way.

492
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.020
Maybe it comes from,
you know,
my dad collects cars.

493
00:27:57.021 --> 00:28:01.400
Maybe it comes from growing up in that culture of like talking about,
you know,

494
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.340
how you know,
a difference between like a Hemi and a wedge.
Right.
You know,

495
00:28:04.341 --> 00:28:08.630
like the difference having dual spark plugs versus single,
like,
I don't know.

496
00:28:08.631 --> 00:28:12.490
I mean maybe it all sort of mashed up together.
Um,
I,

497
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.630
I think it just,
I,
you know,

498
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.710
I wanted to play everything and I realized from a young age,

499
00:28:18.711 --> 00:28:23.540
probably subconsciously like I need to be as efficient as possible so I'm not

500
00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:26.660
getting in my own way so I can play this stuff.
I want to play.
You know,

501
00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:29.840
it's like the first time you heard becoming,
you know the Penn terra song,

502
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.350
first time I heard it I had to put it on a cassette tape and put it in a

503
00:28:33.351 --> 00:28:36.740
handheld recorder and slow the speed down.
Right.

504
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.460
I remember standing in my mom's kitchen putting it up to my up to my ear,

505
00:28:40.461 --> 00:28:43.670
slowing the speed done going,
what the fuck is going on right now?

506
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:48.560
Like having no clue how he could possibly do that physically and then just

507
00:28:48.561 --> 00:28:50.770
sitting there and breaking it down and going.
Well that wouldn't be,

508
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.490
<v 0>I still feel a lot of that way about a lot of this stuff.
Which by the way,
man,</v>

509
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.820
you gotta give a shout out to Vinny.
Oh Lord man.

510
00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.720
I was literally talking about texting with you.
Yup.
Cause talking on the phone.

511
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.520
Yeah.
And I was just going like why is this guy so fucking good in,

512
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.680
in like two hours later you sent me the texts that he had passed away.
Man,

513
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.450
it's fucking brutal,
man.

514
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.600
<v 1>I was really bad.</v>

515
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.250
I haven't been that bummed out in [inaudible] or I haven't been affected that

516
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.330
much by someone's death.
Like who?
I,
I didn't really know him.
I met him once,

517
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.030
you know?
Right.
But I mean he was a real hero of mine and,

518
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.740
and to a lot of people and he just had such a commitment to a very specific

519
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:34.920
aesthetic.
Like he's like,
this is the sound,
this is the feel,

520
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.970
this is the vibe.
And like I'm 100% committed.
Like,

521
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.830
<v 0>and the fact that they were doing,</v>

522
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.430
when all the shit that I was talking about that I was listening to that's just

523
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:49.890
face planted and then all this grunge came out and they will just like,
Nah,

524
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.730
we're going to keep doing this.

525
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.150
<v 1>That's the great southern Trenco that's the records about is them being like</v>

526
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:57.730
fuck all these trends.
Like fuck this grunge shit.

527
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.240
Like we're going to stay true to our metal roots.
He just keep doing this,

528
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:03.700
you know,
and like all that on that live record,

529
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:06.400
that live hundred and one proof record,
like I love that dude.

530
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:10.030
Fill in some holes in between songs.
Banter is incredible.

531
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:15.460
<v 0>Larry.
There's fall,
you spoke with [inaudible] show recording.</v>

532
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.200
Paul could show number one Faulconer Obama.
No bullshit.
I always love it.

533
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.970
That's pretty good fucking logging American hog antler.
Do strops,
Meryl Streep.

534
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.570
It's just like all this shit that if you set it now you'd be my favorite thing,

535
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:31.810
and I always talk about on this is when he,
when uh,

536
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.180
when Vinny counts off unbroken,

537
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.280
it's like in the middle of Phil talking like why are stronger than a notch

538
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:41.780
called arm broken?
I'm avenue in the icts,

539
00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.590
we're having a good child and Diane,

540
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.000
Diane is already playing and it was just like,
did they do that?

541
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.290
Cause that was fucking cool.
Always Vinnie.
Like,
Oh God,
shut up.

542
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.700
I want to drink.
I think it was part of it.

543
00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.460
<v 1>Yeah.
I think he was probably just like,
fucking,
here we go.
You know,</v>

544
00:31:01.461 --> 00:31:02.360
like I love that.

545
00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:05.690
That's such a great moment in that record because you can tell they're just

546
00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:08.660
fucking having fun dude.
And that's why that shit,

547
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:09.920
that's part of the reason why that shit,

548
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.600
<v 0>I never went to go see them because I heard the music and I had an idea in my</v>

549
00:31:14.601 --> 00:31:16.250
head what the crowd was going to be like.

550
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.800
I'm going to get the shit kicked out of me at this thing.

551
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.630
<v 1>But that's one of the funny things.
I was just talking to a buddy of mine,</v>

552
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:24.381
Jamie,

553
00:31:24.381 --> 00:31:29.381
who I've been giving Skype lessons to in London every week for years and he was

554
00:31:29.481 --> 00:31:34.460
telling me he went to see the Bronx,
the other,
the recently,
it's like,

555
00:31:34.461 --> 00:31:36.920
you know,
pretty heavy like punk rock band and he said like,

556
00:31:36.921 --> 00:31:40.250
he brought his wife and she was like,
they left.

557
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.250
They had a great time at the show and like everyone,
you know,

558
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.260
someone falls down in the pit,
someone picks him up.

559
00:31:45.261 --> 00:31:48.320
Like everyone's looking out for each other and he said like they left the show

560
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.620
and his wife was like,
or he said,
I forget.
They were like,

561
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.280
we felt more unsafe walking the streets.

562
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.380
Then you did it at the show,

563
00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.390
like with all these dudes beating the shit out of each other.

564
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.260
<v 0>Yeah.
It just sounded like when I listened to the music,</v>

565
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:04.840
there's a bunch of guys that were mad at their dad.

566
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:07.540
We're going to show up and then they were going to take the childhood out on me.

567
00:32:07.541 --> 00:32:09.920
I just,
you know,
and I had fucking orange hair and it was just like,

568
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.430
I just didn't think it was going to end well.
So it's just like,

569
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.520
but that is one of my big regrets that I didn't,

570
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.000
there was a number of those bands that I didn't go out and go see because I was

571
00:32:19.001 --> 00:32:21.490
just like,
dude,
I love this music,
but I'm going to go,

572
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.650
I'm going to get the fucking shit kicked out of me.
And you know,

573
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:27.130
I was also in my fucking,
my stupid single bass drum.

574
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.900
Barnum didn't need a double pedal.
The music didn't require it.
Bill,
I don't care.

575
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.071
He could do both.

576
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:35.620
One foot did this guy just saying all this shit that other people,

577
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.770
I just completely ignoring the,
this entirely new,
uh,

578
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:44.450
type of drumming in,
in all of these pioneers who were just,
there was like,

579
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.280
there was no roadmap on what to do when I was listening to all these other

580
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:53.270
fucking guys who were just saying shit that had already been said.

581
00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:58.271
And like basically if you could have a foot is fastest bottom right then you

582
00:32:58.461 --> 00:33:01.340
were bottom,
something like that.
I be this way,
my head was,

583
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.580
<v 1>this is what I love doing when we're doing lessons together and just shooting</v>

584
00:33:06.611 --> 00:33:07.750
the shit or whatever is,
is,

585
00:33:07.751 --> 00:33:12.751
is that massive amount of carry over between drumming and stand up comedy.

586
00:33:12.971 --> 00:33:16.760
I mean,
it's,
Oh yeah,
it's huge.
And that's what's so fun about it.
Difference.

587
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.350
<v 0>It's the exact same fucking thing of like,
you know,
uh,</v>

588
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.610
the it guys,

589
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.230
the difference between a guy who changed comedy versus a guy who's just sort of,

590
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.580
you know,
doing comedy or if you just,
if you're on stage,

591
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.240
like just reciting your act versus being up there and having an idea and the

592
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:43.550
crowd reacts one way which actually affects how the show goes and everything.

593
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:44.384
And um,

594
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.520
I used to be so envious of musicians that could just sit down and play what they

595
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.820
feel or react to what another musician did and I just did not have that ability.

596
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.490
So,
uh,
when I got into stand up,

597
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:03.050
I remember like stand up.
I had the same feeling you had when you got down,

598
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.900
when you set it at a kid.
When I first time I remember when I went to a,

599
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:08.660
it was my second show is at this place stitches comedy club,

600
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:11.720
which no longer exists.
And um,

601
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.700
I went in there for this open mic and I remember just walking into all of these

602
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.850
open makers up at the bar,
all in different levels.

603
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:24.050
And I just remembered feeling like,
like,
like for the first time,

604
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:29.000
like I was with a demographic of people that like,
I didn't know,
I was just like,

605
00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:32.960
yeah,
these guys are the same kind of fucking weird that I am,
this,

606
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.970
these Weirdos feel normal to me.

607
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.480
And it was the first time when I went to stand up,
you know,

608
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:41.480
even though I obviously had to learn from all these people,
there was,
I,

609
00:34:41.481 --> 00:34:43.310
I had like this feeling of,

610
00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:46.580
I know I don't really know exactly where I'm going,

611
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:49.030
but I kind of know where I'm going.
Like I know that I,

612
00:34:49.031 --> 00:34:53.720
I just have to do this a bunch of times and what I feel in me is,
is,

613
00:34:53.721 --> 00:34:57.380
is like that this is the right thing is going to kind of come out.
And uh,

614
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.830
so when I am in the,
I'm trying to think,

615
00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:05.330
one of the first guys I ever saw just wing a set.
I saw this guy,

616
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.300
Frank Santa Rally,
and he went up there and knowing what I know now about comedy,

617
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:15.140
I think it was because the host brought them up and they were playing this weird

618
00:35:15.141 --> 00:35:18.740
music and she started doing this dumb dance and he did it with her and he had

619
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:20.120
this totally serious look on his face.

620
00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:22.430
He was already killing before he even took the mic out of the mic stand.

621
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:27.730
But I think that little improv exercise opened him up and he just went up there

622
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:32.450
and it was like he was just fucking talking and,

623
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.040
and I had seen his act a bunch of times.
Sure.
And uh,

624
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.400
then I remember thinking like,
oh he should be,
you should do that again.

625
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:42.810
He should do it.
Like everything was so precious.

626
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.420
Got gotta hang on to every front of thing you ever said.

627
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.180
And it wasn't until like listen to the musicians were there,
that whole,

628
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.610
those types of bands where it's just like a yeah.

629
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:53.760
Just how the song came out that night.
That was the mood we were in.
Right.

630
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.160
And I remember trying,
like I tried to apply that.

631
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.760
<v 1>Yeah.
Cause it's the exact same thing I have.</v>

632
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:03.200
People say to me real hard at what you do cause you wake up,
you go,

633
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.280
you're a baby mama.
Dot.
Dot.
You're already playing.
You're already talking.

634
00:36:06.281 --> 00:36:09.240
I'm just talking into a microphone.
I have to learn how to speak.
Yeah,

635
00:36:09.241 --> 00:36:12.300
but use through sounds.
Yeah,
but put an instrument,

636
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:16.890
but you being able to stand up and wing a set.
You have to be just funny,

637
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:18.780
inherently funny.
Obviously it takes work,

638
00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:22.380
but you have to be a funny person to be able to do that as opposed to someone

639
00:36:22.381 --> 00:36:25.890
who has,
all you do is when it,
if it doesn't work,
you just make fun of yourself.

640
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.040
It's the,
it's the,
it's like literally,
you know,
if he can't dance,

641
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:32.640
you just learn a little two step and let the woman do all the fucking work and

642
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.020
seen it's over.
It's the same fucking thing.
You go up there,
you wing an idea.

643
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.590
If it doesn't either just make fun of yourself or you blame the crowd.
Yeah.

644
00:36:40.591 --> 00:36:43.800
But that's like saying like,
Oh yeah,
when I go to do a drum solo,
it's like,
yeah,

645
00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:46.620
just kind of played the Tom's a little bit and then the symbol.
No it isn't.

646
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.280
That's what I'm saying.
It isn't.
Yeah.
So I'm saying the same thing to you or not.

647
00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:54.950
It's not that easy.
Like,
I mean,
but that,
you know,

648
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:56.450
I have uh,
you know,

649
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.540
dudes who I teach who are like mainly Torin guys I've played with like pop acts

650
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:02.750
or whatever and they're like,
I can sit down and play the shit out of a show,

651
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.410
like from start to finish nail everything.
But if I sit down and someone's like,

652
00:37:06.411 --> 00:37:08.630
Hey,
play a little bit like I don't know what the fuck to do.

653
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.620
Like I can't just play by myself.
And that's the same also type of a thing.

654
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.180
Someone has a routine or bits of show put together,
they could kill it.

655
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.130
But then if they just walk up and

656
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.710
<v 0>Oh,
somebody heckles him and fucks up the APP,
I guess that's exactly right.</v>

657
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.400
<v 1>Same in music and comedy.</v>

658
00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:27.380
Someone throws a fucking beer bottle at you or whatever.

659
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.130
<v 0>Yeah.
People throw shit at you guys.
That does not have,</v>

660
00:37:30.131 --> 00:37:31.350
I mean I've had shit thrown at me,

661
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:35.610
but like I usually to served as [inaudible] you guys would just be up there

662
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.270
singing and for some reason somebody just wants to throw a bottle.
I don't know.

663
00:37:40.271 --> 00:37:44.370
I,
and a lot of times it's like the band is like the crowd is enjoying the show.

664
00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:47.640
It's like they just want to connect with you less.
I hit him with the bottle,

665
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.530
like the plastic water bottle I was drinking and my fingerprints were on it and

666
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:55.950
it touched him.
So yeah.
And then he yelled at me.
It was epic

667
00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.340
and people are crazy.
What um,

668
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.400
what's the most fucked up thing that you ever saw in a show?

669
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.990
Cause you're the drama,
you get to see the,

670
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.980
have you ever said your lead singer go to crowd surf and just sort of disappear

671
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:10.800
in the crowd and the people can't find them and you guys are looking at each

672
00:38:10.801 --> 00:38:12.210
other like how are we going to end this song?

673
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.430
<v 1>You know,
one of the most brutal things I ever saw,
it was,</v>

674
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.320
I wasn't involved.
I was just a spectator,
but,
um,

675
00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.790
I was seeing,
I think it was some,

676
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:26.470
it was some Mike Patton band.
He was,

677
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:30.800
he looked Melvin's or Fanta moss or he's in that dead cross now,
right?
Yeah,

678
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:35.200
I got to see them.
Bartow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
I can't remember who it was.

679
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.870
Um,
anyway,
they brought up like,
uh,

680
00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:42.850
jelaby off road to like sing a song and he went to go like,
this is maybe five,

681
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.420
10 years ago.
And he went to go like state like stage dive or whatever.

682
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.190
And his first step he took,
he said that on some girl's face.

683
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:55.900
Oh No.
Then just ate shit.
Slide like family guy fall.

684
00:38:55.901 --> 00:38:58.600
How it's like one frame and then your arms are behind your back

685
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.230
shit.
And it was,

686
00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:05.380
I know it just like took him like 10 minutes to get back on stage and it was

687
00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:08.740
just like,
oh,
and what is the band doing?
Were they just playing,

688
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:13.270
kept playing and you know,
it was just like,
oh God.
Brutal.

689
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.360
So what do you do?
Does the guitar player play a Solo?
Like how do you eat?
I mean,

690
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.690
I think they just kept,
you know,
patent was up there.

691
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:21.280
I think they just kept like going,
you know,

692
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:23.200
and he eventually made his way back on stage or whatever,

693
00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:27.220
but it was just like Bam.
It was just like,
oh,
oh yeah.
Um,

694
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.200
I mean maybe like for me playing,
there's a drum cam video on,
on,

695
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.390
on Youtube I think is the first thing you saw of me.
The,
the volt,
the Goliath.

696
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.850
Oh yeah.
And I didn't understand your technique.
I'm like,

697
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:42.400
this guy's fucking arms are going to fall off.
Yeah,
yeah.

698
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.690
Cause I was going ape shit and go nuts and hitting super hard and um,

699
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.180
or it looks like it's hitting hard.
Um,

700
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.660
and one thing Cedric he used to love to do is he would just like take my crash

701
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:56.920
symbols away from me.
Like,

702
00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.690
so there's a part in that video where he just takes my crash,
uh,

703
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.380
and only have two up.
So,
uh,
he takes my crash and then like,
you know,

704
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.380
like basically just jumps on it,
uh,

705
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:12.070
and like throws it up and down and then takes the symbol off and stomps on it.

706
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.650
And then takes the cymbal stand and throws it over my head and almost hit it,

707
00:40:16.651 --> 00:40:18.820
takes out the camera.
And I'm like,
this is the,

708
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.910
this was the first time he'd ever done this.
So like,

709
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.490
did you know that he did shit?
Like,
no.
No.
I mean,
not really.
I don't think so.

710
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.620
Did you think it was because of your playing?
No,

711
00:40:26.621 --> 00:40:28.930
he was just like rock and rock and roll,
you know,

712
00:40:28.931 --> 00:40:33.010
like my fucking self esteem.
It'd be like,
he hates me,

713
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.860
I'm getting fired and then it'd be getting mad man.
Like,

714
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:40.460
do some fucking trash my shit.
Well,
I did get mad eventually.
Um,
uh,

715
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.630
and my company was like,
what the fuck?
Um,
but anyway,
yeah,

716
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.300
because he had to keep sending you shit.
They were like,
Shit,
what the fuck?

717
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:50.890
We send you symbols to play knock to get broken by the lead singer,
you know?
So,

718
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.410
uh,
so yeah,
this is the first time he ever did it.

719
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:55.900
So you can see me like turning around to my tech,
like,
Hey,

720
00:40:55.901 --> 00:41:00.190
fucking give me another symbol on a stand.
Like,
come on dude,
like,
and a,

721
00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:03.550
and he's like,
hold on a sec.
You know,
and then,
uh,
and then he was just like,

722
00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:05.470
I gotta make sure and wait until he's actually done,

723
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.790
I don't know how far he's going to take this.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

724
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.380
Wait until he's out of that mood.
Yeah.
And then he eventually,
you know,

725
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.890
eventually brought another one up and it was fine.
But like,
uh,

726
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.310
well not to get into the gossip,
we able to just kind of sit there and say,

727
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:21.920
hey buddy,
I love being in the band man,
but I need my simple,
see,

728
00:41:21.921 --> 00:41:25.720
I mean I got to a certain point where I was like,
dude,
like really?
You know,

729
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:28.390
like come on,
cause he actually plays drums too.
I was like,
you know,

730
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.570
you know how much,
you know,
annoying that that would be right.
You know,
he's like,

731
00:41:31.571 --> 00:41:34.740
Oh shit.
Yeah,
you're right.
Sorry man.
Just get carried away.
You know,
I used to,

732
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.010
when I was e five,

733
00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.520
eight if I ever saw that on TV or if I was in the crowd or whatever when I was a

734
00:41:40.521 --> 00:41:42.290
kid and I was playing drums and everything,

735
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:46.700
I used to just be a tech to just give it to me.
Right,
right.
I need a symbol.

736
00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.593
Right.
Totally.

737
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.480
<v 0>Can you just sit there and just break it in front of me?</v>

738
00:41:49.481 --> 00:41:51.640
It's like I would've loved to have had that.
Yup.

739
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:55.000
Like when I ever watched like the WHO or whatever.
Yeah.
And you know,

740
00:41:55.001 --> 00:41:58.900
it's funny cause I don't know if they just had like some piece of shit,
you know,

741
00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:01.990
the Japanese version of the lesser or whatever.
Or if it was an actual one.

742
00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.910
It now like all those vintage instruments,
how much they're worth.
Like I,

743
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:09.370
Pete Townsend and his probably,
you know,
oh my God,

744
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.770
probably seven figures and guitars

745
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:17.310
<v 1>at least.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My Buddy,
my buddy Jerry plays with Dick Dale,</v>

746
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.070
you know,
and uh,
he brings out this like,

747
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.430
I don't know what it is if it's like an explorer or Les Paul or something,

748
00:42:23.431 --> 00:42:28.431
but it's like from the 50s and his amp is also from the 50s and it's like that

749
00:42:28.471 --> 00:42:32.040
shit's worth several hundred thousand dollars and he tours with it

750
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:38.190
<v 0>crazy.
Well,
yeah.
And he's the guy who plays her frog,
but he plays like,</v>

751
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.090
Oh,
right hand guitar left the upside down.
It doesn't change the strings.

752
00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.810
<v 1>That sounds right to me.
Yeah.
He does something super fucked up and weird.
Yeah.</v>

753
00:42:45.811 --> 00:42:49.550
That's all that,
that pulp fiction song.
Yep.
That's it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

754
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.180
Well where can people get this video?

755
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.310
And you have mentioned that they can go to my website,

756
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:59.040
[inaudible] dot com spell your name.
We're done.
We're done over here.
L I,
t c h,

757
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.210
Dave [inaudible] dot com.
And uh,
you can just click on instructional course,

758
00:43:03.211 --> 00:43:07.410
it'll pop up there and you can get everything there.
It's just streaming and uh,

759
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:07.830
you know,

760
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.190
everybody does these sort of subscription based courses now and then they just

761
00:43:11.191 --> 00:43:14.340
take your money forever and I didn't want to do that.
So I'm like,
you know,

762
00:43:14.341 --> 00:43:17.820
you just pay for it once you stream it forever,
as long as you want.

763
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.480
I'm not going to charge your credit card for seven years and you know,
like,

764
00:43:21.481 --> 00:43:23.160
I don't want to do that.
So,
uh,

765
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.670
I've had a couple of those and then you forget you have exactly day somebody is

766
00:43:26.671 --> 00:43:28.650
looking at your stuff going like,
dude,
what the fuck is this?

767
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:29.711
<v 0>Did he ever tell you I had,</v>

768
00:43:29.711 --> 00:43:33.110
I had a cell phone number for like 15 years that I never use.

769
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:38.170
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Like I was bitching to my wife going like,

770
00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:42.820
is that mine?
Oh,
Siri,
no worries.

771
00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.710
Um,
I was paying,
it just seemed like a ton of money.

772
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.100
All of a sudden for my cell phone.
It just kept going up and up and up.
I said,

773
00:43:51.101 --> 00:43:53.230
I don't understand why I'm paying,
why am I paying so much more than fuck?

774
00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:57.790
It was going to have to like fucking three,
400 bucks.
Right.
So she goes,

775
00:43:57.791 --> 00:44:00.310
let me see it.
And she looked at it.
She goes,
all right,
first of all,

776
00:44:00.311 --> 00:44:04.960
I think I had three cell phone numbers.
Why?
Yeah,
she's still going at me.
Yeah.

777
00:44:04.961 --> 00:44:08.600
Like I like I got like fucking chicks on the side and I'm like,
no,
I don't know.

778
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.540
We looked it up.
Here's what it was back in the day.
Um,

779
00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.720
when you were on the road,
you know,
in,
you'd bring it,

780
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:20.980
you fucking big thick laptop or whatever and all these hotel rooms were charging

781
00:44:20.981 --> 00:44:25.920
anywhere from seven,
10,
$11 a day for the Internet.
Right.
So I,

782
00:44:25.921 --> 00:44:29.770
I wouldn't,
I was working places Tuesday through Sunday,
so it was like six times,

783
00:44:29.771 --> 00:44:32.520
you know,
10,
11 bucks.
It was like,
man with the taxes customer,

784
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:37.350
like $70 to be on the Internet.
So,
uh,

785
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.340
my buddy Robert Kelly,
right?
He's like,
dude,
what do you want to do again?

786
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.400
He knows all the fucking technology.
Cause did you get the fucking,

787
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.420
it's this was his hotspot,
right?
Things.
So it had its own number.

788
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.950
You plugged it in to your computer and blah,
blah blah.
Right.

789
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.900
So I tried to use it twice and it never worked.

790
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:58.950
Now says he's fucking things never fucking work.

791
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.640
And I knew in the back of my head it's like I gotta call these guys up and

792
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:07.330
cancel it or whatever.
And I just,
I just never did and I just forgot about it.
Oh.

793
00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:11.970
And recently I actually found it,
I still have the thing.
So that was one of them.

794
00:45:11.971 --> 00:45:15.510
I forget what the other one was,
but it was like two things that were of that.

795
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.100
One was like a fax machine number and the other one's like all this outdated

796
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:21.450
shit.
So she got,

797
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.140
she got that taken off and then I think one time when I left the country I

798
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:28.290
switched my plan and they didn't quite switch it back or something.

799
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:31.190
So now it's down to like a buck 80 a month.
It was your,

800
00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.540
was your mobile hotspot like the size of this fridge?
No.
You know,

801
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.620
it was the size of a hockey puck.
I mean it was big,
was a big plastic thing.

802
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:41.790
And you just had a,
and you had to come up with all the stuff that trips me up,

803
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.560
you know,
you got to come up with a password and just like,
oh,
just a couple,
two,

804
00:45:46.561 --> 00:45:49.470
three of those hoops that I have to jump through.
Oh yeah,
that's too much.

805
00:45:49.471 --> 00:45:53.010
But I've been working on lately though.
Um,
I remember seeing,

806
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.290
maybe I was watching one of the interviews you did or whatever you said,

807
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:59.670
how you think everyone should have a therapist.
If you just talk to somebody.
Yes.

808
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.830
The world be a better place.
Well,
um,
I haven't gone to therapy and like for,

809
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.820
I finally at one point I was just going like,
dude,

810
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.480
I'm always going to be fucked up.
I mean,
I can sit here like,
well,

811
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.140
I'm done talking about my childhood,

812
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.140
so I'm just going to be talking about the dumb shit that happens every day.

813
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:13.870
Like it was,

814
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:18.450
it was feel starting feeling a reality show or one on one reality show.
But,
um,

815
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.480
recently I've really been working on my not snapping over little things.

816
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.111
Uh,
and I,

817
00:46:26.111 --> 00:46:29.550
I started to snap this morning for the first time in like four days and it

818
00:46:29.551 --> 00:46:33.880
actually felt a little weird,
but,
um,
I,

819
00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.260
I'm just gonna keep trying to do what I'm doing with it and I keep talking about

820
00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:40.320
it allowed,
so I remember it because,
you know,
it's like,
Hey,

821
00:46:40.321 --> 00:46:41.820
I'm going to go to the gym.
Yeah.
You know,

822
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:43.350
and then that week you fucking crush it.

823
00:46:43.351 --> 00:46:46.890
Next week you three quarters of crush it,
a month later you're eating Oreos.

824
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.760
Sit on a couch.
So what do you,
so what are you doing?
Like,

825
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.100
do you just like breathe deeply years?
Like when you say Aye?

826
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:59.010
Well,
big thing is driving.
Sure.
So when I get in the fucking car,

827
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.450
I just say like,
uh,
first of all,
I leave enough fucking time to get there.

828
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.820
I don't leave the utopia time.
This should take a half hour.
Nope.

829
00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:12.960
How dare these other people in front of me have other plans in other lives.

830
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.820
So I leave plenty of time and then I,
it's just weird.

831
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:22.440
I drive slow slower.
I'm probably driving somebody nuts by him.
I drive slower.

832
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:27.510
I stopped at yellow lights.
I let people go.
I chill out.
I actually,

833
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.770
uh,
is another thing.
I swear to God,
this is like,

834
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:32.830
they use this for premature ejaculation.
I'm actually using this.

835
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.010
I listened to baseball.
They stay,
think I'll think about baseball.

836
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.180
I never understood that it be,
if you don't want to fucking bust a nut,

837
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:43.030
I start thinking of fucking call your strobe ski now.

838
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.930
Fucking got a hard tech thinking about the fucking left field or the red sox and

839
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:51.340
it's just confusing.
It's like,
wait,
am I attracted to this guy?
Um,

840
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.420
I just didn't feel like you are present.
Um,
sorry,
I was busy.

841
00:47:55.421 --> 00:47:59.890
I was thinking about fucking at Jerry Remy.
No,
I put on like a,

842
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.770
there's something about smoking a cigar and listening,

843
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:07.890
listening to baseball on the radio is like some old man shit and it slows life

844
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:12.280
down.
I don't know what it is.
So I,
uh,

845
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.050
I just have it on and they just have a wonderful day for a ball game,
man.

846
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:22.470
Just crazy.
The lineups,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know,
he's just,
yeah,

847
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.060
he's extending his bratty of Aa.

848
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.860
And you just sort of drift along and I just,
and I just know and I just,

849
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:34.120
I don't have,
I hate saying this,
but you know that the people always say like,

850
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:37.900
you know,
you got to give up like expectations and shit.
First of all,

851
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:41.590
I also like googled how to stop snapping over the little things in.

852
00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:44.570
The first thing I clicked on was this woman going,
did you ever,

853
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.250
have you ever blown to say everything that I've done?
It's like,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,

854
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:49.390
yes.
So she goes,

855
00:48:49.391 --> 00:48:53.860
here's four techniques and I'm reading this shit and I am like five minutes into

856
00:48:53.861 --> 00:48:56.740
reading this and before she says,
you know,

857
00:48:56.741 --> 00:48:59.010
I've been doing this for like a week and I'm like,
what?

858
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:01.930
Literally started snapping.

859
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.460
Like you don't change in a week.
Okay,
this is,

860
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:13.870
this is going to take me.
I just turned 50 this will take,
if I work my ass off,

861
00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:18.420
this will take all of my fifties
to not to not do.

862
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.930
That's why I was joking with a buddy of mine,

863
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:24.760
why one of the most real as characters ever in any movie was,

864
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:28.870
was private hooks in police academy member.
She's always all mousy.

865
00:49:28.871 --> 00:49:30.940
That black girl hang and then the end she'd be like,

866
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:37.480
and I remember joking,
you know,
every movie she'd go back to being mousy again.

867
00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:40.810
She had the exact same character arc.
And it's just like,
when is she,
you know,

868
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:42.700
in reality is,

869
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:47.440
is that's what it's like to try to change yourself as a person is you have,

870
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.100
you know,

871
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.730
fucking up fucking up fucking up for 90 minutes and then whatever or whatever,

872
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.180
how much time the move goes by in the movie and then you have that breakthrough

873
00:49:55.181 --> 00:49:59.540
moment and you don't move dirt bag and then the next day you know you're going

874
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.240
to fall back again or maybe two days later or whatever.
So yeah,
but that,

875
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.250
that's the,
but when you,
you know,

876
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:11.251
if you continue to do that work on yourself where you fall back isn't as far

877
00:50:12.491 --> 00:50:17.230
down the ladder as you were before.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah,
no,
no,
I,
yeah,

878
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.340
believe me,
dude,
like I'm,

879
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.400
I am committed to this because it's going to make my relationship with my wife

880
00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:25.300
so much better.
I'm telling you,
dude,

881
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:29.240
if I could just stop snapping at little shit,
dude,
she's got nothing.

882
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.980
She's got the real motivation.
She's got nothing.
No,

883
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:36.830
because what I'm still doing,
this is something else that I'm gonna I'm,

884
00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.660
I'm starting to let go of is the way when you're in a relationship with a woman,

885
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.180
like thinking the way a guy thinks,

886
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:48.680
you think I'm going to do this and then it's gonna,
then it's,

887
00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:52.430
then she's going to be happy with me and she'll be in a good mood and then I'll,

888
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.870
the egg shells go away.
Right.
And what you realize is that,

889
00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:01.220
that that's yeah,
you're chasing a a,
that's like a Ponzi scheme.

890
00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:06.780
Like there's,
there's no meaning having expectations for your actions is,
uh,

891
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:11.550
no,
I,
I just like,
I'm just always going to win.

892
00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:17.240
Neuer inherently just because I'm a man and I'm not going to see things the way

893
00:51:18.451 --> 00:51:19.980
she does because she's a woman.

894
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.930
And touching that and what she views as important versus what I view as,

895
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.640
or she views is not a big deal.
And I think is a big deal,
is not going to Mesh.

896
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:32.790
Not because she's a bad person or I'm a bad person,

897
00:51:32.791 --> 00:51:37.560
it's just because we are wired differently.
And,
uh,

898
00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:40.590
so I forget what something happened

899
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.710
just this morning and I started to get upset and I was just like,
well,

900
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:48.930
why would I think that she would blah,
blah,
blah,
and it just fucking went away.

901
00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.630
That's great.
So I can,

902
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:54.000
but I'm afraid of this because now I'm filling and we just become this spineless

903
00:51:54.001 --> 00:51:56.400
guy or oh hell,
you know,
sitting there holding her purse.

904
00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.650
<v 1>You know what?
I'll talk about the same shit I have with my,</v>

905
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:03.430
with my therapist a bunch of times,
uh,
because coming,

906
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:08.500
not even necessarily talking about that specific thing as a human being,

907
00:52:08.501 --> 00:52:12.970
but talking about that specific thing as being the source of your creativity in

908
00:52:12.971 --> 00:52:15.460
some way.
Yeah.
You know what?
I mean like that's,

909
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:17.620
<v 0>no,
there's there,
there is a thing with comedians with,</v>

910
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:21.410
if I get happy I won't be fun anymore.
Which is what musicians too.

911
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:25.640
It's a huge myth because I'll tell you why.
What happens is,

912
00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:29.330
is like once you get everything you want,
you know,

913
00:52:29.331 --> 00:52:33.220
as far as like you found love and you have the kid and your kid comes home,

914
00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.560
it's going.dot,
dot,
dot.
Big Smile students.
The fucking greatest,

915
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:38.660
greatest fucking thing ever.

916
00:52:38.661 --> 00:52:41.390
It's one of the few things in the world that lives up to the hype,
right?

917
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:45.320
Other than downloading your fucking video,
boom,
Bam.

918
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.530
Cross promoting.
Um,
what,
Eh,

919
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:53.450
what replaces all your angsty Lolitas and I'm sleeping on a futon and shit isn't

920
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.440
this new fear of that you're now going to lose it.
All right?

921
00:52:57.441 --> 00:53:00.380
Like what if something happens?
Like I can't tell you since having a kid,

922
00:53:00.381 --> 00:53:04.490
like any new scenario like,
hey,
I'm going to go take her on the swing.

923
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:09.520
Like immediately this horror movie that Steven King could not fuck with or maybe

924
00:53:10.011 --> 00:53:11.780
that maybe he has kids or something.
That's how he writes.

925
00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:16.460
But like the shit that goes through your head about the possible stuff that

926
00:53:16.461 --> 00:53:20.510
would happen.
And always in the end,
I'm either murdering a person or an animal.

927
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.200
One of the other dude,

928
00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:30.090
I've actually had fantasies of jumping down on a cougars back in somehow.

929
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:32.430
I know that UFC move will you choke it out.

930
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.490
And I wrapped my legs around his belly so it can't claw me.

931
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.370
And I sit there while I'm eating his sandwich.

932
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.840
Thinking of all of this because my wife said that she's going to like just take

933
00:53:42.841 --> 00:53:47.640
her out in the backyard,
um,
turns into a Joe Rogan episode.
Yeah.

934
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:53.700
Yeah.
So all of that and then like those fucking crazy thoughts,

935
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:58.600
we'll then we'll then fuel your,
um,
your act hopefully.
So,
um,

936
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.560
any as well.
I have to,
I've got to read a little bit of advertising.
Okay.

937
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:04.320
You want to see some comedy here?
Um,
once again,

938
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.820
my apologies to the Special Smith.
I feel so fucking bad about that.

939
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.930
And I told,

940
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:13.880
I told the singer I'd throw a couple of concent form and then I called his pant,

941
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.520
the smiths,
and then I had all these fucking mopey Morrissey people.

942
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.850
He left at band 30 years.
You'd go,
man,

943
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:23.100
they're never getting baked in other people freaking out.

944
00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:28.260
Did they get back together?
Like I caused like this whole fucking thing.

945
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:29.150
I feel like such a,

946
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:31.140
<v 1>by the way you're,
you're,</v>

947
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.080
you need to fill him like a video of your Morrissey dance.

948
00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:37.520
<v 0>Oh,
the Morrissey dance.
Oh yeah.
Have you done that yet?
No,</v>

949
00:54:37.521 --> 00:54:40.460
I got to get it down better.
It's one of my favorite things I've ever seen.

950
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:42.090
I don't dislike Morrissey.
I just,

951
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:45.720
I like irritating people that are really into shit.
Like star wars fans.
Oh,

952
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.890
I saw them.
I saw one of the,
I saw one of the new newest star wars ones.

953
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:51.380
It was fucking great.
It was actually really good.

954
00:54:51.381 --> 00:54:54.860
Now that it's not like a muppet movie,
like it was too,
like it was like,

955

I just,

960
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.330
it's like there's so much other shit out there in the world.

961

did.

964
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:26.070
If they just fucking just did what they did and just shut the fuck up about it

965
00:55:26.071 --> 00:55:28.470
and let them other generations realize how cool they were,

966
00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.870
they would have been fine.
Um,

1063
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:55.360
I say admit to bullshit the doing so they don't take your blood and figured out

1064
01:00:55.361 --> 01:00:56.920

whatever.

1066
01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.780

because I really didn't earn it.
That's what I,

1093
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.960
cause I always feel like with stand up as much as you know,
doing Letterman,

1094
01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.170
the HBO special duties like that,
it's like I did the hell gigs.

1095
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:53.850
Like I fucking earned it and the cracker barrel at three in the morning and

1096
01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:56.880
Nebraska or whatever.
But there's these drum and gigs.

1097
01:02:56.881 --> 01:02:59.730
It's not like I had to audition.
It's just like,
oh,
that guy's funny.

1098
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:03.660
I'll play a song with them.
Yeah.
I'm sick of the guys in my band.

1099
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:07.950
Get up their freckles,
see what you can do.
Um,
all right.

1100
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:11.940
That's the Thursday afternoon podcast.

1103
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.860
I've learned so much myself,
dude.
And one more thing.
Yeah,

1104
01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:26.310
I can imagine you had a fucking student more difficult than make the fucking

1105
01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:30.120
teach.
Oh,
I definitely have believed that.
Right?
I don't say any of that.
Um,

1106
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:34.140

Get look at that is it gave him,

1110
01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:47.100

1115
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.063
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1116
01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.040
[inaudible] what's going on?
It's,

1117
01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:51.950
<v 3>it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

1118
01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.050
June 28th,
2010 right off the bat.

1119
01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.820
You should be thinking,
you know what,
Bill,

1120
01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:00.740
there's something weird with your voice.

1121
01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:03.710
Why does it sound like you're whispering?

1122
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.700
Because I am fucking whispering in fucking Douche bag.

1123
01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.320
Why don't you go with your gut?
You know,
didn't you fucking brain?

1124
01:06:12.321 --> 01:06:13.820
Just tell you that I was whispering.

1125
01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.750
Did your parents beat you down mentally that bad?

1126
01:06:18.751 --> 01:06:23.751
That you literally question what that fucking voice in in Saudi.

1127
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:24.911
Who was even saying?

1128
01:06:24.911 --> 01:06:29.911
That's the voice that makes you fucking when you go on a hike and if that little

1129
01:06:30.101 --> 01:06:33.280
voice in years go on.
Is there a mountain line staring at me?
Yes,

1130
01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:38.080
there is run.
All right.
Um,

1131
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:42.430
I am whispering because I'm doing this fucking thing at eight 20 in the morning,

1132
01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.230
my girlfriend is sleeping in the other room.

1133
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.820
I taped this fucking thing last night,
but for some reason I screwed up

1134
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.540
and it didn't record 50 minutes.
I fucking did it.

1135
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.810
I was going to upload it at midnight just like last week.
Okay.

1136
01:06:58.811 --> 01:07:01.720
And just like last week,
I am once again,

1137
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:06.730
I'm Douche bag of the week back to back.
Just like the Lakers.

1138
01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.830
I'm a Douche bag two years in a fucking row,
uh,

1139
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:14.950
two weeks in a row,
I should say our two times in a row,
whatever.

1140
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:16.450
You know the analogy I'm trying to

1141
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:20.710
let you guys know that I'm a fucking idiot when it comes to this.

1142
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.680
The past two weeks and kind of try and trashed the Lakers anyways,

1143
01:07:23.681 --> 01:07:25.900
but they don't give a fuck.
They got their rings right.

1144
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:28.780
You know what a wonderful organization.

1145
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.710
They actually had to switch their parade route because they're stupid.

1146
01:07:32.711 --> 01:07:36.670
Fans were writing so much bunch of fucking animals.

1147
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.860
All right,
Billy.
Ever going to let the Lakers Celtics series go?
You know what?

1148
01:07:41.861 --> 01:07:46.030
I don't think I'm gonna.
I'm reminded of it constantly.

1149
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.350
Like I started watching World Cup soccer and watching all those fucking people

1150
01:07:50.351 --> 01:07:51.850
flopping around on the ground.

1151
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:56.980
Anytime anybody kicked it back to their socks reminded me of watching Pau Gasol

1152
01:07:56.981 --> 01:08:00.370
play basketball.
The fucking flopping.
Fag.

1153
01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:04.720
All right,
let's not be this angry.
You can't be angry in whisper.

1154
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.160
Ever seen that?
You'll see a couple fighting public.

1155
01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.820
They do that angry whispering.
That's not what I said.

1156
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.270
You know damn well what the fuck's on right here?
He'll kill.
Shut the fuck up.

1157
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:21.500
That's what I'm going to be doing.
So anyways,
um,

1158
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.610
I actually did the podcast last night already and uh,

1159
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:29.120
fighting through,
I was like sweating.

1160
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:32.810
I was so god damn sick.
I did Vegas this weekend.

1161
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.570
I performed at the Orleans casino.

1162
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.700
Now few stand up nerds out there or if he fans of the podcast who listen every

1163
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:41.160
week,
you,

1164
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.160
you know that the Orleans casino was the last place George Carlin did a stand up

1165
01:08:46.461 --> 01:08:49.130
before he died.
So,
uh,

1166
01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:52.070
I went there and I asked them a ton of questions.

1167
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:54.770
People who work there with totally cool.

1168
01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:59.600
Even one of the guys was actually telling me how Carolyn put together as hours

1169
01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.970
of material.
You know,

1170
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:06.971
how he would come in and it would be like an hour and 20 minutes and before his

1171
01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:10.340
special he'd watch them whittle it down and by the end of the weekend it would

1172
01:09:10.341 --> 01:09:13.040
be like an hour,
right on the nose.

1173
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:17.540
Gave me chills listening to it,
and also made me really feel like,
uh,

1174
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:22.910
I need to start working harder as a fucking comedian.
And,
uh,
someone,

1175
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:26.840
they're also gave me a,
a ticket stub from his last show was fucking awesome.

1176
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.150
But I,
uh,
made the mistake.
I,
um,

1177
01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:36.050
the Orleans Orleans casino is actually off the strip.
It's kind of cool.

1178
01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:40.970
So my hotel room at a view of the entire Strip and,
uh,

1179
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.230
I would have been content to just stay out there at the Orleans casino because I

1180
01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:49.580
liked it.
I liked the vibe of the crowd was a little bit older as am I,

1181
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:54.950
you know,
so there wasn't a lot of craziness going on.
It was just straight up,

1182
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.660
let's booze,
let's eat,
let's gamble.
You know,

1183
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:02.780
it wasn't a bunch of people fucking,
you know,

1184
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:08.120
in Alica Gaggle of chicks screaming at the sunroof of a fucking limb out,

1185
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:15.470
you know,
we got a limo,
beaches,
you know,
you know,

1186
01:10:15.471 --> 01:10:17.650
everybody tags everything with bitch nowadays.

1187
01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:22.760
Is that from the Rick James Sketch?
I'm Rick James Bitch.

1188
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:24.470
Then everything became bitch,

1189
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.390
whatever long fucking story.
You know what I'm doing right now,

1190
01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.240
I'm looking at my laptop and the screen saver just has all,

1191
01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:37.300
all the albums on my iTunes or all the albums that don't really fucking exist.

1192
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.230
The covers to the digital signals that I downloaded.

1193
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.130
I'm actually looking at one that says Elvis speaking of Las Vegas.

1194
01:10:46.131 --> 01:10:48.980
And I came out to,
uh,

1195
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:52.450
to elvisy entire weekend.
I had to do it.

1196
01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.540
I came out to that song that's used to be cute and now I realized that it's

1197
01:10:56.541 --> 01:11:00.740
about stocking someone,
you know,
has that fucking song.

1198
01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:03.430
Go hide in the kitchen,
had in the hall.

1199
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:08.900
Ain't gonna do you any good at all?
It goes one side,
something man.

1200
01:11:08.901 --> 01:11:13.130
The kisses dot a team allowed Hawes is good and tear us apart.

1201
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.970
It's like really?
Elvis does.
Does the woman have any say in that?

1202
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.320
I'm going to fuck on
Volvo Bubba.

1203
01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:28.470
Yes.
Stuck on you.
Stuck on you.
You would think that,
uh,

1204
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:33.160
that with them,
it's a guy in love.
But if you really listen to the lyrics,

1205
01:11:33.161 --> 01:11:33.540
it isn't,

1206
01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:38.540
it's a guy who can't accept the fact that the relationship is over in her mind

1207
01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:43.580
and she wants to move on.
Eh,
you know,
hey,
he just

1208
01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.720
won't fucking leave her alone.
It keeps pressing his sweaty out of shape,

1209
01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.850
iconic stomach up against her as he kisses her.

1210
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.740
I mean,
that's what I got out of it,

1211
01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.780
but it was a great song to come out to nonetheless.
So anyways,

1212
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:04.020
you probably asking,
hey bill,
you whisper in [inaudible]

1213
01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:10.000
how did you get sick?
I don't really know,

1214
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:14.950
but I know who I'm going to blame it on.
How about that?
I was fucking,
uh,

1215
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:19.540
like I said,
I was content to stay off the Strip at the Orleans casino,

1216
01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:24.760
you know,
but I brought my girlfriend.
So you know what that means.

1217
01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:26.560
They want to do stuff.

1218
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:32.150
<v 5>Let's go to the strip.
I heard they had some stores.</v>

1219
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.160
They are students on the strip.

1220
01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.970
Let's go to this trip and go to the store and see where to go to the stores and

1221
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.180
the Strip.
Hi Sweetie.
Sweetie.

1222
01:12:41.181 --> 01:12:43.110
Do you want to go to this stores on this trip?

1223
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:48.350
<v 3>No,
of course.
I don't know.
I,
why would I want to do that?</v>

1224
01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:53.390
If I had something I needed to buy,
I would go,
but I don't,
I don't want to go.

1225
01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:57.270
Yeah,
but I fucking learned.

1226
01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.830
I've learned to get through the fucking relationship.

1227
01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:07.740
You got to say yes to some shit.
You don't want to fucking do.
So I go,

1228
01:13:07.741 --> 01:13:10.800
yeah,
yeah.
Let's go to the fucking stores on the Strip.
Right?

1229
01:13:10.801 --> 01:13:14.880
So we fucking go out there and uh,
you know,

1230
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:20.130
we go into all these fucking stores.
I noticed those really high end stores.

1231
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.630
When you go into them,

1232
01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:27.740
they only have like 40 pieces is they call them.

1233
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:32.340
You know,
it's very,
it's not like when you go into old navy

1234
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:37.320
a what's waist size area,
we've got a hundred of that,
you know,

1235
01:13:37.321 --> 01:13:41.130
we get a hundred every fucking size and their stack from the floor up to the

1236
01:13:41.131 --> 01:13:43.680
goddamn ceiling.
And we got that ladder.

1237
01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.090
I fucking slides right across the wall.
That's how much product we have in here.

1238
01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:50.280
And that's just the goddamn change.
And you know why?

1239
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.290
Cause they're 30 bucks a whack,

1240
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:57.540
but you go into those fucking high end places and it stops being jeans and

1241
01:13:57.541 --> 01:13:59.850
dresses.
It starts being called pieces

1242
01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:05.890
and all of a sudden there's like 28 things and there's a ton of space and

1243
01:14:05.891 --> 01:14:07.060
everybody in those stores,

1244
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:10.480
it looks like Mike Myers and that fucking sketchy used to do you know where he

1245
01:14:10.481 --> 01:14:11.170
danced?

1246
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:16.170
Like the fucking German guy who liked to get shit on sprocket or some shit of

1247
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:18.810
came out where the fuck name Lewis,

1248
01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:23.560
he's dressed all in black and he put his hands on his hips and he only moved his

1249
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:24.394
legs.

1250
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:28.900
Can you guys hear that person that somebody giggling like a maniac downstairs

1251
01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.350
person moved out downstairs?
Not The old guy.

1252
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.900
My apartment's over two different apartments.

1253
01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:41.800
It's a little fucking spread out.
So anyways,

1254
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:45.130
we start going to those goddamn shops.
Long Story Short,

1255
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:49.600
I got actually admit one Louis Vuitton when you go in there,
uh,

1256
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:52.840
I really liked their luggage,
man.
That luggage is fucking insane.

1257
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.900
Like it's handcrafted.
Said I lied that,
you know,
look at that handcrafted.
Yeah.

1258
01:14:58.901 --> 01:15:02.860
Some guy took a hammer and nails on the inside.
Look at that craftsman ship.

1259
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.700
You know,

1260
01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:09.370
they have an old Louis Vuitton trunk from like the early 19 hundreds and it's

1261
01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:10.690
still functional.
You know why?

1262
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:15.370
Because it was made by hand using great materials.
So I was like,
you know,

1263
01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:19.150
and I liked this shit.
I like,
it wasn't made by a machine.

1264
01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:20.890
It was made by a human being.

1265
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:26.130
So I asked him the smallest fucking piece of luggage they had,

1266
01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:30.250
which I guess would be considered kind of like a jewelry box.

1267
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:37.470
And I asked him how much it was and they were like a $4,000 and uh,

1268
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.820
I did the Eddie Murphy and Beverly Hills Cop,
you know,
you know,
I just,

1269
01:15:42.821 --> 01:15:46.540
I just totally played it off like I could afford it as I guy.
That's great.

1270
01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:47.800
You know?
Okay,

1271
01:15:47.801 --> 01:15:51.130
now why don't you close up this handcrafted thing and put it back up on the

1272
01:15:51.131 --> 01:15:54.700
fucking shelf?
I was actually pissed afterwards

1273
01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:57.123
for grant.

1274
01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.000
They fucking look me right in the eye when they said four grant for Greg.

1275
01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.170
You look at the fucking floor when you throw a goddamn number out,

1276
01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:08.290
like that should be ashamed of yourself charging that much fucking money.

1277
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:11.800
I don't understand.

1278
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:16.720
Do you know how fucking rich you'd have to be to buy a $40,000 fucking jewelry

1279
01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:20.560
box?
Jesus Christ.
Most people did.

1280
01:16:20.561 --> 01:16:22.060
Jewelry isn't worth that much.

1281
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.690
And then when the fuck do you take it?

1282
01:16:25.691 --> 01:16:29.440
That's the thing about buying really nice clothes and really nice stuff.

1283
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:31.870
I got my legs crossed right now and I'm swinging my foot around.

1284
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.830
The fuck is wrong with me.
She caught myself in a really a feminist moment.

1285
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.950
Whatever I'm allowed on,
I,
um,

1286
01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.690
what,
what the fuck are you gonna do?
Like someone will like,

1287
01:16:46.691 --> 01:16:49.120
that's when you know you're rich.
When someone will mug you,

1288
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:53.380
not for what's in your luggage,
they'll just mug you for your fucking luggage.

1289
01:16:56.230 --> 01:17:00.700
You know,
when I go to do a,
the David Letterman program,
I go,
always go out.

1290
01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:05.200
I buy a nice God damn suit.
I always lose money whenever I do that show.

1291
01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:07.120
But I'm not going out there looking like a bum.

1292
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:09.650
And I love the suits and I love wearing them.

1293
01:17:09.651 --> 01:17:14.220
But the second you put them on your freaking out like,
oh my god Ha.

1294
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.820
Anything you go to brush up against,
you freak out

1295
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:23.530
because it's an expensive goddamn suit as opposed to when you shop at old navy

1296
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:27.260
in the gap,
you know,

1297
01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:31.190
the Anti Pussy where that they sell.

1298
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:36.350
I wouldn't give a shit if I was walking through a fucking pig sty.
I mean,

1299
01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.960
I freak on my God pigs shit.
Oh,
it's okay.

1300
01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:44.720
I'm wearing gap jeans.
I've never wore gap jeans.
I would never do that.

1301
01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:46.790
The other was a kid in my high school,

1302
01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:51.791
his nickname was the gap nerd and he d he had no idea people use,

1303
01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.080
no one said to his face because he was a bigger guy,

1304
01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:58.670
but he always wore a gap jeans.
And he wasn't even that big of a nerd.

1305
01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.460
Now he always tucked his shirts in cause it was the 80s and a,
yeah,

1306
01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:05.600
they called them the gap nerd

1307
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:13.010
and that was the end of his pussy getting career.
He had no idea,
had no idea.

1308
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.720
She has to do with this big six foot,

1309
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:21.980
four inch fucking red quarter roid gap jeans,

1310
01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:26.720
big stupid tag on the back gap.

1311
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.130
It's like,
don't you notice that everybody else has says Levi Strauss.

1312
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:33.080
That's what you want to have on.

1313
01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:37.610
And then the couple of kids whose dads have mafioso connections,

1314
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:41.810
there's actually actually have guests jeans,
you know,

1315
01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.630
which in my world was chick jeans back then.
Um,
anyways,

1316
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:50.330
I'm getting off the fucking beaten track.
So anyways,
so we will look,

1317
01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.030
we're going through all these,
these high end fucking stores.

1318
01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:55.850
I went into the Tom Ford store,

1319
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:58.970
some of the most beautiful suits have ever seen in my life.

1320
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:04.520
Also some of the most expensive,
but you get caught up in it.

1321
01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.020
I was actually in there because Tom Ford,

1322
01:19:09.021 --> 01:19:12.230
his entire line is not just the line.

1323
01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.260
It's like a lifestyle and it's like that dull Secchia beer guy.

1324
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:22.760
Stay thirsty.
My friends,
it's like Steve McQueen man's man.

1325
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:25.510
They had a fucking run,

1326
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.500
a cigar cutter cutter made out of like a fucking,

1327
01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.210
I was going to say a rhino horn.
It wasn't,

1328
01:19:32.211 --> 01:19:37.211
it was an ox horn and ox horn cigar cutter are the most manliest fucking things

1329
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:41.150
I've ever seen and I'm actually thinking about buying it.

1330
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:45.890
I'm holding this fucking ox horn.
You know,

1331
01:19:45.891 --> 01:19:49.370
they had a ram horn cigarette lighter.
I'm not even lying.
I'm not even joking.

1332
01:19:50.610 --> 01:19:55.100
I'm actually considering buying this fucking thing.
Fortunately,

1333
01:19:55.101 --> 01:19:58.520
I walked out of the store,
you know,

1334
01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:01.370
and like 10 minutes went by

1335
01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:06.350
and then I just kind of had like that little fucking gut check moment there or

1336
01:20:06.351 --> 01:20:09.000
whatever.
Kind of looking at myself like,
dude,

1337
01:20:09.001 --> 01:20:13.170
did you almost just by a fucking ox horn,
cigars cutter.

1338
01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:14.910
Did you really?
Almost too.
Did you,

1339
01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:18.870
did you get that fucking caught up in that bullshit as like,
yeah,
I did.

1340
01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.610
Couple of things kept snapping me back into reality.
Um,

1341
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.681
I don't like my,

1342
01:20:25.681 --> 01:20:29.910
I don't like buying shit made out of animals unless it's a leather jacket.

1343
01:20:29.911 --> 01:20:32.190
It's just a stupid cow ate hamburgers anyways.

1344
01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:35.790
It'd be fucking hypocritical when it fucking cows already dead.

1345
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:39.660
Why don't we go the native American route and use up this whole fucking cow?

1346
01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.600
You know?
But I don't eat ox.

1347
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:49.250
Although I did go to a Mario Batali restaurant one time and I got an ox tail

1348
01:20:49.251 --> 01:20:51.770
fucking stew or something.
I can't even remember what the fellow was,

1349
01:20:51.771 --> 01:20:52.604
but it was delicious.

1350
01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:54.350
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1351
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.420
<v 3>Uh,
but anyways,
this is just no fucking need.</v>

1352
01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:59.840
Unless the ox was already dead and you're like,
well,
we might as well

1353
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:04.460
soft.
It's fucking horns and turned it into a cigar cutter.

1354
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:09.970
Anyway,
so we get out of that thing and speaking of fucking cows,

1355
01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:16.350
so I dunno,
my girls like,
let's go get something to eat.
And I said,

1356
01:21:16.351 --> 01:21:20.640
all right,
here's a fucking Mcdonald's right there.
And she's like,

1357
01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:25.710
do you want to eat there?
And Soda was looking down at the ground,
all sad,

1358
01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:31.190
you know,
just doing that classic female manipulation thing.

1359
01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:34.850
She knew I wanted to eat there.
I just said,
there's a Mcdonald's there.

1360
01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:37.100
And then why would she say,

1361
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:40.310
do you want to eat there and look down at the ground?

1362
01:21:40.670 --> 01:21:44.930
This question is for all the young male listeners,
if my whispering podcast,

1363
01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:50.810
why would a female do that?
Do,
do,
do,
do,

1364
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:54.200
do.
I'll tell you why.
Because she doesn't want,

1365
01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.300
if not only does she not want to fucking eat there,

1366
01:21:56.570 --> 01:22:00.080
she already has a place where she wants to eat.
She's already,

1367
01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:02.590
she's already had this place that she's wanting,

1368
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:06.530
wanting to eat it for probably a month before you ever went to Vegas.

1369
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:11.240
But she's not going to tell you about it because if she tells you about it,

1370
01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:15.140
they'd give you time to do research on it and find out how fucking expensive it

1371
01:22:15.141 --> 01:22:20.090
was.
So
[inaudible] she looks down at the ground.
So immediately,

1372
01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.160
despite the fact that I know all this about females,
I take the bait.
Why?

1373
01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.200
Where do you want to eat,
sweetheart?

1374
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:31.250
I'm their fifth burger place at Mandalay Bay.

1375
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:36.320
I heard it was really nice.
Do you ever watch top chef?

1376
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:40.370
Uh,
only when you're watching it sweetheart.
I don't like that show.

1377
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:43.070
Fucking show is annoying.

1378
01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:49.100
I hate when the shift starts screaming those people fucking foreign accent.

1379
01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:54.650
You call daddy fucking grilled cheese sandwich.
Get the fuck out of my kitchen.

1380
01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:58.010
Hey.
Hey,
you think I'm fucking afraid of you?

1381
01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:02.780
You fucking Dosha.
You got a fucking problem with my grilled cheese sandwich.

1382
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:06.220
You come up like a fucking gentleman and you take me aside.

1383
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.940
They'll fucking be screaming at me.
Why get these fucking knives in my hand?

1384
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.180
Stick it right to your goddamn trachea.
What do you think about that?
Huh?

1385
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:19.600
I'll give you a fucking blow hole right out the front of your fucking neck.

1386
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:24.370
Get out of my goddamn face before I take you by your fucking hair and wash your

1387
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:28.900
face into this pile of shrimp that I haven't taken the shells off.

1388
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:33.040
So I'll give you a bunch of little razor cuts.
Sorry,

1389
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:35.470
could you actually smother somebody there?

1390
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:39.610
You know I used to work in a restaurant or I uh,
I work the mesquite grill.

1391
01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:44.440
I worked in a fancy restaurant called the sable cafe and Cary North Carolina.

1392
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:45.820
Very short lived.

1393
01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.880
It was supposed to be five star dining yet they had me working on a mesquite

1394
01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:52.240
grill.

1395
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:57.240
Glassed in with a big chef hat is all these fucking people will be looking at

1396
01:23:57.881 --> 01:24:00.270
me,
you know,

1397
01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:04.320
and I had to cook up all this shit and I was done,
you know,
burgers,
shrimp bro,

1398
01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.030
Shit's the chicken sandwiches,

1399
01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:08.970
whatever the fuck we will make in the swordfish specials.

1400
01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:10.950
And then I turned around,

1401
01:24:10.951 --> 01:24:15.150
there was a little window and I'd hand it to the fucking Metallica fan who I

1402
01:24:15.151 --> 01:24:17.310
worked with who had a stick his hair up in the hat.

1403
01:24:17.311 --> 01:24:21.570
But this pre pubescent fucking mustache,
even though he was 19,

1404
01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:25.730
that was a funny thing about that job is I'd be sitting there looking out at all

1405
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:28.860
these quote on quote elegant people in Cary,
North Carolina.

1406
01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.730
And then I'd look through the little port hole where I would stick the food

1407
01:24:32.731 --> 01:24:37.320
through to give to the fucking drug addicts on the lie.
I remember who,

1408
01:24:37.321 --> 01:24:40.800
they had a guy back there who was on a work release program.

1409
01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:45.990
Like at night he was in jail,
but it during the day he cooked it,

1410
01:24:45.991 --> 01:24:48.420
this fucking restaurant,
this guy was a douchebag.

1411
01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:53.750
And one time we went,
we were on our way to going out of business.

1412
01:24:53.751 --> 01:24:56.150
So at one time I was literally the grill chef,

1413
01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:58.790
the busboy and a dishwasher.

1414
01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:03.080
Let's not even get involved in the amount of fucking health code violations that

1415
01:25:03.081 --> 01:25:04.600
they're involved in there.
Cause I was,

1416
01:25:04.601 --> 01:25:07.610
I did not have time to wash my fucking hands,
put it that way.

1417
01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.780
Um,
so one day we was slammed,
I'm in back going,

1418
01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.110
hey,
we need some more glasses.
You know,

1419
01:25:18.111 --> 01:25:23.111
because we were running low on glasses and the fucking Douche on the work

1420
01:25:23.361 --> 01:25:27.740
release program goes,
well,
why don't we wash some Aha,

1421
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.680
a novel idea,
you know,

1422
01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:37.620
like he's fucking intelligent or something.
Uh,
a novel idea I have.

1423
01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:41.420
It was only because the guy was,

1424
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:45.410
was in fucking prison that I didn't say anything to him.

1425
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:48.830
He had that sort of credibility.
But looking back,
he was a fucking pussy.

1426
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:52.940
God Damn Little Shit.
He wasn't even that tall.

1427
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:54.470
And this is back in the day though,

1428
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:59.060
when you weren't that tall and if you weren't that tall,
you weren't that tough.

1429
01:25:59.090 --> 01:26:01.250
You were tough for a little guy,
but you are still a little guy.

1430
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:05.600
This is before Jujitsu made it to America.
There was no UFC,

1431
01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.400
you know,
remember the first fucking UFC and hoists,

1432
01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:14.360
Gracie kept fighting all those big guys and you think that he's about ready to

1433
01:26:14.361 --> 01:26:17.000
get punched in the chest and the fuck had face or whatever.

1434
01:26:17.001 --> 01:26:20.450
And then all of a sudden he grabbed that little finger and bend it back and

1435
01:26:20.451 --> 01:26:25.000
whatever the fuck he was,
did he know what he's doing?
It's like magic.
He's like,

1436
01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:25.231
oh,

1437
01:26:25.231 --> 01:26:27.520
that little guy is going to get the shit kicked out of him and the other guy and

1438
01:26:27.521 --> 01:26:31.660
be like,
I ran,
I ran,
I ran,
I ran a wreck.
So,
um,

1439
01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:34.563
<v 6>yeah.</v>

1440
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:36.263
<v 3>Isn't that hilarious?</v>

1441
01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.330
There's nothing worse than taking shit from somebody and you don't give them

1442
01:26:39.331 --> 01:26:44.040
shit back.
You know why?
Because 23 fucking laters years later,
it still bugs you.

1443
01:26:45.610 --> 01:26:48.070
You guys hit that.
There's a,
there's a great one.
If you guys want it,
you want it?

1444
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.620
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1445
01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:52.080
<v 3>You want to know where the fuck is the word?
I'm trying to say.</v>

1446
01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:56.630
If you want to participate in the podcast,
what's the law?

1447
01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:00.140
I want to find out what the longest,
like who the oldest person is on my podcast.

1448
01:27:00.141 --> 01:27:02.900
What's the longest you've held on to some shit.
All right.

1449
01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:07.901
There's one that was from 1987 88 at least 22 fucking years ago.

1450
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:12.900
It still bugs me every once in awhile I'll just pop in my head.
Well,

1451
01:27:12.901 --> 01:27:16.650
why don't we watch some glasses?
Ah,
a novel idea.

1452
01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:18.780
Hey,

1453
01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:21.930
why don't we not live a life of fucking crimes so we don't have to go to jail?

1454
01:27:21.931 --> 01:27:25.780
You fucking piece of shit.
Yeah,

1455
01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:29.550
the fuck did you do to get in jail?
You'd dumb fucking idiot.
You do.

1456
01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.740
I bet you one of those guys who pulled his shirt over his fucking head and tried

1457
01:27:32.741 --> 01:27:34.360
to rob a seven 11 on a whim.

1458
01:27:37.170 --> 01:27:39.550
That was another thing before they had really good security camera.

1459
01:27:39.551 --> 01:27:42.150
So this asshole wasn't on America's dumbest criminals.

1460
01:27:42.570 --> 01:27:45.780
I really fucking hate that guy.
Still to this day.

1461
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.790
I remember I had a math teacher one time and he goes,

1462
01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:53.210
he was asking questions and he goes,
for a number seven,

1463
01:27:53.211 --> 01:27:55.970
let's call on the dumbest kid in the room,
Bill Barr,

1464
01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:57.740
and it's still fucking bugs me.

1465
01:27:59.610 --> 01:28:04.200
That was like fucking 24 years ago.
You know what?

1466
01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:08.760
I think that that's what heaven is to me.
When I die,

1467
01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.200
I go to heaven.

1468
01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:15.060
And then there's just a line of fucking people that gave me shit throughout my

1469
01:28:15.061 --> 01:28:19.200
life and I never punched him in the face and they just come one at a time and I

1470
01:28:19.201 --> 01:28:20.100
blast them in the,

1471
01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.720
they say what they said to me then and I blast them in the face and it doesn't

1472
01:28:24.721 --> 01:28:28.960
even hurt my hand cause it's heaven,
you know?
And I always fucking win.

1473
01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:35.380
Um,
wow.
That's a lot of anger,
isn't it?
Okay,
let's plow ahead.
So I go,

1474
01:28:35.381 --> 01:28:38.350
all right sweetie,
let's fucking go up to the goddamn Mandalay bay.

1475
01:28:38.351 --> 01:28:39.310
I've never been there.

1476
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.550
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1477
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:42.290
<v 3>So anyways,
like I said,
it was,</v>

1478
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:47.350
it's run by one of the winners of Hell's kitchen or some shit.

1479
01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:53.580
And when the reality is,
is what I'm not realizing is,
um,

1480
01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.220
people who win that show,

1481
01:28:57.690 --> 01:29:00.120
I'm now really starting to believe like,

1482
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:06.230
it's like last comic standing.
You go to go to the winner of last comic standing,

1483
01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:07.940
Oh,
this guy,

1484
01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:11.540
one last comic standing and then you're going to go see some open miker who's

1485
01:29:11.541 --> 01:29:16.310
got 10 fucking minutes of material.
I'm basing that on the first season.

1486
01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.910
I don't know who won the other fucking seasons,
but it's a reality show.

1487
01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:25.070
So I imagine it,
it,
it's,
it's a fucking,
I dunno,

1488
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:29.900
somebody with like a fucking Hula hoop going around their head.

1489
01:29:29.901 --> 01:29:33.440
Somebody with some sort of hook.
God knows that's how this business works.

1490
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.700
You gotta have a hook,

1491
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:39.420
know if anything told me that it was,
uh,

1492
01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:43.710
looking at the people headlining in Las Vegas.
And that's not true.

1493
01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:46.290
There's actually some real comedians out there.
George Wallace.

1494
01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.140
I know Bobby Slayton worked out there for awhile.

1495
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:54.470
There was real comics out there,
but the guys who make the big fucking bucks,

1496
01:29:55.900 --> 01:30:00.010
they just do shit.
Well,
you know,
Uf puppets,

1497
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:05.360
how the fuck is that still entertaining in 2010?

1498
01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:08.123
<v 7>You know,</v>

1499
01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.940
<v 3>like what I can't do ventriloquism
is that right?</v>

1500
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.490
Ventriloquism is that the right word?

1501
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:17.680
You won't hear me talk without moving my fucking lips.

1502
01:30:17.681 --> 01:30:22.120
I can do that shit a there.
They had dummy.
What did you do today?

1503
01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:26.860
Yeah.
Fuck.
You'll fail your Dar than I am.
Isn't that funny?
Huh?
That dummy thing.

1504
01:30:26.861 --> 01:30:29.440
You're fucking dumb now.
Wait,
I've got to have a stupid voice,
right?

1505
01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:33.450
Take it to another level.
Who Do,
who could go Google dude.

1506
01:30:33.451 --> 01:30:36.160
Fucking sold out shows at Caesars.

1507
01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:40.870
10 million a year entertainer of the year.

1508
01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:45.640
Bill Barr and fucking ham face.

1509
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:49.450
Whatever the fuck you're fucking puppet is.

1510
01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:54.610
Why is the fucking puppet always smarter?
Can't somebody switched that up?

1511
01:30:57.330 --> 01:31:01.200
I'd be arguing with my puppet second.
The puppet started giving me shit.

1512
01:31:01.201 --> 01:31:02.760
Oh really?
You're so fucking smart.

1513
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.340
What if I take my hand out of your back now look at you.

1514
01:31:05.370 --> 01:31:08.550
He just fell on your wooden face,
didn't you?
You dumb.
Fuck.

1515
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:13.020
And I turned on the crowd.
What the fuck is wrong with you people?
What is it?

1516
01:31:13.021 --> 01:31:17.150
The 1930s.
She when you want,

1517
01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:19.550
what do you want me to do after this?
She was,
what's my fucking encore?

1518
01:31:19.551 --> 01:31:21.290
Come out here and do the Goddamn Charleston.

1519
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.050
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1520
01:31:23.050 --> 01:31:26.470
<v 3>Charleston.
I could even say it.
All right.
25 whispering minutes in.</v>

1521
01:31:26.471 --> 01:31:28.220
I'm actually starting to get a louder,
but you know what?

1522
01:31:28.221 --> 01:31:31.000
The Sun is a little higher in the sky.
They liked that.

1523
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:35.310
Did I sound like a native American?
Um,
anyways,
uh,

1524
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:38.800
so let Jesus Christ,
let's get to the fucking Mandalay bay.

1525
01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.700
So we go over to the Mandalay Bay and Oh yeah,
that,

1526
01:31:43.701 --> 01:31:48.110
that's what I'm realizing that I'm eating at an open miker is fucking
restaurant.

1527
01:31:48.111 --> 01:31:52.430
I didn't even realize that until afterwards.
I eat the Burger.

1528
01:31:53.210 --> 01:31:55.490
I got one of the Kobe beef burgers.
All right,

1529
01:31:55.491 --> 01:31:59.740
now let me say something positive about Mandalay bay.
Uh,

1530
01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:01.700
before I get out of that,

1531
01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:06.340
they had some fucking insane shows coming up at their house of Blues.

1532
01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:11.440
All right.
Joe Rogan friend of this podcast and uh,

1533
01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:13.180
he had me on his podcast last week.

1534
01:32:13.181 --> 01:32:18.181
Joe Rogan is going to be performing there on July 3rd at Mandalay Bay at the

1535
01:32:19.241 --> 01:32:23.260
house of Blues the day before the,
uh,
the big UFC fight you off.

1536
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.990
Sure job.
You're triple the woo.

1537
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:32.860
Um,
do you ever see that Joe Rogan video,
the buffer three 60.

1538
01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:37.210
You got to see that just to fucking search that there's a fucking,

1539
01:32:37.211 --> 01:32:41.860
I don't know if it's a youtube video or if it's just on his,
uh,
website,

1540
01:32:41.861 --> 01:32:46.180
Joe rogan.net per check.
That one out.
Really fucking funny video.
But anyways,

1541
01:32:46.181 --> 01:32:50.470
he's playing there and lamb of God,
if you're into that,

1542
01:32:50.471 --> 01:32:53.140
a tolerable sort of death metal,

1543
01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:58.870
that guy still sings in that fucking uh,
you know,

1544
01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:00.250
Tom waits voice.

1545
01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:05.230
Tom Waits is really the father of death metal if you listened to is the way that

1546
01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:08.170
guy sinks on a out,

1547
01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:13.450
you know,
or maybe Louis Armstrong and then it goes Louie Armstrong,

1548
01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:17.410
Tom Waits and then fucking death metal.

1549
01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:23.590
Nah,
I see trees of green red roses too.

1550
01:33:24.610 --> 01:33:28.510
Um,
anyways,
so that's the good shit at Mandalay bay.

1551
01:33:28.511 --> 01:33:30.550
The bad shit is we go to this fucking burger place,

1552
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:31.540
I can't even remember the name of it.

1553
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:36.590
We go in there and I order a $16 and 50 cent fucking Coby beef burger and

1554
01:33:39.251 --> 01:33:42.370
they're talking about how it's the greatest Goddamn Burger.
I'll,
you know,

1555
01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.420
the highest quality fucking meat,
Yadda,
fucking Yada.

1556
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:51.310
My girl orders one to 16,
15,
16,
50.
What is that?
Kids,

1557
01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:55.780
that's 33 bucks plus fries plus drinks,

1558
01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:59.560
all that bullshit.
You know,
the mob doesn't run Vegas anymore.

1559
01:33:59.561 --> 01:34:01.840
You can't go out and get yourself a $2 stake.

1560
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:06.070
The whole fucking place out there now as a God damn,
it's a fuck over.

1561
01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:11.950
So whatever cost me like 40 something bucks,
50 bucks with the goddamn tip,

1562
01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:16.900
I eat it.
You know,
it wasn't even that good.
My girls like,
how's your burger?

1563
01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:20.920
You know what I said?
I said,
it's good just keeping the peace,

1564
01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:25.960
keeping the water nice and smooth.
Nice and fucking still on the horizon.

1565
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:30.310
Okay.
So anyways,

1566
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.070
I get back to my hotel.

1567
01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:36.850
My girl already tells me she doesn't feel too good at that burger sitting in or

1568
01:34:36.851 --> 01:34:39.970
like a Goddamn boot.
And I'm like,
you know what?
I feel fine.

1569
01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:45.070
I get ready to do my show,
iron my button down shirt,

1570
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:49.160
put a little conditioner in my hair,
what's left of it,

1571
01:34:49.161 --> 01:34:54.161
shape it up a little and I head downstairs to go work the Orleans casino,

1572
01:34:55.300 --> 01:35:00.170
the last place,
Carlin ever the place where the smothers brothers retired,

1573
01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:05.960
you know,
smothers brothers who was so fucking edgy,

1574
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.320
they actually lost their sketch show during the Vietnam War.
They did sign,

1575
01:35:10.321 --> 01:35:15.140
I forget what the sketch was,
but they had the balls to say no to the network.

1576
01:35:15.141 --> 01:35:16.170
And Do,
uh,

1577
01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:22.190
a sketch that was actually criticizing what the fuck we were doing over there

1578
01:35:22.191 --> 01:35:26.780
and they lost their goddamn show.
You know,
I don't know about you guys,

1579
01:35:26.781 --> 01:35:31.070
but for me,
that's lifetime respect.
So anyways,

1580
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:35.450
I walked down there and I'm going through the Orleans casino and then all of a

1581
01:35:35.451 --> 01:35:40.190
sudden it just fucking hits me.
Boom,
right in my stomach.
Like some capsule,

1582
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:42.350
some time release.
CIA,

1583
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:45.680
you're going to shit your pants fucking capsule goes off.

1584
01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:51.040
And I know there is no question that whatever I just ate was not good for my

1585
01:35:51.261 --> 01:35:51.741
body.

1586
01:35:51.741 --> 01:35:56.741
And it was about to reject it one way or the other without getting crude people,

1587
01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.680
when something goes into your stomach,
if it's coming out,

1588
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:04.490
it only has two options.
All right.

1589
01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:12.320
Anyways,
I just thought of a really,

1590
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:15.800
really bad joke for the fucking third one,
and I'm not going to say it,

1591
01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:20.570
but it involved stabbing yourself in the stomach and you can fill in the blanks

1592
01:36:20.571 --> 01:36:24.920
on that one.
All right.
So anyways,
um,

1593
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:30.230
Tommy,
he gotta be fucking,
you gotta be shitting me,
no pun intended.

1594
01:36:30.231 --> 01:36:33.050
So I go in the back way.

1595
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:36.750
The same way that Carlin used to go in,
cause I've already taught,

1596
01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.860
asked everybody every fucking question literally is how much I'm into Carlin.

1597
01:36:40.130 --> 01:36:43.700
How did he leave?
Did he hang out now?
We'd say good night.

1598
01:36:43.701 --> 01:36:47.150
And he would go right out the door and he'd be in the car and he wasn't

1599
01:36:47.151 --> 01:36:50.690
difficult to work with.
I guess he had arthritis at the end of his life.
And uh,

1600
01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.630
the sound guy was saying one show,

1601
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:57.700
he forgot to take the bottle caps off the water bottles and he saw the car loan

1602
01:36:57.741 --> 01:37:01.790
was struggling with them and when he got off because George,
I'm so sorry.

1603
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:05.220
I'm so sorry George.
Just like whack man.
AL,
come on,
come on.

1604
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:07.160
I don't give a shit that worry and just walked out.
I guess.

1605
01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:11.960
He was a really great guy.
So anyways,
I'm walking through this legendary door

1606
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:17.630
and uh,
you know,
and what's worse is like,
I know what's going to happen,

1607
01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.740
but I know it's not going to happen for like another 15 minutes.

1608
01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:27.190
And coincidentally the fucking show starts in 15 minutes and I'm going on first.

1609
01:37:28.410 --> 01:37:30.710
All right.
And this guy,

1610
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:34.460
when you're backstage literally says 20 minutes til show time,

1611
01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:37.820
20 minutes til show time.
He like counts it down.

1612
01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.250
I never get nervous before shows,

1613
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.040
but this guy counting down the show is making me nervous.

1614
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:48.710
15 minutes till showtime.
Okay.
And it's starting to get worse and fuck it.

1615
01:37:48.711 --> 01:37:53.210
Get literally gets down to two minutes before showtime.
And I'm questioning,

1616
01:37:53.211 --> 01:37:57.750
can I make it through a half set?
And I was like,
you know what?

1617
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:01.800
Fuck this.
The show can't start without me.

1618
01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:06.450
My opening music is Elvis Presley.
Anyways,
the fuck do I care?

1619
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:11.270
They can listen to that song I'm going robe with Google's lose your long blur.

1620
01:38:11.271 --> 01:38:16.210
Her
slam before,
conform yourself.
The fucking sink.
A Ho,

1621
01:38:16.211 --> 01:38:19.920
Ho Hoo.
I don't give a shit.
And I said fuck it.

1622
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:24.090
And I fucking ran into the bathroom.
And a,

1623
01:38:24.091 --> 01:38:27.180
I will spare you the details,
but you know,

1624
01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:29.610
when something either amazing

1625
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:35.250
or uh,
something amazing happens,
they make a statue.

1626
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.720
If something horrific happens,
a lot of times they will preserve the area.

1627
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:45.630
You know,
like Dealey Plaza fucking president gets his brains blown out.

1628
01:38:45.631 --> 01:38:48.900
All of a sudden.
We can't change one blade of fucking grass.

1629
01:38:50.610 --> 01:38:54.000
The horror that happened in that fucking bathroom,
ladies and gentlemen,

1630
01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:58.080
I never do shit jokes.
They should have retired that fucking bathroom.

1631
01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.590
That's it.
They should've just fucking,
uh,

1632
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:07.630
air sealed it and just put a glass fucking door.
Two people could look in,

1633
01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:13.200
in,
in,
and realize why they closed that fucking burger joint at the Mandalay bay.

1634
01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.060
And,
uh,
I got to met.
Dude,
I haven't,
this is Monday.

1635
01:39:18.090 --> 01:39:20.370
I'm finally back to normal.

1636
01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:25.080
So there you go.
There's my big shit story.

1637
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:30.230
I had a burger over at the fucking Mandalay bay and it almost ruined my fucking

1638
01:39:32.281 --> 01:39:36.480
show over at the Orleans.
So if you guys saw me,
anybody saw me Saturday night.

1639
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.651
All right,

1640
01:39:37.651 --> 01:39:41.130
you want to talk about a professional because I extra fucking killed on that

1641
01:39:41.131 --> 01:39:45.330
show.
If you knew what the fuck happened,

1642
01:39:45.331 --> 01:39:50.331
just know that the next time you go to Vegas and you go to see Barry Manilow and

1643
01:39:53.161 --> 01:39:54.780
he's singing that song.
Mandy,

1644
01:39:55.650 --> 01:40:00.630
you something you've summed and then you sat there,
but I still want to fuck you.

1645
01:40:00.631 --> 01:40:02.190
Oh,
Mandy.
Right.

1646
01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:07.740
Just know that he could have just been shitting his fucking brains out two

1647
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:12.741
minutes before he put on his ray on fucking slacks with his horrific plastic

1648
01:40:13.171 --> 01:40:15.780
surgery is yanked back face.

1649
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:20.700
I bet you know I was going to say he d and another face lift if he fucking shit

1650
01:40:20.701 --> 01:40:24.420
the way I did before my show.
But that's actually not true.
There's no strain.

1651
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:29.310
There was no straining.
Um,
anyways.
All right bill.
Jesus Christ.

1652
01:40:29.311 --> 01:40:32.040
Enough already.
So anyways,

1653
01:40:32.041 --> 01:40:34.710
one of the things I like to do when I go out to Vegas as I like to check out

1654
01:40:34.711 --> 01:40:36.150
some of the acts that are out there,

1655
01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:41.690
because Las Vegas is a viable option for a standup comedian.

1656
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:47.640
Um,
if things aren't going well for you in,
uh,
in Hollywood,

1657
01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:53.600
but you're a huge draw is you can actually go out there like,

1658
01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:58.360
uh,
you know,
some of the comedians that are out there,
I won't name names,

1659
01:40:58.361 --> 01:41:02.140
but they're making a ridiculous amount of money,

1660
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:06.550
you know,
3 million,
four,
five,

1661
01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:10.870
$7 million contracts
for the year.

1662
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:15.130
And you don't have to travel,
you don't have to go on the road or nothing.

1663
01:41:15.131 --> 01:41:19.180
And believe me,
I have thought about it.
I've thought about it.

1664
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:22.870
It's like you fucking kidding me.
4 million.
I'd stay out there for a year.

1665
01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.060
I just do it.
I get a fucking,
I think I already talked about this.
I'd have a,

1666
01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.720
a,
a,

1667
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:35.210
this is how I had a plan.
I was going to have a fucking,

1668
01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.520
a really fucking slamming house that I would rent and then I would make the

1669
01:41:40.971 --> 01:41:44.090
casino,
give me a car service and I would just have him pick me up,

1670
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:48.890
drive me to the Gig,
walk right in the back door,
like Carlin do my show and walk.

1671
01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.920
That's probably why I did it.
I fucking walked right back out,

1672
01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:55.520
give me the car and I get the fuck outta there,
you know,

1673
01:41:55.521 --> 01:41:59.030
that way I wouldn't get sick of the casinos or any of that type of shit or at

1674
01:41:59.031 --> 01:42:00.110
least it would take longer.

1675
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:05.000
But someone was telling me that Celine Dion actually has it down and yes,

1676
01:42:05.001 --> 01:42:08.060
I am comparing myself to Celine Dion.
Cause sometimes,

1677
01:42:08.061 --> 01:42:10.430
I don't know if you guys notice when I'm really feeling a joke,

1678
01:42:10.431 --> 01:42:14.150
I start punching myself in the chest.
Um,

1679
01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:21.530
her fucking music is horrific.
She's like the white version of Beyonce,
you know,

1680
01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.010
where she's really successful.
I'd actually fucker,

1681
01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:28.430
but the sound of her voice makes me want to just fucking kill myself,

1682
01:42:29.690 --> 01:42:33.710
you know?
I mean how hard is Beyonce?
But her voice is fucking,

1683
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:38.120
it's beyond horrific.
It's like,
it's unacceptable.

1684
01:42:39.170 --> 01:42:43.250
Doesn't she sound like she's singing like two octaves higher than she should be?

1685
01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:48.390
Okay.
The worst is when you're in like a restaurant and they just have it on.

1686
01:42:48.391 --> 01:42:51.090
It's sort of low volume and the background and you're like,

1687
01:42:51.091 --> 01:42:52.650
is someone choking on their food?

1688
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:55.560
Actually that would make sense because that would mean that you could actually

1689
01:42:55.561 --> 01:42:59.760
get air out.
Is somebody sort of choking on their food?

1690
01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:05.460
Is there a an s and m couple
in the corner booth

1691
01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:12.720
and the dude is applying just enough pressure.
All right.

1692
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:17.370
Whatever.
Um,
anyway,
she had it down the best.

1693
01:43:17.371 --> 01:43:20.070
Celine Dion like she would live,

1694
01:43:20.130 --> 01:43:24.330
she had a helicopter pick her up at her fucking house.

1695
01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:31.030
She land on top of the casino.
Right?
You guys don't understand that.

1696
01:43:31.031 --> 01:43:32.420
How much of a dream this is,

1697
01:43:32.690 --> 01:43:37.690
any performer who's listening to this is fucking is got a fucking hard on at

1698
01:43:38.781 --> 01:43:42.020
this point.
This is the ultimate.
All right.

1699
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:47.050
Other than just having a fucking evil twin robot who always kills and just goes

1700
01:43:47.121 --> 01:43:49.640
out and does your shows,
you know,

1701
01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:54.340
and the
fucking helicopter would pick her up at the house,

1702
01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.260
Flyer over to the casino,
land on top of the casino,

1703
01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:02.650
and then she would just go down,
go out,
sing,

1704
01:44:02.890 --> 01:44:07.890
punch herself in the chest and then just fucking get back on the helicopter and

1705
01:44:08.621 --> 01:44:09.454
ride back.

1706
01:44:10.150 --> 01:44:15.150
Do you realize that means she was doing her vocal warmup in like our bathroom,

1707
01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:16.961
you know,

1708
01:44:16.961 --> 01:44:21.760
and like five seconds later or whatever as she sat in her kitchen eating fucking

1709
01:44:21.761 --> 01:44:26.730
fruit loops or some shit.
You know,
toto,
toto,
toto,
toto,
toto,

1710
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:31.810
20 hit the fucking
sound of those helicopter blades out,
dude.
I,

1711
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:36.560
we'd be listening to the theme from Mash.
Bad,
bad at and a,

1712
01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:38.013
you know,

1713
01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:41.830
or maybe some of that music that they listened to when like apocalypse now.

1714
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:45.490
What were some of the music that they listened to?

1715
01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:48.670
Was that the one at one of those war movies where they would listen to the
doors?

1716
01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:54.120
This is the end Doodoodoo my Olay Freddy.

1717
01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.610
And you probably wonder why bill,
what the fuck are you singing so much for

1718
01:44:59.350 --> 01:45:02.380
on your podcast this week?
I'll tell you why.
Because,
uh,

1719
01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:04.320
I went out to Vegas and uh,

1720
01:45:04.330 --> 01:45:09.330
I saw a group out there that was selling out and it was frustrating to me how

1721
01:45:09.341 --> 01:45:13.540
much people like singers.
This group had the worst fucking name

1722
01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:20.160
of any group I've ever seen in my life.
I right,

1723
01:45:20.170 --> 01:45:23.260
it was four people,
three guys and one girl.

1724
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:29.070
All with like the fucking face lifts face yanked back to fucking hair dyed all

1725
01:45:29.141 --> 01:45:33.790
well into their 50s except for one of them who might've been 38.

1726
01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:37.570
And I thought they were an acapella group.
They're not,

1727
01:45:37.571 --> 01:45:42.571
they sing and they have a band there and the name of the group was vocal soup.

1728
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:50.710
Vocal soup.

1729
01:45:52.210 --> 01:45:54.880
Is that not the most disgusting fucking name

1730
01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:01.340
you've ever fucking heard who came up with that vocal soup?

1731
01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:06.740
So I'm like,
I have to go.
I have to go on Youtube,
look them up,

1732
01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.580
look up vocal soup and click on vocal soup and concert

1733
01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:17.180
and I'm going to sing you some of their lyrics.
They sing vocals soup.

1734
01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.190
Yeah.
Yeah.

1735
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.800
You take four cool voices and you make them high and he carried everything you

1736
01:46:24.801 --> 01:46:26.780
get.
You get vocal soup.

1737
01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.820
How fucking gross as that.

1738
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.520
It just makes you gag just to think of it.
And the in the fucking lyrics,

1739
01:46:37.521 --> 01:46:40.880
they do nothing to try to make it less gross.

1740
01:46:42.490 --> 01:46:47.380
There's actually a line in that then they're stupid theme song that you won't

1741
01:46:47.381 --> 01:46:52.381
stop slurping till you're burping up focal soup and the end of the video,

1742
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.630
I shit you not speaking of Shit,

1743
01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:01.110
which is the reoccurring theme of this podcast.

1744
01:47:01.410 --> 01:47:06.410
They actually have an animated bowl of soup that is shit Brown.

1745
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:11.860
It looks like a bowl of fucking diarrhea.
I know it's gross,
but,
um,

1746
01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:13.650
I have to accurately describe it.

1747
01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:17.130
And they have notes coming out of it with the steam

1748
01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:22.410
vocal soup.
Ah,

1749
01:47:22.411 --> 01:47:24.690
it's fucking horrific vocal soup.

1750
01:47:24.691 --> 01:47:27.300
And this is what killed me is the one guy in the band,

1751
01:47:27.301 --> 01:47:32.100
the rocker is actually this guy from the group foreigner.

1752
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:37.640
And it's just like,
okay,
whatever.
You know,
I dunno.

1753
01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:42.310
Foreign is broke up right now and you had a bad deal.
Some behind the music shit,

1754
01:47:42.311 --> 01:47:44.170
you need money a,
I respect it.

1755
01:47:44.770 --> 01:47:48.550
But how the fuck did you sign off on vocal soup?

1756
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.850
Former person that was in Farner,
you know,
you know,

1757
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:56.170
you didn't,
you didn't speak up like,
hey guys,
you know,

1758
01:47:56.171 --> 01:48:00.520
I don't want a big league anybody,
you know,
but I,

1759
01:48:00.521 --> 01:48:04.150
I wasn't a band that not,
not only sold out arenas,

1760
01:48:04.151 --> 01:48:05.680
not only had a number one record,

1761
01:48:05.681 --> 01:48:08.830
but I want it to say we actually had a pretty cool fucking name.

1762
01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.520
I think we can do better than vocal soup.

1763
01:48:15.230 --> 01:48:16.063
I mean,

1764
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:20.600
I don't want to go the hacky route here with like what will be your,

1765
01:48:20.601 --> 01:48:24.620
the rube shoots,
what were the other options?
Throat Puke.

1766
01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:33.390
<v 7>Ah,</v>

1767
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:36.540
<v 3>fucking throat puke.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1768
01:48:37.230 --> 01:48:41.370
You won't stop yakking until you fucking burping up stomach acid.

1769
01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.280
It's fucking horrific.
But of course they sell out.

1770
01:48:44.281 --> 01:48:45.960
They sell out and everybody loves him.

1771
01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:51.150
And I guess the piano player worked with Frank Sinatra for 10 fucking years and

1772
01:48:51.151 --> 01:48:54.750
he also signed off on vocal soup.

1773
01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:00.950
Ugh.
It's just,
I dunno,

1774
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:04.440
but they sell out,
you know,
that's what the fuck happens in Vegas.
And it really,

1775
01:49:04.441 --> 01:49:08.970
you know,
Vegas will really help you understand this business as a performer.

1776
01:49:08.971 --> 01:49:13.971
Like why good things don't make it and why shit makes it.

1777
01:49:14.290 --> 01:49:15.900
Oh,
you've got to do is fucking go out there,
you know,

1778
01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:20.850
put a fucking toilet seat on your head.
Toilet seat head.
Yeah.

1779
01:49:20.851 --> 01:49:25.260
Yeah.
If you don't have a toilet and you want to take a fuck and shit,

1780
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:31.170
I'm all right.
I think that says I'm running out of fucking steam here.
Uh,

1781
01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:35.410
let's recommend some youtube videos here.
Um,

1782
01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.770
youtube video.
I already told you to check out vocal soup.
Oh,

1783
01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:42.970
it's just making me sick to my stomach to continue to say that name a youtube

1784
01:49:42.971 --> 01:49:45.010
video.
Look up.
Best cry ever.

1785
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:48.183
<v 7>MMM.</v>

1786
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:53.290
<v 3>It's unbelievable.
And then of course,
you gotta hit the auto tune remix of it.</v>

1787
01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:57.460
It really is the best,
uh,
one ever.

1788
01:49:57.470 --> 01:50:01.180
But don't look at the Popeye's chicken one.
I hate when they people do those,

1789
01:50:01.181 --> 01:50:05.830
that racist Shit,
you know.
Um,
anyways,

1790
01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:10.030
um,
and then there's another one.
This is just an uncomfortable podcast.

1791
01:50:10.031 --> 01:50:11.920
I talked to you about my bodily functions.

1792
01:50:12.130 --> 01:50:16.120
I brought up vocal soup and just for the Trifecta of disgusting,

1793
01:50:16.121 --> 01:50:18.550
it's usually not,
it's never been this disgust.
And this,
this,

1794
01:50:18.551 --> 01:50:22.720
I'm going to nominate this one for the most disgusting podcast of all time.
Um,

1795
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:27.020
and this is the cherry on top here at the last youtube video,
uh,

1796
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.230
is chimp rapes frog.

1797
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:34.510
It's really fucking,
I actually had to shut it off.

1798
01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.220
I had to shut it off.
Um,

1799
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:43.230
it started off is sort of funny and then it's bizarre.

1800
01:50:43.290 --> 01:50:46.710
And then the people in the background who are filming it are so fucking dumb

1801
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:50.670
that you,
you can't,
uh,

1802
01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:56.420
I dunno.
They just,
he just listened to them.

1803
01:50:56.421 --> 01:50:59.690
And you hear that their parents and you know,

1804
01:50:59.691 --> 01:51:04.040
you realize why we shouldn't have tried to stop the swine flu,
swine flu.

1805
01:51:04.041 --> 01:51:07.070
I can't even talk.
Sorry.
I'm tying to talk and type at the same time.

1806
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:12.020
And here's something new.
Here's,
here's the fucking cool old car

1807
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:15.700
of the week.
Go on.
Um,

1808
01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:21.500
go on youtube and look up a Nash Metropolitan.

1809
01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.900
Now I'm sure people made fun of this and you're going to be like,

1810
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:26.540
of course you like this car bill because you drive a fucking Prius,

1811
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:30.530
which you got to check this.
This car was a fucking Badass car.

1812
01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.890
When they will make an all these huge cars back in the day,

1813
01:51:33.891 --> 01:51:38.000
they made this little fucking car.
I don't know.
Check it out.

1814
01:51:38.001 --> 01:51:42.170
Tell me what you think about it.
Some people like redid theirs.
Um,

1815
01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.850
I know it's not a fucking Mclaren.
Don't be a cunt.
Just check it out.

1816
01:51:46.851 --> 01:51:51.350
It's a cool fucking car.
Um,
by,
uh,
international,

1817
01:51:51.351 --> 01:51:55.700
I guess national international is somehow combined or something.

1818
01:51:55.701 --> 01:51:57.620
I don't know what happened.
They became American motors.

1819
01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:01.100
I really should have looked that part up.
Puts a fucking cool car.

1820
01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.440
It's got three on the tree,
you know,

1821
01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:08.400
you know the old school cars where you had like the uh,
you know,
the,

1822
01:52:08.690 --> 01:52:11.280
uh,
if it was an automatic,
the park neutral,
reverse drive,

1823
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:14.730
all that shit was right on the steering column.
Uh,

1824
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:18.220
I think last time they made a car with,
if it was at,

1825
01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:21.000
it was a standard and you shifted up there.

1826
01:52:21.001 --> 01:52:24.510
They called it three on the tree and I'd never even heard of that until I was

1827
01:52:24.511 --> 01:52:28.530
like fucking 25 years old because those cars were long gone.
But this thing,

1828
01:52:28.531 --> 01:52:32.100
three on the fucking tree,
check it out,
a Nash Metropolitan.

1829
01:52:33.150 --> 01:52:35.940
And you know what that's going to be it for the whispering podcast this week.

1830
01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:38.970
And maybe it was a good thing that I whispered it because it was so fucking

1831
01:52:38.971 --> 01:52:43.380
disgusting.
Let me,
uh,
let me hype some of my gigs coming up here.
Uh,

1832
01:52:43.381 --> 01:52:46.160
let me go to the official website of bill.
I'm going to be a,

1833
01:52:46.161 --> 01:52:48.740
the next kick I have.
I'm not working again until,
uh,

1834
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:54.660
I actually have a July 12th on my website,

1835
01:52:54.661 --> 01:52:57.780
but I have to change that.
I don't get to Montreal till the 13th people.

1836
01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.070
July 13th through the 17th.
I'm going to be in Montreal,
Canada.

1837
01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:07.400
Speaking of cities that riot after they win or lose,

1838
01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:09.690
just like Los Angeles,

1839
01:53:10.590 --> 01:53:15.590
another sports town of fucking animals who attack police officers and tip over

1840
01:53:16.441 --> 01:53:21.020
cars,
even if they fucking win,
win or loose.
Um,

1841
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:25.470
I'm going to be up at the Montreal comedy festival,
the just for laughs festival.

1842
01:53:26.130 --> 01:53:28.860
I'm doing my new one hour of material.

1843
01:53:30.210 --> 01:53:34.620
So while you fucking frogs up there,
who want to pretend like you're from Paris,

1844
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:40.380
I'm speaking of that shit.
Uh,
I love the,
uh,

1845
01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:44.820
my actually gonna burn a job,
Burnett show.
How many fucking listeners do I have?

1846
01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:48.150
Actually,
you know what,
my,
uh,

1847
01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:51.940
the guy who actually set up my entire,

1848
01:53:51.941 --> 01:53:56.941
a podcast player told me a week ago that as of the beginning of this month told

1849
01:54:02.381 --> 01:54:04.720
me this a week ago,
I had 1 million,

1850
01:54:04.721 --> 01:54:08.320
3000 something downloads of my podcast.

1851
01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:12.450
Do you want a,
do you fucking understand that for a second?

1852
01:54:12.451 --> 01:54:14.100
Let's think about that for a second.

1853
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:17.760
If I charged a dollar a podcast,

1854
01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:22.560
I wouldn't have to do this fucking podcast anymore.
That's actually bullshit.

1855
01:54:22.561 --> 01:54:24.060
First of all,
people wouldn't have,
you know,

1856
01:54:24.061 --> 01:54:27.270
I know a lot of people go back and they download all 150.

1857
01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:32.460
And if it was a buck a piece they wouldn't,
but if I charged a dime a piece,

1858
01:54:32.461 --> 01:54:36.390
I would add a hundred grand,
hundred fucking grand,

1859
01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:41.580
you know,
that's almost as much as focal soup makes a night.

1860
01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:47.940
All right.
So anyways,

1861
01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.690
maybe I'll do that.
Maybe I'll charge like a fucking dime.

1862
01:54:52.230 --> 01:54:54.720
Cause if you didn't notice from the,
uh,

1863
01:54:56.410 --> 01:55:01.180
from the story I was telling you about working Vegas and not having to do the

1864
01:55:01.181 --> 01:55:02.350
road and that type of thing,

1865
01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.420
that's what happens to perform is after awhile is it's not the doing of the

1866
01:55:07.421 --> 01:55:07.840
show.

1867
01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.840
It's the fucking travel and you try to figure out how the fuck I can get off the

1868
01:55:13.361 --> 01:55:17.380
road.
Initially the road seems like a cool,
fun thing to do when it is,

1869
01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:22.180
but then as you get older and you've been pretty much everywhere,
uh,

1870
01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:26.950
you try to look for ways.
What'd you guys do?
If I charge 10 cents now,

1871
01:55:26.951 --> 01:55:28.510
what would that be?
10 cents.

1872
01:55:28.511 --> 01:55:30.670
You guys are really going to expose me for how dumb I am.

1873
01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:36.300
That means you can download the entire podcast for 53 fucking years for 15

1874
01:55:37.691 --> 01:55:40.480
bucks,
you know,

1875
01:55:41.710 --> 01:55:46.200
be $15.
I'd have a hundred grand in my pocket.

1876
01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:51.750
Granted it would go down to like fucking 50 after the Goddamn government came

1877
01:55:51.751 --> 01:55:54.030
in.
But you know what?
You know what that would do?

1878
01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:58.500
That would buy me a nude fucking dodge challenger.
The fucking top of the line,

1879
01:55:58.501 --> 01:56:03.240
one with the fucking stripe on it and shit.
Um,
don't worry,

1880
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:04.740
I'm not,
I'm not going to charge a dime,

1881
01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:07.210
but what I am going to do is I'm going to start,
I'm,

1882
01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:11.850
I'm at the beginning of guilting you guys into buy my new DVD.
Okay?

1883
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:15.820
Just for the simple fact,
dad,

1884
01:56:15.821 --> 01:56:17.890
I don't charge for this motherfucker.
I am real.
I am.

1885
01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:21.070
I am going to let you guys know that I'm going to guilt you motherfuckers.

1886
01:56:21.610 --> 01:56:22.990
All right,
pay it forward.

1887
01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:28.520
And it's not that you can't just buy one of my DVDs.
You got to buy two,

1888
01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:32.900
one for yourself to show all your friends and then you've got to buy the second

1889
01:56:32.901 --> 01:56:37.580
one for somebody that you don't really like,
but you have to buy him a gift.

1890
01:56:37.581 --> 01:56:40.160
It's a great fucking gift.
You know your boss,

1891
01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:44.600
you have conti fucking sister in law,
you know,

1892
01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:48.350
and you have to get him a gift cause they get you a gift as that's a great gift

1893
01:56:48.351 --> 01:56:52.460
to get is my fucking DVD.
It's only fucking 20 bucks.

1894
01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:53.601
There you go.

1895
01:56:53.601 --> 01:56:58.601
You can't shut your face and watch this guy trash women for an hour.

1896
01:56:59.810 --> 01:57:03.520
Um,
that's it everybody.
That's the podcast for this week.
I uh,

1897
01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:07.660
apologize that it was so fucking graphic.
I usually don't tell shit stories,

1898
01:57:07.661 --> 01:57:11.170
shit jokes,
bodily feel fluid stories.
But uh,
it happened.

1899
01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:13.090
What do you want from me?
But anyways,

1900
01:57:13.091 --> 01:57:16.600
I want to thank the Orleans casino if I have on me.
I had a fucking great time.

1901
01:57:16.601 --> 01:57:19.960
If you go out to Vegas,
go to the Orleans casino,
you know,

1902
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:24.040
if you a little more mature and you don't want to deal with those fucking whores

1903
01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:28.020
walking around.
Oh Hey,
I gotta,

1904
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:31.690
I gotta give you guys the name of this fucking thing.
I actually,

1905
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:36.310
I'm not one of these guys who's into art.
Really.
Bill,

1906
01:57:36.490 --> 01:57:41.350
you just did a fucking shit joke for fucking 45 minutes.
You guys,

1907
01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:46.120
next time you go out to Vegas,
go out to the Peter Lick.
Um,

1908
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:51.730
gallery gallery,
Peter Lik L.
I k this guy takes pictures of,

1909
01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:52.630
of uh,

1910
01:57:53.530 --> 01:57:58.420
like beautiful scenes in nature and he uses this camera from like the 1930s that

1911
01:57:58.510 --> 01:58:02.770
it literally takes a minute for the camera to take a picture.
And obviously,

1912
01:58:02.771 --> 01:58:05.650
I don't know shit about photography,
but I don't know what he does.

1913
01:58:05.651 --> 01:58:08.260
He opened something,
it's wide open and he hits it.

1914
01:58:08.710 --> 01:58:10.930
And because it takes so long to take the picture,

1915
01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:13.840
it gets all these unbelievable colors.

1916
01:58:14.170 --> 01:58:19.100
It literally looks like an HD TV picture.
And,
uh,

1917
01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:23.080
they stick you in these rooms and with these dimmers and what they do is they

1918
01:58:23.081 --> 01:58:28.080
dim the lights down.
You,
it looks like the sun is going to,

1919
01:58:28.081 --> 01:58:32.630
I can't explain it,
but there they have a gallery in Mandalay bay,

1920
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:37.580
the Venetian and the,
uh,
that mall,
that covered mall there

1921
01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:43.030
at Caesar's palace.
Definitely check that out.
If you're going out to Vegas,

1922
01:58:43.031 --> 01:58:43.864
Peter Lik,

1923
01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:49.500
you know when you're done checking out Joe Rogan at the House of Blues July 3rd,

1924
01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:54.440
go to the,
uh,
all you could do that.
Go up there.
Don't get a hamburger.

1925
01:58:54.710 --> 01:58:58.880
Check out the Peter Lick,
uh,
pictures and have them sit you down

1926
01:59:00.650 --> 01:59:00.981
in one of the,

1927
01:59:00.981 --> 01:59:03.980
in one of the rooms and have them dim the fucking lights to check it out,
man.

1928
01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:07.640
Peter Lik,
man,
it's the shit.
All right.
That's it.
