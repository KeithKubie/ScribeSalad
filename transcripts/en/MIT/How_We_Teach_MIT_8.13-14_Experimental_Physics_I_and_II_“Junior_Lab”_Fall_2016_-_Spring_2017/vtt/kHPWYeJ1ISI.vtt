SEAN ROBINSON: Some
of the students

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.250
in junior lab come in with
some experience on how

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.840
to use the equipment, basic
equipment like oscilloscopes,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.920
voltmeters, function
generators, things like that.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.560
Some of them have never
seen those things before.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.017
So there's a learning curve.

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:20.600
In fact, there's
many learning curves.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.740
There's a multi-dimensional
learning surface.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.990
Now all of these skills, no
one of them is very difficult.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.240
But having to learn many
of them simultaneously is

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.570
one of the challenges we hear
from students consistently

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.980
that they have to
have to get through.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.770
So again, we spend
about the first month

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.880
of the course with a lot of
really directed small tasks

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.760
just to get people
over the hump in these

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.610
you know many small
but multiple tasks

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.830
that they all need to learn.
