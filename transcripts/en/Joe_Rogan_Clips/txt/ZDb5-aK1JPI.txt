Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. The unintended consequences are something that I've been taken very seriously lately when I'm paying attention to technology as a, as it's used in social media. Um, particularly the one, one of the things is disturbed me quite a bit over the last few weeks is that there's a model that they use in, not intentionally, but there's a model that they use to get people upset about things, show you things in your feed that, uh, you argue against because that makes you click on them more and you engage in them more. And because of the fact that we have this advertiser based model where people are trying to get clicks because they want to get ads on their page and the more clicks they get, the more money they get from those ads. And so they want to incentivize people to go there. And the best way through the algorithm, what they've found without doing it on purpose is to get people upset and they're pushing people into these little information ghettos that are really dangerous.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Right. And we've gotten to this point where this is just an accepted part of our lives that you go to check your Google feed or your Facebook feed and all, but what the fuck are they doing? Is this real? They're going to pass this. Yeah. Goddammit. And then you get mad and then you engage with people online and then it results in more revenue. But getting them to stop that. If you had to go to Facebook and say, hey, hey mark Zuckerberg and know you have fucking $100 billion or whatever you got, but you can't make any more money this way. Right. Because what you're doing is fucking up society. Yeah. Cause you're encouraging dissent. You're encouraging people to be upset and arguments and you're doing it at great financial reward, but great societal costs. Yeah. So stop. Yeah. And he's not going to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Right. Well, he may not do it. That comes back to the point about regulation did the question is how big is your stick? One of the guys who was the founder of faces yes. Is now coming out and saying, hey, Facebook needs to be broken up. And then he was one of the original founders and he's like, it has gotten so far out of hand, it's so far away from where it is. It's literally affecting global politics. Yeah, well it is. And so one option is to break it up that it seems to have worked pretty well with at t and T. Um, another option is to regulate it, which I is in my mind would be a better approach. And that is to say, here's what's okay and here's what's not okay. And this stuff is really intricate. You have to really get down beneath these algorithms, which are unbelievably complex.

Speaker 1:          02:24          But you're exactly right. I mean, what we're seeing now is we are being pushed into it. I said information ghettos, but it's like information barricades and so pushed into camps. Which camp are you on? It's so dangerous because the old, I mean this, this country is based on not everybody agreeing that having a process where people come and they work it out and they say, you know, I'm not perfectly happy with this outcome, but here's a compromise and if we can't compromise and our, our civic culture is going to break down and there's so much, I mean, people don't see these pillars that are holding up our society. I'd lived in Cambodia for two years and if you don't have civic pillars under your society, society's look very, very different. Everyone's life experiences, right? We kind of take for granted. You can go out the door, walk to Starbucks and not get shot or a, you can have your house.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Something happened, your house gets Rod, you call the police and the police aren't the ones who've robbed your house or they're not in, I mean there's all these kinds of crazy things. If we break down the foundations that underpin our lives, that's really dangerous. What I was kinda getting at was that through what this, this process of this algorithm, how this algorithm selects things that, that chose you in your feet and how people are getting upset by this and how this is generating massive amounts of revenue once it's already happened. It's very difficult to stop. And my concern would be that this would be a similar thing when it comes to genetic engineering or we're saying we need to be able to put regulations on this. We needed to be able to establish that. But once it gets out of the bag, once it gets rolling, and I have, you remember when Mark Zuckerberg sat in front of all those politicians, they had no fucking idea what they were talking about.

Speaker 1:          04:03          You make money. It's such piss, poor prepares and it just, it shows you like these are the people that are looking out for us. Good fucking luck. These are Luddites. They're dumb asses. They're fools, right? And they're, they don't know anything about, some are better and worse, but yet almost everyone was underwhelming and under impressive in that hearing, in that hearing. Yet the fact that they're dealing with one of the most important moments of our time, but they didn't bring on some sort of a like legitimate technology expert. It could explain the pitfalls. Yes. And do so in a way that the, the rest of the world's could know. So they're not going to protect us from genetic engineering either. Right. Because they are generalists in terms of their education for the most part and they're not, they're not concerned. This is not, they're concerned with raising money for their campaign.

Speaker 1:          04:47          The concern with getting reelected. That's their concerned with, yeah. I totally agree with you that if we wait to focus on this issue until it becomes a crisis, it's going to be too late because all the big decisions will have been made. The reason why I wrote this book, the reason why, you know, I'm on my almost week three of this book tour doing events like this every day is what I am saying. Every form that I can is this is really important to you. Kind of. We were watching the news yesterday. They had this royal baby in, in the UK. Like, I don't give a shit. It doesn't affect my life and anybody. But what does it play now is the future of our entire species and our democracy and our lives. And we have to be focusing on those things because we have a moment now where we can get to a certain extent influence how these revolutions play out.

Speaker 1:          05:37          And if we just wait around, if we're distracted and we're focusing on all this stuff that's sucking up our attention, and whether it's Trump or Brexit or Muller and all these things, I mean, we're spent, how much of our time are we spending focused on is fine, let's pay a little bit of attention. But there's really big stuff 50 years from now, 100 years, and no one's going to look back and say, oh, that was the age of Trump or that they're going to say that was the age when after almost 4 billion years of evolution, humans took control of their own evolutionary process. And it's huge and it's going to change all of life. And what I'm trying to do is to say everybody has to have a seat at the table. Whether you're a conservative Christian, whether you're a, a biohacking transhumanist, everybody needs to be at the table.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Because we talking about is the future of our species. We're talking about the future of our species, but are we even capable of understanding the consequences of these actions to the stuff that we're discussing like right now, or I'm not like I'm talking about it, right? If someone said, hey, you've got to go speak in front of people about the consequences of an in a very clear one hour presentation, I'd be like, no, I'm not. Well, I'm what I'm talking about. One, we can go together. So you're good. Thank you. Um, but to the reason why I've written this book hacking Darwin is I want it say if you could read just one book and it's written just for everybody in a very clear way with a lot of jokes that I think are funny. My mother laughed at them as well, that you get it.

Speaker 1:          07:01          And then once you know just the basics as a human being, anybody, it has an equal right to be part of this, of this conversation as the top scientist or the leaders of any of any countries, but would agree with you there. Yeah, but I don't think that other people are going to see it that way. I think the people that are in control, they're not going to say, hey, we need to find, we need to be fair with everyone, all the citizens of the world. How do you feel we should proceed? No, but that's why we have to, that's why we need this bottom up ground swell. But we can't have a bottom up ground swell if people, if just general people aren't even aware of what the issues are. And that's, that's the challenge. And that's why forums like yours are just so important.

Speaker 1:          07:40          I mean, you have all of these people and then you know, maybe everyone doesn't listen to this podcast. Say, all right, I get it. I can go give that hour long speech. But you can read a couple books and then you can give an an hour speech because the issues like, yes, there are scientific issues, but this isn't a conversation about science. This is about values and ethics in our future. And it has to be a conversation for everybody. Yeah. It's not just a scientific conversation. It's a conversation about the future of the species. The species will be awesome. Yeah. And that's something we're wholly unqualified. No, it's you. But here's, here's a little vote for optimism. Okay. We have never been this literate as a species for, we've never been this educated. I don't think it was if we ever been this nice either. Well, I hope so.

Speaker 1:          08:23          I really did want do, if you look at it, all the wars and all the murder that used to happen, it's actually a, this is the best time ever to be alive. Still Sucks for people that are in bad situation. But it's, yes, on average it's better. And we've never been this connected. So we have, so I am the book, I call for a species wide dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering. You think go, well, that's nuts. 7 billion people on Earth. How are they gonna how are they going to do that? But we have the opportunity and we have to try. Because you don't want, look with the beginning of the genetically modified crops here, the scientists were actually really responsible, but the regular people weren't consulted and they felt that these guys just did it to me. So if you have all the marches with genetically modified organisms, you that we are entering the era of genetically modified humans and that's going to scare the shit out of people. And so we need to start preparing and we need to make people feel that they're respected and included, and our government leaders aren't going to do it for us. So we have to find ways of engaging ourselves. And that's why with me with the book, I set up a website where people can, um, can share their views, debate with other people. I really want everybody to be part of this conversation.
