(mouse clicking)
(tinkly music)

00:00:05.218 --> 00:00:07.801
(upbeat music)

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:33.304
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:35.344
My name is Tina Sacks.

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:36.821
I'm and Assistant Professor in the

00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:38.978
School of Social Welfare,
and a member of the

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:41.615
Hitchcock Professorship Committee.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:44.068
We're pleased, along with
the Graduate Council,

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:47.422
to present Deborah Tannen,
this spring's speaker

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:51.010
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.943
As a condition of this request,

00:00:52.943 --> 00:00:56.163
we are obligated and happy to tell you

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:59.154
how the endowment came to UC Berkeley.

00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:01.288
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:01.288 --> 00:01:04.033
this campus is linked to
the history of California,

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.450
and the Bay area.

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:10.133
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.572
came to San Francisco
during the Gold Rush,

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.419
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:19.013
In 1885, Charles established
a professorship here

00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:21.324
at Berkeley, as an
expression of his long-held

00:01:21.324 --> 00:01:23.600
interest in education.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.259
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.995
still treasured in San Francisco for her

00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:32.405
colorful personality, as
well as her generosity,

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.514
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:37.839
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley.

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:41.815
Making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:43.676
The Hitchcock Fund has become one of the

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:46.989
most cherished endowments of
the University of California.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:49.335
Recognizing the highest
distinction of scholarly

00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:51.329
thought and achievement.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.142
Thank you, Lillie and Charles.

00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:56.642
And now, a few words about Deborah Tannen.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.984
Deborah Tannen's research
examines the discourse

00:01:59.984 --> 00:02:01.727
of everyday conversation,

00:02:01.727 --> 00:02:03.787
including cross-cultural
and gender differences

00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:08.617
in ways of speaking, and the
discourse of social media.

00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:10.709
A prolific scholar, Tannen has written

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.494
critically-praised books for both

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:15.050
scholarly and general audiences.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.141
Her books include, the number one,

00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:19.908
four-year New York Times Bestseller,

00:02:19.908 --> 00:02:24.569
You Just Don't Understand:
Women and Men in Conversation,

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.847
Talking From Nine to Five:
Women and Men at Work,

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:33.014
You're Wearing That?: Mothers
and Daughters in Conversation,

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.943
and You're the Only One I Can Tell:

00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:41.681
Inside the Language of
Women's Friendships.

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:45.135
Her scholarly books include,
Gender and Discourse,

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:49.157
Conversational Style, and Talking Voices:

00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:51.570
Repetition, Dialogue, and Imagery

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.903
in Conversational Discourse.

00:02:55.657 --> 00:02:57.896
Deborah Tannen earned her
BA in English Literature

00:02:57.896 --> 00:02:59.685
from Harper College.

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:03.065
Her MA in English Literature
from Wayne State University.

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:05.742
And her MA and PhD in Linguistics

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:08.040
right here at UC Berkeley.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.600
She is the recipient of
five honorary Doctorates.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.455
Since 1979, she has been on the faculty

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:17.421
of Georgetown University's
Department of Linguistics,

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:22.307
and since 1991, has held the
rank of University Professor.

00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:24.778
She has been the McGraw
Distinguished Lecturer

00:03:24.778 --> 00:03:27.580
at Princeton University,
spent a term in residence

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.791
at the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton,

00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.547
and has twice been a Fellow at the

00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:34.206
Center for Advanced Study at the

00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:36.189
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.500
She is also a member of the Board of the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.417
PEN/Faulkner Foundation.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.961
Today's lecture, in today's lecture,

00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:46.452
Tannen will draw on her
interviews with 80 women,

00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:49.410
ranging in age from nine to 97.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.720
And on her years of research,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.796
examining how ways of
talking effect relationships.

00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:57.129
To explore the role of talk among friends,

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.750
with particular focus
on women's friendships.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.601
How they compare to men's,

00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:04.497
and the consequences of such differences.

00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:06.716
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Deborah Tannen

00:04:06.716 --> 00:04:10.883
back to Berkeley.
(audience applauding)

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:28.309
- Wow, thank you!

00:04:29.964 --> 00:04:32.220
And I didn't even say anything yet.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.222
Thanks so much.

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:36.054
What a thrill, to be
back at Berkeley where,

00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:38.971
as you heard, I got my PhD in 1979,

00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:44.104
and everything that I'm gonna
be saying today, started.

00:04:46.177 --> 00:04:48.899
Tomorrow I'm gonna be
introduced by Robin Lakoff,

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:51.536
who was the reason that
I came to Berkeley.

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:54.133
And just for those of you
who won't be here tomorrow,

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:57.944
I just wanna say how much I owe to her.

00:04:57.944 --> 00:05:00.032
It was attending a course that she taught

00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:01.982
at the University of Michigan,

00:05:01.982 --> 00:05:04.899
summer of 1973 that I got the idea,

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.430
this is what I have to do
for the rest of my life.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.333
And I'm nearer to the
rest of my life right now.

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:14.641
Thank you so much for coming.

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.424
As you heard, I'm going
to be talking about

00:05:16.424 --> 00:05:18.964
the language of women's friendships.

00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:21.083
Much of what I say
though, will also be true

00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:23.899
of friendships among women and men,

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:25.732
in particular, women and gay men,

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:27.462
friendships between men.

00:05:27.462 --> 00:05:29.182
There are things about
friendships that will

00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:31.850
apply across the board.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.451
But there also are patterns that tend to

00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:36.618
distinguish friendships among women

00:05:36.618 --> 00:05:38.088
and friendships among men.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.652
And tend to is very important.

00:05:40.652 --> 00:05:42.484
Everything I say about gender,

00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:44.671
I always make a point of saying some,

00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:49.182
many, tendency, and it often
gets translated as all.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.312
Or, norms.

00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:51.466
We're not talking about norms,

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:54.322
we're not talking about 100%,

00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:57.809
but we're talking about tendencies.

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:59.821
As you heard, I interviewed a large number

00:05:59.821 --> 00:06:01.404
of girls and women.

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.578
Nine to 97.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:08.361
I heard comments like,
my friendships with women

00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.361
are as essential as air.

00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:14.317
My women friends are the most
sustaining thing in my life.

00:06:14.317 --> 00:06:16.739
I heard many, many comments like that.

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:19.689
And you heard that I wrote a book about

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:20.755
mothers and daughters.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.334
You were in that.

00:06:22.334 --> 00:06:24.797
I comment in that book, that love between

00:06:24.797 --> 00:06:27.256
mothers and daughters can be as intense,

00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:31.188
as complicated, as
passionate as romantic love.

00:06:31.188 --> 00:06:33.552
And I found in doing this research,

00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:38.152
that the same also could be
said about some friendships.

00:06:38.152 --> 00:06:41.756
But I did also hear comments like,

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:43.525
I find friendships with women difficult

00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:45.831
terrain to navigate.

00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.327
And I'm gonna try to say
something about both sides

00:06:48.327 --> 00:06:50.077
of those friendships.

00:06:51.697 --> 00:06:53.992
A woman that I talked to said,

00:06:53.992 --> 00:06:55.799
in telling me how much she would do

00:06:55.799 --> 00:06:56.801
for her friend.

00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:58.482
She said, if a friend
called at three o'clock

00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:00.790
in the morning, and said I need bail,

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.258
I'd say, can I come in my nightie?

00:07:03.258 --> 00:07:05.119
I'll be right there.

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.820
I heard a story that a woman told me about

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.987
when she was in 3rd grade.

00:07:11.407 --> 00:07:14.285
Her friends had heard, picked up,

00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:15.684
that she was going through something

00:07:15.684 --> 00:07:17.727
very difficult and challenging,

00:07:17.727 --> 00:07:20.055
and the word was out.

00:07:20.055 --> 00:07:22.753
And how her friends, this is 3rd grade,

00:07:22.753 --> 00:07:27.342
just formed a phalanx
around her, to protect her.

00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:29.244
So they didn't ask what was going on,

00:07:29.244 --> 00:07:30.961
they didn't ask details out of respect

00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:33.072
for her privacy, but if they sensed that

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:34.812
another girl was about to ask her,

00:07:34.812 --> 00:07:36.881
they would sort of close in around her,

00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:39.303
and prevent that friend, that girl,

00:07:39.303 --> 00:07:40.897
from getting close to her.

00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:42.686
And so, it was just so moving to hear

00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:47.171
how early that kind of loyalty
to friends could start.

00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:50.235
I heard about friends who
flew across the country

00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:54.124
when a friend had a loss, or an illness.

00:07:54.124 --> 00:07:57.456
Stayed for weeks, even months, to help.

00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:00.458
Friends who called every day for a year,

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:03.121
when her friend lost her husband.

00:08:03.121 --> 00:08:06.663
And friends who call every
day for no particular reason.

00:08:06.663 --> 00:08:08.144
Just to stay in touch.

00:08:08.144 --> 00:08:10.049
To know what's happening.

00:08:10.049 --> 00:08:12.382
And being in touch, and
knowing what's happening

00:08:12.382 --> 00:08:14.635
in each other's lives is often,

00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:17.248
not only what is
treasured, but also what is

00:08:17.248 --> 00:08:19.165
required of friendship.

00:08:20.343 --> 00:08:23.943
And in a way, that was
the most significant

00:08:23.943 --> 00:08:25.888
thing that I heard about over and over.

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:28.049
A friend is someone
who's available to talk

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.215
when you need to.

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:33.382
A woman told me a situation, very sad,

00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:39.050
that's not uncommon, how
terrible she was feeling

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.232
because she had lost a very close friend,

00:08:42.232 --> 00:08:44.405
life-long friend who had passed away.

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:47.188
And she said, you know, the worst thing

00:08:47.188 --> 00:08:49.023
is that I can't call her up and tell her

00:08:49.023 --> 00:08:52.321
how terrible I feel about her dying.

00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:54.714
Because that was the person she would call

00:08:54.714 --> 00:08:58.214
when she went through something like that.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.239
Comparing women's friendships to men's.

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:03.665
This is a conversation
that a woman told me

00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:06.611
she had with her son, that I think

00:09:06.611 --> 00:09:08.490
captures some of that.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.198
So this is a son, who had
recently graduated from college,

00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:14.788
was living across the country.

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:17.125
And she was asking, talking on the phone,

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:20.166
asking him about a friend
that she knew very well.

00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:22.166
And the conversation
went something like this.

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:24.347
Have you talked to Mike lately?

00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:26.705
And he said, yep, talked to him yesterday.

00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:28.347
How's he doing?

00:09:28.347 --> 00:09:29.430
I don't know.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.632
(audience laughing)
But you just talked

00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:36.299
to him, didn't he say?
Nope.

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.882
Well, how's his job?
I don't know.

00:09:39.882 --> 00:09:42.852
How's his girlfriend?
Don't know.

00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:45.335
Well, what did you talk about?

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.168
Football.

00:09:47.732 --> 00:09:49.958
Did you only talk about football?

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.208
No, soccer too.

00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:58.520
That would be fairly
unusual among women friends.

00:09:59.655 --> 00:10:02.005
And there was a man in the audience,

00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:03.387
and when I talked about this,

00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:05.746
who approached me after.

00:10:05.746 --> 00:10:07.394
And he said, you know, the same thing,

00:10:07.394 --> 00:10:08.394
it's still true.

00:10:08.394 --> 00:10:11.683
He said he and his wife
are very good friends

00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:13.595
with another couple.

00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:15.750
The wives get together,
the guys get together.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.540
And one evening, his wife said to him,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.886
isn't that terrible that
they're getting divorced?

00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:24.469
And he had no idea.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:30.081
He said they had played tennis
every week for months, years.

00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:34.248
But, he said, the topic of
his marriage never came up.

00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:38.102
And that would be surprising
among women friends.

00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:39.685
Good women friends.

00:10:41.413 --> 00:10:45.006
I teach at Georgetown
University, I teach a class

00:10:45.006 --> 00:10:48.729
called Cross-Cultural
Communication, for undergrads.

00:10:48.729 --> 00:10:51.821
And part of the course
requirement is that everybody,

00:10:51.821 --> 00:10:54.945
every week, describes some interaction

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.663
that they've been part of.

00:10:56.663 --> 00:10:58.617
They write about it, and they analyze it

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:01.576
in terms of what we have
been doing in class.

00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:03.546
Methods, theories we've been discussing.

00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:06.928
And so I wanna read you
a part of a field note.

00:11:06.928 --> 00:11:10.602
I call it field notes,
that a student wrote.

00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:13.282
This is gonna be my first sip of water,

00:11:13.282 --> 00:11:15.949
and the first of many, I'm sure.

00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:21.617
She wrote, "Saturday night after a party,

00:11:21.617 --> 00:11:25.363
"a group of us went to
Matt's house to hang out

00:11:25.363 --> 00:11:27.223
"before we went home to bed.

00:11:27.223 --> 00:11:31.580
"I, and the other girls proceeded
to sit down on the couch.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.121
"and we began talking about the night.

00:11:34.121 --> 00:11:35.320
"What we thought was fun,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.887
"what we wished had happened, et cetera.

00:11:37.887 --> 00:11:40.082
"I was in the middle of
giving my friend, Sarah,

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:43.408
"advice about a boy, when all of a sudden

00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:45.759
"the coffee table was
pushed out of the way,

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:48.024
"and the guys began to wrestle.

00:11:48.024 --> 00:11:49.486
"Throwing each other on the couch,

00:11:49.486 --> 00:11:52.142
"pushing each other off chairs.

00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:54.373
"It was funny for me to
see my big, guys friends

00:11:54.373 --> 00:11:58.258
"wrestling as if they were five year olds.

00:11:58.258 --> 00:11:59.779
"But it also struck me that this is how

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:01.445
"we chose to relax.

00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:03.671
"The girls began talking,
and the guys got up

00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:06.026
"and started play fighting."

00:12:06.026 --> 00:12:09.021
And this was something that
we had discussed in class.

00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:10.723
That those who study kids at play,

00:12:10.723 --> 00:12:14.612
do find that often boys will play fight.

00:12:14.612 --> 00:12:17.304
Girls do fight, they
just don't fight for fun.

00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:19.965
They fight when they mean it.

00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:23.265
And the girls will spend more
time sitting and talking.

00:12:23.265 --> 00:12:25.863
I was interested though,
she said it was funny

00:12:25.863 --> 00:12:28.867
to see her guy friends
acting like five year olds.

00:12:28.867 --> 00:12:31.102
But she and her girlfriends were also

00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:32.523
acting like five year olds.

00:12:32.523 --> 00:12:36.411
But they were acting
like five year old girls.

00:12:36.411 --> 00:12:38.663
She also, I was intrigued
that she made the point

00:12:38.663 --> 00:12:42.188
that she was giving her
friends advice about a boy,

00:12:42.188 --> 00:12:43.796
advice about troubles.

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:47.130
It is not at all unusual for conversations

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.167
among women, to talk about some kind

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:51.606
of problems that they're having.

00:12:51.606 --> 00:12:53.514
And there was a woman,
this is a woman in her 80s,

00:12:53.514 --> 00:12:55.502
but she remembered this story,

00:12:55.502 --> 00:12:58.502
that captured how this can function.

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:02.085
It was a conversation.

00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:04.556
The scenario was, she was quite young,

00:13:04.556 --> 00:13:08.773
she was home with her toddler little boy.

00:13:08.773 --> 00:13:11.982
Her neighbor had a
little boy, similar age.

00:13:11.982 --> 00:13:14.894
And she said, one day she
got a call from her neighbor.

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:17.755
And she was kind of upset
because her little boy

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:22.176
had dropped a jar of mayonnaise
on the kitchen floor,

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:25.246
spread the mayonnaise all over the floor,

00:13:25.246 --> 00:13:28.366
and added eggs to it, because
he was gonna make a cake.

00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:30.071
(audience laughing)

00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:33.326
What she said was, she just left the mess,

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:37.493
and came over, and we just
drank coffee and commiserated.

00:13:38.668 --> 00:13:41.300
And I love that word commiserated,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.671
because this is one of
the functions, often,

00:13:43.671 --> 00:13:46.261
that talking about troubles can have.

00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:48.066
It didn't help clean up the mess,

00:13:48.066 --> 00:13:50.409
didn't change her neighbor's situation,

00:13:50.409 --> 00:13:52.840
and yet, I'm sure they
did both feel much better

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.635
to realize that they were
both in the same boat.

00:13:55.635 --> 00:13:58.607
And here was somebody
who had a child that was

00:13:58.607 --> 00:14:02.170
similar age, and was going
through something similar.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.315
There's a term that we sometimes use,

00:14:05.315 --> 00:14:06.856
not exactly a technical term,

00:14:06.856 --> 00:14:09.110
but those of us who study conversation

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.027
call it, troubles talk.

00:14:11.913 --> 00:14:14.541
And this is a particular
kind of talk that again,

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:18.992
is more common often among
women friends than men.

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:20.851
And it seems quite universal.

00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:23.496
I have a student from Kazakhstan,

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:25.493
and she was home one summer,

00:14:25.493 --> 00:14:29.943
and interviewed women in
Kazakhstan about their friendships.

00:14:29.943 --> 00:14:32.544
And one of the women that
she interviewed there,

00:14:32.544 --> 00:14:33.561
made this comment.

00:14:33.561 --> 00:14:36.140
She said, "When you have talked to someone

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.431
"about something that's bothering you,

00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:40.816
"it's lighter on the soul.

00:14:40.816 --> 00:14:43.504
"The days seem sunnier,
and troubles step back,

00:14:43.504 --> 00:14:46.402
"and start seeming smaller."

00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:50.569
And I thought that was such
a lovely way to put it.

00:14:52.188 --> 00:14:53.677
I also though, wanna go back to something

00:14:53.677 --> 00:14:56.007
that I said about
troubles talk in the book,

00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:57.905
You Just Don't Understand, that I would

00:14:57.905 --> 00:14:59.415
put a little differently now.

00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:02.539
I don't think what I said
then was exactly right.

00:15:02.539 --> 00:15:04.891
One of the scenarios that
I wrote about in that book,

00:15:04.891 --> 00:15:06.049
that got a lot of attention,

00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:08.019
I guess it rang a lot of bells,

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:10.588
was a scenario where a
woman might tell a man

00:15:10.588 --> 00:15:12.817
about a problem that she's having,

00:15:12.817 --> 00:15:15.659
and he tells her how to fix the problem.

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:18.699
And she's frustrated, because
what I said at the time was,

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:21.565
she didn't want a solution,
she wanted to talk about it.

00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:23.442
And he's frustrated, 'cause he's thinking,

00:15:23.442 --> 00:15:25.179
why do you wanna talk
about it if you don't

00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:27.688
wanna do anything about it?

00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:29.640
And they're both frustrated
because they're trying

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.435
to be good people, and
they're being told that

00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:34.049
they're not being good people.

00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:37.617
So that's what I commented on at the time.

00:15:37.617 --> 00:15:39.415
I would say something different now.

00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:41.387
I don't think it would be correct to say

00:15:41.387 --> 00:15:43.515
she doesn't want a solution.

00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:45.570
Remember those girls on the couch.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.206
She said, I was giving my friend Sarah,

00:15:48.206 --> 00:15:49.889
advice about a boy.

00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:51.808
It's not that we don't give advice.

00:15:51.808 --> 00:15:54.636
But I think maybe she
didn't want a solution

00:15:54.636 --> 00:15:56.136
right off the bat.

00:15:57.109 --> 00:16:00.119
So, if you tell about
a problem to a friend,

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:02.898
a good friend, you might
expect something like,

00:16:02.898 --> 00:16:05.495
gee, why do you think he said that?

00:16:05.495 --> 00:16:08.136
And then, what did you say?

00:16:08.136 --> 00:16:10.171
And then, how did he respond to that?

00:16:10.171 --> 00:16:12.344
And then, what do you think you might do?

00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:14.753
And what do you think would
happen if you did that?

00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:17.108
And you ask a series of questions.

00:16:17.108 --> 00:16:19.931
And partly this 'cause
you need the information

00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:22.385
to know what advice to give.

00:16:22.385 --> 00:16:24.987
But I think there's another level, too.

00:16:24.987 --> 00:16:27.153
In much of what I write, I talk about

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:31.287
the two levels of meaning in conversation.

00:16:31.287 --> 00:16:33.263
One is the message level,

00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:35.556
and the other is the meta-message level.

00:16:35.556 --> 00:16:37.710
So the message would be
the meaning of the words,

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.834
and in case you're interested,

00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:42.665
this all comes from the
anthropologist Gregory Bateson.

00:16:42.665 --> 00:16:44.527
But he applied it somewhat differently.

00:16:44.527 --> 00:16:47.070
I apply it to conversation.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.841
The message is the meaning of the words,

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.745
but the meta-message is what
it says about the relationship,

00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:54.779
that you say these words
in this way, at this time.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:57.538
So, perhaps the problem is the message,

00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:59.869
but being willing to talk about it.

00:16:59.869 --> 00:17:03.057
To ask the questions, to
listen to the answers.

00:17:03.057 --> 00:17:07.591
To take that time to be
engaged about something

00:17:07.591 --> 00:17:09.731
that's bothering you.

00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:12.424
This sends a meta-message of caring.

00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:15.392
And I suspect that part
of the frustration,

00:17:15.392 --> 00:17:18.098
is a woman tells a man about a problem,

00:17:18.098 --> 00:17:19.099
and he gives her the solution,

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.479
isn't that she didn't want a solution,

00:17:20.479 --> 00:17:23.306
she just didn't want it right off the bat.

00:17:23.306 --> 00:17:27.759
And giving the solution
shuts down the conversation.

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:30.325
Whereas starting that
conversation was part of

00:17:30.325 --> 00:17:33.075
her motivation in bringing it up.

00:17:34.537 --> 00:17:37.949
I sometimes say as an aside,
shutting down the conversation

00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:40.998
may actually be a secondary gain for him.

00:17:40.998 --> 00:17:43.122
'Cause if he isn't used to
having conversations like that,

00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:45.755
he might not actually
appreciate having to go,

00:17:45.755 --> 00:17:48.005
get into all those details.

00:17:49.185 --> 00:17:51.807
But being interested in
it, has that meta-message

00:17:51.807 --> 00:17:53.724
that I think is valued.

00:17:54.912 --> 00:17:56.777
There's another kind of
conversation that is very

00:17:56.777 --> 00:18:00.444
common among women, and
that is very valued.

00:18:01.358 --> 00:18:04.225
And that is exchanging secrets.

00:18:04.225 --> 00:18:07.242
I collect pictures from
all over the world,

00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:09.447
of two little girls.

00:18:09.447 --> 00:18:11.937
And one is whispering in the other's ear.

00:18:11.937 --> 00:18:14.150
And I've been fascinated by having

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.084
encountered pictures like that from such

00:18:16.084 --> 00:18:18.361
disparate cultures across the world.

00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:21.604
I have encountered them about boys,

00:18:21.604 --> 00:18:24.281
but much, much more rarely.

00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:26.718
In fact, I had said,
'cause it was the case,

00:18:26.718 --> 00:18:29.136
that I had never encountered
such pictures among boys,

00:18:29.136 --> 00:18:31.594
and somebody who was in
the audience sent me one.

00:18:31.594 --> 00:18:33.762
So I can't say I've never seen one.

00:18:33.762 --> 00:18:35.903
But it isn't as common.

00:18:35.903 --> 00:18:40.003
And this is something that
I heard about over and over.

00:18:40.003 --> 00:18:42.052
So, as one woman put it, she said,

00:18:42.052 --> 00:18:43.695
a close friend knows things about me

00:18:43.695 --> 00:18:45.866
that nobody else does.

00:18:45.866 --> 00:18:48.519
She said, if someone is a true friend,

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:52.950
I tell her everything I
think, and everything I feel.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.272
A woman that I was
interviewing was telling me

00:18:55.272 --> 00:18:58.666
about various friendships,
and she said at one point

00:18:58.666 --> 00:19:02.763
about one friends, she's
not that close a friend.

00:19:02.763 --> 00:19:05.898
I wouldn't tell her
about my kids' problems.

00:19:05.898 --> 00:19:08.256
And then, later in the conversation,

00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:09.956
she said about another friend,

00:19:09.956 --> 00:19:12.602
she's not that close a friend.

00:19:12.602 --> 00:19:14.395
I wouldn't tell her what I had for dinner.

00:19:14.395 --> 00:19:17.585
(audience laughing)

00:19:17.585 --> 00:19:19.607
Now this might seem odd.

00:19:19.607 --> 00:19:21.619
You could think why you would only tell

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:25.273
about family troubles to a
friend that's a good friend,

00:19:25.273 --> 00:19:27.218
but why you wouldn't tell her what you're

00:19:27.218 --> 00:19:28.433
having for dinner.

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:30.670
When you think about it,
there's that end of day

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.086
conversation with people
you're really close to.

00:19:33.086 --> 00:19:35.239
Could be a family member,
could be a romantic partner,

00:19:35.239 --> 00:19:36.672
could be a friend.

00:19:36.672 --> 00:19:38.586
And you say what you
did, and where you went,

00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:40.396
and what that made you think,

00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:41.619
and what that made you feel.

00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:45.005
And where you went to
dinner, and what you ordered.

00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:46.944
Or maybe what you prepared for dinner

00:19:46.944 --> 00:19:48.550
while you were at home.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.109
So again, it's an aspect
of detail of your life,

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:57.276
the caring about which, sends
a meta-message of closeness.

00:19:58.821 --> 00:20:01.164
Again, writing about
mothers and daughters,

00:20:01.164 --> 00:20:05.113
I encountered the daughter
who said about her mother,

00:20:05.113 --> 00:20:08.792
who else can I tell I got a
good deal on toilet paper?

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.498
(audience laughing)

00:20:10.498 --> 00:20:12.442
Somebody who cares about
that level of detail

00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:16.202
in your life, is something precious.

00:20:16.202 --> 00:20:18.681
A meta-message of caring.

00:20:18.681 --> 00:20:22.069
When people told me that
they were hurt by friends,

00:20:22.069 --> 00:20:25.505
and that is always something
that I did ask about.

00:20:25.505 --> 00:20:29.672
One reason that I often heard
as a reason for being hurt,

00:20:31.066 --> 00:20:33.915
was not being included,
or not being invited.

00:20:33.915 --> 00:20:37.568
And this is more common
among women than among men.

00:20:37.568 --> 00:20:41.326
Again, I refer to people
who study kids at play.

00:20:41.326 --> 00:20:43.116
Not my research, but
the patterns are clear

00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:45.168
from those who have studied kids at play.

00:20:45.168 --> 00:20:47.835
That when boys don't like a boy,

00:20:48.746 --> 00:20:52.031
they let him play, but
they treat him badly.

00:20:52.031 --> 00:20:54.237
When girls don't like a girl,

00:20:54.237 --> 00:20:55.737
they lock her out.

00:20:56.582 --> 00:20:58.718
And when you think about the fact that

00:20:58.718 --> 00:21:01.303
friends are telling each other secrets,

00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:03.185
your friends are people
that know things about you

00:21:03.185 --> 00:21:05.272
that others don't, that could be something

00:21:05.272 --> 00:21:08.688
behind the reason why you
can't have girls there

00:21:08.688 --> 00:21:09.994
who you don't wanna be friends with,

00:21:09.994 --> 00:21:12.623
because they can't hear your secrets.

00:21:12.623 --> 00:21:16.416
So that may be something going on there.

00:21:16.416 --> 00:21:20.560
So you've probably heard of FOMO, F-O-M-O,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.238
which is fear of missing out.

00:21:23.238 --> 00:21:25.990
That's the reason that we check our email,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.014
or our phones, or our
Instagram, constantly checking,

00:21:29.014 --> 00:21:30.601
because you don't wanna miss out.

00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:32.112
There may be something happening,

00:21:32.112 --> 00:21:35.679
and if you don't check it
in time, you'll miss out.

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:38.184
I devised two more acronyms.

00:21:38.184 --> 00:21:40.304
FOBLO, F-O-B-L-O.

00:21:40.304 --> 00:21:42.674
Fear of being left out.

00:21:42.674 --> 00:21:45.574
And that's worse than FOMO.

00:21:45.574 --> 00:21:46.901
With FOMO, you miss the party 'cause you

00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:48.559
didn't check your phone in time.

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.486
With FOBLO, you missed the party

00:21:50.486 --> 00:21:52.832
because you weren't invited.

00:21:52.832 --> 00:21:54.522
And that's worse.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:57.840
That actually can be more hurtful.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.857
And I'll have more to
say about that tomorrow,

00:22:00.857 --> 00:22:04.940
because this is one of
the risks of social media.

00:22:06.714 --> 00:22:08.672
That you're always seeing
everybody doing things

00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:09.910
when you're not there.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.073
So, that feeling of being
left out can be aggravated.

00:22:14.073 --> 00:22:17.906
But again, it comes out
of the real experience

00:22:18.798 --> 00:22:21.152
of having been left out.

00:22:21.152 --> 00:22:25.319
And FOGKO, F-O-G-K-O, fear
of getting kicked out.

00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:29.809
Groups of girls will
often turn on one girl

00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:30.716
and kick her out.

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:33.122
I heard stories like that, especially from

00:22:33.122 --> 00:22:34.201
middle school and high school.

00:22:34.201 --> 00:22:38.651
But I did also hear some
stories from adult groups.

00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:41.866
And again, my colleagues
who study kids at play

00:22:41.866 --> 00:22:44.752
have encountered this in real time.

00:22:44.752 --> 00:22:46.310
I have a colleague, Amy Sheldon.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.164
And she has studied preschoolers.

00:22:49.164 --> 00:22:52.481
And she actually recorded conversation

00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:54.833
among these little preschoolers.

00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:56.825
A couple of them were playing.

00:22:56.825 --> 00:22:58.291
A bunch of them were playing house.

00:22:58.291 --> 00:23:01.401
And one girl came over to join
them that they didn't like.

00:23:01.401 --> 00:23:02.326
They didn't want her to join.

00:23:02.326 --> 00:23:05.843
Well you know, they tell
you in many of these

00:23:05.843 --> 00:23:08.147
nursery schools, you
can't say you can't play.

00:23:08.147 --> 00:23:10.148
They know that.

00:23:10.148 --> 00:23:12.375
So they told her she could play.

00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:15.450
And the one who was assigning roles said,

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.322
you can be the baby brother,
but you aren't born yet.

00:23:19.322 --> 00:23:22.322
(audience laughing)

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.710
She gave her a non-speaking part.

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:32.450
So, very creative at
that, so young in age.

00:23:33.872 --> 00:23:37.955
Of kind of locking out
those that you don't like.

00:23:40.873 --> 00:23:45.129
I heard so many stories
from women, now adults,

00:23:45.129 --> 00:23:48.130
who still feel guilty
about having been part

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.944
of groups in middle school or high school

00:23:49.944 --> 00:23:53.554
that locked somebody
out, kicked somebody out.

00:23:53.554 --> 00:23:55.717
And one really stuck in my mind.

00:23:55.717 --> 00:24:00.344
This is woman now, she's
a real estate salesperson,

00:24:00.344 --> 00:24:01.853
and very successful.

00:24:01.853 --> 00:24:03.227
She's in her 40s.

00:24:03.227 --> 00:24:06.599
She still feels guilty because
when she was in high school,

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:08.199
the group of friends,
and they had been friends

00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:11.796
since middle school,
decided to eject a girl

00:24:11.796 --> 00:24:13.607
who had been in their
group in middle school.

00:24:13.607 --> 00:24:15.820
And she's the one who
I was talking to said,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.631
she had been really close to that girl.

00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:21.656
And she felt terrible
that she was kicked out.

00:24:21.656 --> 00:24:25.714
And she said about her,
she was really cute,

00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:27.881
and really good at sports.

00:24:29.689 --> 00:24:31.926
And this really made me stop and think,

00:24:31.926 --> 00:24:34.217
because among boy's
groups, someone who was

00:24:34.217 --> 00:24:37.266
physically attractive and
really good at sports,

00:24:37.266 --> 00:24:40.099
their status in the group goes up.

00:24:40.965 --> 00:24:44.417
So wouldn't that be a reason
to keep her in the group,

00:24:44.417 --> 00:24:48.579
rather than a reason to
eject her from the group?

00:24:48.579 --> 00:24:51.891
When girls eject a girl, turn on a girl,

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:54.550
once you punish a girl,

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.888
they will say things like she
really thinks she's something.

00:24:57.888 --> 00:24:59.463
She's stuck up.

00:24:59.463 --> 00:25:00.697
She's snobby.

00:25:00.697 --> 00:25:04.038
I heard so many stories like this.

00:25:04.038 --> 00:25:07.152
One of the beautiful,
wonderful things about

00:25:07.152 --> 00:25:08.854
girls and women's friendships,

00:25:08.854 --> 00:25:11.077
is a valuing of sameness.

00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:14.071
I tell you about a
problem, and you might say,

00:25:14.071 --> 00:25:16.664
oh I know how you feel,
I'd feel the say way.

00:25:16.664 --> 00:25:19.144
I tell you I feel bad
about something I did.

00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:22.562
You say, oh I know, I woulda
done exactly the same thing.

00:25:22.562 --> 00:25:24.327
It's this feeling of
sameness which makes you

00:25:24.327 --> 00:25:27.038
feel less alone in the world.

00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:31.518
But that expectation of
sameness can be a requirement.

00:25:31.518 --> 00:25:33.649
And if you're not the
same, especially if you

00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:36.929
seem somewhat better,
or seem to think you're

00:25:36.929 --> 00:25:40.033
somewhat better, then
girls can be very critical.

00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:42.225
And that is what one of the women said,

00:25:42.225 --> 00:25:45.088
who told me that, she said in her words,

00:25:45.088 --> 00:25:46.999
"I find friendships with women difficult

00:25:46.999 --> 00:25:48.521
terrain to navigate."

00:25:48.521 --> 00:25:53.073
That's what she said in
explanation, partial explanation.

00:25:53.073 --> 00:25:56.631
She said, if you have an
opinion that's different,

00:25:56.631 --> 00:25:59.138
or you've chosen a different path,

00:25:59.138 --> 00:26:01.531
my women friends will often
take that as criticism

00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:03.476
or a valued judgment.

00:26:03.476 --> 00:26:05.564
So the expectation of being the same

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:07.064
can be a downside.

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:13.730
Often, this is a point I
make repeatedly in the book.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.107
The wonderful things and
the challenging things

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:18.806
are often two sides of the same coin.

00:26:18.806 --> 00:26:20.556
And I think that is the case with this

00:26:20.556 --> 00:26:22.223
valuing of sameness.

00:26:24.733 --> 00:26:28.336
And I think this valuing
of being the same,

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:31.025
and tendency to be critical
of women who seem better,

00:26:31.025 --> 00:26:33.809
is one of the things that
presents a double bind

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:35.970
for women in positions of authority.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.970
This is not about women's
friendships so much,

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.832
although it does come up in friendships,

00:26:39.832 --> 00:26:43.327
but something that I wrote
about at great length

00:26:43.327 --> 00:26:47.494
in essays and other subjects
about women in the workplace.

00:26:48.465 --> 00:26:50.516
And certainly wrote some op-eds

00:26:50.516 --> 00:26:52.993
about Hillary Clinton
in the last campaign.

00:26:52.993 --> 00:26:56.094
That some od the criticism,
I just don't like her,

00:26:56.094 --> 00:27:00.072
I think came from this
feeling of discomfort

00:27:00.072 --> 00:27:02.774
with a woman who seems not
to be self-deprecating,

00:27:02.774 --> 00:27:04.868
not to be putting herself down,

00:27:04.868 --> 00:27:07.254
but seems to be comfortable with being

00:27:07.254 --> 00:27:08.934
in a position of authority.

00:27:08.934 --> 00:27:10.350
That's a side points.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.183
That's a footnote to my talk here.

00:27:14.284 --> 00:27:18.209
But there were many examples
that I encountered of that.

00:27:18.209 --> 00:27:20.219
I just recently saw a
play in New York called,

00:27:20.219 --> 00:27:21.597
Coming From Away.

00:27:21.597 --> 00:27:23.193
Did any of you see that?

00:27:23.193 --> 00:27:25.259
Yeah, it's based on a real situation,

00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:27.118
and it's a musical.

00:27:27.118 --> 00:27:29.224
There's a song in that play,

00:27:29.224 --> 00:27:32.159
and it's based on a real character.

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:35.632
The woman who was the first pilot,

00:27:35.632 --> 00:27:38.453
first female pilot at American Airlines.

00:27:38.453 --> 00:27:40.428
And she sings this song about her life.

00:27:40.428 --> 00:27:43.450
And there's this line in
the song where she says,

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.774
when she showed up as
the first Captain pilot,

00:27:46.774 --> 00:27:50.498
in the cockpit of a plane,
the men were very unhappy,

00:27:50.498 --> 00:27:54.347
they felt a girl doesn't
belong in the cockpit.

00:27:54.347 --> 00:27:58.378
And she says, the stewardesses
weren't my friend either.

00:27:58.378 --> 00:28:01.676
They said, do you think
you're better than us?

00:28:01.676 --> 00:28:05.176
So that's that pattern that I encountered.

00:28:06.543 --> 00:28:09.312
Telling this story, again, people come up

00:28:09.312 --> 00:28:12.834
from the audience and tell
me similar experiences.

00:28:12.834 --> 00:28:14.890
Just recently, was told by a woman,

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.385
that her granddaughter in 2nd grade,

00:28:18.385 --> 00:28:21.021
was really unhappy because
her three close friends

00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:23.432
told her they couldn't
be her friend anymore

00:28:23.432 --> 00:28:26.515
because she had won the spelling bee.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.363
Now, the happy ending
is at least two of them

00:28:30.363 --> 00:28:32.423
changed their minds.

00:28:32.423 --> 00:28:33.832
They came around.

00:28:33.832 --> 00:28:37.999
Decided that was not a good
reason to end the friendship.

00:28:40.453 --> 00:28:44.143
I'm talking about the place
of secrets in friendships.

00:28:44.143 --> 00:28:47.413
And the precious thing of feeling that

00:28:47.413 --> 00:28:49.202
somebody knows what's going on,

00:28:49.202 --> 00:28:51.604
and you can tell them what's
going on in your life.

00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:53.024
One woman put it this way, and I really

00:28:53.024 --> 00:28:54.254
like the way she put it.

00:28:54.254 --> 00:28:55.581
I thought this was very sweet.

00:28:55.581 --> 00:28:57.981
She said, when she tells a
friend something personal

00:28:57.981 --> 00:29:01.398
it's like saying, here's
this little piece of me.

00:29:01.398 --> 00:29:03.546
That means I like you.

00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:04.752
I thought that was very sweet.

00:29:04.752 --> 00:29:08.338
But when you think about it,
now she has a piece of you.

00:29:08.338 --> 00:29:10.953
What's she gonna do with it?

00:29:10.953 --> 00:29:13.512
And that is one of the
liabilities that I heard

00:29:13.512 --> 00:29:17.317
quite a lot of stories
about among women friends.

00:29:17.317 --> 00:29:20.705
So, she might repeat it inadvertently,

00:29:20.705 --> 00:29:22.956
not realizing it was
supposed to be a secret,

00:29:22.956 --> 00:29:27.565
or just letting it slip
out without meaning to.

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:31.428
She might, and this I heard
again from high school students,

00:29:31.428 --> 00:29:35.394
let it out on purpose
because she got mad at you.

00:29:35.394 --> 00:29:38.197
And there's another reason
that girls and women

00:29:38.197 --> 00:29:41.202
are very tempted to let other people know

00:29:41.202 --> 00:29:43.037
that they know your secrets.

00:29:43.037 --> 00:29:45.209
And this is again, related to something

00:29:45.209 --> 00:29:47.798
that I wrote about in You
Just Don't Understand.

00:29:47.798 --> 00:29:50.485
It was said about that book,

00:29:50.485 --> 00:29:51.844
and I did say this in the book,

00:29:51.844 --> 00:29:53.886
relating to other people's research,

00:29:53.886 --> 00:29:57.300
that girls tend to be
cooperative in situations

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.345
where boys might be more competitive.

00:29:59.345 --> 00:30:01.603
I wouldn't put it that way anymore,

00:30:01.603 --> 00:30:03.109
because I think both girls and boys,

00:30:03.109 --> 00:30:04.580
women and men, we are all competitive

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.103
and we're all cooperative,
but maybe in different ways.

00:30:07.103 --> 00:30:09.487
And one of the ways that girls and women

00:30:09.487 --> 00:30:13.755
can be very competitive,
is who knows what,

00:30:13.755 --> 00:30:15.600
and who knows first.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.874
So, if you're in a group of friends,

00:30:17.874 --> 00:30:21.601
the person who knows
something important first,

00:30:21.601 --> 00:30:25.768
feels like she's raised in
the hierarchy of friends.

00:30:27.174 --> 00:30:31.091
And sisters, when I wrote
a book about sisters,

00:30:32.565 --> 00:30:33.672
several, more than one told me,

00:30:33.672 --> 00:30:35.856
if they have really important news

00:30:35.856 --> 00:30:38.643
they have to have a conference call.

00:30:38.643 --> 00:30:40.116
Because if they call one first,

00:30:40.116 --> 00:30:42.913
the others are gonna be offended.

00:30:42.913 --> 00:30:45.437
And sometimes now, we do
that with close friends,

00:30:45.437 --> 00:30:47.178
with group emails.

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:50.138
So you're telling
everybody at the same time.

00:30:50.138 --> 00:30:53.078
And the reason for that, I think, again,

00:30:53.078 --> 00:30:54.908
especially among girls and women,

00:30:54.908 --> 00:30:57.752
closeness is like the pot of gold

00:30:57.752 --> 00:30:59.948
at the end of the relationship rainbow.

00:30:59.948 --> 00:31:03.351
And knowing secrets, knowing
what's going on in your life

00:31:03.351 --> 00:31:05.920
if evidence of that closeness.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.714
And so there's a real
temptation to let people know

00:31:08.714 --> 00:31:12.474
how close you are, by letting
them know that you know this.

00:31:12.474 --> 00:31:16.082
A woman told me that her
mother had warned her

00:31:16.082 --> 00:31:18.263
from the time she was pretty young,

00:31:18.263 --> 00:31:21.635
be very careful about
sharing personal information

00:31:21.635 --> 00:31:25.468
with women who get their
hair done every week,

00:31:27.328 --> 00:31:30.245
or women who play Bridge regularly.

00:31:31.773 --> 00:31:34.102
And the reason her mother said was,

00:31:34.102 --> 00:31:36.003
when they run out of
things about themselves

00:31:36.003 --> 00:31:40.844
to talk about, they will
move on to talking about you.

00:31:40.844 --> 00:31:42.393
And I think that's interesting,

00:31:42.393 --> 00:31:46.405
not only from the perspective
of repeating secrets,

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:49.299
but also it's just showing the assumption

00:31:49.299 --> 00:31:51.570
that what they wanna talk about is people,

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.922
and personal relationships.

00:31:53.922 --> 00:31:58.089
And that's why you need fodder
for those conversations.

00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:03.182
Another thing that I often heard about

00:32:03.182 --> 00:32:06.658
when people were hurt, was not
having been told something.

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:10.142
A woman told me about a very close friend,

00:32:10.142 --> 00:32:11.578
they had traveled together,

00:32:11.578 --> 00:32:14.078
she had been helping her
friend with something or other,

00:32:14.078 --> 00:32:16.373
and then her friend came
to her and announced

00:32:16.373 --> 00:32:18.579
that she had been having an affair

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:20.903
and was getting a divorce.

00:32:20.903 --> 00:32:22.418
And the woman I interviewed said,

00:32:22.418 --> 00:32:25.777
and she wanted me to
be on board with that.

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:28.344
But I felt like she had lied to me.

00:32:28.344 --> 00:32:29.586
Because I had been telling her what was

00:32:29.586 --> 00:32:31.509
going on in my life, and she had hidden

00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:33.569
such an important thing from me.

00:32:33.569 --> 00:32:37.232
So she experienced it almost as a lie.

00:32:37.232 --> 00:32:41.050
So the requirement to
let your friends know

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:43.544
what is going on in your
life is another thing

00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:47.711
that is both a gift, but is
also, can become limiting.

00:32:50.525 --> 00:32:52.276
I have heard some of the women who told me

00:32:52.276 --> 00:32:54.708
they prefer friendships with men.

00:32:54.708 --> 00:32:56.183
That was one of the reasons they gave me.

00:32:56.183 --> 00:32:57.392
They said they felt that they could

00:32:57.392 --> 00:33:00.877
trust men not to tell their secrets.

00:33:00.877 --> 00:33:02.241
And I don't think its that men are

00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:04.512
inherently more trustworthy than women,

00:33:04.512 --> 00:33:08.497
but I think it's because they
have nothing to gain by it.

00:33:08.497 --> 00:33:12.954
Whereas we women have a lot
to gain by letting others

00:33:12.954 --> 00:33:14.378
know that they know your secrets,

00:33:14.378 --> 00:33:18.610
and therefore, evidence
that you are close to them.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.345
I wanna move to another element

00:33:21.345 --> 00:33:24.058
that is more common among
women's friendships than men.

00:33:24.058 --> 00:33:26.686
Again, there's always
cultural differences in this.

00:33:26.686 --> 00:33:30.170
And I know of many
instances where it doesn't

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.573
fit this gender pattern,
but I'm gonna read you

00:33:32.573 --> 00:33:36.229
these two contrasting field notes,

00:33:36.229 --> 00:33:37.892
written by students in my class,

00:33:37.892 --> 00:33:41.260
describing problems with their roommates.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.343
And in both cases, it has to do with,

00:33:47.432 --> 00:33:50.434
well you'll hear it, but
it's a similar challenge

00:33:50.434 --> 00:33:52.601
in dealing with roommates.

00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:56.613
And I want to read first,
how this young woman

00:33:56.613 --> 00:34:00.642
described this problem,
and how she solved it.

00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:02.490
"On a couple of different
occasions last week

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.414
"I heard my roommates
mention they wanted to

00:34:04.414 --> 00:34:06.690
"have a party of Thursday.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.138
"I didn't think much of it
until Thursday afternoon

00:34:09.138 --> 00:34:10.836
"when I realized I would be up all night

00:34:10.836 --> 00:34:14.586
"writing a paper that
was due Friday morning.

00:34:15.473 --> 00:34:17.110
"I didn't wanna be the annoying roommate

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.994
"that wouldn't allow a party.

00:34:18.994 --> 00:34:21.778
"But at the same time, I
didn't want distractions

00:34:21.778 --> 00:34:24.959
"while I was trying to finish
a paper under a deadline.

00:34:24.959 --> 00:34:26.294
"So as I was walking back from class

00:34:26.294 --> 00:34:30.215
"with one of my roommates, I asked, so,

00:34:30.215 --> 00:34:33.293
"what are you guys doing tonight?

00:34:33.293 --> 00:34:35.801
"She responded, I'm not sure.

00:34:35.801 --> 00:34:39.487
"We're thinking of having a
party, what are you up to?

00:34:39.487 --> 00:34:42.453
"I told her I had a big
paper due on Friday.

00:34:42.453 --> 00:34:45.156
"She responded, Oh, in
that case we definitely

00:34:45.156 --> 00:34:46.823
"won't have a party.

00:34:48.472 --> 00:34:51.787
"I told her it would be fine with me.

00:34:51.787 --> 00:34:53.944
"But she restated that they
would not have a party,

00:34:53.944 --> 00:34:56.694
"and that time I did not resist."

00:34:59.262 --> 00:35:03.709
I have at times described this
as a kind of indirectness.

00:35:03.709 --> 00:35:05.723
She knew her roommates
were having a party,

00:35:05.723 --> 00:35:06.841
but she didn't state that.

00:35:06.841 --> 00:35:08.545
She started kind of vague.

00:35:08.545 --> 00:35:10.479
What are you guys thinking?

00:35:10.479 --> 00:35:12.866
She needed to tell them
not to have the party,

00:35:12.866 --> 00:35:14.702
but she didn't say it outright.

00:35:14.702 --> 00:35:17.248
She let them know what the reason was

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:19.036
that she'd rather them not have a party,

00:35:19.036 --> 00:35:23.020
and let her friend decide
on her own not to have it.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.261
And I especially love that first one,

00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:27.676
they said they wouldn't have a party,

00:35:27.676 --> 00:35:29.734
and I say, no, no, it's fine with me.

00:35:29.734 --> 00:35:32.183
Because again, she doesn't want to be

00:35:32.183 --> 00:35:34.379
that annoying roommate,
but she trusts her friend

00:35:34.379 --> 00:35:36.575
to come to the right decision.

00:35:36.575 --> 00:35:39.123
So now I want to contrast
that with the way

00:35:39.123 --> 00:35:43.543
a young man described
how his apartment mate

00:35:43.543 --> 00:35:45.208
solved a similar problem.

00:35:45.208 --> 00:35:47.787
This is what he wrote.

00:35:47.787 --> 00:35:49.715
"I could not help but
overhear a brief exchange

00:35:49.715 --> 00:35:52.068
"between my apartment mates this week.

00:35:52.068 --> 00:35:53.784
"I was doing something or other in my room

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:55.252
"with the door open.

00:35:55.252 --> 00:35:57.070
"One of my apartment mates was in his room

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.372
"with the door closed, cramming for his

00:35:59.372 --> 00:36:03.270
"Organic Chemistry test the next day.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.978
"My other two apartment
mates were watching

00:36:04.978 --> 00:36:07.261
"the World Series in the common room,

00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:11.170
"passionately yelling at every player.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.337
"This went on for awhile,
until the one studying

00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:17.380
"opened the door and yelled,
guys can you keep it down?

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.644
"I'm studying here.

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:21.394
"The response was no.

00:36:24.196 --> 00:36:28.751
"The one studying followed
with a quick, go to hell."

00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:30.551
The conversation concluded with a remark

00:36:30.551 --> 00:36:33.100
from the common room which
I cannot say in public,

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.212
but it starts with the letter f.

00:36:36.212 --> 00:36:37.532
And they said f you.

00:36:37.532 --> 00:36:39.766
They actually said it.

00:36:39.766 --> 00:36:41.251
And the student continues.

00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:43.282
"And with that, the problem was solved."

00:36:43.282 --> 00:36:46.282
(audience laughing)

00:36:48.794 --> 00:36:50.614
"They lowered the volume on the television

00:36:50.614 --> 00:36:53.335
"and mellowed out considerably.

00:36:53.335 --> 00:36:55.447
"No one was mad, just a typical way of

00:36:55.447 --> 00:36:58.030
"problem solving in Henley 60."

00:37:01.975 --> 00:37:04.324
The contrast is pretty striking.

00:37:04.324 --> 00:37:05.825
If you try to imagine a group of women

00:37:05.825 --> 00:37:07.299
having a conversation like that,

00:37:07.299 --> 00:37:08.685
it's a little hard to imagine.

00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:10.625
Try to imagine the guys
having a conversation

00:37:10.625 --> 00:37:12.173
like the one the girls had.

00:37:12.173 --> 00:37:13.712
It's a little hard to imagine.

00:37:13.712 --> 00:37:16.058
One of the things I find very
intriguing here though is,

00:37:16.058 --> 00:37:18.917
the boys were also indirect.

00:37:18.917 --> 00:37:21.685
If indirectness is not saying
what you mean outright,

00:37:21.685 --> 00:37:23.527
they didn't say what they meant outright.

00:37:23.527 --> 00:37:25.330
They said no, they said go to hell,

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.613
but they were going to accommodate.

00:37:27.613 --> 00:37:29.202
So it was also indirect.

00:37:29.202 --> 00:37:30.981
But it's a different kind of indirectness.

00:37:30.981 --> 00:37:32.723
It's a mock aggression.

00:37:32.723 --> 00:37:35.549
And that is very common
among boys and men.

00:37:35.549 --> 00:37:37.180
A kind of teasing.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.693
The kind of showing
affection with his punching.

00:37:39.693 --> 00:37:42.137
It's a kind of mock aggression that has

00:37:42.137 --> 00:37:46.304
the same meta-message of
friendliness and closeness.

00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:51.404
I had an occasion to
observe a very similar

00:37:52.319 --> 00:37:55.364
kind of negotiation among women

00:37:55.364 --> 00:37:58.462
at a very professional situation.

00:37:58.462 --> 00:38:02.412
This was a meeting that
was, a conference that

00:38:02.412 --> 00:38:05.100
was being organized by someone,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.060
it was for professional women,

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.875
and I was gonna be one
of the plenary speakers.

00:38:09.875 --> 00:38:13.130
And the women organizing
it told me when I arrived,

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.055
that another one of the plenary speakers,

00:38:15.055 --> 00:38:18.682
who was a mutual friend of
ours was not going to come.

00:38:18.682 --> 00:38:21.153
And she said to me, this
is what she said to me.

00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:23.056
She said, Judy isn't
going to be making it.

00:38:23.056 --> 00:38:25.780
She called me this morning, and she said,

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.989
I'm really sick.

00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:28.974
I know I'm coming down with something,

00:38:28.974 --> 00:38:30.419
I feel horrible.

00:38:30.419 --> 00:38:33.988
But if you really need
me, I'll come and talk.

00:38:33.988 --> 00:38:36.302
And the organizer said to me.

00:38:36.302 --> 00:38:38.260
I told her I need you to stay home

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.533
and take care of yourself.

00:38:40.533 --> 00:38:41.880
I said, I love that.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.153
Can I use it in my talk?

00:38:44.153 --> 00:38:46.075
And she said, yes, yes you can, of course.

00:38:46.075 --> 00:38:50.250
It was such great, perfect,
direct communication.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.500
(audience)

00:38:54.115 --> 00:38:56.251
And I think this is so revealing.

00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:58.754
Why did she think it was direct?

00:38:58.754 --> 00:39:01.137
Judy said I'll come if you need me to.

00:39:01.137 --> 00:39:03.168
There was no way on
Earth she was gonna go.

00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:05.240
She knew that the
organizer wasn't gonna say,

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.423
I don't care if you're
sick, get out of bed

00:39:07.423 --> 00:39:09.340
and come here and talk.

00:39:10.249 --> 00:39:12.956
It was direct because it was clear.

00:39:12.956 --> 00:39:14.555
She knew exactly what was meant,

00:39:14.555 --> 00:39:17.893
and she did her part in
the conversational routine.

00:39:17.893 --> 00:39:20.082
And this is the beauty of indirectness.

00:39:20.082 --> 00:39:21.787
It is something that Robin Lakoff,

00:39:21.787 --> 00:39:23.141
who I mentioned at the beginning,

00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:25.595
wrote about way back, and I heard about

00:39:25.595 --> 00:39:27.580
in that first course that I took with her,

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.663
back in 1973.

00:39:29.654 --> 00:39:32.535
We, especially Americans, can sometime be

00:39:32.535 --> 00:39:35.321
a little bit critical of
indirect communication.

00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:37.487
I'm often asked, wouldn't
this be a better world

00:39:37.487 --> 00:39:40.285
if we just all said what we meant?

00:39:40.285 --> 00:39:41.898
To which I often say, well we do,

00:39:41.898 --> 00:39:44.413
but we use our own conversational style.

00:39:44.413 --> 00:39:45.642
And if someone's style is different,

00:39:45.642 --> 00:39:48.496
then they don't know how
we mean what we said.

00:39:48.496 --> 00:39:51.189
But, Robin has written,
and I think it's so true,

00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:54.025
that there's a great satisfaction in that

00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:55.510
kind of indirect communication.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.660
So Judy, the one who wasn't able to speak,

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.758
didn't have to feel she's
letting her friend down.

00:40:00.758 --> 00:40:02.122
Her friend let her off the hook.

00:40:02.122 --> 00:40:03.816
And the organizer didn't have to feel

00:40:03.816 --> 00:40:06.300
she was presented with a fait accompli.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.882
She's the one who made that decision.

00:40:09.882 --> 00:40:11.576
I can't resist telling you though,

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:15.659
that I also encountered
a very direct observation

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.328
where it didn't work with someone who

00:40:18.328 --> 00:40:19.904
didn't share that style.

00:40:19.904 --> 00:40:22.279
I was in the office of
a faculty colleague.

00:40:22.279 --> 00:40:24.189
She answered the phone while I was there,

00:40:24.189 --> 00:40:26.319
so I just heard her side
of the conversation.

00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:28.209
And it was something like, I don't see how

00:40:28.209 --> 00:40:29.988
I possibly could.

00:40:29.988 --> 00:40:31.839
I am so overwhelmed this term.

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:33.774
I'm on the rank and tenure committee,

00:40:33.774 --> 00:40:35.019
I knew it would be a lot of work.

00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:37.112
But it's more work than I could imagine.

00:40:37.112 --> 00:40:40.267
Teaching an overload course.

00:40:40.267 --> 00:40:45.187
Four of my dissertation students
are defending this term.

00:40:45.187 --> 00:40:47.479
I don't see how I could possibly do it.

00:40:47.479 --> 00:40:49.262
But if you can't find anybody else.

00:40:49.262 --> 00:40:52.262
(audience laughing)

00:40:53.357 --> 00:40:54.757
And when she hung up the phone,

00:40:54.757 --> 00:40:57.307
she looked at me with this true look

00:40:57.307 --> 00:40:59.248
of astonishment on her face.

00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:01.887
And she said, I can't believe it.

00:41:01.887 --> 00:41:03.200
I told him I couldn't do it,

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.667
and he put me on the committee anyway.

00:41:04.667 --> 00:41:07.267
(audience laughing)

00:41:07.267 --> 00:41:10.115
So this is this direct communication.

00:41:10.115 --> 00:41:12.147
She felt she had told him that.

00:41:12.147 --> 00:41:14.095
And he took what she said literally,

00:41:14.095 --> 00:41:15.798
because he wasn't, I'm guessing,

00:41:15.798 --> 00:41:19.465
he wasn't used to that
kind of ritual offer.

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:25.953
That is self-evident you're
not supposed to accept.

00:41:25.953 --> 00:41:28.498
Indirectness like that
can be confusing among

00:41:28.498 --> 00:41:29.915
same sex friends.

00:41:31.011 --> 00:41:33.287
It's an element of what I've described

00:41:33.287 --> 00:41:34.952
as conversational style.

00:41:34.952 --> 00:41:37.654
Many of the different things I've written.

00:41:37.654 --> 00:41:40.087
And I have several
examples that I encounter.

00:41:40.087 --> 00:41:42.734
The people told me,
frustration with friends,

00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:45.267
even close friends, who
had difference sense

00:41:45.267 --> 00:41:46.943
of conversational style.

00:41:46.943 --> 00:41:49.390
And sometimes different
sense of indirectness.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:52.057
One was a woman who had visited.

00:41:53.941 --> 00:41:55.962
Okay she and another friend,

00:41:55.962 --> 00:41:57.524
they had gone to college together,

00:41:57.524 --> 00:41:59.040
lived in the same city.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.787
A friend, a guy visited
who knew them both,

00:42:02.787 --> 00:42:04.505
and he was visiting this one.

00:42:04.505 --> 00:42:06.793
And he said he'd really
like to see the other one.

00:42:06.793 --> 00:42:08.665
So she said fine, I'll call her up and see

00:42:08.665 --> 00:42:10.817
if she wants to see us, if she's free.

00:42:10.817 --> 00:42:12.732
She called up the third, the other friend,

00:42:12.732 --> 00:42:14.606
said so-and-so is in town.

00:42:14.606 --> 00:42:16.203
He'd like to see you.

00:42:16.203 --> 00:42:17.672
Do you want to see him?

00:42:17.672 --> 00:42:19.440
She said, yeah sure, bring him over.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.870
She did bring him over.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.154
The next day, she called,
and she was livid.

00:42:24.154 --> 00:42:25.422
Why did you do that?

00:42:25.422 --> 00:42:27.034
Why did you bring him over?

00:42:27.034 --> 00:42:28.056
I hate him.

00:42:28.056 --> 00:42:29.723
You know I hate him.

00:42:30.768 --> 00:42:34.461
And she said, but you said
you wanted us to come over.

00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:36.953
Yeah, but you should have
known by the way I said it

00:42:36.953 --> 00:42:38.786
that I didn't mean it.

00:42:39.753 --> 00:42:41.989
Which seems ridiculous to those of us

00:42:41.989 --> 00:42:44.383
who don't use that kind of indirectness,

00:42:44.383 --> 00:42:46.845
but it's self-evident, I
think would be self-evident

00:42:46.845 --> 00:42:49.521
to someone who shared that style.

00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:51.931
I don't know if any of you noticed this,

00:42:51.931 --> 00:42:54.065
but I had an op-ed in the New York Times

00:42:54.065 --> 00:42:56.024
just a few weeks ago.

00:42:56.024 --> 00:42:57.458
And in it I tell this anecdote.

00:42:57.458 --> 00:42:58.637
And I was so embarrassed that I myself

00:42:58.637 --> 00:43:01.119
missed the possibility of indirectness.

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:03.491
See, I've written about
this since the 1970s,

00:43:03.491 --> 00:43:04.903
and I still missed it.

00:43:04.903 --> 00:43:06.541
I had a friend visiting.

00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:09.209
I won't tell you the
whole story behind it,

00:43:09.209 --> 00:43:11.408
but the bottom line was, she was helping

00:43:11.408 --> 00:43:14.575
to serve, and to clean up, and to act,

00:43:15.636 --> 00:43:18.184
in my view, act like
a host in my own home,

00:43:18.184 --> 00:43:19.849
and I kept telling her not to.

00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:21.504
And she kept doing it anyway.

00:43:21.504 --> 00:43:22.765
And I would tell her not to,

00:43:22.765 --> 00:43:24.143
and she would still do it.

00:43:24.143 --> 00:43:25.809
At one point, she made
it into the kitchen.

00:43:25.809 --> 00:43:27.808
I physically grabbed
her and yanked her back,

00:43:27.808 --> 00:43:30.055
and pushed her down in the chair.

00:43:30.055 --> 00:43:31.677
And I tried to do it in a way that seemed

00:43:31.677 --> 00:43:33.927
good-natured, but I was really rattled.

00:43:33.927 --> 00:43:36.575
I really didn't like it.

00:43:36.575 --> 00:43:37.575
Now, she's a good friend.

00:43:37.575 --> 00:43:39.416
I wasn't gonna like,
stop being her friend,

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:42.538
but I was gonna think twice
about having her over again.

00:43:42.538 --> 00:43:44.722
(audience laughing)

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.860
And would normally have just let it go,

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.710
but because I was writing
this book about friends,

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.664
I felt, it's research, I
need to know her perspective.

00:43:51.664 --> 00:43:53.638
I need to know why she kept doing it

00:43:53.638 --> 00:43:55.119
when I told her not to.

00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:56.435
So I talked to her about it.

00:43:56.435 --> 00:44:00.438
And when I described it,
a look of astonishment

00:44:00.438 --> 00:44:02.700
went across her face.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.046
It had never occurred
to her that I meant it.

00:44:07.046 --> 00:44:10.119
And she told me, in the
op-ed I wrote about it

00:44:10.119 --> 00:44:13.361
as family styles, or mother styles.

00:44:13.361 --> 00:44:14.933
She had just been at her parent's house.

00:44:14.933 --> 00:44:16.259
They're older.

00:44:16.259 --> 00:44:17.651
She was helping.

00:44:17.651 --> 00:44:19.283
Every stage she was helping.

00:44:19.283 --> 00:44:20.661
Her mother kept telling her not to,

00:44:20.661 --> 00:44:21.731
she kept doing it anyway.

00:44:21.731 --> 00:44:26.044
And at the end of the evening,
her mother said thank you.

00:44:26.044 --> 00:44:27.678
And she even said at one point,

00:44:27.678 --> 00:44:30.017
you never listen to me.

00:44:30.017 --> 00:44:33.044
And I am so glad you don't.

00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:34.815
There was no question in her mind,

00:44:34.815 --> 00:44:37.075
that people tell you they
don't want you to help,

00:44:37.075 --> 00:44:39.244
but they really want you to.

00:44:39.244 --> 00:44:41.385
And it had never occurred
to me that she didn't

00:44:41.385 --> 00:44:42.802
think I meant it.

00:44:43.725 --> 00:44:46.128
And it's so funny, 'cause
I've written about this.

00:44:46.128 --> 00:44:48.251
And that's the thing about
conversational style.

00:44:48.251 --> 00:44:52.390
What seems right to us
just seems self-evident.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.025
So this has been great.

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:56.251
She says she's very relieved now,

00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:58.147
to know she doesn't
have to do all the work

00:44:58.147 --> 00:44:59.860
at everybody's house.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.528
If they tell her not to the third time,

00:45:01.528 --> 00:45:05.338
she can actually listen, and not do it.

00:45:05.338 --> 00:45:08.669
And I can now meta-communicate, and say,

00:45:08.669 --> 00:45:09.954
by the way, I really do mean this,

00:45:09.954 --> 00:45:12.147
I'm not just saying it.

00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:13.708
But I encountered many other examples

00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:16.983
of conversational style differences.

00:45:16.983 --> 00:45:20.392
Where a friend was offended by something

00:45:20.392 --> 00:45:24.180
that another friend
said, or was put off by

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:27.240
something that was really
just a style difference.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.152
Two women, very close friends,

00:45:30.152 --> 00:45:31.557
they're walking around the lake.

00:45:31.557 --> 00:45:32.859
One is telling the other about something

00:45:32.859 --> 00:45:35.300
that she really feels strongly about.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.170
And the one she's telling
to is really listening.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.907
And also when she sees
something that's really pretty,

00:45:40.907 --> 00:45:44.321
that's really interesting
like, looks at those ducks

00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:46.014
going along the lake, and there's little

00:45:46.014 --> 00:45:47.751
ducklings behind her.

00:45:47.751 --> 00:45:51.878
Or, oh look at that flower,
isn't that beautiful?

00:45:51.878 --> 00:45:53.349
If you didn't call attention to it,

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:55.234
you're walking, and it would be gone.

00:45:55.234 --> 00:45:56.625
Your friend would miss it.

00:45:56.625 --> 00:46:00.309
At one point, the friend who
was telling about the problem,

00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:02.233
she stopped dead in her tracks,

00:46:02.233 --> 00:46:03.636
and she turned to her friend and she said,

00:46:03.636 --> 00:46:07.053
you haven't listened to a word I've said.

00:46:08.121 --> 00:46:10.143
And the one who told me the anecdote

00:46:10.143 --> 00:46:14.217
was that friend who felt
so unfairly criticized.

00:46:14.217 --> 00:46:15.742
Of course she was listening.

00:46:15.742 --> 00:46:18.685
This is a conversational style difference.

00:46:18.685 --> 00:46:20.735
And I'm curious how many people here think

00:46:20.735 --> 00:46:22.897
if you're listening to something,

00:46:22.897 --> 00:46:24.498
you can't talk.

00:46:24.498 --> 00:46:28.425
You can't say look at that,
or throw in a comment.

00:46:28.425 --> 00:46:29.909
And how many of you feel of course,

00:46:29.909 --> 00:46:31.411
that's perfectly fine.

00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:33.657
It's kind of like you're having dinner

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:36.627
and you want the salt, and
someone's telling a story.

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.112
You don't have to go without salt

00:46:38.112 --> 00:46:40.527
'til they finish their story.

00:46:40.527 --> 00:46:43.247
You might say, excuse me, pass the salt.

00:46:43.247 --> 00:46:46.354
And that's not an interruption.

00:46:46.354 --> 00:46:49.362
Another friend, I encountered an example

00:46:49.362 --> 00:46:52.362
of another friend with a
conversational difference.

00:46:52.362 --> 00:46:55.112
Anybody here from South Carolina?

00:46:56.144 --> 00:46:57.945
This friend of mine is
from South Carolina.

00:46:57.945 --> 00:47:00.213
If you have not yet guessed,

00:47:00.213 --> 00:47:02.434
I grew up in Brooklyn, New York.

00:47:02.434 --> 00:47:04.678
From my hands, or my accent.

00:47:04.678 --> 00:47:06.593
So, pretty good friends.

00:47:06.593 --> 00:47:07.794
So we're talking about something,

00:47:07.794 --> 00:47:10.086
and I was telling her about,

00:47:10.086 --> 00:47:11.938
we were talking about some
guy that we both knew,

00:47:11.938 --> 00:47:13.033
not particularly well.

00:47:13.033 --> 00:47:15.136
And I asked her what she thought of him.

00:47:15.136 --> 00:47:17.248
And she said, I don't really know him.

00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:19.743
And I said, I think he's a jerk.

00:47:19.743 --> 00:47:22.805
And she said, that's what I just said.

00:47:22.805 --> 00:47:25.805
(audience laughing)

00:47:28.866 --> 00:47:30.199
And I said, huh?

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:33.926
But she knows I study this sort of thing,

00:47:33.926 --> 00:47:35.767
so she explained it to me.

00:47:35.767 --> 00:47:37.197
She said, in South Carolina,

00:47:37.197 --> 00:47:39.973
you cannot say somebody's a jerk.

00:47:39.973 --> 00:47:42.663
So you have to proceed on the assumption

00:47:42.663 --> 00:47:44.703
that if you knew him long enough,

00:47:44.703 --> 00:47:47.715
you would find something to like.

00:47:47.715 --> 00:47:49.733
So, I don't really know
him means I haven't

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.384
found anything to like about him.

00:47:51.384 --> 00:47:54.384
(audience laughing)

00:47:57.874 --> 00:47:59.747
You know, I followed her argument,

00:47:59.747 --> 00:48:01.250
but I didn't quite believe it, 'cause it

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.000
seemed so farfetched.

00:48:04.795 --> 00:48:06.893
Luckily, not very long
after, I was at some

00:48:06.893 --> 00:48:09.619
sort of a gathering, and I met someone

00:48:09.619 --> 00:48:12.022
who said he was from South Carolina.

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:14.177
So I thought I'll test this.

00:48:14.177 --> 00:48:17.705
I said, what would it
mean if you asked someone

00:48:17.705 --> 00:48:19.582
what they thought of someone,

00:48:19.582 --> 00:48:22.420
and she said, I don't really know him.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.524
He said, that means he's
a no-good, no-count.

00:48:25.524 --> 00:48:29.253
(audience laughing)

00:48:29.253 --> 00:48:32.363
So, conversational style differences.

00:48:32.363 --> 00:48:35.597
And you can imagine, I can imagine

00:48:35.597 --> 00:48:39.779
how a person who used
that style would react

00:48:39.779 --> 00:48:42.981
to someone like me who
says I think he's a jerk.

00:48:42.981 --> 00:48:44.564
You can't say that.

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:49.043
They must think I'm a
jerk for talking that way.

00:48:49.043 --> 00:48:50.771
And what I would think about someone who

00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:54.949
expects me to know that she
didn't mean what she said,

00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:58.070
that would seem rather unacceptable to me.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.460
And these conversational style differences

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.565
really are very significant.

00:49:02.565 --> 00:49:04.686
And I have a chapter of
that, and quite a lot

00:49:04.686 --> 00:49:06.689
of examples about that.

00:49:06.689 --> 00:49:08.112
I'll just give you one last one.

00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:09.872
A woman who told me that she was very hurt

00:49:09.872 --> 00:49:14.392
by a friend, because her mother
had been in the hospital.

00:49:14.392 --> 00:49:15.889
She was terribly worried about her.

00:49:15.889 --> 00:49:17.498
She told her friend about it.

00:49:17.498 --> 00:49:20.396
And the friend never
asked, how's your mother?

00:49:20.396 --> 00:49:23.301
She just assumed that's
what a friend does.

00:49:23.301 --> 00:49:26.366
So she told the friend
that she was hurt by that.

00:49:26.366 --> 00:49:28.479
And the friend, again, was incredulous.

00:49:28.479 --> 00:49:29.982
She said, oh my goodness.

00:49:29.982 --> 00:49:33.711
In my family, you don't
ask questions like that.

00:49:33.711 --> 00:49:35.576
If you wanted to tell me about it,

00:49:35.576 --> 00:49:36.764
you would tell me.

00:49:36.764 --> 00:49:40.297
But it would be very
intrusive for me to ask.

00:49:40.297 --> 00:49:42.155
And she was Vietnamese-American.

00:49:42.155 --> 00:49:44.178
And I suspect that did have a role.

00:49:44.178 --> 00:49:46.606
And some of these
differences are regional,

00:49:46.606 --> 00:49:50.773
ethnic, cultural, and sometimes
just conversational style.

00:49:52.771 --> 00:49:55.407
The very expectation
that you ask questions

00:49:55.407 --> 00:49:57.122
as a way of showing interest,

00:49:57.122 --> 00:49:59.796
which would be self-evident
to some people,

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:02.062
to others would be intrusive.

00:50:02.062 --> 00:50:04.061
So, these conversational style differences

00:50:04.061 --> 00:50:06.061
can be very significant.

00:50:07.041 --> 00:50:09.041
Okay, so let me wrap up.

00:50:10.486 --> 00:50:12.058
Obviously I've only been able to say

00:50:12.058 --> 00:50:13.707
some of the stuff that's in the book.

00:50:13.707 --> 00:50:16.097
But the goal really is to understand

00:50:16.097 --> 00:50:18.932
the ways that these friendships work.

00:50:18.932 --> 00:50:20.905
What makes them so gratifying,

00:50:20.905 --> 00:50:23.818
but also, what make them
challenging at times.

00:50:23.818 --> 00:50:26.393
And as I said, often the challenging

00:50:26.393 --> 00:50:29.839
and the satisfying are two
sides of the same coin.

00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:32.988
When I talk about it, I often focus

00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:34.610
on some of the problem things.

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:35.713
'Cause I think, kind of people,

00:50:35.713 --> 00:50:38.708
that's where they want help
with solving these problems.

00:50:38.708 --> 00:50:42.944
A talk show I was on, it
was a radio call in show,

00:50:42.944 --> 00:50:45.776
and somebody called in
and said, that's terrible.

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:47.592
You're describing awful friendships.

00:50:47.592 --> 00:50:49.639
I would never have friendships like that.

00:50:49.639 --> 00:50:51.215
And I said, I hope I
didn't give the impression

00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:52.782
that I think every friendship has

00:50:52.782 --> 00:50:56.052
these kinds of problems at every moment.

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:58.822
There really is a lot
about what is precious

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:00.860
about friendships, and
that is really what I

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.025
heard about more than anything else.

00:51:03.025 --> 00:51:05.473
How precious those friendships can be.

00:51:05.473 --> 00:51:09.405
And in particular, I kept being
struck by the role of talk.

00:51:09.405 --> 00:51:12.278
And that is again, one of the things that

00:51:12.278 --> 00:51:13.979
really does tend to distinguish

00:51:13.979 --> 00:51:15.926
women's friendships in particular.

00:51:15.926 --> 00:51:19.242
But talk is something that can get you

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:22.729
into more trouble than maybe, activities.

00:51:22.729 --> 00:51:26.107
And sometimes I have
been told by women that

00:51:26.107 --> 00:51:28.774
they feel there's too much talk.

00:51:29.657 --> 00:51:31.958
A woman especially was telling me

00:51:31.958 --> 00:51:33.474
when she went through her divorce,

00:51:33.474 --> 00:51:34.860
she avoided her women
friends, 'cause she didn't

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.779
wanna talk about it.

00:51:36.779 --> 00:51:38.846
She said she really valued a guy friend

00:51:38.846 --> 00:51:40.384
who was also going through a divorce.

00:51:40.384 --> 00:51:44.189
They just rode their bikes
for hours and didn't talk.

00:51:44.189 --> 00:51:47.070
And so I think sometimes that can be

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.949
almost a liberation to realize you don't

00:51:48.949 --> 00:51:50.542
always have to talk.

00:51:50.542 --> 00:51:52.842
Just as it can be a
liberation to realize that

00:51:52.842 --> 00:51:53.925
you can talk.

00:51:55.651 --> 00:51:58.776
So, I'll just end by saying that,

00:51:58.776 --> 00:52:01.728
in everything that I'm saying
about women friendships

00:52:01.728 --> 00:52:04.593
is probably true of many
other relationships.

00:52:04.593 --> 00:52:08.057
And also again, it's not limited to women.

00:52:08.057 --> 00:52:10.314
It's women and men.

00:52:10.314 --> 00:52:12.299
Certainly I could say
a lot about friendships

00:52:12.299 --> 00:52:13.732
among women and gay men.

00:52:13.732 --> 00:52:15.257
My own best friend is a gay man,

00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:18.489
and I do have some things to
say about that in the book.

00:52:18.489 --> 00:52:22.072
But, I guess overall,
I would like to leave

00:52:23.013 --> 00:52:26.058
a sense of appreciation, and also caution

00:52:26.058 --> 00:52:28.996
about the role of talk in
these close relationships.

00:52:28.996 --> 00:52:30.438
Thank you.

00:52:30.438 --> 00:52:33.605
(audience applauding)

00:52:42.779 --> 00:52:44.342
Thank you.

00:52:44.342 --> 00:52:45.623
We do have time for questions?

00:52:45.623 --> 00:52:46.692
- [Tina] Yes.

00:52:46.692 --> 00:52:50.139
So, I would just like to
open it up for questions,

00:52:50.139 --> 00:52:53.972
and also to thank Dr.
Tannen for her comments.

00:52:55.106 --> 00:52:58.489
And if you have a question,
please approach the mic.

00:52:58.489 --> 00:52:59.869
- It's intimidating, but
if you have a question,

00:52:59.869 --> 00:53:01.562
come to the microphone.
- Yes, thank you.

00:53:01.562 --> 00:53:05.062
- It's an open book in here, including me.

00:53:07.936 --> 00:53:08.943
- [Woman In Blue Shirt] Hi.

00:53:08.943 --> 00:53:10.102
I'd like to thank you.

00:53:10.102 --> 00:53:12.101
Your book, You Just Don't Understand

00:53:12.101 --> 00:53:15.281
helped start my marriage
off at a really good spot,

00:53:15.281 --> 00:53:19.457
and we even say to each
other, do you want ice cream?

00:53:19.457 --> 00:53:21.177
- I'm happy to hear that.
- And my husband says no,

00:53:21.177 --> 00:53:23.677
and then we laugh at all that.

00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:27.506
I'm hoping for two things from you.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:29.876
I'm an East Coast transplant.

00:53:29.876 --> 00:53:31.226
I'm from Philadelphia.

00:53:31.226 --> 00:53:33.043
Lived there for, grew up there.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:36.082
Came out to California about 30 years ago.

00:53:36.082 --> 00:53:39.628
And I still have trouble
communicating with Californians.

00:53:39.628 --> 00:53:42.415
(audience laughing)

00:53:42.415 --> 00:53:44.998
- Now I have to interrupt here,

00:53:45.842 --> 00:53:47.827
because I'm from Brooklyn,
I'm gonna interrupt.

00:53:47.827 --> 00:53:49.639
(laughing)

00:53:49.639 --> 00:53:51.523
My dissertation was a comparison of

00:53:51.523 --> 00:53:54.128
New York and California
conversational styles.

00:53:54.128 --> 00:53:55.208
- [Woman In Blue Shirt] That's
what I wanted to ask you.

00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:56.208
Do you have a book?

00:53:56.208 --> 00:53:57.208
You have a book on mothers
and daughters, and women.

00:53:57.208 --> 00:54:00.992
Do you have a book on East
Coast versus West Coast?

00:54:00.992 --> 00:54:02.563
That direct stuff you
would just talking about

00:54:02.563 --> 00:54:05.027
at the end of your
speech is my life story.

00:54:05.027 --> 00:54:07.045
And I've gotten in trouble so many times.

00:54:07.045 --> 00:54:09.501
30 years out here and I can't fix it.

00:54:09.501 --> 00:54:10.510
Do you have a book on that?

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.909
- I do.
- Or can you point me

00:54:11.909 --> 00:54:13.295
to a book on that?

00:54:13.295 --> 00:54:15.455
And also, the last piece of that is,

00:54:15.455 --> 00:54:16.796
what advice do you have for someone who

00:54:16.796 --> 00:54:18.734
obviously can't change
the way she communicates,

00:54:18.734 --> 00:54:21.686
and yet gets in trouble
for that very thing?

00:54:21.686 --> 00:54:23.061
- Yeah, okay.

00:54:23.061 --> 00:54:24.881
So just let me say a little bit about,

00:54:24.881 --> 00:54:26.373
so it was my dissertation.

00:54:26.373 --> 00:54:27.855
It's a book.

00:54:27.855 --> 00:54:29.441
It's an academic book, but it's pretty,

00:54:29.441 --> 00:54:31.987
everything I write it pretty readable.

00:54:31.987 --> 00:54:34.178
The book is called Conversational Style:

00:54:34.178 --> 00:54:36.886
Analyzing Talk Among Friends.

00:54:36.886 --> 00:54:38.205
And then I have the book called,

00:54:38.205 --> 00:54:39.772
That's Not What I Meant, which is just all

00:54:39.772 --> 00:54:41.717
the things that can differ,
including the things

00:54:41.717 --> 00:54:43.787
that differ New York and California.

00:54:43.787 --> 00:54:48.174
But this may be some of
what you're experiencing.

00:54:48.174 --> 00:54:50.270
It was so shocking to me,

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:51.858
and I have more to say
about this tomorrow,

00:54:51.858 --> 00:54:53.922
that I'd be accused of being rude

00:54:53.922 --> 00:54:58.013
when in New York I was
considered overly polite.

00:54:58.013 --> 00:54:59.686
- Thank you.
Yes.

00:54:59.686 --> 00:55:01.204
- I had friends who literally would say

00:55:01.204 --> 00:55:03.136
I'm not really New York Jewish,

00:55:03.136 --> 00:55:04.168
which is what I am.

00:55:04.168 --> 00:55:06.226
It's just in New York
it's easier being Jewish.

00:55:06.226 --> 00:55:09.622
I must really be a wasp,
because I'm so indirect,

00:55:09.622 --> 00:55:11.572
and so you know.

00:55:11.572 --> 00:55:14.161
And suddenly here, I
was being called rude.

00:55:14.161 --> 00:55:18.540
And it's things like talking
along to show enthusiasm,

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.285
and you're perceived as
indirect, as interrupting.

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:25.118
The length of pause between turns.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.232
And this can vary, not just
New York and California,

00:55:29.232 --> 00:55:31.859
but Californians and New England.

00:55:31.859 --> 00:55:33.389
Or New England and the South.

00:55:33.389 --> 00:55:35.331
Anytime two people are talking,

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:39.784
if one is conducting a
slightly shorter pause,

00:55:39.784 --> 00:55:41.670
you get the feeling that the other person

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:44.223
has nothing to say, and
you wanna be a nice person

00:55:44.223 --> 00:55:46.856
and save the conversation,
so you start speaking.

00:55:46.856 --> 00:55:50.328
And if that person is waiting
for a slightly longer pause,

00:55:50.328 --> 00:55:53.509
it never comes, and they feel interrupted.

00:55:53.509 --> 00:55:56.143
So, yeah, and on, and on,
and on, things like that.

00:55:56.143 --> 00:55:57.164
What can you do?

00:55:57.164 --> 00:55:58.740
I'd say meta-communicate.

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.074
Talk about it.

00:56:00.074 --> 00:56:04.286
That example I gave was my
really close friend, Tamara.

00:56:04.286 --> 00:56:08.036
Had I left it that she
has this weird pattern

00:56:09.457 --> 00:56:11.919
that she keeps helping
when I tell her not to,

00:56:11.919 --> 00:56:14.466
that wouldn't been where it stayed.

00:56:14.466 --> 00:56:16.324
But when we talked about it,

00:56:16.324 --> 00:56:19.260
we really were able to figure it out.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.516
And it was a gift, I
think, to the both of us.

00:56:21.516 --> 00:56:24.380
Raised my awareness to
apply what I'd written about

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.980
in my own life.

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:28.799
People may not think I mean what I say.

00:56:28.799 --> 00:56:30.752
And for her to realize that sometimes

00:56:30.752 --> 00:56:33.502
people really mean what they say.

00:56:36.624 --> 00:56:38.575
So, meta-communicating.
- Thank you so much.

00:56:38.575 --> 00:56:39.575
- Thank you.

00:56:42.051 --> 00:56:43.384
Can you come up?

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:50.048
- [Woman In White Shirt]
Thanks for your speech.

00:56:50.048 --> 00:56:52.310
I think the research you are doing is very

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:54.172
interesting and exciting.

00:56:54.172 --> 00:56:57.039
And speaking of the friendship,

00:56:57.039 --> 00:57:01.934
I recall classical and
controversial old question,

00:57:01.934 --> 00:57:03.341
at least I think so.

00:57:03.341 --> 00:57:06.924
And do you think there
is a simple and pure

00:57:07.985 --> 00:57:11.796
friendship between a girl and a boy?

00:57:11.796 --> 00:57:14.706
- So the question is, is
simple, pure friendship

00:57:14.706 --> 00:57:16.741
possible between a girl and boy.

00:57:16.741 --> 00:57:18.451
Is that the question?
- Yeah.

00:57:18.451 --> 00:57:20.237
Friendship, just a friendship.

00:57:20.237 --> 00:57:23.996
Have nothing to do with
love relationship or other.

00:57:23.996 --> 00:57:25.906
Just a pure and simple
friendship between girl and boy.

00:57:25.906 --> 00:57:27.259
- Yeah, friendship.

00:57:27.259 --> 00:57:28.599
It's an interesting question.

00:57:28.599 --> 00:57:31.305
My short answer is, yes I do.

00:57:31.305 --> 00:57:35.123
But I'm thinking of
lesbians that I interviewed,

00:57:35.123 --> 00:57:36.299
who told me that they found,

00:57:36.299 --> 00:57:38.899
sometimes found it simpler,
one woman I'm thinking

00:57:38.899 --> 00:57:40.982
who I interviewed said, she found that her

00:57:40.982 --> 00:57:44.920
closest friends were
straight women and gay men.

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.348
Because there was no confusion about

00:57:47.348 --> 00:57:50.553
what kind of friendship
it was going to be.

00:57:50.553 --> 00:57:53.981
And that in her group, if a woman somehow

00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:57.654
developed a crush on someone
that wasn't returned,

00:57:57.654 --> 00:57:59.936
it was sort of difficult for everybody.

00:57:59.936 --> 00:58:01.421
For the whole group.

00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:03.916
I'm thinking of women who told me that

00:58:03.916 --> 00:58:06.202
gay men are their closest friends.

00:58:06.202 --> 00:58:08.946
That's part of what
they told me about that.

00:58:08.946 --> 00:58:10.798
It was wonderful.

00:58:10.798 --> 00:58:12.101
They really loved the guy's company,

00:58:12.101 --> 00:58:14.484
but they don't have to
worry about that tension.

00:58:14.484 --> 00:58:17.366
So it think that layer is there.

00:58:17.366 --> 00:58:20.379
But yeah, I have encountered examples of

00:58:20.379 --> 00:58:22.723
if you want it, simple friendship.

00:58:22.723 --> 00:58:25.528
If simple means no sexual overtones.

00:58:25.528 --> 00:58:28.304
I do think it's possible.
- Thank you.

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:32.304
- Good luck.
(audience laughing)

00:58:53.074 --> 00:58:54.196
- [Woman In Red Shirt] Hi,
I'm wondering if you have

00:58:54.196 --> 00:58:57.613
any suggestions about how to, as a woman,

00:58:59.212 --> 00:59:04.039
negotiate aspiration,
versus keeping your friends?

00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:06.422
- Aspiration versus--
- versus keeping your friends.

00:59:06.422 --> 00:59:09.550
You talked earlier about women,

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.897
like the girls who kicked their friend out

00:59:11.897 --> 00:59:13.579
for being in the spelling bee.

00:59:13.579 --> 00:59:17.746
Any tips for diffusing that?
- Yeah, it's so complicated.

00:59:19.127 --> 00:59:23.112
I'm think again, real
anecdotes I heard about.

00:59:23.112 --> 00:59:26.820
Women telling me that
they felt their friends

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:27.931
really stopped being their friends

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:31.514
because they got a
higher job, or whatever.

00:59:33.063 --> 00:59:36.439
And sometimes it's just, if somebody has

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:39.475
something you really want,
it's hard to be with them.

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:41.047
So I'm thinking of a woman who told me,

00:59:41.047 --> 00:59:43.027
she had a baby, and a friend of hers

00:59:43.027 --> 00:59:44.580
who desperately wanted a baby,

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.118
and wasn't able to get pregnant,

00:59:46.118 --> 00:59:49.186
just didn't wanna be with her
because it was so painful.

00:59:49.186 --> 00:59:53.019
And then later they
reunited, and got past it.

00:59:55.342 --> 00:59:56.759
So, what can you do about it?

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:59.719
I guess my solution to everything is,

00:59:59.719 --> 01:00:03.602
you can try accommodating,
you can try talking about it.

01:00:03.602 --> 01:00:05.372
And then sometimes you just have to

01:00:05.372 --> 01:00:07.805
let it go for awhile, and see if you can

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.638
come back to it later.

01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:13.009
Now you should know, I'm not a therapist,

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:16.723
and I have no experience
on which I'm basing this.

01:00:16.723 --> 01:00:18.223
I'm just guessing.

01:00:19.303 --> 01:00:20.136
Thank you.

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:27.457
- [Woman In Red And
White Shirt] Thank you.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.077
I've been a big fan of
your writing for awhile.

01:00:29.077 --> 01:00:31.264
- Thank you.
- So, in one of your books

01:00:31.264 --> 01:00:33.431
you talked about sympathy.

01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:37.413
And how men and women
perceive it very differently.

01:00:37.413 --> 01:00:39.600
- Sympathy.
- Yeah, and how women,

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.872
when you, women friends,
when you express sympathy,

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.536
they see it as the sameness,

01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:45.964
getting on the same level.

01:00:45.964 --> 01:00:48.701
And you could say the exact
same thing to a male friend,

01:00:48.701 --> 01:00:52.844
or a male partner, and they
view it as hierarchical.

01:00:52.844 --> 01:00:54.466
That you're putting them down.

01:00:54.466 --> 01:00:57.313
And I found that fascinating.

01:00:57.313 --> 01:00:59.139
And I've noticed that a lot.

01:00:59.139 --> 01:01:01.741
But I don't know how to navigate it.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:05.520
So if you could elaborate on that at all,

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.569
that would be wonderful.

01:01:06.569 --> 01:01:08.003
Thank you.
- Yeah, I agree.

01:01:08.003 --> 01:01:09.257
It's fascinating.

01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:12.892
You know who helped me understand that?

01:01:12.892 --> 01:01:14.616
Robert Bly.

01:01:14.616 --> 01:01:16.037
Do you remember, around
the time that my book,

01:01:16.037 --> 01:01:18.845
You Just Don't Understand
was a Bestseller,

01:01:18.845 --> 01:01:21.174
Robert Bly has a book called Iron John,

01:01:21.174 --> 01:01:22.190
that was also best-selling.

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:24.626
And we did a thing together.

01:01:24.626 --> 01:01:26.134
And he really helped me to understand.

01:01:26.134 --> 01:01:28.414
I never quite understood this myself.

01:01:28.414 --> 01:01:31.247
He said that sympathy seems to be,

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.083
like you said, a put down.

01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:37.166
And also a reminder of this bad thing

01:01:38.305 --> 01:01:40.048
that you wanna forget.

01:01:40.048 --> 01:01:42.787
So, he was saying for many men,

01:01:42.787 --> 01:01:44.381
the kindest thing you can do is

01:01:44.381 --> 01:01:46.257
act as if it didn't happen.

01:01:46.257 --> 01:01:47.685
(laughing)

01:01:47.685 --> 01:01:48.966
Help them forget it.

01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:51.049
Yeah, it's so widespread.

01:01:52.405 --> 01:01:55.569
And I have encountered
really serious issues

01:01:55.569 --> 01:01:58.305
among people who are close.

01:01:58.305 --> 01:02:01.509
One couple how had been
through 9/11 together.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:02.858
They had an apartment quite close

01:02:02.858 --> 01:02:04.856
to the World Trade Center.

01:02:04.856 --> 01:02:09.096
And so they had been
very traumatic for them.

01:02:09.096 --> 01:02:10.856
And the wife wanted to talk about it,

01:02:10.856 --> 01:02:12.733
and the husband didn't.

01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:15.268
And the more she wanted to
talk about it and he wouldn't,

01:02:15.268 --> 01:02:17.662
the more alienated she felt,
the more alone she felt,

01:02:17.662 --> 01:02:19.813
the more let down she felt.

01:02:19.813 --> 01:02:21.360
And the more she kept
trying to talk about,

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.194
when what he really wanted
to do was not talk about it,

01:02:24.194 --> 01:02:27.027
and move on, was upsetting to him.

01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:31.294
So I guess I'm gonna sound
like a broken record,

01:02:31.294 --> 01:02:34.227
but it think if they had talked about it,

01:02:34.227 --> 01:02:37.244
and kind of come to an
understanding of why

01:02:37.244 --> 01:02:39.557
each of them is reacting
this different way,

01:02:39.557 --> 01:02:42.143
then maybe they could
figure out a compromise.

01:02:42.143 --> 01:02:45.198
And that's what, you
know, what I'm called by

01:02:45.198 --> 01:02:47.674
journalists about all
these things I write about,

01:02:47.674 --> 01:02:50.683
they always wanna know tips.

01:02:50.683 --> 01:02:51.708
What can you do?

01:02:51.708 --> 01:02:52.827
What's the tip?

01:02:52.827 --> 01:02:54.495
And I always say, I
can't give tips because

01:02:54.495 --> 01:02:57.040
each situation is different.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.178
Each person is different.

01:02:59.178 --> 01:03:01.800
The tip I give is understanding.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.403
If you both understand what's going on,

01:03:04.403 --> 01:03:07.038
then you can decide how to proceed.

01:03:07.038 --> 01:03:10.442
And so you might decide,
I might just have to

01:03:10.442 --> 01:03:12.138
not offer sympathy.

01:03:12.138 --> 01:03:13.584
It makes me feel bad, because I think

01:03:13.584 --> 01:03:16.197
I'm letting him down, or I
should be offering sympathy.

01:03:16.197 --> 01:03:17.920
But I realize that's what he wants.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.577
So I'm giving him the
gift of what he wants.

01:03:21.577 --> 01:03:25.570
And he might have to learn
to offer some sympathy.

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:29.494
Because that's what
might be helpful to you.

01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:30.639
So I don't know if that's hugely helpful,

01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:32.556
but that's my thoughts.

01:03:35.121 --> 01:03:36.160
Hi.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.657
- [Woman In Red Shirt]
First I wanna say thank you

01:03:37.657 --> 01:03:39.574
very much for your
research and your writing.

01:03:39.574 --> 01:03:41.491
I used your research on

01:03:43.856 --> 01:03:46.553
gender differences in
communication when I was

01:03:46.553 --> 01:03:47.951
teaching at the college level,

01:03:47.951 --> 01:03:49.929
and now the teacher has
become student again.

01:03:49.929 --> 01:03:52.747
And so my questions is pertaining to,

01:03:52.747 --> 01:03:54.101
if you're doing any research,

01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:56.183
or the research of your colleagues on

01:03:56.183 --> 01:03:59.089
intergenerational differences
in terms of friendship.

01:03:59.089 --> 01:04:00.756
I'm in my early 50s.

01:04:01.594 --> 01:04:05.940
I have, I'm probably,
I'm near the top end.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.284
I'm at one of the seminaries
here through the GTU.

01:04:09.284 --> 01:04:13.098
And a lot of my colleagues
are in their 20s and 30s.

01:04:13.098 --> 01:04:15.476
They're the age of my adult children.

01:04:15.476 --> 01:04:18.584
They're the age, a little bit older than

01:04:18.584 --> 01:04:20.707
the age of the students I used to teach.

01:04:20.707 --> 01:04:22.957
And just a general trend is

01:04:24.081 --> 01:04:25.248
circumspect...

01:04:30.277 --> 01:04:31.110
Reticent.

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:34.301
And I can do the whole texting,

01:04:34.301 --> 01:04:35.698
and the social media thing.

01:04:35.698 --> 01:04:37.639
But I have a sibling that's
only two and a half years

01:04:37.639 --> 01:04:39.579
younger than myself, and her primary mode

01:04:39.579 --> 01:04:41.197
of communication is through texting.

01:04:41.197 --> 01:04:43.684
Some of this may be addressed
in your talk tomorrow,

01:04:43.684 --> 01:04:47.851
but is conversation, is
intimacy through conversation

01:04:49.329 --> 01:04:51.979
becoming a lost art,
as those of us that are

01:04:51.979 --> 01:04:56.042
in the boomer generation, and
maybe some of the Gen-Xers

01:04:56.042 --> 01:04:58.459
continue to age and fade out?

01:04:59.367 --> 01:05:00.370
- Yeah.

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.792
I will have a bit to say,
a lot to say tomorrow

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:06.039
about generational differences
and use of social media.

01:05:06.039 --> 01:05:09.372
But especially the mechanics of it.

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:12.273
And assumptions about what's
appropriate and what's not.

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:16.786
And use of punctuation, and
other markers like that.

01:05:16.786 --> 01:05:18.833
But the question of
friendships across age,

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:20.580
I have a bit to say about it in the book,

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.794
but not a whole lot.

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:26.424
And sometimes what people
told me in those interviews

01:05:26.424 --> 01:05:28.752
about friendships with older or younger,

01:05:28.752 --> 01:05:30.323
much older or much younger friends,

01:05:30.323 --> 01:05:33.764
often ended up being about social media.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:36.764
Like students saying that she really

01:05:37.605 --> 01:05:39.759
considered this older
friend a good friend,

01:05:39.759 --> 01:05:41.379
but that friend didn't understand that

01:05:41.379 --> 01:05:44.501
having a Facebook page open didn't mean

01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:47.993
she was actually open for interaction.

01:05:47.993 --> 01:05:51.765
She might be in class with
the Facebook page open.

01:05:51.765 --> 01:05:53.098
Not in my class.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.269
I don't allow it.

01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:59.407
But yeah, no I'm sure there's
more to say about that

01:05:59.407 --> 01:06:02.125
in maybe a future book.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:02.958
Thank you.

01:06:12.845 --> 01:06:13.857
- [Woman In White Shirt]
Since it's welcome back

01:06:13.857 --> 01:06:17.502
to Berkeley, I wanna ask
a political question.

01:06:17.502 --> 01:06:20.802
So we're reading, we're
hearing from many people

01:06:20.802 --> 01:06:23.434
we have to learn to talk with people

01:06:23.434 --> 01:06:27.023
and listen to people
with whom we don't agree.

01:06:27.023 --> 01:06:30.818
And I think it's one more layer about

01:06:30.818 --> 01:06:34.416
what are your values,
in addition to all these

01:06:34.416 --> 01:06:37.743
things you say about rituals and styles.

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:39.660
So it feels impossible.

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:44.459
I don't think I want tips, but maybe,

01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:47.657
maybe I do want tips.

01:06:47.657 --> 01:06:51.152
But do you have any
insight that could help us?

01:06:51.152 --> 01:06:54.388
- I'm asked about that a lot.

01:06:54.388 --> 01:06:58.643
I wrote a book called
The Argument Culture.

01:06:58.643 --> 01:07:00.626
It was published in 1998,

01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:02.802
but I think it's more
true, and more accurate

01:07:02.802 --> 01:07:06.006
and relevant today than
it was even back then.

01:07:06.006 --> 01:07:08.009
And the point I made there is that our

01:07:08.009 --> 01:07:10.443
public discourse is polarizing,

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:13.479
because we turn everything into a fight.

01:07:13.479 --> 01:07:15.062
And the news media,

01:07:17.945 --> 01:07:21.535
and politics certainly,
they exaggerate that.

01:07:21.535 --> 01:07:23.814
They don't find people to put on who are

01:07:23.814 --> 01:07:25.242
somewhere in the middle.

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:28.959
They find the most extreme
sides that they can find,

01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:31.244
even if they have to scour the fringes

01:07:31.244 --> 01:07:33.677
of lunacy to find them.

01:07:33.677 --> 01:07:36.041
And they won't even cover
something if there isn't

01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:38.835
another side, and they make
everything into two sides,

01:07:38.835 --> 01:07:40.503
where most things are not two sides.

01:07:40.503 --> 01:07:42.199
There are many sides.

01:07:42.199 --> 01:07:43.859
And I think what we're reaping now,

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.776
is the harvest of that being a norm

01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:50.557
in our public discourse over so long.

01:07:50.557 --> 01:07:53.844
And it has crept into
personal relationships.

01:07:53.844 --> 01:07:55.441
I think people are more confrontational,

01:07:55.441 --> 01:07:58.736
more belligerent in
private attraction now,

01:07:58.736 --> 01:08:01.986
because of that tone being so pervasive

01:08:03.503 --> 01:08:05.003
in our public discourse.

01:08:05.003 --> 01:08:06.771
And I think it's corrosive.

01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:09.684
Corrosive to the human spirit.

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:11.374
The specific question.

01:08:11.374 --> 01:08:13.238
Everyone's telling us now
you have to talk to people

01:08:13.238 --> 01:08:16.482
that you don't agree with,
and how do we do that?

01:08:16.482 --> 01:08:18.184
I've certainly encountered the phenomemon

01:08:18.184 --> 01:08:21.181
that people are less likely to do it now.

01:08:21.181 --> 01:08:24.793
People who won't go home
to their relatives because,

01:08:24.793 --> 01:08:27.102
okay, they knew that their
relatives were Republican.

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:30.000
That was okay, they put it aside.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.832
But now, knowing somebody voted for Trump

01:08:32.832 --> 01:08:36.582
they feel is so, that
ramifications have been

01:08:37.745 --> 01:08:41.007
so terrible that they just
don't wanna deal with it.

01:08:41.007 --> 01:08:43.090
Okay, I'll say one thing.

01:08:44.814 --> 01:08:47.670
I have read that if you talk to people you

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.254
don't agree with, our
impulse it to tell them

01:08:50.254 --> 01:08:52.461
what we think, and change their minds.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:53.898
And nobody changes their mind because

01:08:53.898 --> 01:08:55.914
of something you told them.

01:08:55.914 --> 01:08:58.081
But if you listen to them,

01:08:58.081 --> 01:09:02.906
and have them tell you
everything that they think,

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:05.251
and you really listen, and
you really consider it,

01:09:05.251 --> 01:09:08.554
that if you then eventually
work your way around

01:09:08.554 --> 01:09:09.974
to showing another perspective,

01:09:09.974 --> 01:09:11.750
they'd be more likely to hear it.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.250
So, maybe that's one little bit of advice.

01:09:16.094 --> 01:09:17.604
I think we're done.

01:09:17.604 --> 01:09:18.497
(audience applauding)

01:09:18.497 --> 01:09:19.330
Thank you.

01:09:25.607 --> 01:09:28.190
(upbeat music)
