00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's get this tool under our tool belt.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's figure out what radians are. Well, I'll tell you what they are.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
They're unit of angle--just like the degree

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Whereas the trace of degree was somewhat arbitrary, who thought there should be 360Â°

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in a circle--where that number come from.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The choice for the radian is a little less arbitrary, and so let's talk about that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here we have a circle of radius 1. Can you tell me what's the circumference of this circle.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can put your answer here and round to two decimal place.
