00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.990
&gt;&gt; Roberta I Shaffer:
Good afternoon.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.580
Good afternoon.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.690
My name is Roberta Shaffer and
I have the privilege of serving

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.920
as the Law Librarian of Congress
and it is indeed my pleasure

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.010
to welcome you this afternoon

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.700
to our program marking
the 500th anniversary

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.990
of the establishment
of the Venice Ghetto.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.910
It's quite appropriate
actually that the Library

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.850
of Congress be the venue
for this commemoration.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.620
And as many of you already
know, Venice during the period

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.170
that it was a Ghetto,
so up until 1797

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.120
when that 20 something Napoleon
Bonaparte lifted the flood gates.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.060
It was a flourishing
commercial publishing center.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.210
Many, many arts and much
literature and music was created

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.250
and disseminated from
the Venice Ghetto

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.240
and it had quite a contribution to
the life of the Venetian Republic

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.620
and the life of the
whole region around it.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.240
But probably the most important
reason for us to be the venue

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.130
to begin this commemoration
is the fact

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.440
that it was kind of a melting pot.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.350
Now many of you know that
the word Ghetto is associated

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.990
at least originally by
many with the Venice Ghetto

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.310
as the first instance
of that term being used.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.190
But there is I understand
some controversy

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.850
about the origin of the word.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.400
This region which was
the confined community

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.720
that became the Venice Ghetto years
before had been the foundry works

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.110
of that region.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.460
And I like to think that that's
the origin from the Italian word

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.470
because in many ways it really
signifies the melting pot

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.880
that the Venice Ghetto was.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.250
And also that it was a place

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.420
that much culture and
commerce was forged.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.210
So if you'll excuse my being
a bit punish this afternoon

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.980
that is why I prefer to think

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.180
that the term foundry was indeed
the reason for the creation.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.470
And the Library of Congress
itself is a great melting pot

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.220
of intellectual creation.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.230 position:56%
As many of you, I hope, know we have
over 165 million items representing

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.140
over 420 languages, we
have maps, manuscripts,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.190
movies and of course books
and many, many other artifacts

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.960
of intellectual creation
and the history of humanity.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.400
So for all of these
reasons, we are delighted

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.870
to be hosting this commemoration
this afternoon and we welcome you

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.770
and we hop you will have
the opportunity at the end

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.120
of the program to view
a really small sampling

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.600
of the wonderful treasures
that are part of the library

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.730
of congress collections that
are relevant to the topic

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.160
that we will discuss today
and looking at the topic

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.900
through a very long lens of how
what our scholars will share

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.480
with us has relevance
to contemporary life.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.870
So speaking of contemporary
life, it is indeed an honor

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.230
to welcome the new Ambassador
to Washington from Italy,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.550
His Excellency Armando Varricchio,
who has had many, many post.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.340
He served in Budapest, in Belgrade.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.160
He's been in Brussels.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.300
Served his own foreign
ministry as an equivalent

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.620
of an undersecretary very recently
and is coming back to Washington

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.740
for the second time he was
here a number of years ago

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.670
as the economic advisor
to the embassy of Italy.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.000
He is marking this year his 30th
anniversary in civil service.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.560
So although we're marking
a 500th anniversary today,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.380
we're also marking
a 30th anniversary.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.870
He came to civil service after a
brief stint in the private sector.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.020
We are delighted by the
relationship that we have

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.670 position:56%
through the cultural attaché Renato
Miracco with the embassy and we know

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.990
that our new ambassador
will continue the tradition.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.810
He has a phenomenal
intellectual curiosity.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.030
This is not his first trip even
though he just came to Washington

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.040
to the Library of Congress.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.050
And so we are absolutely
honored that he is

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.510
with us this afternoon,
your Excellency.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:21.020
[ Applause ]

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.320
&gt;&gt; Armando Varricchio:
Good afternoon.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.940
Thank you very much Roberta
for this very, very warm

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.450
and friendly welcome here.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.750
You're right.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.460
This is not the first
time here had a privilege

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.880
to attend an event a few weeks ago.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.270
And this shows importance

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.690
that I attach this
great institution,

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.370
the Library of Congress.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.560
We are celebrating today
500 years great anniversary

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.160
when Leonardo Loredan, the
doge of Venice, ruler of Venice

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.530
and the Venetian Senate in
early spring day March 1516

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.430
and Venice decided that the Jewish
community had to be segregated

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.340
in an old part of the city close
to an area that we call Cannaregio.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.900
They were not aware that
that decision was conducive

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.730
to change history in a way.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.100
I don't want to enter
into the pronunciation

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.890
with the word Ghetto or Jhetto.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.860
I think that we should have
a glottologist working on it.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.380
But it is true that we tend
to believe that because

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.730
of the location, because that part

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.050
of the city was an
industrial site, a foundry.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.270
From that very name we
nowadays have been accustomed

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.810
to use this word, Ghetto.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.810
The idea of the Venetian rulers was
to segregate people and this one

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.510
of the topic that we are
pre-discussing today La Città degli

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.560
Ebrei the City of the Jews,
Segregated Space and the Admission

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.220
of Strangers in the Jewish Ghetto.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.110
But what does segregation
mean actually?

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.100
It might sound paradoxically
that a city like Venice,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.920
Venice was a winner of
that time globalization.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.120
We tend to believe that the
globalization is a very recent

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.340
world, this is not the case.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.160
Venice was really globalized city.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.020
You had Venetian ship
ruling the waves

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.710
in what was called the Venetian Sea

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.420
and now we are accustomed
to name Adriatic Sea.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.040
They were sailing throughout the
Mediterranean down to the east,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.920
the areas that we now call Syria,
the great city of Constantinople.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.760
So they were particularly
open to different cultures,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.150
different ideas, different
religions.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.760
But nonetheless they decided
to segregate the community.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.480
What is particularly intriguing is
to think about segregation today.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.230
Because we do think
that that community made

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.990
out of very talented
people there were merchants,

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.360
there were intellectuals,
the were bankers.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.240
They responded in the
best possible way.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.140
They did continue their journey.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.270
And their journey and the
journey that we can admire here

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.060
with the display of this great
piece of art, the books that thanks

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.280
to the library we will enjoy,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.670
was a journey throughout their
mind, throughout their spirit.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:35.580
This means that you can segregate
people, you can close a border

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:41.600
but you cannot segregate your mind.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.080
Thanks to their ability,
to their deep knowledge,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.990
to their great personality,
those people,

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.880
people that were not different

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.650
for anybody they were
part of the society.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.190
There were an active part of the
society continue their journey.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.620
They produce ideas,
they wrote about law,

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.120
about the arts, about daily life.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.520
So they remain an active
part of the society.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.460
And by the way Venice should
not have been the same

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.180
without the great contribution
of the Jewish Venetian.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.430
They were a very, very
dynamic component to society.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:29.820
Since then we've accustomed to have
different Ghettos not just Jewish

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.690
but in other part of the societies
and see we tend to use this word.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:42.830
We are in the Library of
Congress so we tend to read books.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.160
But books are so useful to us.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.600
Cicero we used to say that
Historia est Magistra Vitae,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.280
because of history we can learn
to better understand our present.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.620
The historians have
a great privilege.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.360
They look into the past and
they offer us opportunities

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.040
to think about the present.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.080
It is not up to historians to
say what we should do nowadays

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.680
and what should do
particularly in the future.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.320
But they are offering
us a current reading.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.060
And I think that we will enjoy
listening to great contributions

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.070
of very prominent scholars.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.130
Afterwards, some of you will
have the opportunity to be

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:31.390
and to receive a great treat I
received by looking at those books.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.820
But first and foremost I
think that by going back

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.630 position:56%
to that early spring day of 500 days
we will have opportunities to think

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.600
about our present and particularly
what lays in front of us.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.510
Thank you very much
for having me here.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:53.770
[ Applause ]

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.070
&gt;&gt; Natalia Indrimi: Good evening.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.360
I'm Natalia Indrimi the Director of
the Centro Primo Levi in New York.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.560
I like to thank Roberta Shaffer
and Ambassador Varricchio,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.990
Armando for inviting us to
participate in this event

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.850
which I believe with and I
hope will be the beginning

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.460
of a fruitful collaboration
with the Library of Congress.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.530
Our center has been
active in New York

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:24.850
for about 18 years presenting
the work of Primo Levi as well

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.370
as the history of Italian Jews.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:33.000
The history of Italian Jews and the
particular combination of the lens

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.810
through which Primo Levi has
portrayed and transmitted it

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:44.470
to the public all over the world
has-- is especially symbolic.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.050
We are talking about
one of the smallest

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:56.190 position:56%
and longest living minorities in the
world which Jews have lived in Italy

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:02.230
for over 22 centuries and have
been always in the range between 30

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.560
and 50,000 people so a
very, very small population

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.040
that has not assimilated
at all but integrated

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.830 position:56%
and coexisted being influenced,
that influencing the Italian society

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:22.150
to a very high degree
after the tragedy of Joshua

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:32.840
which Primo Levi has brought to
us in very unique universal terms.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:38.270
The way in which the history of
this minority become symbolic is

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.390
to show what a small group
of people who are different

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:50.460 position:56%
but fully participatory do to larger
society as the rule in systems

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.230
as the forms of governments
change in that country.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:03.130
And I think that by studying the
relationship with an Italian Jews

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.170
and Italy as first as
combination of smaller states

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.230
and then as a unified country.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:13.330 position:56%
There is a lot that we can gain in
trying to understand the world today

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.080
and how we in a melting
pot relate to each other

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.630
and to a larger society
in which we live.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:27.610
The way in which our center works
is by supporting programming,

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.700
both academic and public,
and publishing,

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.960
we have an online magazine, Printed
Matter that is free for everybody

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.110
to enjoy and a small
publishing house.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.830
What we provide for
the academic world

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:50.790
and the general public is an
interface with enormous treasure

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.120
of Italian libraries and archives

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.220
that are also extremely
well-organized

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.030
through a unified portal
called SIUSA.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:06.710
And that anybody from here or from
anywhere in the world can access.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:11.230
What's always surprising
and interesting is

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.610
to see the traveling of books.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.900
I mean, what we have in Italy has
often it create an interlocutor,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.780
a book that is in Italy
as an interlocutor

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.610
in a library in the Unite States.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.260
There is no library in the
United Stated and here we have

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.200
of course the most precious
example of Italian collection here

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.810
but that doesn't feature a piece
of the history of Italian Jews.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.840 position:56%
Some in very important ways like the
Jewish Theological Seminary library

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.230
which by the way was founded by
an Italian rabbi Sabato Morais.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.980
The two smaller libraries
like Colombia and the Library

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.430
of Congress, the [inaudible]
library that he wrote that is

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.550
by 80% of Italian origin.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:03.820
And the fact that it's such a
small population has left a legacy

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.050
that we can find and follow

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:15.730
in so many different places I think
is per se something to reflect upon

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.130
and something to investigate.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.860
The history of traveling of each
of this book and what they did

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.610
to the place and the-- where
they landed and the students

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:34.110
that were able to read them is very
much important part of our culture

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.010
and our society and something
that we always ought to remember

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.880
because the destiny of books

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.490
and libraries is always
uncertain especially when we are

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:52.620 position:56%
in tight times of crisis that people
tend to diminish what the books do

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.760
and instead our basis
even in the face

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.690
of basic, very, very, basic needs.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:09.080
I'm going to leave the podium
to our distinguished speakers

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.460
and I just want to add that I
hope very much that the books

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.510
that are here at the Library
of Congress of Italian

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:22.150
and Italian Jewish origin and
the books that are [inaudible]

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:28.990
and this libraries are
featured in our website

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:35.880
and in others will begin a new
dialogs and continue the dialogs

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.790
that have been initiated so far
by scholars like Bernard Cooperman

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:45.530
who was been a champion of
understanding bringing the history

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.390
of Italian Jews here
in the United States.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:54.510
Again, thank you very much and
please welcome our speakers.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:17:01.090
[ Applause ]

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.790
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: Thank
you very much Natalia.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.940
Welcome Ambassador.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.200
Thank you Roberta, thank
you everybody for coming.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:17.280 position:56%
I am a professor by profession,
right, that's what I do for a living

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.100
which means that I can only
speak in 50 minute blocks

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.550
and they've only given
me 30 minutes.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.090
So I'm going to talk very fast
now and then you'll understand

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.380
and you'll have to slow it down
on the tape afterwards trying

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.120
to understand what I said, OK.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.820
So let my try-- first of all
let's put on a picture here.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.120
How do we do?

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.420
Oh, there we are, OK.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.720
Can you see that?

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.020
Yeah. All right.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.190
So, I'm going to skip around
and I'm just going to try

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.480
to hit some highlights to try
to make sense out of this.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.320
So forgive me if I'm too fast
and I assume there'll be time

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.630
for questions afterwards and
we can do it and I'll try

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.360
to also let you know about some of
the things you'll be able to see

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.630
in the room out there and what
they are and so forth and so on.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.640
So the first question
is what is a Ghetto

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.210
and what do we assume it to be.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.150
We assume for most people and
the Ambassador put it very well,

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.950
there is a sense of
segregation, there is a sense--

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.150
if you ask the average
person, most people if you ask

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.450
in America what is a Ghetto,

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.140
they don't know it has
anything to do with Jews.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.210
They think the Ghetto
was the intercity,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.300
it's African-Americans,
it's Latinos.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.590
In American the word has
lost its Jewish connotation.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.150
But if you ask my students
who know anything

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.200
about Jewish history they will tell
you the Ghetto is a terrible period

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.700
and the Ghetto gives its name to
pre modern to the pre modern world.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.890
There's a very famous article that
is called Ghetto and Emancipation,

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.900 position:56%
as if all the Jews lived in a Ghetto
and then they were led out, right?

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.220
Then they were let free,
who let the dogs out,

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.520
or who let thee Jews out, right?

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.630
So all the Jews run
out of the Ghetto

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:56.550
and suddenly they become a
part of the modern world.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.920
And so there is a sense that
the Ghetto was an enclosure,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.460
was an expulsion from society there
is one absolutely horrifying book

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.250
by a very well known
social scientist

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.890
from New York whose name I
won't mention but if you look

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.220
at my articles you'll see him
and who compares the Ghetto,

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:20.070
if you'll excuse me, to a condom
that protect society from the Jews

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.590
who are germs and that,
you know, this is insane.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.220
It's absolutely nuts.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.870
But it is part of a
narrative of Jewish history

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.810
that says the Jews
used to be excluded,

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.090
the Jews used to be punished
and then suddenly perhaps

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.790
with the French Revolution,
perhaps the American Revolution,

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:43.800
perhaps with the Austrian
Edict of Tolerance

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.520
that suddenly they were let out.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.480
So there's this notion of
expulsion and exclusion.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.640
And the idea was that the Jews were
excluded from not only the contact

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.360
with the outside world but from
the culture of the outside world.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:05.200
It was a sense then that the Jews
gain their legal rights of citizen

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.540
and once they become a citizen,
discrimination was over.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.990
We, you know, we are now
the Messianic Era has come.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.810
Now in that story what is the
assumed motive for the Ghetto?

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.660
Why did they create a Ghetto?

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.670
Well first of all we all know
that everybody hated the Jews.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.490
Anybody here who remembers
Tom Lahrer may remember

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.630
that wonderful song about national
brotherhood week and, you know,

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.240 position:56%
the black folks hate the white folks

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.060
and the white folks
hate the black folks

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.190 position:56%
and everybody hates the Jews, right?

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.180
So it's a kind of a narrative that
Jews and other people have come

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.540
to tell and that narrative
of course has been emphasized

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.670
by the holocaust and
by everything else.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.140
We said, they always hated the Jews
they always prosecuted the Jews.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.280
Why did they hate the Jews?

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.580
That's obvious.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.770
They hated the Jews because
the Jews weren't Christians

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.230
because they killed
Christ, they are deicides.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.650
They are condemned forever let
his blood be upon our hands

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.950
for all times, right?

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:09.240
That's the account of the
crucifixion and so forth.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.250
And that becomes, and
this is very important

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.690
and I hope you won't see
me as just an idiot taking

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.160
in big words and-- or big phrases.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.730
This is actually extremely
important to emphasize.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:29.430
The idea that this hatred is age
old, we now call it anti-semitism,

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:33.010
right, which is in fat a new word
it was made up in the 19th century.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.030
It's a political term and
has very specific meanings.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.620
But we use it for everything and
we have all kinds of organizations

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.830
in both the Jewish community and
the non-Jewish community to stamp

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.750
out anti-semitism, to get
rid of this age old hatred

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.870
and has only changed its
face from time to time.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.390
It is arguably the
only ahistorical idea

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.530
in all historians toolbox, right?

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.330
The only thing that isn't subject
to change is anti-semitism.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.470
It just changes its rhetoric
but it's always there.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.890
Everybody always hates the Jew.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.500
So that's the first argument
that Ghetto is an example

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.370
of Christian anti-semitism.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:17.370
The second argument is that
it has to do with economics.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:21.780
Christianity was-- because of a
verse in the bible and because

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.400
of their interpretation of it
you shouldn't lend an interest

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.700
to your brother.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.410
This was understood that Christians
could not lend an interest

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:33.110
to each other and therefore
Jews were led in.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.170
Of course everybody hated
them because you have

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.210
to pay them interest but the
Jews were the only people

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.450 position:56%
in Christian society that were
legally allowed to lend an interest.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.840
Let me tell you, first of
all you may have gathered

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.630
from the way I presented
anti-semitism

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.270
that I think that's a silly
understanding of animosity

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.630
between groups but let me
tell you about this business

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.530
about money lending
it's absolute nonsense.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.770
It is not true that
there was no credit

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.800
in Medieval Christian Society.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.160
How do you think Venice
traded all over the world?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.950
If you were sending out a
boat believe me you tried

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.250
to share the risk.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.030
Believe me the merchants invested.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.900
They had contracts that
were written in ways

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.240
that theoretically hid the
fact that there was interest.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.490
Real interest was not what
Jews were involved in.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.230
The real money that ran
society, the real money

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.990
that governments wore
bonds and so forth.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.290
That wasn't a Jewish myth.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.140
There are a few Jews here and
there but that's very unusual.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:32.800
What Jews are doing is providing
what we use credit cards for today.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.930
That is, they were providing
consumer credit, right?

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.230
And they were providing it
to relatively poor people.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.380
Now, I assume that some people
will walk away saying Cooperman,

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.150
that's me, is an anti-semi.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.150
My mother would be surprised
because she raised me Jewish but be

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.950
that as it may be I want to
assure you that the kind of credit

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.990
that Jews did and it's
very important to my story,

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.540
the kind of credit that Jews
did was an ugly kind of credit.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.990
I don't mean that the Jews
were ugly people I don't mean

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.290
that they were nasty.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:10.870
I mean that that kind of credit
is horrifying in its results, why?

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.900
Because poor people need it.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.890
And when people get involved

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.030
in loans no matter how
low the rate of interest.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.200
Think about check cashing places.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.140
Think about the labor department
just put out a report about people

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.940
who borrow against their card.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:33.230
The average borrowing against a
car in this country is for $700.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.570
And 40% of those loans result
in the car being repossessed.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:41.530
Because people get tied up and they
get hung up and there's no way out.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.850
So you have to remember

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.290
that although it was
a profitable business,

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.960
although it was a very
specific business,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.160
the reason Jews are admitted
to do this is first of all

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.700
because even though money lending
is legalized in Europe it's a myth

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.580
that there was no legal
money lending

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.020
and there were notarized
text that show

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.900
that money is being
lent and so forth.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.180
Please by the way somebody tell
me when I'm out of time here

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.910
because I looked at my
watch I think I started

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.600
at 20 after but I'll forget.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.900
I keep looking at.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:20.850
But Jews are-- What happens is
that even though it is legal to do,

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.190
no one wants to do it, right?

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:27.560
Because it's a hard business,
you have to go done people

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.000
for the money very often the people
you've lent money to can't afford

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.900
to pay you back of course
you need the money too,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.200
right, it's your money.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.230
It's just one of those businesses
that Christians didn't like to do.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.970
We know by the way that many
Christian wealthy people invested

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.100
money with the Jews and
made money off of this too.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.460
In other words, they lent money
to Jew who then lent money

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.760
to the poor people, right?

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.060
It's never that simple and we could
go on for an hour and a half just

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.860
about the nature of
the credit business.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.520
But the bottom like is that
societies need that service

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.570
at the same time, I
want to stress this,

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.520
that kind of money
lending has three elements

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.890
in it that are very important.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:11.360
First of all that kind of
money lending will be something

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.270
that the society itself.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.740
The government will have a stake
in making cheaper and cheaper.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.090
They will try to keep
it as cheap as possible.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.790 position:56%
The people who are lending the money
are trying to make money from people

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.350
who will probably never
pay them back, right?

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.430
So it's a very, you know,

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.810
thin margin here even though it
looks like a horrifying thing.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.340
But as a result of that

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.490 position:56%
because there is pressure there I
always going to be pressure to force

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.440
down the rate of interest.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.810
The Jews are going to
want to live in areas

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.710
where there are a lot of customers.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.140
The government will
use that to force them

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.130
to accept a lower rate of interest.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:59.360
In Venice, within a relatively
short time the Jewish community was

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.300
subsidizing the banks.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.390 position:56%
The Jews were admitted to lend
money at interest to the poor people

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:10.080
but fairly soon the Jews were
subsidizing their own banks

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.480
because the rest of the community
needed the banks to exist in order

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.990
to be able to live
in the city, right?

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.990
Very few people actually
own these little pawnshops

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.000
or banks whatever we
want to call them.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.780
But because there's this
pressure from the government

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.780
to lower the rate--
nobody will take the job

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.300
because it doesn't make a living.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:35.200
So the Jews pay loan bankers
significant sums to open banks

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.500
that don't make a profit.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.310
So that's the first thing
you want to understand.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.460 position:56%
The second-- I know it's interesting
how well these things work.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.780
The second thing is, I mean,
think about Trump University

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.270
and how they made money, right?

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.530
OK. So I don't know
why that came up.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.910
The second-- ah Democrats.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:58.440
The second point you want to
understand is that these pawnshops,

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.140
these little places where somebody
will bring their stuff to sell,

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:09.280
they are often selling what we
would call seconds or end of cloth

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.030
or out of season goods, right?

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.690
It's very important
to remember this.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.980
So they're selling in other
words off-brand stuff.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.110
Anybody here go to Marshalls?

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.380
OK. So, you know what Marshalls in.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.570
Marshalls, you go in there
and you buy last season's good

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.050
or you buy things that have a
few less threads per square inch

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.780
in the knitting of the--

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.950
in the weaving of the fabric
and so forth and so on.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.130
You buy things that
the company was trying

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.920
to get rid off and
so forth and so on.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.760
That is what Jews did.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.930
And remember the economy

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.790
of the early modern city
is dominated by guilt.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.560
And these guilts control the
manufacturing and the price

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.960
and the quantity and the
quality and everything.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.570
And Jews are not just
lending money at interest.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:29:00.660
They are also in effect running a
secondary market, a gray market.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.250
They are running the
Marshall Stores every

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.770 position:56%
where that they are allowed to life.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:11.380
Naturally, the guild merchants
don't want to Jews there

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.500
because they cut the price.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.420
On the other hand, it's nice
to have somewhere you get rid

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.730
of your extras, your
end of season goods.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.270
And so the Jew serves
first of all a function

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:28.700
of providing economic relief to
the poor, second with its problems,

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.110 position:56%
second they are selling and
competing with established merchants

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.320
and the third thing that Jews
are doing and there's no doubt

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.370
about this and it sounds not nice
but I assure you it is true is

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.460
that these shops are
fencing agencies.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.030
That is, the people
who bring them things

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.980
to pawn have often stolen
those things, right?

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.170
And that is a serious problem.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.190
And if you go into any
used furniture store

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.920
or any used clothing store,
you had better believe

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.710
that a large proportion of what is
on sale there has not in one way--

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.430
it's more complicated than
simply saying it was stolen.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.690
But I assure you that a large part

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.710
of it was not exactly
there legally, all right?

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.830
So that is a function of
this kind of gray economy.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:21.580
It's an economy in used
items, off brand name items

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.350
and stolen material
and things like that.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:29.670
OK. So that is why Jews are let in.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.310
That is what they to.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:39.620 position:56%
Now in order then to take the next
step I want to say that what happens

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.740
if you want to understand
what the Ghetto is,

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.080 position:56%
the Ambassador said quite correctly.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.670
There is a decision
to exclude the Jews

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.410
or to segregate the Jews
and that's quite true.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.040
But we have a word for that.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.450
We call those gated
communities, right?

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.550
Everybody laughs when I say that.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.300
But think about it.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.510
What is a gated community?

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.060
I can live here and
you can't, right?

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.550
Now, you could say yes but the
Jews would have rather lived

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.850
somewhere else.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:12.170
How many Jews do you think
lived in Venice before 1516?

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.200
How many people vote 300 people?

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.080
I'll tell you that in
1516, 900 Jews were

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.050
at one moment admitted
into that Ghetto.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.590
How many lived there in 1514?

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.770
Or, let's say 1500.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.070
Take a guess.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.500
How many people would say 500?

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.470
How many people would say 1500?

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.770
Nobody is saying anything.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.070
Come on guys.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:38.010
You're like my classes.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.030
Who give me $1500?

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:43.240
1500 Jews, 1500 Jews?

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.540
Going ones.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.620
1500 Jews going twice.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.860
How many people here would say,

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:53.620
"Oh there were only 500
Jews before the Ghetto."

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.710
OK, I got one.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.100
How many? Three hundred, OK.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.860
You want the real answer is?

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.160
So what was the Ghetto?

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.320
It was a way of letting
the Jews into Venice.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.620
Now wait a minute.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.360
Where did the Jews live before?

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.770
So let me try to show you
some quick maps here, OK?

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.510
This is a 1500 map of the city.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:12.810
There are no Jews yet.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.600
There is no Ghetto in the
city there are no Jews

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.480
in the city except people who come

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.610
in on short term peddling
licenses and so forth.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.910
The Ghetto is going to be--

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.710
I don't know if there's--
no there's nothing.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.250
OK. So but up at the top is

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.240
where the Ghetto was
going to be established.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.190
Here you can see this
is a larger map.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:39.100
This is already 1550 and if you
look at the top of the map here,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.400
this is the area where
the Ghetto was established

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.980
as we heard it was a foundry
it was an old industrial zone

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.280
that had been opened
up, let me show you.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.100
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.270 position:56%
And now I want to show you something
important for you to understand.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:50.990
We're going to skip that.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.290
I'll come back to that.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:59.840
OK. The first Ghetto was called,
in Italian, the Ghetto Nuovo.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.900
The second Ghetto was-- some
people here speak Italian.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.730
The second Ghetto was
called the Ghetto Vecchio.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.100
Now, does that make sense?

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:16.060 position:56%
No. Because the new Ghetto shouldn't
come before the old Ghetto unless

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.160
you realize that the word
Ghetto means foundry.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.720 position:56%
And as we heard it means a foundry
or a melting pot like that I'm going

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.260
to use that in my next talk and
not admit I stole it from you.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.440
But the Ghetto, the first area

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.650
that the Jews were given
was an old industrial area.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.860 position:56%
They were given that area to live in

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.890
and that area is called
the Ghetto Nuovo.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.960
That's how we really know
the word comes from Venice.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.920
There are a lot of
theories about maybe it came

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.870
from somewhere else that belong.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.510
If you look down below,

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.040
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:58.130
The first Ghetto was
established in 1516.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:03.470 position:56%
By 1541 the Jews need more space and
so they are given the second space.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.600
Understand I said to you
the Jews were admitted

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.940
because they provided money
lending and they provided peddling

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.240
and they provide they were part

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.380
of that extended gray
market thus the old Ghetto

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.260
which is the newer Ghetto, right,
the Ghetto Vecchio which is

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.230
in fact the newer Ghetto
was established for Jews

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.760
who are bringing the trade of the
Ottoman Empire into Venice it is

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.930
for Levantine merchants and that
is an indication of how Venice

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:32.950
which had once as the Ambassador
quite correctly said once dominated

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:34.250
the Eastern Mediterranean,

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.270
Venice own the Eastern
Mediterranean, right?

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:41.030
But at this point the Ottomans
have become so powerful

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.330
that Venice is now forced.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:48.250
If it wants the rights of its
merchants to trade in Istanbul

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.520
or Constantinople that
it becomes Istanbul,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.980
they have to also admit
Ottoman subjects.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:59.130
So this Ghetto, the second Ghetto
is an extension that is given

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.160
to the Jews who are coming
from the Ottoman Empire.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.170
Now if you look up in the third
area, you can see the Ghetto

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:11.610
in Nuovo which is the kind of
pinky square, the bluish thing

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.510
down below is the Ghetto Vecchio.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.530
If you look at the yellow up on the
right, that is the newest Ghetto.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:24.280
By 1633 the word Ghetto had
come to mean not a foundry

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.700
but the place where Jews live.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.040
And so by that point when
they give the Spanish

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.950
and Portuguese Jews a
new Ghetto they get it

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.950
and it is called the newest Ghetto.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:39.230
That is 1633 and that is an
attempt by Venice to get access

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:44.530
to the huge imperial trade of
the Iberian Empires, right?

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:48.620 position:56%
You know, we talk about the American
Empire and we bemoan the fact

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.740
that perhaps the American
Empire is over,

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.160
but it was a very short
life empire, right?

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.220
It was a very short
empire, maybe 50, 60 years.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.190
If you want to take it back
to First World War maybe,

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:04.090
but Spain ran the world
for 250 years.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.910
That's what you call an empire.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.910
That's how to build an empire.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:09.970
Those Hispanics don't let them in.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.270
They'll take-- oh I'm sorry.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:17.270
It's just-- I live on
CNN what can I tell you?

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.420
OK. So, there's another thing

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.790
and here is the entry
way into that Ghetto.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.530
And that's just another map of it.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.990
Now, let me-- What do I have left?

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.960
I have about 10 minutes
left, something?

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.440
OK, so not bad, not bad.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.120
How long we leave out
three quarters.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.740
OK. Now, what I want to
stress to you is this.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.850
I used the term gated community.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:44.220
And obviously, you know, everybody
laugh, "What are you talking about?

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.150
Gated communities are
for fancy people."

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.660
Thank you.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.900
This is an admission of Jews.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.210
Now, would the Jews have liked
to have places somewhere else?

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.410
Sure. Sure they would've.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:01.400
In fact, in 1509 Jewish money
lenders were already negotiating

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:06.520
for spots on the Rialto for
places to live right on the Rialto

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:11.350
at the bridge, the main commercial
hub, the Wall Street of Venice.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:16.060 position:56%
And instead they got this place but
would Jews have preferred no Ghetto?

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.930
No, don't be silly because first

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.560
of all it gave them
a place of their own.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.540
It gave them the right
to live in the city.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.910
The community, there are rumors
that the community got to be as big

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.750
as 5000 Jews and there is a
wonderful lecture that I heard

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.290 position:56%
by a man named David Cassuto who was
once the vice mayor of Jerusalem.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.940
He's an architect who figured

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.190
out that there are literally was
not enough space in the Ghetto

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.020
for everybody to sleep
at the same time.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.480
There were 5000 Jews there--

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.680
it just wasn't that big and so we
have this whole theory the Jews

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.820
slept in shifts.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.660
Slept in shits-- oh no.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.180
Whatever they did, right?

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.440
They live there but it's not so.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.050
The community was probably
never much more than 2500 Jews.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.620
There were bigger Jewish
communities.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.890 position:56%
Rome's Jewish community got to about
8000 and Livorno's Jewish community

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:09.310
on the other side of the
peninsula got to be about 5000.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.810
Amsterdam was close to 5000.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:15.790
Prague may have been
as much as 10 or 15000.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.850
So but Venice is one of
the biggest cities in one

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:21.990
of the biggest Jewish
cities in Europe and one

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.820
of the richest and wealthiest.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.010
Now I just want-- let me--
I'm going to skip this.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.480
I just want to show you
a couple of pictures

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.930
of synagogues in the
Venetian Ghetto.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.840
If you haven't been there,
go there, quite remarkable.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.310
This is the Ashkenazi Synagogue.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.960
This is the outside of
the Spanish synagogue

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.920
which was built a little bit later.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.130
This is the Canton synagogue.

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:49.430
The pictures aren't that great
because I took them off the web

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.800
and I don't have very good ones.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.360
OK. So now let me now sum this up,
I've got about five minutes left

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.320
so let me see if I can
bring this together for you

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.160
to make some sense of it.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.370
What did it mean that the Jews
were given their own city,

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:08.390
their own business that these
are people whom Venice needs

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:10.080
and wants and attracts?

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.590
The first thing I want you to
understand is it does not mean.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.430
We always talk about in terms of
rights, toleration, assimilation,

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.880
getting along, going together.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.440
Don't be silly.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:28.130
This is a society which is defined
by ethnic and religious factors.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.000
And people did not.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.490
They may have crossed those
lines on a daily basis,

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.500
at night when they
slept with somebody.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.260
You can never tell
what they're doing.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.560 position:56%
And believe me everybody is sleeping

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.620
with everybody especially
during carnival.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:46.340
But these are segregated
societies in a way

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.140
that our society doesn't
know how to deal with.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.890
We live in a segregated
society not as much

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.660
as it was 30 or 40 years ago.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.020
But you look around look at
residential neighborhoods

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.610
and you see that people
tend to live in groups.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:07.760
And we have an ideology in our
society of openness, right?

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.870
I move to this country
from Canada at a time

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:12.940 position:56%
when the Civil Rights Act was just--

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:19.120
the country literally tore itself
apart to try to maintain and foster

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.630
and build up that ideology when it
came to racial segregation, right?

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.510
But the whole idea of this
country is this ideology

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.730
and we think that's the norm.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.640
It's not the norm here and
it certainly is not the norm

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.760
in other societies and we
somehow say they're immoral.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:39.200
No they're not immoral
because the anxieties of groups

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.630
that are separate living
next to each other

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:46.820
in crowded urban situations,
is always real.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.570
You can work against it.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:52.800
You can try to articulate
an ideology of openness.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.600
But in this society nobody though
that everybody should be the same.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.090
And remember please, this is
very important to remember.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:06.470 position:56%
I started out by saying everybody
knows that Christians hate the Jews.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:11.240
If it weren't for the Christianity
Judaism would not have survived

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.540
in Europe.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.460
If it weren't for the church,
Judaism would have been eradicated.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:21.030
The church has an ideology that
says the world will be saved

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:23.490
by the ultimate redemption
of the Jews.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:26.760
And as a result the
church worked consistently,

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.180 position:56%
there were exceptions here and there
but consistently church teaching is

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:37.510
that the Jews must be
fostered and protected and kept

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:41.600
within the society because they are
the ultimate redemption of mankind.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.830
If you'll ask me, a Jew, I think
it's a crazy-- I know Jews.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.020
I wouldn't make them the
redemption of nothing.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:52.510
But the Christians have
a mishegas, a craziness.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:57.250
[ Foreign Language ]

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:01.630
But it is a Catholic doctrine.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:03.350
So it's very important
to remember that.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.570
That doesn't mean there
isn't anxiety.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.400
But where does that leave us?

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.670
I want to just end off with
a couple of quick moments.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.070
First of all what was
mentioned before the idea

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.370
that the Jews have their own city

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:20.600
that this was the Città degli
Ebrei, the Jews have their own city

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.670
and therefore they
had obligations there.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:29.450
They had to control behavior there.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.560
There are legal implications.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.440
Jews were in charge of the streets,
Jews were in charge of crime,

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.840
Jews were in charge of membership.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.070
Jews would keep some Jews out
and allow certain Jews in.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.410
I want to show you one of
the most famous characters

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:44.790
from the Ghetto of Venice.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.920
His name, you'll see
his book out there.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.430
He wrote a-- on sec, let
me show you the title page.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:55.460
His name is Mayor ben
Gavriel [assumed spelling].

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.070
His first name was Mayor, a
good Hebrew name but he was born

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:03.110
in Madshow Amaya and so in
Italian they called him Magino,

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:08.370
Magino Gabrielle was quite a
character and in the 16th--

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:11.030
there you see a picture
of him in the middle.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.570 position:56%
You could see that he's dressed in
the latest most fashionable clothes.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.730
He does not have a badge.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.950
He does not have a long beard.

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:23.140 position:56%
He does not have a hat, because he's
an Italian Jew they didn't bother

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.040
with all that stuff.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.340
And what did he do?

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:31.240 position:56%
He taught Italians how to make a
second crop of silk worms each year.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.540
How did you do it?

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.210
By keeping the Bhakti,
the little worms warm.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:37.970
Where did you keep them warm?

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.210
Well there were women
and they had dresses

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.660
and they-- you could keep them.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.680
And so here you see a picture
from his book of him handing

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.950
that little sack, you see the
little in the woman's hand?

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:52.910
That's full of little silk
work cocoons and she gives it

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.170
to her neighbor, the neighbor
gives it to the nest lady

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:58.610
and the lady is there ready to
bring the worms into bed with her,

00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:59.910
right, and keep them there.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.880
And if you think that's
a craziness it's not

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.720
because in fact we
have travelers who say

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.630
that this was quire regularly done.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:10.150 position:56%
It was one of the ways that Italians
got two sets of silk works each year

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.310
and improve their produce.

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:15.910
But now, you can look at Magino
and Magino is a character.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.920
He's obviously-- look at how he's
dressed, look at what he is here

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.400
and he really is one of
the most fascinating people

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.710
of the Venetian Ghetto.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:25.100
But he is typical in a
very interesting way.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.730
He's not an intellectual.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.540
He is not a rich merchant.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.230
He is an operator.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.120
He is one of those guys that
make movies about on Wall Street.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.800
You know, she's one of these
guys who's always got a new idea.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.350
He got the Pope's sister
to invest in his idea.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:44.240
He got-- sorry, Ferdinando de
Medici to invest in his idea.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.450
He was sure he was going
to build everything.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:52.220
And he also made himself a
console of the Jewish nation.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:57.630
And he-- this Jew from Venice gets
de Medici to give him the right

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:02.230
to bring as many Jews as he
wanted to Venice's rival the city

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:04.640
of Livorno on the other
side of the country

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.470
and to be there chief fellow.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:11.750
Within about one year, the Jews
there say, "You're our what?"

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:16.260
And they throw him out and
they rewrite their constitution

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:21.150
so that no more is this Charlton
or this operator running things.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:24.750
And like a lot of people who
dream of making a lot of money,

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.260
his eventually thrown out.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:31.390 position:56%
But I want to go back just to a very
different Jew and this is the fellow

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.950
that I mentioned before,
that I showed

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.190
and passed over before Leon Modena.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.270
Leon Modena and this
is my last point.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:42.370
Leon Modena was born in the
Ghetto of Venice in 1571.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.610
He lived there his entire life.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.330
Every time he left
all he could dream

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.040 position:56%
about was coming back to the Ghetto.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.470
He dreamed of the Ghetto.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.940
He loved the Ghetto.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.760
And he was an unbelievable failure.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.420
He was a famous rabbi.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.400
He spoke, he wrote, he was friends

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.180
with the ambassadorial
class in Venice.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.050
He wrote books that
were published in French

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:03.860
and in English and
so forth and so on.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.720
He wrote in Hebrew and he was
a terrible failure primarily

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.650 position:56%
because he was addicted to gambling.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:13.500
And as a gambler he lost
every cent he ever made.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.400
At one point he was giving
four sermons every Saturday

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.460 position:56%
in different synagogues in the
Ghetto and he went through the money

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.330
like water because he gambled.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.570 position:56%
He wasn't gambling just for nothing.

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.700
Gambling was a problem
in the Ghetto.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.140
And I want to mention
as I end this thing,

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.880
I really am coming
to the end I promise.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.180
The [foreign language]
stealing his time.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:40.450
His sons, one of his sons died
from alchemical experiments.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:45.710 position:56%
He was trying to make a quick buck
and he poisoned himself with arsenic

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:48.090
and ended up bleeding to death.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:53.510
Second son left the city,
was captured by the Turks.

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:57.630 position:56%
He's actually expelled from the city
for gambling and alcohol abuses.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:01.450 position:56%
He leaves, he eventually ends up
and leave or nowhere he has to write

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:05.010
to his father because he
is now a prisoner and slave

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.870
and the father sends money but
the kid never comes to visit him.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.280
The third son is a
boy named Zebulon.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.170
It's his pride and joy he calls
him Zebulon because the bible says

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:18.180
that Zebulon was a tribe that
lived on the sea and they live

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.950
in Venice and it's on the sea.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:24.090
And this is a boy who sand in the
synagogue choir and he's wonderful.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:28.890
And then the boy gets involved in
gangs in the Ghetto and he gets

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:33.690 position:56%
in a fight with the head of the gang
over a prostitute and he is stabbed

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.180
on the street and they run and
call his father this old rabbi here

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:43.680
and he comes and he's holding his
head in his lap as the boy dies.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.310
Now, what I want you
to understand then is

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:49.690
that the Ghetto was many things.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.930
It was not a condom.

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.190
It was the city of the Jews.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:00.020
But that means that it
had all the complications

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:04.410
and all the plusses
and minuses of cities.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:09.330
It had intellectuals, it had
merchants, it had gang fights,

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.280
it had prostitutes, it
had robbers, it had theft,

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.280
it had selling goods on the slide.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.780 position:56%
That ladies and gentleman is the
Ghetto and the book that I'm working

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.420
on right now has this it's
subtitled "The Ghetto of Venice,

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.630 position:56%
The Birthplace of Jewish Modernity".

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.510
Thank you very much.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:34.630
[ Applause ]

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.550
And I now introduce
Professor Stefano Villani

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.020
who knows much more
about Venice than I do.

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.510
&gt;&gt; Stefano Villani: Than you.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.520
[ Applause ]

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.860
Thank you so much to the Library
of Congress and to the embassy

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.910
for being organize this event.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:58.910
It's always difficult to
speak after Berny and actually

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:05.100 position:56%
in my talk I'm asking whether where
Ghettos for non-Catholic Christians.

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.750
To answer to this question we must
therefore first address the issue

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:12.460
of what was the protestant present
in Italy in early modern times.

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.670
The information as its
known dates from 1517,

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:21.140
following the establishment of the
Ghetto of Venice when Martin Luther

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.950
on the heave of all saints put
out this 95 thesis at [inaudible].

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:29.970
Luther's work quickly circulated
throughout whole Germany

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:39.840
and Europe already in 1520
the first anti-lutheran text,

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.140
the [foreign language].

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:44.690
Politi was published in Italy at
Florence spreading information

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:48.870
about the German religious
debate among Italians.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:53.790 position:56%
Lutheran ideas spread in Italy among
religious orders and in particular

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:59.070
in the Augustinian one to which
formerly Luther himself belong.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:04.130
Refer my ideas circulated since
1530s in many areas of Italy.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:11.220
Significant reform groups affirming
Venice creates to a political elite

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:15.210
which claim its autonomy
from Rome in Ferrara

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:18.890
where the Dutch's near
France offer protection

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:21.920
to enter dock Saint
Calvinist and then Luca

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:27.550 position:56%
where the entire city portrayed
openly sympathize for the new ideas.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:33.580 position:56%
Reform groups more or less structure
are report in Milan, Cremona, Como,

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.530
Pavia, Udine, Pagua,
Vigencia Modena.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:44.080
Enables in the 1540s a spiritual
circle that develop orthodox ideas

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.930
without being openly
protestant gather

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:51.230
around the Spanish theologian Juan
de Valdez challenging traditional

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.230
Catholic doctrines.

00:50:53.230 --> 00:51:00.670
The spreading of heresy in Italy
led the Pope Paul III in July 1542

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:04.730
to organize a special committee
of six cardinal with the task

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:08.160
of proceeding against
heretics, those suspected

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.060
of heresy and those who help them.

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:16.370
The congregation of the holy office
or the Roman inquisition was born.

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:20.230
The holy office unlike the
already existing Spanish

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:23.810
and Portuguese inquisition
which were born mainly in order

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:29.050
to control the Jews and the Muslims
what converted to Catholicism was

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:34.480 position:56%
so established to stop the diffusion
of protestant ideas in Italy.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.900
The congregation was given the
task of creating a structure

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:43.280
of tribunals all over the
entire Italian Peninsula.

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.200
It was heavily centralized
institution.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.290
Everything was report
directly to Rome.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:53.010
Since Pius V pontificate
the practice

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.250
that the Pope himself
preceded over the meetings

00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:00.520 position:56%
of the cardinal once a week
usually on Thursday was established.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.850
The congregation was also meeting
once a week without the Pope,

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:08.630
usually on Tuesdays to
revue all the cases,

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.180
judge it in the local tribunals.

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:16.640
On December 7, 1965 on
the heave of the hand

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.590 position:56%
of the council Vatican II the Pope
changed the name of the congregation

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:23.800
of the holy office into that of
the congregation for the doctrine

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.750
of faith which is still exist.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:30.370
Because of the dispersion of
the archives and documents

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:31.940
which are secure over the years.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.520
It is difficult to establish the
number of prophesies and death

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.560
of the death sentences executed

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.540
by the 48 local seeds
of the inquisition.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:47.270
We know that 128 people were
burned at the stake at Rome.

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:51.010
Rough calculations suggest that
in the four centuries of activity

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:54.490
of the holy office, 11 to 1400

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.860
of people were executed
throughout Italy.

00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:00.550
The last death sentence
was carried out in 1761.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:03.820
About half of the sentences
were against protestant.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:06.770
The others concern
diabolic witchcraft,

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.620
men with ministrio de
confesión or celebrated mass

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:15.200
without being ordained priest
and again Jews and Muslims.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.360
The Spanish inquisition was more
ferocious for bringing out for

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.970
than 1200 death sentences.

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:25.860 position:56%
Their oppression played an important
role in preventing the spread

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.200
of protestant ideas in Italy.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.730
Many were those who
choose the path of exile,

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:34.050
Italian protestant churches
where if founded abroad

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.170
in Geneva and Zurich and London.

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.780
An Italian branches of the
Geneva church were established

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.620
in Paris, Leone and [inaudible].

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:46.430
Italian protestant churches
were then active in Valtellina

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:49.090
which from 1512 was
under the control

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:51.750
of the Swiss Canton of the Grisons.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.820
The Grisons joined the reformation
in the 1530s and therefore

00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:00.570
since then ulting Valtellina
for several decades co-existence

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:04.160
between protestant and
Catholics was practiced.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.130
This experiment of co-existent

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:10.250
between different religious
confessions however ended in blood

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.790
in 1620 when the pro-Spanish
revolt against the domination

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.390
of the Grisons led to the
massacre of hundreds of protestants

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:21.760
between 400 and 600
people were killed.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.170
The only other place that
saw a protestant presence

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:28.530
in the Italian peninsula were
the valleys west of Pinerolo

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:33.340
in Piedmont part of the
Duchy of Savoy where most

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.040
of the population were Waldensians.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.170
These areas of the westerner half

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:43.520
since the middle ages had seen
the presence of heretical groups

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:49.060
that not even the last
great crusade internal

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.170
to Christianity in
1487 had weed out.

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:56.070
They're Waldensians who
did not speak Italian

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:59.060
but the French dialect
establish a relationship

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.410
with the Swiss protestant

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:04.410
and in 1532 formally joined
the reformation becoming

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:05.780
Calvinist church.

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:10.100
For 30 years the Waldensians
Mountains resisted in arms

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:16.260
to any attempt of the Duke of Savoy
to bring them back to Catholicism.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:21.910
On June 5, 1561 in Cavour a peace
treaty between the representatives

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:24.710
of the Waldensian communities
and those

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:28.220
of the Duke of Savoy was signed.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:32.460
This treaty granted religious
freedom to the Waldensians

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:36.500
in precise and define
territorial limits.

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:40.210
The agreement was condemned by
Rome and the Waldensian communities

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:44.260
which then existed till to Calabria
were massacre in the same year

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:45.970
with thousands of deaths.

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:50.190
Since then the Waldensian valleys
were sort of [foreign language].

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:54.440 position:56%
And in those mountain municipalities

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:59.900
around 15,000 Waldensians could
build temples, organize schools

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:02.790
and they have pastor
trainee in Geneva.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:06.480
The Waldensians could not move
outside the prescribed areas

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.360
of the valleys mentioned in the
treaty, the high valley Lucerne,

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.740
valley San Martino Castrozza.

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:17.790
We don't find the expression Ghetto
to define the Waldensians valleys

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.770
in any influent at the time.

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:22.840
This was an expression
coined in the 19th century

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.920
and since then much
using the historiography.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.090
But even though it was
not a space enclosed

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:33.890
by walls the term Ghetto well
describes the idea of a space

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.600
that allowed the presence of people

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.090
of different religion
in a Catholic country.

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:43.790
The valleys that very well
defined and precise boundaries.

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:47.650
The Cavour treaty is in fact the
first Edict of Tolerance issued

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:50.710
in Europe which surpass the
principle of [foreign language]

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:58.580
in shine in the piece of
Oxberry 1555 which stated

00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:02.830
that in par subject were to follow
the religion of their ruler.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:06.800
Over the years Waldensians families
settle outside limits that set

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.130
up by the treaty of Cavour.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:13.050
In 1655 an ordinance imposed to
the Waldensians who are settling

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:17.440 position:56%
in these areas either to convert to
Catholicism or to leave their homes.

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:23.410
A massacre followed in which it
doesn't mean that about 1700 men

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:28.460
and women were killed and
148 children were taken away

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:29.860
from their valleys and given

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:33.460
to Catholic families
to be educated as such.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:37.430
The massacre provoked the
ignition of the protestant world

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:41.190
and the memory of the
protestant anger was enshrined

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:44.420
by John Milton in a
famous [inaudible].

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:48.680
The Waldensians valleys, the
Ghetto of the hubs represent

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:53.420
and thus the only area of religious
freedom in the Italian peninsula

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.590
after the massacres of the
Waldensians of Calabria

00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:00.110
and of the protestants
of Valtellina.

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:04.580
In evidence of those places in
fermented over the year's practice

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.950
of tolerance and co-existents.

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:10.350 position:56%
It was only with the patent electors
granted by Duke Carlo Alberto

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:16.410
of Savoy to the Waldensian on
February 17, 1848 that the terms

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:18.990
of the treaty of Cavour
were overcome.

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:22.450
The patent electors granted to
the Waldensians the possibility

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:27.650
of building temples outside of
the 13 parishes of the valleys,

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:31.400
the Waldensians set in Turin in
Genuine after the unification

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.910
of Italy they adopted the
Italian language instead of French

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:39.890
and established churches throughout
the peninsula in very major city.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:46.130
Except from the Waldensian valleys
in all Italian states protestant

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:51.080
and foreign non-Catholics were not
allowed to stay even temporary.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:56.370 position:56%
And those were found run the risk to
be persecuted as formally heretics.

00:58:56.370 --> 00:59:03.570 position:56%
Every year on Holy Thursday the Bull
in China domeny was solemnly read

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:06.390
in letting an Italian
from the [inaudible]

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:08.670
of Saint Peter's Basilica.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:13.440
This battled document listed
the most serious case punishable

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.640
by excommunication and the list is

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:21.120
in 1610 the excommunication was
clear prescribed for all the sites,

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.100
likely fights, Lutherans,
Indians, Calvinist, Huguenots

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:28.730
and Baptist anti-Trinitarian
apostolate of the Christian faith.

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:34.180
Those who were aware of the
presence of heretics were obliged

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.060
to report them to the inquisition.

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:40.690
In 1592 Italian Catholics were
explicitly forbidden to live

00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:43.470
in countries where mass
was not celebrated openly.

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:49.790
In 1623 Gregory XV issued
the Bull Romanum Pontificem

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:53.720
which reiterated the ban for
heretics to travel in Italy.

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.820
From a purely theoretical point
of view a protestant persecuted

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.570
by the inquisition had
only the option to choose

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:03.330
between the conversion
to Catholicism

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:07.200
and the condemnation is a relapsed
heretic which followed the transfer

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.580
into the hands of the
secular authorities

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.200
to carry out the death sentence.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.470
If the legislation excluded in
such a precise and dramatic manner,

01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:20.560
the possibility for heretics
to travel, trade and settle

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.780
in a Catholic country,
in reality things run

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.620
in a complete different way.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:30.500
Since the 16th century
flexible practices correspondent

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:35.110
to the Draconian rule and heretic
travelers would have behave

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:41.390
in a prudent and judicious way were
usually left entirely undisturbed.

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:45.200
It is obviously clear that the
presence of a strict rule even

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.230
if not always applied let the
ample space to an arbitrary

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:52.680
and arrogant discretion
therefore over the years,

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:57.380
the protestant countries try often
successfully to introduce elements

01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:00.340
of perfection for protestants
who needed

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.750
to travel in Catholic countries.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:06.080
For example, after the approval
of the peace treaty between Spain

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.210
and England in 1605 it's
provisions regarding the protection

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:12.830
of British travelers
from any persecution

01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:16.440
of the Spanish inquisition where in
fact the standard the old thing the

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.050
Mediterranean countries
under the jurisdiction

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.730
of the Roman inquisition.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:26.280 position:56%
The only condition that were imposed
on them were not to do any kind

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.140
of religious propaganda, not to
behave without giving scandal

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.870
in the eyes of Catholics.

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:35.150
That means no to publicly
express their idea in said

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.510
to a known Catholic faith.

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:42.790
These flexible practices led to
the establishment in many parts

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:45.590
of the Italian Peninsula
of South communities

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:49.190
of foreign protestants
as permanent residence.

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.090
In early modern Italy for
a known Catholics live

01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:57.210
in the great trading cities of the
Italian Peninsula, Venice, Milan,

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.990
Janua, Livorno, Rome, Naples.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:03.280
In the republic of Venice,
known Catholic foreigners study

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.770
at the University of Padua
where students who came

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:12.340
from protestant lands had this
special status or serve a soldiers

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.910
in the fortress of Palmanova.

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:18.480 position:56%
In the north, there was a continuous
osmosis between the Catholic

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.940
and the protestant world
with merchants and craftsmen

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:23.700
who move from place to place.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.000
In other Italian cities,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.200
the presence of known
Catholic foreigners,

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.200
were very limited often temporary
and due to the individual choices

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.810
that in their singularity
escape through a general rule.

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:36.460
Of course especially
in north in Italy,

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.040
most of these foreign
heretics were from Germany.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.420
There were also depending on
the place of French Huguenots,

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.690
Dutch Calvinist, this
charismatic Greeks and Armenians.

01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:49.120
Known Catholic British are the
structure presents only in Venice,

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.650
Genoa, Naple and Livorno.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:55.430
In the later city, in the
17th century, German speaking

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:58.790
and English speaking protestant
communities were established.

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:01.530
The de facto tolerance
towards protestants

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:05.720
and protestant merchants was also
granted in the port cities of Nice

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.760
in the Duchy of Savoy and [foreign
language] in the Papal States.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.010
You know, these places, protestants
were asked to do their best not

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:19.290
to be recognized as such because in
theory it was impossible for them

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:22.950
to reside in any Italian state,
they were not demanded to reside

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.200
in a particular part of the city.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.520
On the contrary, there were request
to adopt pneumatic strategies

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.650
to avoid being discovered
as for example not

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:37.490
to eat meat during
holidays of obligations.

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:41.760 position:56%
The typical example of this practice
common told the Catholic country

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.820
that for commercial reasons
of protestant presence is

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.220
that of Livorno where known
Catholic merchants were protected

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.540
by Monco Proporio issued by
the Grant Duke of Tuscany

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.370
in 1593, the so called Levornina.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:56.760
This decree designed to protect

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.140
from the inquisition the Jewish
cumbersome versus desire to settle

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:05.690
in Livorno was addressed to the
merchants of whatever nation,

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:09.980
Levantini and Ponentini, Spanish,
Portugese, Greeks and Germans,

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:15.280
Italian Jews, Turks and Moores,
Armenian, Persian and others.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.950
Gradually, the Levornina
became a point of reference

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:21.580
for whole known Catholic Christians
who wanted to settle in Tuscany.

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:26.150
Between to the end of the 1500s and
the early 1600s, not many British

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:28.800
and Dutch settle in Livorno.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.670
Those who did so were
often ship captains

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:33.540
in the service of the grand Duke.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:37.230 position:56%
Less frequently, they were merchants
and although there were no precise

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:39.420
that have very often
they were Catholic.

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.970
It was only in 1620s
when the English

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:45.100
and Dutch mercantile
presence increase in number

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.830
that gradually the
protestant element emerge

01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:50.500
of becoming predominant
in a few years.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.150
There were a few dozen people and
almost all of them were bachelors

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:57.680
or had left their wives home
clearly showing that at least

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.470
in their intention, their stay in
Livorno was conceived as temporary.

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:06.050
Eventually, the growing foreign
presence led to the establishment

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:11.030
of formal national communities, the
[inaudible] officially recognized

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:15.400
by the Tuscan government
structure with their home statutes

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.160
and self-governing bodies
headed by a counsel.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.140
We did not have diplomatic status

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.070
and only represented the
mercantile community.

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:25.840
The German presence in Livorno,
at least until the middle

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.240
of the 18th century was
completing negligible.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.420
The few German merchants within
their early modern hate to reside

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.460
in Livorno joined the Dutch nation

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.990
which in fact was called
Dutch-German nation hat's [foreign

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:39.260
language] Germanica.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.710
There was also small
garrison of German soldiers,

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:45.540
and a number of abjuration of
these soldiers make us think

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.500
that among them the
majority were protestants.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:52.700 position:56%
It must be emphasized that the
tolerance granted to the protestants

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:57.240
of Livorno was a limited and
controlled one which offer

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:01.250
to them neither the freedom
of worship nor the possibility

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.920
of religious frugalities,

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.850
not to worry with the quorum
and dignity their debts.

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:10.040
On the contrary, it
allowed Catholic frugalities

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.340 position:56%
and inquisitorial control over them.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.710
Gradually, with the
growth of importance

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:19.080
of their mercantile communities,
British and Dutch started

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:23.330
to feel uneasy with this strict
limits imposed on their freedom

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:26.090
and sought to widen
the space of tolerance.

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:29.970
The history of the protestant
presence in Livorno in the 17th

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:33.740
and 18th century is that's also
the history of the conflict

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.880
of this communities
with the political

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.540
and religious Tuscan
authority to assert their right

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:41.670
to live openly their
religious beliefs.

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:44.660
The first to clean this
right were the British,

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:48.050
it was since 1644 tried
several times

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:51.220
to have a protestant
minister for their community.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.960
Very significantly, the Tuscan
authorities both locally

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.210
and centrally were
well aware of the fact

01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:00.120
that the protestant worship
was practiced in the city.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.750
It did not try any objections.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.980
However, every time that
the protestant went over

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.280
and above the limit of desirable
description and this correction

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.540
in the presence of this protestant
minister became publicly known the

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:17.840
inquisition intervene forcing the
state authorities to expel them.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:23.860
Between 1644 and 1670s we know
at least of 10 expulsions.

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:28.050 position:56%
It was only in 1697 that the
ambassador's chaplain could informal

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:31.790
exercise his ministry also for
the English mercantile community

01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:35.360
of Livorno thanks to extra
territoriality granted

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.090
to the English diplomats.

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:41.240
At first this happened, if
not secretly, with discretion

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:45.940
and prudence then since
1707 openly and publicly.

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.720
This change was obtained
by England threatening

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.270
to break off diplomatic relation
with Tuscany if they did not agree

01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:56.890
to this request and even
menacing military intervention.

01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:01.760 position:56%
However, it is significant that even
after 1707, it was explicitly ask

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.370
to the British that the buildings

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:09.130
where the protestant congregation
met should not be recognizable

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:14.930 position:56%
in many way as a chapel or a church
in contrast to the Jewish synagogues

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:18.850 position:56%
which are to be clearly recognizable
in the case of protestant places

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:21.400
of worship, they assist soft
of talking invisibility.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:25.680
In the 1640s the Dutch and
the English communities

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.050
of Livorno were allowed
to have grave yards

01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:30.900
where they could erect
individual tombs.

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.250
Almost certainly before then
they buried their deaths

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:35.330
in anonymous common graves.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:38.230
All these cemeteries, for
almost half a century,

01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:40.560
however, could not be fenced.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.740
Fences to protect the burials
of not Catholic from animals

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.680 position:56%
and grave robbers were ask in 1685
by the Dutch in 1706 by the English,

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.730
difficult negotiations follow.

01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:56.910
The Dutch at first write the
issue first fenced their cemetery

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:58.330
as early as 1695.

01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:02.550 position:56%
The English could also only in 1746.

01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:06.870
One of the reason which
prevented the erection of walls

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:10.080
around the known Catholic
cemeteries was the fear

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.210
that the religious rights
could be celebrated there

01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:14.680
and seen from the outside.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.150
And for this reason, even when
eventually the construction

01:09:18.150 --> 01:09:22.180
of the wall was permitted, this had
to be short enough to allow those

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.710
who were outside to see what was
going on inside the cemetery.

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:34.100 position:56%
The religious authorities wanted to
affirm so in a symbolic way the fact

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:38.360
that the burial of heretics
had nothing to do with religion

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.190 position:56%
and for death reasons much attention
was devoted to forbid Catholic

01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:45.900
to attend any protestant
from their own service.

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.360
The protestant in Livorno
live all over the city.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.980 position:56%
Their issues in the central cities,
the ordering less prestigious areas,

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.670
the same thing as far as I know can
be say the fall the Italian cities

01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:00.400
in which there was
a foreign presence.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.120
The co-existence in
the same urban space--

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:09.110
they co-exist in the same
urban space led eventually

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:13.250
to process assimilation especially
among the wealthy foreigners.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:18.060
In 1616, the inquisitor of Turin
complained the Swish merchant

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.050
married Catholic women, was
children he did not know

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:24.410
which church they belonged to.

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:27.710
We know dozens of dozens of foreign
protestant who are having decided

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:31.350
to settle in Italy forever
converted to Catholicism.

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:35.380
In some, there were no protestant
Ghettos in Italy, on the contrary

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:38.870
as we have pointed out, protestant
were asked to be as invisible

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:41.410
as possible to formally
admit the presence

01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:44.960
of organized protestant
congregations beyond the violation

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.050
of the Canon law who they've meant
to admit that it was possible

01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:52.090 position:56%
to be a Christian without being
Catholic and this was inconceivable.

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:57.840
The closest thing to a Christian
Ghetto is the Fondaco dei Tedeschi,

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.710
the German Fondaco in Venice.

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:03.870
This ethnic institution was
established well before the

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:07.180
reformation in the mercantile
center of the city close

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.330
to Rialto Bridge [foreign
language] where medieval buildings

01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:14.960
that in the maritime Mediterranean
Cities were used as warehouse

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.880
and definitely also to
accommodate the foreign merchants.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:22.450
The words come from Arabic
Funduk literally warehouse house.

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:24.130
Between the 11th and
the 14th century,

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:26.960
Fundachi were built all
over the Mediterranean.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.550
Gradually, they lost
their shelter function

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:35.080
and became essentially place
where they live with custom taxes.

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.210
With 1500s, the great period
of the Fundachi had concluded.

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:42.160
The end of this system was
determined mainly by the impact

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.570
of the full Constantinople
in 30 shrines

01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:47.460
and on the Mediterranean trade
with the consequent search

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.400
of New Atlantic routes and
the progress in shifting

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.860
of commercial access
to the Northern Europe.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:56.470
The Fondaco dei Tedeschi
in Venis established

01:11:56.470 --> 01:12:02.580
in 1228 following the model of
Venetian Fundachi Gesan same

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.810
in the Islamic countries was the
only one of this medieval structure

01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:09.390 position:56%
to survive in the Italian Peninsula.

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:13.770
The structure permanently house
about 120 German merchants

01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:16.920
in addition to a large
number of workers, as cooks

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.300
and carriers the Venetian Sea at
the direction of that Fondaco.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.110
Every German mentioned was
obliged to stay in the Fondaco.

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:27.960
The boatman referred
them to the Venice

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:31.270
from the Mainland were forbidden
to take them to another place

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:33.140
that was not the Fondaco.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.990
A personal interpreter was assigned
to every merchant and was supposed

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:41.010
to assist him in all his dealings
and of course to control it.

01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:43.640
Entering the Fondaco,
the merchant had to hand

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.300
over their weapons and their money.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.900
As a matter of fact, many
of these measures were meant

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.200
to prevent tax fraud.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.900
In 1505, the building of
the Fondaco caught fire.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.510
The republic he gave order

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:59.250
to immediately rebuild
it at his own expenses.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:03.950
The speed with which this decisions
was taken relies creates the

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:06.640
economic importance that
the republic attributed

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.160
to the German presence.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.720
The new Fondaco completed in
1508 was a compact, beautiful

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.230
and harmonic building
decorated with fresco

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.160
by Jojo na Tisi [assumed spelling].

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.960
On the ground floor on the square,
courtyard they were the shots.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.810
In the two floors above
there were the houses

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:25.370
for the merchant and their factory.

01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:29.040
Many of the German merchants in
Venice joined the reformation.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.690
Already in 1529 the Pope lamented
that the Fondaco was a center

01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:34.400
for heretical propaganda.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.680
In subsequent year of the 16th
century of no much information

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:43.130
about the religious life
of the Fondaco the silence

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:46.100
of the sources led us to
think that known probability,

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.370
the republic was able to obtain
cautious attitude on the part

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:54.290
of the German community offering
it's political protection

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:58.900
in exchange of prudent behaviors
that would avoid any scandal.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:01.600
This dynamics were clearly similar

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.100
to those we have just described
for the Tuscan scenario.

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.860
But everyone they knew that the
Fondaco dei Tedeschi was nest

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.160
of heretics.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.290
In 1634, the apostolic minister of
Venice wrote to the congregation

01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:15.050
of the holy office that in
the Fondaco dei Tedeschi

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:20.350
in Rialto almost all the
merchants were heretics.

01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:25.960 position:56%
In the changing religious climb that
follow the hand of the 30 year wars

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.750
in 1650, the first
Lutheran pastor disguised

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:32.410
as a physician move in the Fondaco.

01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:36.790
He started to secretly celebrate
the protestant cult in two rooms

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.610
on the third floor of the building.

01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:44.960
At Easter of 1651 about 150
Lutherans did the communion.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:51.370 position:56%
The presence of the successor to the
first minister was denounced in 1654

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:56.020 position:56%
and they are cast of the [inaudible]
it was spelled from Venice.

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.900
These are [inaudible]
turning point in the life

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.310
of the German protestant
community of Venice

01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:04.730
which to avoid possible future
problems work out the set

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:08.070
of articles which organize
the worship rigorously

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:11.500
to ensure the secrecy
of the community.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.210
There were clear provision for
new comers and prescription role

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:17.640
to access the worship hall
without arousing suspicion.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.060
In addition to the detail longer
version they also prefer an

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:24.840
abbreviated document that that was
right to the younger new members

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.190
of the time of their
hunter in the community.

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:31.220
The Fondaco, and I'm
going to finish,

01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.110
was clear at the same
time both an institution

01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:37.250
of coexisting and of separation.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:39.620
It is not unlikely
that when the decision

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:44.070
to establish the Jewish Ghetto
was made the German structure

01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:47.710
as in some measure represent
a model for this project.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:50.550
In this brief overview we
have examined the three models

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:53.730
of integrous coexistent the
developing their early modern times

01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:55.520
in Italy towards protestant.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.460
The [inaudible] Ghetto of
the Waldensian Valleys,

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.350
the de facto tolerance granted
to foreign protestants in Livorno

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:07.110 position:56%
and other mercantile cities provided
the [inaudible] publicly express

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:10.800
their belonging to church
different from the Catholic one.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.260
In the Fondaco they did this in
Venice a sort of Christian Ghetto

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:19.060
on ethnic grounds which
reproduce the multi-confession

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.660
of the German nation.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.730
The study of this practice of
limited tolerance in the Italy

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:27.080
of Counter Reformation is
obviously significant in itself

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.980
to investigate the methods
that they've allowed

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.650
to maintain commercial
relationship outside the

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:33.460
congressional boundaries.

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:36.830
Beyond this however in the
5th century of the founding

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:40.200
of the Ghetto the study of these
events made for us beautiful

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.430 position:56%
to study Jewish history in a context

01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:45.650
that goes beyond the tragic
history of anti-Semitism.

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:47.450
Thank you.

01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:57.350
[ Applause ]

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:59.330
&gt;&gt; Roberta I Shaffer: I'm going
to invite both of our speakers

01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:03.160
to the podium now and we'll have
a question and answer period.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.370
If we have to cut off the question

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:07.320
and answer period please
do not be alarmed

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.430
because we will have a
reception following this.

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:14.340
And I hope you'll take that
as an opportunity to talk

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.040
with our speakers and our scholars.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.780
I believe we have microphones,

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:22.840
so if you'll race your hand a
microphone will come to you.

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:30.870
I think its working.

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:34.320
Professor Cooperman, you
indicated that besides Venice

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.490
or other fairly large Jewish
communities throughout Europe

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:38.790
at that time.

01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:42.550
Did any of these communities
replicate the segregation

01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:46.730 position:56%
that existed in Venice be it in
Amsterdam or any of the other areas?

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.870
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: Yeah,
that's a great question.

01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:53.150
One of the surprising things that
[inaudible] they did this work was

01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:57.970
to realize that Venice even though
the word Ghetto I have no doubt

01:17:57.970 --> 01:17:59.270
comes from Venice.

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:03.030
In fact, the idea of
special segregation as a way

01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:07.120
of allowing the community
in goes back much further.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:13.050
Frankfurt, the Jews are expelled
by the merchants of Frankfurt

01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:18.060
and the Bishop of Frankfurt builds
an area right next to the gate

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.810
of the city to accommodate
a hundred Jews.

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:24.230
It was a very ample area.

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:30.580 position:56%
By the time the Rothschild's live
there it had its estimated 3000 Jews

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.560
living in that same space.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.310
So these places become
very attractive

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:39.160
and the same method is used.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:43.550
In other words, what you have is
the merchants control the zoning

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:47.700
within the walls and they want
the Jews out but the Bishop

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:51.350
who wants the Jewish taxes and
their contributions to the economy

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:53.200
or whatever or wants the there

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.580
as Jews gives them a
space in his territory.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.830
The same thing can be seen Krakow.

01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:03.080
One if the beautiful things you
have here, one of the treasures

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.500
of the library of congress
is the Nuremberg Chronicle.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:11.250
Nuremberg Chronicle was
published in 1490 and it is one

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:16.020
of the most elegantly and
beautifully illustrated geographic,

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:20.230 position:56%
you know, it's kind of like an Atlas

01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:23.020
and a picture book
and a history book.

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:27.940
And if you look at Krakow there
you will see that there's the city

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.760 position:56%
of Krakow and then just cross a
little bridge there's the city known

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.720
as Kashmiris or in Polish
it's called Kashmirs.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.250
The Jews had lived in Krakow.

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:41.430 position:56%
There had also been Jews in Kashmirs
they are two separate jurisdictions.

01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:45.460
When the Jews are eventually
forced out by the merchants

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:51.220
of Krakow they are put in
the Ghetto of Kashmirs.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.520
But it's not a Ghetto.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.040
It's a separate city there is a
wall around the Jewish district

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.410
but the Jews control it and
in fact the rest of the city

01:19:59.410 --> 01:20:03.210
of Kashmir is very angry at the
Jews because they don't take care

01:20:03.210 --> 01:20:07.330
of the sewage and they
don't maintain the wall

01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:08.630
and they're very angry at them.

01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:10.960
But again you see that
same kind of thing.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.220
So the idea is done in many areas.

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:15.260
Now in Amsterdam there is no wall.

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.760
And in Livorno there is no wall.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.280
That's one of the important
things about Livorno

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:25.480
and Pisa there was never in
Livorno or Pisa a formal area.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.770
But Livorno and Pisa are a
custom zone and Jews can't go

01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:32.900
out elsewhere in Tuscany.

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.780
So there is a Ghetto which just
didn't have physical walls it has

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.140
economic walls, right?

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:41.090
And, you know, the
Duke of Tuscany said,

01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:43.320
"I'm going to make the
Jews build this wall

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.620
and they're going to pay for it."

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.290
And the Jews didn't
want to pay for it, so.

01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:49.010
I don't know how that
comes up all the time.

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.310
[ Laughter ]

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:51.610
Sorry.

01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:55.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah I-- It's on?

01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.470
OK. I have several questions
one to each one of you.

01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:02.010
You went through a whole list

01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:04.900
of different historical
features can you outline to us

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.550
where you got the sources from?

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:08.790
These are 500 year old data.

01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:12.700
I mean I would think that there
weren't computers 500 years ago.

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:16.430
And where did you, you know, you
just elaborated on the facts.

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:19.710
Where do you do your research
and where your recourses are?

01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:24.670
&gt;&gt; Stefano Villani: Yeah, yes.

01:21:24.670 --> 01:21:32.130 position:56%
I work extensively on the records of
the inquisition in Rome for and many

01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:37.230
of the things that I'm saying here
are actually can be based on some

01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:39.100 position:56%
of the documents of the inquisition.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:43.860
So for example in very recent times
I've been working on the hundreds

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.430
of duration of protestants and from

01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:49.090
that duration they are
very formalized documents.

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:53.990
You usually think that these
document enrich people presented

01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:56.330
them self in front of the
inquisitor and converted

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:59.830
to Catholicism really
conversion narratives.

01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:02.100
On the contrary they're
very bureaucratic documents.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.650
They are more similar to the
form that you are filling

01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:09.780
up for the Green Card and for
a real narrative conversion.

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:14.070
And you can get some
of the data for these.

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:17.600
In the case of the
Fondaco dei Tedesch a lot

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.190
of work has been done
since the 19th century.

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:25.160 position:56%
There are two huge volumes edited by
German scholars that yes would dug

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.720
up all the documents in
the Venetian archives.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.410
So it really-- and then, I
mean, in the case of Livorno

01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:37.050
that is probably the
place that I know best.

01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:40.870
There are documents as
well in the correspondents

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:47.330
of the local state authorities
with again Duke of Tuscany.

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:51.810
So it's really-- I was
presenting here a short summary

01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:55.130
of a major research.

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:59.740
I'm planning actually to
write a book on the presence

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:06.610
of protestant foreigners
in Italy and so

01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:10.510
in the book you will
find older reference.

01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:14.920
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:18.090
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman:
Basically, one of the things

01:23:18.090 --> 01:23:21.510
that my own teachers
did not realize was

01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:25.500
that there are many more documents
about Jews in general archives

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.060
than there are in Jewish archives.

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.210
And that's an interesting question.

01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:35.390
Jews are overrepresented in general
archives and I'm not sure of why.

01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:39.210 position:56%
There are all kinds of theories as
to why this might be but I think one

01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:41.110
of the reasons is basically
what was I talking

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:43.510
about in terms of the Ghetto.

01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:49.700
The Jews you see in a city, Jews
don't have any of the mechanisms

01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.820
that other people can
use to defend themselves.

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.520
They are not part of the guild.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.290
They don't have a cousin who
is the mayor of the city.

01:23:57.290 --> 01:24:00.950
They don't have access
to the leaders of power.

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:02.900
And so what they do
is they go to court.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:04.890
And they go to court all the time.

01:24:04.890 --> 01:24:10.460
And there are people who think that
Jews, oh Jews we're always afraid

01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:14.510
of going to non-Jewish courts and
that they only went to rabbis.

01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:16.870
Baloney! It's not at all true.

01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:20.970 position:56%
Jews trusted the non-Jewish courts
they knew what the non-Jewish courts

01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:24.130
were they knew they could rely
on them especially on Italy.

01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:27.320
I mean, as much as you can
ever rely on a court, you know,

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.880
but this were established
legal procedures.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:39.510
&gt;&gt; I make questions for
Professor Cooperman.

01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:44.130
So, you know, I'm with you in terms
of pushing back against, you know,

01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:49.090
the kind of modern idea that the
medieval or early modern Ghettos

01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:53.420
that these were essentially
prisons that, you know,

01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.730
had no redeeming features
whatsoever.

01:24:56.730 --> 01:25:01.890 position:56%
But I wonder if there's maybe like a
little bit of kind of overcorrection

01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:06.800 position:56%
in this revision in terms of, you
know, when you start using analogies

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.690
to gated communities, you know, or
when you just kind of say things

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.330
like well, we have to
understand that, you know,

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:17.170
these kinds of ethnic religious
factions this was just par

01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:19.260
for the course in pre-modern
societies.

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.490
I mean there was something new
about the kind of segregation

01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:26.540 position:56%
that was being instituted in Venice.

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:30.420
And yes, OK, so you have precursors
like Frankfurt and the idea

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:32.190
to some extent goes back further.

01:25:32.190 --> 01:25:36.310 position:56%
But, you know, the notion of
creating an area that Jews must live

01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:38.250
in and only Jews can live in.

01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:40.400
In other words, this
isn't just the kind

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.990
of basically open Jewish
quarter that's densely Jewish

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:45.480
but has Christians who live --

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.940
you know, I mean there
is real separation here.

01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:51.120
The idea of surveillance,
right, that, you know,

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.430
yeah OK so maybe the idea of
a Jewish quarter having a wall

01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:56.270
around it, yeah, that's older.

01:25:56.270 --> 01:26:00.030
But the idea of these areas being
guarded, the idea of, you know,

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:03.860
you have to break over any kind
of outward facing windows or doors

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.960
and there is real scrupulousness
about that.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.520
Some saying, you know, are you kind

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:12.120
of undermining a little bit
the importance of the concept

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.410
of segregation in terms of
the early modern Jewish gap.

01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:21.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: Excuse me, are
you suggesting that I would reach

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.900
for a joke and say
ridiculous things--

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:27.390
you know, well, let me say

01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:30.800
"Of course you're right
but you're wrong," OK?

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.900
I'll try to very briefly, I mean,

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:36.570
I can go on as you
might know for hours.

01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:38.620
But let me say this.

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:43.250
First of all I try to hint at
something that's very important.

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:47.770
And that is that groups
living together, right,

01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:52.640 position:56%
the idea that everything will be
hunky-dory and everybody will all go

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.010
to each others berm let's
put some confirmations

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:59.260
and we'll all drink wine together
and so forth and so on although

01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:04.420
in Italy they drink wine
together but that's another thing.

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:09.590
But that kind of idea that like
I have students who say to me,

01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:12.660
"Wait a minute, Jews live
separately or Jews live--

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.200
", who did they play
with on the street?

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.270
And the answer is they played with
other Jews if they played at all.

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:20.620
Why would you think?

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:21.980
But they didn't go
to school together.

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:24.350
There were no common
schools you ding-dong.

01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:27.450
I mean, actually it my kids
not my students not you, right.

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:33.280
But we look at the world from the
assumptions to the 21st century.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.110
We projected back and say,
"Well but if it wasn't like that

01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:38.910
that must mean something."

01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:41.590
And what the meaning we
give it are the meaning--

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:43.790
we use things like surveillance.

01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:47.390
These societies surveilled
everybody.

01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:50.590
You know, these are small places.

01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:53.110
If a foreign merchant
came to London,

01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:55.410
just what Professor
Villani was talking

01:27:55.410 --> 01:28:00.280
about with the Fondaco dei Tedesch
in Venice, if foreign merchant came

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.710
to London they immediately
had the innkeeper right

01:28:04.710 --> 01:28:07.220
down everything he brought
in, everything he took out

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.780
and we have these records.

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.080
The government kept records.

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.960
Surveillance is not the new thing.

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.260
So that's the first thing.

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:17.200
The second thing is obviously
there are anxieties when groups

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.230
that are truly different from each
other and ideologically different

01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:23.800
from each other live
next door in each other.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:28.810 position:56%
The social anxieties, cultural
anxieties, if we in America with all

01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:32.940 position:56%
of our Facebook and all of our money
and everything can't live in peace

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:36.020
with each other then
how much more so.

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:38.920
And of course it gets worse at
time with economic downturn,

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.270
at times of war tensions all
kinds of things like that.

01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:47.400
So yes obviously they
are separate communities.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:52.250
The problem is though that
we understand that difference

01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:58.720
as if it is the antithesis
of our perfect society.

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:02.910
Our society ain't perfect and
that was the 16th century not the

01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:04.710
21st century.

[ Applause ]

01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:10.470
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:13.660
My wife and I and a small
group just came back last month

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:16.460
from three weeks exploring
Jewish Italy

01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.640
and the Italian people
are wonderful.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:22.510
They are wonderful!

01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:25.780
[ Applause ]

01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:30.640
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman:
Clearly he ate a lot of pasta.

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:31.940
&gt;&gt; No, no.

01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:35.490
I had a little blog with the group
because I took a lot of photographs

01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:40.590
and I just was citing
examples of the friendship.

01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:45.570
My wife had to go to the
bathroom and [inaudible]

01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:48.390
and the lady left the
restaurant alone.

01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:49.690
There was no one in the restaurant

01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:51.140
and she took her to
go to the bathroom.

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.100
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: For this
you have to comfort him to talk

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.530
about you going in the bathroom.

01:29:56.530 --> 01:29:58.160
&gt;&gt; Well there is a
bathroom here so she canme.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.460
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: Let
me tell you something.

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:01.980
No Italian would have
gotten away with saying

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.280
that about his wife
in a public place.

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:06.760
&gt;&gt; But we learned that
in the 15th century,

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:10.920
Italy was basically
a group of States.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:16.490
And correct me if I'm--
and then in the central

01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:20.560
and southern part it
was ruled by the papacy.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:30.940
A lot of the Sephardic Jews came
to Italy they didn't like being

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:35.180
under the rule and so with
the invitation of many towns

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:40.190
and wealthy families like the
[inaudible] and one of the--

01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:43.370
and Ferrara the Este family.

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:45.400
They came there.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.910
But when the families moved away
or in the case of the Este family

01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:53.670
and Ferrara, when the
last person died

01:30:53.670 --> 01:31:01.950
and there was no heir the papacy
came in and took away a lot

01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:03.250
of the freedom of the Jews.

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:07.080
Took away a lot of the
business and set up the Ghetto.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:11.340
So my question really is, is
that in many areas the Jews lived

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:15.040
without a Ghetto and
they live, you know,

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.000
very happily with the
general community.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.970
So why do you feel that
the Ghetto was something

01:31:21.970 --> 01:31:23.900 position:56%
that the Jews would want to live in.

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:25.430
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: So is it--

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:28.940
First of all I have to say that
professor Villani is much more

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:33.750
of an expert on general Italian
policy and the papacy in Italy

01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:37.270
and his attitudes, you
know, with general history.

01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:38.920
So I'll say something
and then maybe you want

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:42.780
to clarify and tell me what I miss.

01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:45.560
But let me just say this.

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:51.270 position:56%
First of all, the description that
you've been given or the description

01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:53.440
that you repeated here is correct

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.950
but fundamentally too
simplistic, OK?

01:31:56.950 --> 01:32:01.250
So for example the very
first charter to Spanish

01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:05.370
and Portuguese Jews to openly
practice Judaism even though they

01:32:05.370 --> 01:32:10.040
had been living as Christians even
though they had been baptized,

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:14.850
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
was given in Papillon Cona in 1514

01:32:14.850 --> 01:32:17.490
and then in the 1530s and 1540s.

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:21.950
So it is simply not true that it
was a simple arbitrary decision

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:25.960
or difference between the papal
authority and the-- not papal.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:31.110
What tends-- But the question was
asked before is relevant here.

01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:35.460 position:56%
I have argued and I've written about
this and I'm trying to write more

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:41.190 position:56%
about it that the Ghetto is really
a product of commercial competition.

01:32:41.190 --> 01:32:45.800
But as in our society, right, I
keep pointing back to our side

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.700
because it's the model
that sits in front of us.

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:51.250
Historians are not supposed to
use an anachronistic models.

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:56.370
But in our society when people
talked about discrimination

01:32:56.370 --> 01:33:01.270
against African-Americans during
slavery or after slavery, right,

01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:05.860
after 1863 during Jim Crow
after the Civil Rights Movement

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.300
and so forth and so on.

01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:11.610 position:56%
We use a rhetoric about they and us.

01:33:11.610 --> 01:33:14.460
And that rhetoric is
based on anthropological

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:17.830
or pseudo-anthropological
categories or sociologic.

01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:20.730
They are like that,
you know, those people.

01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:23.310
It doesn't matter what the people
are but we use those terms.

01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:25.140
But that's not what's going on.

01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:31.170
That's the words we use to justify
what is very often a power play,

01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:34.000 position:56%
a commerce play, a control of money.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:39.400
If you want to understand, for
example the riots in Baltimore,

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.730
the first thing you should look
at is the way money is allocated

01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:47.250 position:56%
by the city council of Baltimore and
by the bank of Baltimore to allow,

01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:50.180
you know, building in certain
parts of the city as opposed

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.800
to other parts of the city.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:55.500 position:56%
You know, very often it has a lot
more to do with economics and thing.

01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:00.140
So out there you have the
papal decree of the Ghetto.

01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:03.000
Venetian Ghetto was 1516.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.340
The papal Ghetto [foreign
language] is 1555.

01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:09.940
And there are all kinds of
books that will tell you

01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:12.760
that the popes it's
because it's Paulo OV,

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:16.530
Paul IV who is a Carafa
who is a crazy guy.

01:34:16.530 --> 01:34:18.530
Everybody in Rome hated him.

01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:23.020
Everybody was so happy when he
died that they dance in the streets

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:25.300
and they burned all his
papers and so forth and so on.

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:30.350
And he was an old fanatic and an
anti-semi and everything like that.

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:37.070 position:56%
And so there is a famous book by one
of my colleagues, one of my friends

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:41.060
who wrote about how the
Ghetto in 1555 is part

01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:45.010
of a conversionary
policy by the popes.

01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:46.710
There's only one problem with that.

01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:48.680
That's not what it says.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:53.030
What it says is Jews are moving
into the nicest streets in Rome.

01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:54.940
What the hay.

01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:57.220
I forgot exactly how
they say that in Italian.

01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:01.090
But they say excuse me Jews should
live in their part of the city

01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:02.450
and we're going to put up a wall.

01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:07.790 position:56%
Now what I'm saying is yes religious
rhetoric is used and I'm not saying

01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:10.130
that the church didn't become
obsessed with the Jews.

01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:12.160
It certainly did.

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.390
It always has been and I said
the church was the most tolerant

01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:17.920
that the church was the reason
for the survival of the Jews

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:21.460
but there are periods
especially in the 19th century

01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:25.250
when Italy is unifying and papal
control is being threatened.

01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:30.710
The papacy becomes reactionary
in a way that's astonishing

01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:34.210
and it backs off of
many of the principles

01:35:34.210 --> 01:35:37.530
that it had self had
stood for, for centuries.

01:35:37.530 --> 01:35:39.880
All right, good, we
know that in times

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:43.330
of trouble society,
you know, change.

01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:44.960
And they become more restrictive.

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.040
I mean we've seen it in our society
many, many times in the hundreds

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.310
of years of America
which isn't that long

01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:53.520
in the few hundred years
of American history.

01:35:53.520 --> 01:36:01.290
But what happens is that these
themes become more powerful

01:36:01.290 --> 01:36:02.790
and yes they become part

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:07.940 position:56%
of an institution that's really what
Professor Villani and his teachers

01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:10.710
and there's on-- this whole
project about the inquisition.

01:36:10.710 --> 01:36:12.010
That's what they're work on.

01:36:12.010 --> 01:36:15.630
The way the inquisition really
is a bureaucratic institution.

01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:17.610
Part of, you know,
that kind of thing.

01:36:17.610 --> 01:36:21.530
So, yes that happens but
it's not as simple as,

01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:23.630
oh the Spanish Jews didn't--

01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:25.820
because in fact the Spanish Jews
are very happy to live in Rome.

01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:27.520
They fight like hell
to live in Rome.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.520
And Alexander VI who does
not get the best press

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.730
in papal history was very
nice to the Spanish Jews

01:36:33.730 --> 01:36:35.850
and made the Jews of
Rome let them in.

01:36:35.850 --> 01:36:40.540
Maybe you want to say something?

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:43.190
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon first of all
I'd like to thank you gentlemen,

01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:46.620 position:56%
the Library of Congress and the
government of Italy for bringing joy

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.920
to my heart and this topic.

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:53.040 position:56%
I'm an armchair historian and come
from the family of Sephardic rabbis.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.880
My thinking was that the Jews
that were brought to Rome

01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:01.540
to build the coliseum where
the first Jews brought

01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:04.000
to Italy, I guess officially.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.300
That's not true?

01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:06.600
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: No.

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.900
&gt;&gt; Can you explain upon that?

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:09.200
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: No they
didn't build the coliseum

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.950
but the argument is that
Titus brought Jews as slaves.

01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:14.040
And everybody will take
you to the Arch of Titus.

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.530
Did you go to the Arch of
Titus when you were in Italy?

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah I think.

01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:19.130
&gt;&gt; Bernard Cooperman: All right.

01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:21.950
So the destruction of the temple
is '70, Jews think its '68

01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:24.610
but its apparently '70 and use--

01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:28.060
have that Arch and you see the
menorah for supposedly the menorah

01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:30.650
for their arguments
about people usually say.

01:37:30.650 --> 01:37:33.080
And they say these Jews
are brought as slaves

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:37.820
and there are wonderful poems by if
any of you know the Hebrew poetry

01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:39.790
of Judah Lieb Gordon and so forth.

01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:42.340
Was it Judah Lieb Gordon?

01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:43.640
Yeah, I think it was
Judah Lieb Gordon.

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:48.990
About the slaves who
perish, you know, in the--

01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:52.350 position:56%
with the lions, you know, and they
eat them and all that kind of stuff.

01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:53.660
It's a great story.

01:37:53.660 --> 01:38:01.970
The truth is that when the
Maccabees won in 165 BCE, right?

01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:03.270
So that's a long time.

01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:06.800
That's 230 years before the
destruction of the second temple.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.980
When they come they send an
ambassador to Rome and the Jews

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:15.350
in town meet them there and are
very happy and celebrate them.

01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:20.500 position:56%
So Jews had been living in Rome from
at least the second century BCE.

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.800
No, no, no.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.680
The ghetto was 1555.

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:29.370
They lived all over the city.

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:31.700
&gt;&gt; Roberta I Shaffer: Please
continue this conversation as part

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.940
of the reception and the display.

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:38.000
I would like to take this
opportunity, however, to thank

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.990
and introduce you to the
curators of the display.

01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:44.420
Particularly Julia Wolfe [assumed
spelling] who brought the idea

01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:49.890
that commemoration of the 500 years
of the Venetian Ghetto was a topic

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:52.530
that the Law Library and the
European Division of the Library

01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:55.030
of Congress should
present to the community.

01:38:55.030 --> 01:39:00.120
And so thank you Julia,
Nathan Dorn, Anthony Mullan

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.800
and Anne Brener [assumed spelling]
who are our wonderful curators

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:05.330
and are anxious to talk to you more

01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:08.030
in the room just behind this
one about the collection.

01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:12.230
And please, please continue the
conversation over a glass of wine.

01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:16.790
If you would be so kind to also
fill out the evaluation form

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:19.390
that should have been in
your program it will help us

01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:22.040
in the future to make
wonderful programs like this.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.510
And thank you so much for coming.

01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:34.560
