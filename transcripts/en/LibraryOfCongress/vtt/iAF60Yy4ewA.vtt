&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.920
&gt;&gt; We've got our next authors here.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.380
Cynthia and Sanford Levinson are
married and have teamed up not only

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.000
in holy matrimony but
also to write a book.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.700
Together they have written
Fault Lines in the Constitution:

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.070
The Framers, Their Fights, and
the Flaws that Affect Us Today.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.830 position:56%
As its title suggests, the book
connects true stories of the writing

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.550
of the Constitution of the United
States to real present-day issues.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.000
The book draws upon the
knowledge of both authors.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.350
Cynthia Levinson has written
extensively about history

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.220
and historical figures in her books
for children and young adults.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.700 position:56%
And Sanford Levinson has written
about constitutional law and history

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.850
as a lawyer and professor at the
University of Texas Law School.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.180 position:56%
My understanding is that Fault Lines

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.880
in the Constitution is
fresh off the press.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.580
Fresh off the press, Fault Lines

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.610
in the Constitution was
published yesterday?

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.910
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Yes.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.210
That's exactly right.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.880
&gt;&gt; September 1st, yesterday.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.350
Let's give a round of
applause to our authors.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.080
That is amazing.

I would also like to bring
to your attention to the blog

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.030
that the Levinsons wrote

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.220
to accompany Fault Lines
in the Constitution.

You can also meet both of our
authors later for a book-signing.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.720
So, and book signing --
just to remind everybody,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.990
the book signings are
down to my left

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.510
which will be your audience right.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.230
Without further ado,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.010
let me introduce Cynthia
and Sanford Levinson.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.660
[ Crowd Cheering ]

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.540
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
Thank you so much.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.840
Thank you.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.640
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Thank you.

[ Background Discussions ]

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.950
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: I
can't see where I am.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.850
Is this? No?

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.180
OK. I have to go back one.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.480
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.950
I didn't realize that there
was -- yep, thank you.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.250
Oh that's where it is.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.780
OK. So our very kind
introducer just mentioned

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.500
that this book is fresh
off the press.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.990
He also mentioned a
blog that we're doing.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.860
We're blogging every two weeks
about this book to keep it updated.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.470
And in keeping with that urgency --

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.520
he mentioned that it's
very current --

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.080
we have just changed this
morning our presentation for you.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.230
We're going to include some of the
slides that we had been planning

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.150
to include but we're
beginning differently

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.930
than we had initially thought we
would because of current events.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.090
This young woman whom you see
here is named Leezia Dahhla.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.300
Leezia now lives in Washington, DC.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.460
She grew up in San Antonio,
Texas, but she was born in Canada.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.000
She came with her family to this
country when she was six years old.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.610
She graduated from
school in San Antonio.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.740
She graduated from
Northwestern University.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.200
She got jobs.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.500
What she didn't know was, until she
was about to graduate from college,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.310
was that her family had overstayed
their visas in the United States.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.270
Leezia has been living here
as an undocumented alien

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.620
since she was a senior in college.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.210
Now we're not tattling on Leezia.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.820
Leezia opens chapter four in
Fault Lines in the Constitution.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.240
And the reason she does that --

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.660
and she graciously allowed us to
use her story, to tell her story --

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.200 position:56%
is that her situation is very
closely related to the constitution.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.760 position:56%
What makes her story especially
urgent now and the reason we decided

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.820
to open with her is that
there is speculation

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.180
that the president is
going to end a program

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.280
that has allowed her
to stay and work here.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.950
That is a program that
was handed down.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.290
It was an executive order handed
down by President Obama in 2012,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.010
the DACA program -- Deferred
Action for Children of Aliens.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.200
But there is possibility --

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.720
the president has suggested that
he might be ending that program.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.000
Her situation is integrally
involved in problems

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.120
with the US Constitution.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.700
And I'm going to turn it to
Sandy to let him explain how.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.000
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: OK.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.430
So how does this relate
to the constitution?

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.210
And why does this take
up a chapter in our book?

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.180
The answer goes back
to December 2010

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.680
when the House passed legislation
that would have legalized

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:14.360
or normalized the presence in the
United States of children brought

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.080
into the United States
by their parents

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.830
and would have given them basically
a safe haven in the United States.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.400
Congress is bicameral and we spend
a great number of pages in our book

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.460
on the fact that Congress
consists of two separate houses.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.330
So getting through the
House wasn't good enough.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.270
It has to go through the Senate.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.330
What happened in the Senate?

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.950
Well, as a matter of fact,
a majority of the Senate,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.510
with members from both parties,

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.570
supported the so-called
Dream Act bill.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.100
But a majority isn't good enough
thanks to Rule 22 of the Senate

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.420
that requires a super-majority
in order

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.820
for bills to come up to a vote.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:14.190
So the key vote in the Senate in
December of 2010 was whether or not

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.660
to go forth with legislation.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.540
The vote was 55 to 45.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.360
You might think that in a country
that calls itself a democracy

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.730
that would be good
enough to go to a vote.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:35.120
Well it isn't because Rule 22
says you have to have 60 votes

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.490
and 60 is more than 55, obviously.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.720
This can be traced back to
an obscure but important part

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.070
of the constitution
that gives each house

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.620
of Congress the ability
to set its own rules.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.770
And so one of the rules the
Senate has established is

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.030
to require a super-majority
to get a vote.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.070
We also actually begin the
very first chapter in the book

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.600
with a story about lynching.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.110
In 1921, Warren Harding,
a Republican president,

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.990 position:56%
with the cooperation of a Republican
congressman from St. Louis,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.110
introduced an anti-lynching
bill in the House.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.870
It ultimately didn't pass because
of the filibuster of white,

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.340
southern Democrats in the Senate.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.160
And this was true throughout
the next several decades.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.730
And we still don't have a
federal anti-lynching bill,

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:48.630
though fortunately we either don't
have lynchings since the 1950s

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.200
or basically don't have them.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.820
But we should have had an
anti-lynching bill in 1921

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.370
and we didn't have it
because of this same feature

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.190
of the constitution.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.820
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: So both
of these are examples --

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.250
one from chapter one and
one from chapter four --

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.850
in which the majority of the
legislators and the majority

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.140 position:56%
of the population wants a particular
law but for various reasons

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.150
because of entrenchment in the
constitution, they cannot pass

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.740
which is frustrating for everybody.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.360
These are two examples
of how our book,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.600
Fault Lines in the Constitution,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.050
differs from other books
about the Constitution.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.830
Most other books walk through
the Constitution in order article

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.870
by article, explaining
how our government works.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:50.590
We do believe that to some large
extent our government does work.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.250
We are not thorough-goingly
against our Constitution.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:00.300
It has survived for, come September
17 of this year, 230 years.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.730
On the other hand, there are
very, very fundamental problems

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.600
with our Constitution,
some of them having to do

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.490
with what's been there all the way
through and some of it having to do

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.840
with obsolescence which we'll
tell you a little bit about.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.290
So our book focuses on problems
within the Constitution.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.590
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Can I?

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.890
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Yeah.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.190
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson:
That many of you --

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:29.620
many of the parents here might
be familiar with civics courses

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.360
that talk about how
a bill becomes a law.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.660
And one of the things that makes
our book different in some ways is

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:46.040
that we focus on why it is that
most bills never become laws.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.020
And the DACA bill,
the Dream Act bill,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:55.520
or the anti-lynching bill are
only two of a number of examples.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.510
It's also true that most modern
courses on the Constitution,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:06.610
especially since World War two
focus on constitutional rights.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.300 position:56%
Constitutional rights are important.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.160
We like rights.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:17.290 position:56%
That being said, we also think that
it's very, very important for people

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.380
who really are going to
understand our system

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.210
to understand the structures
of government

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:31.040
that often make it very difficult,
in fact, to enact legislation

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.770
that would enable people to enjoy
their constitutional rights.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.210
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: And
I mentioned two other ways

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.310
in which our book is different from
other books about the Constitution,

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.430
especially for young readers.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.290
One is that we give
examples from other countries

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.980
and from state constitutions
where some of the problems

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.640
with ours are avoided
or worked around.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.600
So we're not completely hopeless.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.860
We provide ways to ameliorate
the situation, to improve things.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.260
And also at the end of the
book we grade the constitution.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.560
Spoiler alert.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.000 position:56%
It does not get an A. In fact it
doesn't even get a B. Now every sort

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.850
of, every test -- you know, a lot
of young people here take tests.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.020
There are measures for tests.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.130
You're tested against something.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.020
There's an expectation.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.760
So we have expectations
for the Constitution.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.320
But they're not just ours.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.780
They were the founding fathers'.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.870 position:56%
They were the Framers' expectations
which are written into the Preamble.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.350
So here are the tests, the
measures, the standards,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.600
and rubrics for the Constitution.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.360
We the people of the United States,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.180
in order to form a
more perfect union --

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.010
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson:
Establish justice.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.380
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
Ensure domestic tranquility.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.580
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Provide
for the common defense.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.110
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
Promote the general welfare.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.830
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: And
secure the blessings of liberty

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.370
to ourselves and our posterity.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.810
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Do ordain
and establish this Constitution

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.050
for the United States of America.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.070
So you might think about the
two examples we just gave

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.050
of issues in the Constitution.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.540
How well does the Constitution
or the Preamble hold up,

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.810 position:56%
given those issues and also a couple
of others we're about to talk about?

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.220
One that you are probably very
familiar with here in Washington,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.440
DC -- we expected applause
at this point, you know?

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.250
You know? [Cheers]
Yes, that's right!

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.280
Taxation without representation!

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.580
Who wants that?

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.980
This is chapter six in Fault Lines
without -- what did we call it?

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.030
Fault Lines in the Constitution.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.230
That's the name of
our book [laughing].

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.150
And this comes straight
out of the Constitution.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.450
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Right.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.690
Congress in fact is
required to carve

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:52.000
out a certain territory
for the US capital.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.820
And those of you who might be
fans of the play Hamilton know

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.570
that it's here and not elsewhere
because of a deal that was struck

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.300
in the room where it happened
between Hamilton and Jefferson.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.720
But Washington like Puerto Rico --

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.640
which we also discuss
briefly -- is not a state.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.980
And that means that you have
no representation in Congress

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.100
which means that the federal
taxes that are imposed

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.480
on you you have no say in.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.300
It also means that the local
taxes that you might have some say

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.960
in through the Washington
City Consul are ultimately

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.970
under the control of Congress.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.530
So this really doesn't
look like what most people

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:46.530
in the 21st century would think
a democratic self-government is

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:47.990
all about.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.100
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: So you'll
be glad to know that you all --

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.130
you know, those of you who
live in the district, anyway --

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.450
are well represented in this book,

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.030
even if you're not well
represented in congress.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.040
[ Crowd Cheering ]

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.950
Thank you.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.650
And I should thank our
son-in-law, by the way,

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.300
because he made a strong case
for including that chapter.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.760
[Laughing]

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.910
[ Light Applause ]

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.820
So another thing that you
might not expect in a book

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.480
about the Constitution
is a graphic --

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.590
these graphics are from the
book -- about corn syrup.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:23.730 position:56%
Now why is there a graphic on corn
syrup in a book on the Constitution?

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.240
Well, corn syrup is
in a lot of products.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.390
In fact, when Sandy and
I were flying down here

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.090
on American Airlines we were
handed a package of mini pretzels

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.180 position:56%
and Sandy looked at the ingredients.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.700
Yep. Corn syrup right here
in a package of pretzels.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.780
Who needs corn syrup in pretzels?

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.080
It's in muffins.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.380
It's in ketchup.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.840
It's in soft drinks do corn
syrup just pervades our diet

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.820
and it's not healthy.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.170
That's the other thing.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:54.750
Corn syrup is deteriorating
Americans' health,

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.580
especially young people in fact.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.890
It is very likely that
there are corn products

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.350
in the carpeting right here

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.000
and in the seat cushions
that you're sitting on.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.470
Why is this the case?

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.870
This also relates to
the Constitution.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.170
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Right.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.530
The United States Senate,

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:16.620
as the result of what is often
called The Great Compromise --

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.980
but you should know that James
Madison detested this compromise

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.390
and described it as a lesser evil.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.770
The decision of 1787 was

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:32.050
to give each state the same
voting power in the Senate.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.740
It's very, very different from
the House of Representatives.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:40.960
This means that the
states that grow corn,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.760
although they have a very small
percentage of the population,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.280
have significant power
in the Senate.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.290
And because the agriculture
industry is what most senators --

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.220
whether they're Democrats
or Republicans,

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.300
it really doesn't matter.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.350
It's -- they're representing
their constituents faithfully

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.220
and honestly.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.410
They're sent to Washington
to get federal funds

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.060
for local agricultural
interests including corn.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:21.630
So the Senate is a tribute to what
we would call malapportionment.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.450
We like to think that we believe
in the principle one person,

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.940
one vote in this country.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.970 position:56%
We don't. And the Senate is the
best example and it has consequences

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:40.170
as revealed in how it is we spend
so much money on encouraging people

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.810
to grow corn and corn syrup.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.110
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Right.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.390
And as you can see from
this graphic from the book,

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:52.700 position:56%
less than half the population in the
United States is represented by 82%

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.660
of the Senate, whereas more

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.530
than half the population is
represented by only 18 senators.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.590
The story which begins the chapter
in which we talk about the Senate

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.540
and this inequity tells the
story of the Patriot Act,

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:16.110
which gave more money per capita to
small states which had less chance

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:21.170
of being attacked by future
terrorist attacks than large states

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.240
like New York, Massachusetts,
California, and that sort of thing.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.440 position:56%
That chapter refers to the
upside-down math of the Patriot Act.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.500
It's really the upside-down
math of the US Senate.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.650
So Sandy and I wrote
this book together.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.180
As our introducer said,
I write for young people.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.950
He writes for older people.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.350
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson:
Largely academics.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.720
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
Yes, largely academics.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.020
That's right.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.770
And college and graduate students.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.200
We wrote the book in one voice --

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.670
that is as if one person
is telling the story --

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:03.630
until the last chapter
where we hold a debate

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.730
with each other, going
back and forth.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.070
And here is a picture of the
two of us recording our debate

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.140
with each other for the
audio version of the book.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.360
The debate is about
what do we do now?

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.480
As I said, we don't
leave you hopeless.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.040
We give you examples of
how to do things better.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.190
And we also talk about ways
to change the Constitution.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.030
From my perspective,
I think we should go

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.760
through the amendment
process, even though the second

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.420
to the last chapter of the book
features how, the difficulty

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.400
of amending the Constitution.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.580
Sandy's approach, however --

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.880
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Yes.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.880
Is to call for a new constitutional
convention as, in fact,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.600
Article 5 allows but
has never been done.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.140
In our comparative approach,

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.440
we show that almost all
other constitutions --

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.200
not only around the world.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.690
Who really cares about other
national constitutions,

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.990
unfortunately?

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.160
But also within the United
States are easier to amend

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.620
than the US Constitution.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:22.160
So if we are seriously to confront
the kinds of issues that face us,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.390 position:56%
my own view is ultimately that we
need a new constitutional convention

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.670
as envisioned by the Framers.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.310 position:56%
We do not engage in founder-bashing.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.180
They did the best they
could in 1787.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:46.190
The question raised in our book is
what we do in 2017 and the future

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:51.720
with regard to responding to
what we should recognize are the

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.070
fault lines.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.900
And the title does come from
geology and the possibility

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:05.920 position:56%
that tectonic plates that
generally you could ignore every now

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.360
and then will create
catastrophic earthquakes.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:17.430 position:56%
And we should try to anticipate that
before it happens rather than wait

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.760
until the catastrophe comes.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.080
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Well
I don't disagree with that.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.530
It's just that, you know, if you
have a constitutional convention,

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.890
everything is up for grabs.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.040
But we won't go through
the debate right now.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.080
You can read that in there.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.380
But I do want to go back.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.070
We do want to go back to
-- remember the Preamble?

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.510
Here's the crib sheet on the
Preamble, you know, for the test.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.990
So we ask you all to think
about what you think.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:50.800
To what extent do you think the
Constitution meets its goals?

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.140
I see we only have
five minutes left.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.590
We want to remind you also about
the blog as our introducer did

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.480
because we are keeping the book
updated every couple of weeks.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.480
Do you want to add anything
before we turn it to questions?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.710
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: I would love
to hear some questions or comments.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.010
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: So yes.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.310
We would love to know your
thoughts about the Preamble

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.410
to the Constitution, the writing,
whatever you'd like to bring up.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.600
It's a little hard to see.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.700
Oh I think we must have
answered every single question.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.000
Well wait.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.300
No, is that somebody?

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.600
I think we have a question.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.900
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Good.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.200
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
Or somebody's leaving.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.500
I can't quite tell.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.800
I don't want to embarrass anybody.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.100
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson:
Nope, there is a question.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.400
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Oh, OK.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.700
[Inaudible question]
Oh, interesting.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.450
So the question is I
sort of gave it away

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.150
that we don't give the Constitution
an A or a B in our research.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:47.670
Who or what state or other
country does get an A?

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:53.450
To tell you the truth, we didn't
grade other constitutions in part

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:57.250
because other constitutions
don't have the Preamble.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.410
Our, you know, the US
Constitution Preamble.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.770
And that's the measure.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:06.560
Also, frankly we sort
of cherry pick.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.510
So we don't look at other
constitutions wholesale.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.050
We look at other aspects of other
constitutions that do a better job

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.990
in particular areas than ours does.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:22.290 position:56%
For instance, we have an example we
were going to use, except we decided

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:28.680 position:56%
to talk about Leezia Dahhla instead,
about continuity of government

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.380
and what to do in habeas corpus.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.600
It's complicated issues but
interesting to children still,

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:42.040
about what to do in case of
epidemics or devastating floods.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.850
We live in Texas, so you know,

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:48.000
please think of the
Gulf Coast right now.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.490
And we give an example from
the South African Constitution

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:57.530 position:56%
which does address more effectively
than our 1787 constitution does what

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.330
to do in cases of attacks
and that sort of thing.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:07.310
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: It's also the
case that inevitably the answer

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:13.340
to that question is going to
be a function about what is it

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.830
that most worries you right now?

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:21.220
If in fact you thought the
constitution is working reasonably

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.460 position:56%
well, you'd give it a B or a B plus.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.690
And if you thought there were
ways to make it even better,

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.170
then you might focus
on say Article 5,

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.990
which makes it extraordinarily
difficult to amend the Constitution

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.590
and you might look at one
of the other constitutions

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.460
within the country or around the
world that is easier to amend.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:49.030
It's no secret, though, that
today -- that is, this very day --

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:54.880
there is a great deal of
discussion about President Trump

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.080
and his own continuity in office.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:05.940
If we had a parliamentary system,
he could be voted out of office

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.790
with a vote of no confidence.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.880
We don't. If we were California,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.680
then there could be
a recall election.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.240
But we don't have that either.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.540
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: And
we'll be glad to talk --

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.510
sorry, but our very patient person
is standing here giving us the

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.810
high sign.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.110
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Right.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.410
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: [Laughing]
But we'll be glad to talk more

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.090
about these things afterwards or,
you know, when we're signing books.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.010
&gt;&gt; I just want to say --

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.310
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Oh.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.480
Because there's finally -- with
your book there's finally a book

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.140
about current issues that
relates directly to the history

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.280
of the country for us to read to
our children because the best way

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.450
to affect change is through
our children [sobbing].

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.950
As an immigrant myself -- I
know I don't look like, I mean,

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:56.960
I blend in with America because
I'm from Canada but I have a lot

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:03.610
of immigrant friends who
don't blend in the way I do

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:07.820
because they look different,
they sound different.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.250
And it's a major issue for
a lot of us and thank you

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.990
for bringing that awareness
up again.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.640
And hopefully it creates a
dialogue between American families.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.940
So just thank you.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.240
I appreciate that.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: And thank you--

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.840
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Thank you.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.140
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: For
your heartfelt concern.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.440
We really appreciate it.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.740
Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; More questions or?

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.660
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Oh!

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.960
Do we have time?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.260
Oh! Hello.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.560
Do we have time?

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.860

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.160

&gt;&gt; If I was able to wave a magic
wand and give you the opportunity

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.130
to change one thing
in the constitution,

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.230
what is it you would choose
and how would you go about it?

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.530
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: OK.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.830
I've got two.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.130
I'm sorry, Marty.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.430
I've got two things.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.510
One is I think, having worked
with Sandy on this book,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.130 position:56%
my two least favorite parts of the
Constitution actually are the Senate

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.440
and the electoral college.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.470
Sandy, what about you?

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.260
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Well, I
mean, as I said it really a moment

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:08.260
or two ago, asking me this
question today given what I have

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.720
to admit, it's no secret.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.020
You could Google me -- are my
views about President Trump.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:20.050
I would prefer that there were
an alternative to impeachment

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:25.980
or the 25th amendment, neither
of which works effectively.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.450
But on the other days, I might very
well give you a different answer.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.460
I certainly agree with Cynthia

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.140
that the electoral college has
long since outlived its time.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.480
I share James Madison's view
that the Senate is an evil

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.680
and I think it's no
longer a necessary evil.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:53.920
But what concerns me most today is
the power that the president has

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.900 position:56%
and the fact that there's really not
much we can do about it in contrast

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.750
with many other political
systems across the world.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.930
And for that matter, in
several of the American states.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.530
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: I
think I see more questions

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.050
but I don't know if we have time.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.940
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: I'll
take questions as long as --

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.240
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: No, no.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.110
I'm seeing heads shaking.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.750
No time. OK.
