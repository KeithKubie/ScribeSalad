00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.670
Wow that last lesson got pretty deep.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.650
Now the kind of connection that you've
seen in Netcat is a TCP Session

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.860
which let's two programs send strings of
bytes back and forth over the network.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.370
TCP is kind of the middle layer of
a stack of networking protocols or

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.690
protocol stack which supports all sorts
of different internet applications.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.150
HTTP and other applications
are built on top of TCP.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.880
And TCP is built on top of IP,
the Internet Protocol.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.930
In this lesson, we'll take a closer
look at how these layers work together.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.540
As we do, keep an eye out for
two things,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.870
how each layer depends on behavior or
guarantees made by the layer below.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.720
And also how it hides
the details of the lower layer,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.680
giving programmers a simpler interface.
