00:00:06.155 --> 00:00:12.004
Most history books will tell you the Roman
Empire fell in the fifth century CE.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.344
But this would’ve come as a great surprise
to the millions of people

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:19.323
who lived in the Roman Empire up
through the Middle Ages.

00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:21.342
This medieval Roman Empire,

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:25.036
which we usually refer 
to today as the Byzantine Empire,

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:27.832
began in 330 CE.

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:31.104
That’s when Constantine,
the first Christian emperor,

00:00:31.104 --> 00:00:36.222
moved the capital of the Roman Empire 
to a new city called Constantinople,

00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:41.042
which he founded on the site of the
ancient Greek city Byzantion.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:44.073
When the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410

00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:47.703
and the Empire’s western provinces 
were conquered by barbarians,

00:00:47.703 --> 00:00:52.907
Constantine’s Eastern capital remained 
the seat of the Roman emperors.

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:58.014
There, generations of emperors ruled 
for the next 11 centuries.

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:00.771
Sharing continuity with 
the classical Roman Empire

00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:06.221
gave the Byzantine empire a technological
and artistic advantage over its neighbors,

00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:09.441
whom Byzantines considered barbarians.

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:12.548
In the ninth century, 
visitors from beyond the frontier

00:01:12.548 --> 00:01:16.394
were astonished 
at the graceful stone arches and domes

00:01:16.394 --> 00:01:19.397
of the imperial palace in Constantinople.

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:23.429
A pair of golden lions flanked 
the imperial throne.

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.712
A hidden organ would make the lions 
roar as guests fell on their knees.

00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:32.173
Golden birds
sung from a nearby golden tree.

00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:35.524
Medieval Roman engineers 
even used hydraulic engines

00:01:35.524 --> 00:01:39.942
to raise the imperial throne 
high into the air.

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:42.623
Other inherited aspects 
of ancient Roman culture

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:44.564
could be seen in emperors’ clothing,

00:01:44.564 --> 00:01:47.534
from traditional military garb to togas,

00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:48.912
and in the courts,

00:01:48.912 --> 00:01:51.782
which continued to use Roman law.

00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:54.734
Working-class Byzantines would’ve also 
had similar lives

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:57.104
to their Ancient Roman counterparts;

00:01:57.104 --> 00:01:59.573
many farmed or plied a specific trade,

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:00.671
such as ceramics,

00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:01.633
leatherworking,

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:02.563
fishing,

00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:03.413
weaving,

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.771
or manufacturing silk.

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:07.611
But, of course, the Byzantine Empire

00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:10.693
didn’t just rest 
on the laurels of Ancient Rome.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:15.233
Their artists innovated, creating vast 
mosaics and ornate marble carvings.

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:18.043
Their architects constructed
numerous churches,

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:20.353
one of which, called Hagia Sophia,

00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:25.871
had a dome so high it was said to be
hanging on a chain from heaven.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:30.474
The Empire was also home to great
intellectuals such as Anna Komnene.

00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:32.874
As imperial princess in the 12th century,

00:02:32.874 --> 00:02:36.632
Anna dedicated her life 
to philosophy and history.

00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:40.164
Her account of her father’s reign
is historians’ foremost source

00:02:40.164 --> 00:02:44.262
for Byzantine political history 
at the time of the first crusade.

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:46.525
Another scholar, Leo the Mathematician,

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:50.483
invented a system of beacons that ran the
width of the empire—

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:52.752
what’s now Greece and Turkey.

00:02:52.752 --> 00:02:55.413
Stretching more than 700 kilometers,

00:02:55.413 --> 00:02:59.993
this system allowed the edge of the Empire
to warn the emperor of invading armies

00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:03.924
within one hour
of sighting them at the border.

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:07.673
But their advances couldn’t 
protect the Empire forever.

00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:11.422
In 1203, an army of French 
and Venetian Crusaders

00:03:11.422 --> 00:03:14.904
made a deal with a man 
named Alexios Angelos.

00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:18.203
Alexios was the son of a deposed emperor,

00:03:18.203 --> 00:03:20.972
and promised the crusaders vast riches

00:03:20.972 --> 00:03:24.688
and support to help him retake 
the throne from his uncle.

00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:27.143
Alexios succeeded, but after a year,

00:03:27.143 --> 00:03:32.357
the population rebelled and Alexios 
himself was deposed and killed.

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:38.093
So Alexios’s unpaid army turned 
their aggression on Constantinople.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.451
They lit massive fires,

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:43.531
which destroyed countless works of ancient
and medieval art and literature,

00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:47.158
leaving about one-third 
of the population homeless.

00:03:47.158 --> 00:03:52.258
The city was reclaimed 50 years later 
by the Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos,

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:55.758
but his restored Empire never regained
all the territory

00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:57.819
the Crusaders had conquered.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.827
Finally, in 1453, Ottoman Emperor Mehmed
the Conqueror captured Constantinople,

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:07.959
bringing a conclusive end 
to the Roman Empire.

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.858
Despite the Ottoman conquest,

00:04:09.858 --> 00:04:13.368
many Greek-speaking inhabitants 
of the Eastern Mediterranean

00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:18.108
continued to call themselves Romans 
until the early 21st century.

00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:20.488
In fact, it wasn’t until the Renaissance

00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:24.206
that the term “Byzantine Empire” 
was first used.

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:25.597
For Western Europeans,

00:04:25.597 --> 00:04:29.218
the Renaissance was about 
reconnecting with the wisdom of antiquity.

00:04:29.218 --> 00:04:32.218
And since the existence of a
medieval Roman Empire

00:04:32.218 --> 00:04:35.859
suggested there were Europeans 
who’d never lost touch with antiquity,

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:39.857
Western Europeans wanted to draw 
clear lines between the ages.

00:04:39.857 --> 00:04:44.457
To better distinguish the classical, 
Latin-speaking, pagan Roman Empire

00:04:44.457 --> 00:04:47.879
from the medieval, 
Greek-speaking, Christian Roman Empire,

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.169
scholars renamed 
the latter group Byzantines.

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.138
And thus, 100 years after it had
fallen, the Byzantine Empire was born.
