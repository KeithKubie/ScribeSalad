00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.160
Hi, I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re talking about Iran.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.420
Oh, Mr. Green? Mr. Green? I know that country.
It’s in the Middle East. It’s with Egypt.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.769
No, Me from the Past, we’re going to talk
about Iran. Now, I used to be you so I remember

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.460
when you would look at this part of the world
and you would be like, “oh yeah, that’s a thing.”

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.099
And in your case that “thing” extended
more or less from I guess, like, western China

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.679
to, like, uh, Poland.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.740
Then you’d make a bunch of broad generalizations
about that area and no doubt use the terms

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.510
Arab and Muslim interchangeably.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.790
But as usual Me From the Past the truth resists
simplicity. So today we are going to talk

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.090
about Iran and just Iran. Specifically, the
1979 Iranian Revolution.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.280
So the 1979 Iranian Revolution and its aftermath
are often seen by detractors as the first

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.930
step in the creation of an isolated, fundamentalist
state that supports terrorism, and, you might

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.040
be surprised to hear me say, that there is
some truth to that interpretation.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.990
That said, the way you think about the Iranian
Revolution depends a lot of which part of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.190
it you are looking at.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.680
And regardless, it’s very important because
it represents a different kind of revolution

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.760
from the ones that we usually talk about.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.480
So the 1979 uprisings were aimed at getting
rid of the Pahlavi Dynasty, which sounds,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.620
like, impressive, but this dynasty had only had two
kings, Reza Shah and Mohammed Reza Shah.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.740
Before the Pahlavis, Iran was ruled by the
Qajar dynasty, and before that the Safavids.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.020
The Safavids and Qajars were responsible for
two of the most important aspects of Iran:

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.220
The Safavids made Shia Islam the official
state religion in Iran, starting with Ismail

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.360
I in 1501, and the Qajars gave the Muslim
clergy – the ulema – political power.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.930
So most of the world’s Muslims are Sunnis
but the Shia, or Shiites are an important

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.540
sect that began very early on – around 680
CE and today form the majority of Muslims

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.830
in Iran and Iraq.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.500
Now within both Sunni and Shia there are further
divisions and many sects, but we’re just

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.909
going to talk about, like, the historical
difference between the two.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.229
Shia Muslims believe that Ali should’ve
been the first Caliph, Sunni Muslims think

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.700
that Abu Bakr, who was the first Caliph, was
rightly chosen.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.170
Since that disagreement, there have been many
others, many doctrinal differences but what’s

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.800
more important is that from the very beginning,
Shia Muslims saw themselves as the party of

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.810
the oppressed standing up against the wealthy
and powerful and harkening back to the social

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.300
justice standard that was set by the prophet.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.870
And this connection between religious faith
and social justice was extremely important

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.580
to the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and also
to previous revolutions in Iran.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.819
This is really crucial to understand because
many historians argue that the Iranian revolution

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.270
represents what the journalist Christian Caryl
called an “odd fusion of Islam and late-twentieth

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.250
century revolutionary politics.”

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.720
But actually, in the scheme of Iranian history,
its not so odd.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.310
Because 1979 was not Iran’s first revolution.
The first major one was in 1906. It forced

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.750
the ruling Qajars to accept a constitution.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.959
It created a parliament and supposedly some
limits on the king, and made Shia Islam the

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.000
official state religion, but it also protected
the rights of minorities in Iran.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.620
It ultimately failed partly because the clergy
withdrew their support, partly because the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.010
shah worked very actively against it, and
maybe most importantly, because the Russians

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.910
and the British worked to keep Persia weak so they
could continue to try to dominate the region.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.150
Which reminds me that most people in Iran
are not Arabs, they are Persian.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.390
And most people in Iran don’t speak Arabic,
they speak Farsi, or as we often call it in

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.520
English, Persian.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.599
So after WWI European rivalries really heated
up because of the discovery of oil in the

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.860
Middle East. The British established the Anglo
Iranian Oil Company – which would later

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.480
come to be known as BP.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.980
They also extracted a bunch of concessions
from the Iranian government in addition to

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.390
extracting lots of oil.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.849
And they helped to engineer a change in dynasty
by supporting military commander Reza Khan

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.220
in his coup in February 1921.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.269
Reza Khan became Reza Shah and then he attempted
to turn Persia, which he re-named Iran in

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.470
1935, into a modern, secular, western-style
state kind of like Turkey was under Ataturk.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.290
But Reza Shah is perhaps best remembered for
his over the top dictatorial repression, which

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.870
turned the clergy against him.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.370
Okay, so during World War II Reza Shah abdicated
and his young son Mohammad Reza Shah became

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.650
the leader of Iran. Which he remained, mostly,
until 1979 when he definitely stopped being

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.580
the leader of Iran.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.699
So after World War II, the British allowed
greater popular participation in Iran’s

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.279
government. The main party to benefit from this
openness was Tudeh, the Iranian communist party.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.100
Mohammed Mosaddegh was elected prime minister
in 1951 and led the parliament to nationalize

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.479
Iran’s oil industry, and that was the end
of the democratic experiment.

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.019
Now most history books say that in 1953 the
British and the CIA engineered a coup to remove

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.400
Mosaddegh from office.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.039
And that is quite possibly true. It is definitely
true that we tried to engineer a coup.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.419
It’s also true that Mosaddegh quit and fled
Iran following demonstrations against him.

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.019
But we also know that the Shia clergy encouraged
those demonstrations.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.559
That’s a bit of a weird decision for the
Clergy, considering that Shia Islam traditionally

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.399
takes a radical stance against oppression.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.840
But it’s important to remember that Mosaddegh
was supported by the Tudeh party and they

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.000
were communists.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.740
Nationalization of the oil industry was one
thing, but a further shift toward communism

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.639
might mean appropriation of the land that
supported the clergy, maybe even a rejection

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.259
of religion altogether.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.020
So now we’ve seen two occasions where the
Shia clergy support helped facilitate change.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.780
Right, in 1906 and again in 1953.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.280
So, let’s flash ahead to 1979. The Shah
was definitely an autocrat, and he employed

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.110
a ruthless secret police called the SAVAK
to stifle dissent.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.680
In 1975, the Shah abolished Iran’s two political
parties and replaced them with one party the

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.120
Resurgence party. You’ll never guess who
was resurging - the Shah.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.200
There was a huge round of censorship and arrests
and torture of political prisoners signaling

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.069
that autocracy was in Iran to stay.

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:09.869
But before those events in 1975, say between
1962 and 1975, by most economic and social

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.319
measures Iran saw huge improvements.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:17.389
In 1963, the Shah had tried to institute what
he called a White Revolution – top-down

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.460
modernization led by the monarchy, and in
many ways he was successful, especially in

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.360
improving industry and education.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.210
Oil revenues rose from $555 million in 1964
to $20 billion in 1976.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.259
And the Shah’s government invested a lot
of that money in infrastructure and education.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:38.029
The population grew and infant mortality fell.
A new professional middle class arose.

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:41.919
But the White Revolution wasn’t universally
popular. For instance, it was opposed by one

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.279
particular Shia cleric - the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:49.550
Khomeini spoke out against the White Revolution
from the religious center of Iran, Qom.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.139
One of his main complaints was that the reforms
would grant more rights to women, including

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.249
the right to vote, but he also attacked the
government for, quote:

00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:01.360
“the rigging of elections and other constitutional
abuses, neglect of the poor and the sale of

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.419
oil to Israel.”

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:07.099
And in general, Khomeini felt that a king’s
power was inherently un-Islamic and that Shia

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.289
tradition was to fight that power.

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:14.849
That noted about Khomeini, the 1979 revolution
didn’t start out to create an Islamic state.

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:20.039
At first it was a pretty typical uprising
by dissatisfied Iranians to overthrow a government

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.300
that they perceived as corrupt and unresponsive
to their needs.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.699
In spite of, or arguably because of, oil-fueled
economic growth, many Iranians weren’t enjoying

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.580
economic success. The universities were turning
out more graduates than there were jobs and

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.840
the mechanization of agriculture had the predictable
result of displacing farmers who moved to cities.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.719
Especially the capital city of Tehran where
there weren’t nearly enough jobs for the

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:43.539
number of people.

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:47.469
So, I think it’s unfair to say that a majority
of the demonstrators who took to the streets

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:52.939
in late 1978 were motivated by a fundamentalist
vision of Islam. They were dissatisfied with

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:57.169
economic inequality and political repression
and a corrupt regime.

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:01.800
So why do we generally remember the 1979 revolution
as having been motivated by Shia Islam. Well,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.369
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:09.249
So the initial demonstrations did begin after
an Iranian newspaper on January 7, 1978 published

00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:13.379
an article that was critical of Khomeini.
By the way, at the time he was living in Paris.

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:18.119
These initial demonstrations were pretty small,
but when the government police and army forces

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:22.619
starting firing on demonstrators, killing
some of them, the protests grew. Each time

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:26.649
marchers protested against the violent treatment
of demonstrators, the government would crack

00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:30.860
down, and their violent reaction would spur
more demonstrations. There was also a lot

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.400
of criticism of the west tied up in the revolution.
According to one woman who participated:

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.610
“American lifestyles had come to be imposed
as an ideal, the ultimate goal. Americanism

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:46.450
was the model. American popular culture – books,
magazines, film – had swept over our country

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.270
like a flood...We found ourselves wondering
‘Is there any room for our own culture?’”

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.130
The Shah never understood why so many people
were protesting against him; he thought that

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.750
they were communists, or being supported by
the British. He also thought that merely bringing

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.460
prosperity would be enough to keep him in
power.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.820
It wasn’t. On January 16, 1979 he left Iran.
He eventually ended up in the U.S., which

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.820
had unfortunate consequences for diplomatic
relations between the U.S. and Iran.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.420
But the point here is that the first part
of the Iranian revolution was relatively peaceful

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.510
protests followed by a government crackdown,
more protests that eventually led to the collapse

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.400
of the monarchy, and that looks kind of familiar,
especially if you’ve studied, like, the

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.470
French or Russian or even the American Revolutions.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.460
And most historians argue these protests weren’t
about Islam, but rather, “The discontent

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.610
over living conditions, pay cuts, and the
threat of unemployment fused with the general

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.060
disillusionment and anger with the regime.”

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.550
The government that eventually replaced the
monarchy was the second, and in many ways

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.230
much more revolutionary revolution.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.840
Thanks Thought Bubble. So the new Islamic
Republic of Iran was based on Khomeini’s

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.150
idea about what an Islamic government should
be, a principle he called velayat-e faqih.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.820
Mainly it was that a sharia law scholar, would
have ultimate authority, because he was more

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.430
knowledgeable than anyone about law and justice.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.340
There would be a legislature and a president
and a prime minister, but any of their decisions

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:08.940
could be overturned by the supreme ruler who
from 1979 until his death was Khomeini.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.640
Now, if democracy is only about holding elections,
then the new Iran was a democracy. I mean,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.890
Iran has elections, both for president and
for the parliament.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.310
And for the record, despite what Khomeini
might have thought in the ‘60s, women can

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.460
vote in Iran and they do. They also serve
in the parliament and the president’s cabinet.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.450
And in the referendum on whether to create
an Islamic Republic of Iran, the vast majority

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.150
of Iranians in a free and open vote, voted
“yes.”

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.120
Now governance in Iran is extremely complicated,
too complicated for one Crash Course video.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.460
But in once sense at least, Iran is definitely
not a democracy.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:46.140
The ultimate authority, written into the constitution,
is not the will of the people but god, who

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.650
is represented by the supreme religious leader.
And the actions of the Islamic Republic, especially

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:56.510
in the early chaotic days of 1979 but also
many times since, don’t conform to most

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.340
ideas of effective democracy.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.500
Like one of the first things that Khomeini
did to shore up his support was to create

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.220
the Islamic Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah
to defend the revolution against coup attempts.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.380
Although initially there were opposition parties,
their activities were curtailed by the new

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.920
“revolutionary courts” that applied sharia
law in a particularly harsh fashion.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.280
Like it’s estimated that by October 1979,
several hundred people had been executed.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.060
And under the new constitution, Khomeini was
given extensive power. I mean, he could appoint

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.860
the heads of the armed services, and the Revolutionary
Guard and the national TV and radio stations.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.050
He also approved the candidates for presidential
elections and appointed six of the twelve

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:38.070
members of the Guardian Council that approved
legislation from the parliament before it became law.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.610
So structurally Iran’s government looked
kind of like other governments, but as Michael

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:46.590
Axworthy points out it was different because,
quote, “above and beyond stood the faqih,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.600
with the power and the responsibility to intervene
directly in the name of Islam; indeed with

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.270
powers greater than those given to most monarchs
in constitutional monarchies.”

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:01.600
By 1979, Iran already had a long history of
clerical involvement in protest and dynamic

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.900
change, but it also had a long history of
pushing for constitutions and liberty.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.290
The current end result is the Islamic Republic
of Iran, but it’s worth remembering that

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.680
both those threads of history are still part
of Iranian life.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.520
Like we saw that in 2009 and 2010 with the
so-called Green Revolution where there were

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:21.100
huge protests after an Iranian election. Those
protests involved young people arguing for

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.760
more rights and liberties.. But they were also led
by, and encouraged by, reformist Shia clerics.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.150
In the U.S. we mostly remember the 1979 Iranian
Revolution for its burning of American flags

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.650
and taking of hostages in the American Embassy.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.040
That belonged more to the second phase of
the revolution, the chaotic period when the

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.820
Islamic republic was being born.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.600
Life in the Islamic Republic of Iran remains
highly repressive. I mean, for instance, Iran

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.370
still executes a very high percentage of criminals.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.890
But it’s inaccurate to say that Iran is
merely a dictatorship, or that it’s merely

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.750
repressive. And one of the challenges for
people in the West trying to understand Iran

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.050
is that we have to disentangle the various
aspects of the revolution rather than simply

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.390
relying on the images that have defined it
for us.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.950
I hope this episode can help a little. You
can find more resources in the links below.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.080
Thanks for watching.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.900
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis and

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.000
it’s made possible because of the hard worth
of all of these people.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.260
Thank you for watching and as we say in my
hometown, “don’t forget to be awesome.”
