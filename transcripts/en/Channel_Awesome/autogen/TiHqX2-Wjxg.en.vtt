you because he cares about you that's
 

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.010 align:start position:0%
you because he cares about you that's
why<00:14:11.430><c> this</c><00:14:11.490><c> lie</c><00:14:11.850><c> was</c><00:14:12.030><c> made</c><00:14:12.240><c> it</c><00:14:12.420><c> was</c><00:14:12.600><c> not</c><00:14:12.810><c> I'm</c>

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
why this lie was made it was not I'm
 

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
why this lie was made it was not I'm
gonna<00:14:13.470><c> tell</c><00:14:13.590><c> another</c><00:14:13.920><c> lie</c><00:14:14.190><c> on</c><00:14:14.370><c> top</c><00:14:14.400><c> of</c><00:14:14.610><c> this</c>

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:14.850 align:start position:0%
gonna tell another lie on top of this
 

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
gonna tell another lie on top of this
lie<00:14:15.090><c> so</c><00:14:15.780><c> I</c><00:14:15.810><c> think</c><00:14:16.230><c> that</c><00:14:16.500><c> balance</c><00:14:16.740><c> is</c><00:14:16.830><c> out</c><00:14:16.980><c> a</c>

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.010 align:start position:0%
lie so I think that balance is out a
 

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.970 align:start position:0%
lie so I think that balance is out a
little<00:14:17.430><c> bit</c><00:14:17.760><c> more</c><00:14:18.060><c> um</c><00:14:18.470><c> and</c><00:14:19.470><c> by</c><00:14:19.620><c> the</c><00:14:19.680><c> way</c><00:14:19.800><c> that</c>

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
little bit more um and by the way that
 

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.620 align:start position:0%
little bit more um and by the way that
episode<00:14:20.340><c> I</c><00:14:20.370><c> would</c><00:14:20.520><c> not</c><00:14:20.820><c> have</c><00:14:20.940><c> minded</c><00:14:21.150><c> as</c><00:14:21.420><c> much</c>
