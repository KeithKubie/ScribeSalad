00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.320
Bipolar disorder seems to get a bad rap, but
a lot of people in the public eye have come

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.990
forward and bravely discussed their struggles
with the condition.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.240
So what exactly is bipolar?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.960
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.120
If you’re as big of a Demi Lovato fan as
I am, you know the Confident singer is an

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.090
outspoken activist for mental health issues.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
Several years ago she came forward and admitted
to her own struggles with bipolar disorder,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230
formerly known as manic depression.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.750
Even as the disorder becomes more of a focus
in the public eye, a lot is still misunderstood.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.530
Bipolar disorder is most known for the way
it affects people’s moods.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.730
It often creates an uncontrollable change
in moods that can impact daily life for the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.109
3% of Americans with the condition.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.530
While researchers aren’t sure what causes
it, the risk factors for bipolar include genetics

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.550
and environment, things like stress, substance
abuse, and even lack of sleep.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.429
But really it can affect anybody.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.239
What a lot of people don’t understand is
that bipolar is more than just a single diagnosis.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.929
There are different categories, almost a scale
of bipolar.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.080
The symptoms vary from person to person.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.440
Some people’s manic episodes leave them
feeling exuberant and energetic.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.890
They feel really creative and like their brain
is working faster than usual, this usually

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.730
less severe and classified as “hypomania”.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.300
In others, mania can make them go without
sleep for three days or gamble away all their

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.300
savings.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.280
There’s Type 1, which is what people mostly
think of when think of the disorder.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.100
It’s symptoms include extreme manic episodes
in which someone acts more erratic than usual,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.000
they have grandiose ideas, an exaggerated
sense of importance and skills, higher sex

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.030
drive, and higher impulsivity.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.580
While the highs are really high, the lows
are just as extreme.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.020
People with type 1have periods of extreme
depression too.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.340
Bipolar 2 is similar to type 1, but low moods
tend to dominate with less frequent episodes

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.410
of less extreme mania.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.390
Rapid cycling, just like it sounds, is a type
when someone goes through 4 or more periods

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.450
of manic or depressive episodes in a 12th
month period.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.530
Yet, another type of bipolar is Cyclothymic,
which has several less extreme manic episodes

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.900
and less extreme depression.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.520
But no matter what all type, bipolar is mostly
characterized by the swinging of moods from

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.890
low to high.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.500
Sometimes these moods can last for weeks and
months, other times they’re as short as

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500
days.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.360
And to some you might think the high episodes
sound great.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.890
Who doesn’t want to feel important, smart,
and driven with a flight of ideas?

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.010
It’s these moments that make creative people
with the disorder so productive.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.730
Many creative types, painters, writers, even
actors have been diagnosed with some type

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.730
of bipolar.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.590
I’ve talked about this link before in another
episode.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.080
But like I said there’s a downside too.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.920
Sometimes those grand ideas include delusions
like taking over the government or winning

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.140
the jackpot at poker.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.510
Both the highs and lows can be very disruptive
to someone’s life.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.510
And no one knows this better than Actress
Carrie Fisher, who’s episodes made made

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.510
headlines.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.510
Now she’s a champion of mental health issues.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.510
Fisher once said at Comic Con that her bipolar
made her go “very fast or very sad”.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.510
And she even said something about another
celebrity mental health icon, Robin Williams

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.510
she told Hollywood Reporter that "He was the
opposite of selfish.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.510
Anything would hurt him.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.510
Or … impact him somehow.”

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.510
And that’s just what some research is showing.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.510
One study published in the journal Nature
found that some people with bipolar disorder

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.510
are more sensitive, essentially their brains
are literally more sensitive to stimuli than

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.510
others.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.459
In this study researchers took skin cells
from participants, turned them into stem cells

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.790
than coaxed them into becoming neurons.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.040
They found that some people’s neurons are
physically more sensitive when stimulated

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.150
than others.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.910
Other imaging studies found differences in
the brains of those with bipolar.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.819
One study published in the journal Molecular
Psychiatry found differences in white matter

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.120
and the cerebellum.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.480
The researchers used an MRI technique that
searches for signatures of certain byproducts

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.950
of cell metabolism.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.830
This technique found higher readings in white
matter and the cerebellum than those without

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.830
the condition.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.940
Their research also found that there were
no differences in the cerebellum in those

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.760
participants with bipolar who are also taking
a common form of treatment for the condition,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760
lithium.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.040
Lithium is just one of several effective treatment
options, like other mood stabilizers including

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.040
valproate.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.430
According to a review published in the journal
Current Opinion in Psychiatry, even some anti

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.580
seizure medications have been shown to be
effective in treating the condition.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.480
Beyond medication, different types of therapy
help, like Cognitive Behavior Therapy which

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.629
helps patients build a toolkit of sorts for
dealing with dysfunctions in thought patterns

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.430
and information processing.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.300
Or Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy
which helps patients figure out how their

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.720
routine and social situations affect their
moods.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.240
Many people with bipolar disorder go on to
live wonderful, healthy lives.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.819
But it starts with getting help.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.530
Check out resources like the depression and
bipolar support alliance at http://www.dbsalliance.org/

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.000
Art and creative outlets also help many people
with psychological conditions heal, but what

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.910
is the link between creativity and mental
illness?

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.720
find out more, in this episode right here

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:42.370
So do you have any other questions about psychology
or the way our brains work?
