00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:28.940
- So, Sal here at Khan Academy
worldwide headquarters,

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.810
and I'm excited to be
here with Barbara Oakley,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.250
who's an expert on learning
and learning how to learn.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.010
And so, Barbara, let me just start

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.750
with a question that I'm sure many that

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.590
many of Khan Academy users or
young people around the world,

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.119
frankly, all people have faced,

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:45.510
which is you're trying to learn something,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.790
and you're looking at a textbook

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.670
or a teacher's giving a lecture,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.290
and all of a sudden it's
just not making sense

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.940
and you keep trying to
pound your head on it.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.190
What's going on in the brain at that time,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.763
and is the only option to
keep trying to power forward?

00:05:59.611 --> 00:06:01.240
- Oooo, the last thing you want to do

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.120
is keep powering forward.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.450
I mean, ultimately you want to do that,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.910
but if you're really stuck,
and you're very frustrated,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.960
as I used to get, when
I was trying to study

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.250
when I was growing up,
the best thing to do

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.040
is to back off and get
your mind completely off

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.160
what you're stuck on.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.960
And I mean completely off.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.740
So either study something very different,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.650
or go out for a walk, or just do something

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.520
that gets your mind off of it.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.379
As soon as you get your mind off it,

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:35.040
it turns out, that opens up
a completely different set

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.500
of neural circuits.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.100
It's the difference between task positive,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.500
where you're focusing, and task negative,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.310
where you're not focusing at all,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.910
and these other, this
alternate set of circuits

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.550
is what allows you to begin making sense

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.900
of the stuff that you've
been struggling with.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.950
So as long as you're focusing on it,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.370
you're actually keeping yourself stuck,

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.480
because you're not allowing
these other neural circuits

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.130
to kinda kick into gear.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.170
So that's why people say, back
off when you get frustrated.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.760
I never understood that
before and now I do.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.490
It's very powerful.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.743
- So what you're saying
actually backs up my experience.

00:07:12.743 --> 00:07:14.814
I remember in college
when I used to take these,

00:07:14.814 --> 00:07:18.800
kind of, very difficult
math proof classes,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.860
and these proofs, the
first time you look at 'em,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.890
I'd be like I don't know,

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.889
but I got into a habit,
I kinda fell into it,

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.030
of I would read the proofs
and make sure I understood,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.690
or read what I was trying to prove

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.080
and make sure I understood it,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.043
and then I would go to sleep,

00:07:31.043 --> 00:07:32.980
and then I would wake
up in the next morning,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.810
and it was like I had just
kinda got out of the work,

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.621
I had delegated it to my brain.

00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.240
And it just happened, and you're saying,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.090
that actually is, it's based in science.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.660
- It's based in really good science.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.500
In fact there's some great research out

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.697
that shows that as you sleep at night,

00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:49.970
that's when those little dendritic spines

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.400
will like explode out and make
those synaptic connections.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.520
And it happens when you're sleeping.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.700
So if you've learned, you've studied,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.210
focused during the day,
you go to sleep at night,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.070
that's when the neural architecture

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.770
is actually popping out and forming.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.690
So that's why sleep can be

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.184
such an important part of learning.

00:08:10.184 --> 00:08:11.020
= And how do you know this?

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.548
Have y'all actually looked at,

00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:14.870
do you have people trying
to learn something,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.408
and then you put 'em in
an MRI, how do you know?

00:08:17.408 --> 00:08:22.370
- Well Gwang Yang at NYU has
done some fantastic research

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.958
published in science, and
it studies what happens

00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.710
to neurons when you sleep at night.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.130
And often some of these
studies involve mice

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.780
because we don't want to
dissect little living infants

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.167
and so forth, for some reason.

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:40.740
And but it's, but it really gives us

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.390
a great understanding
of how that architecture

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.060
is growing while we sleep.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.730
And there's another thing.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.400
When you go to sleep,
well, during the day,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.660
as the day goes by, you get this sort of

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.670
little toxic stuff that's
coming out of your cells.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.620
So that's why at night, you feel kind of

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.210
mentally fatigued.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.380
But when you go to sleep, what happens is,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.530
your brain cells shrink.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.050
This allows those, the metabolic,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.150
I mean the sort of cerebral fluids

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.900
to wash away those toxins and that's why

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.230
in the morning you feel so much fresher.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.600
You don't wanna go a night without sleep

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.640
or with a very small amount of sleep,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.710
because that can't wash those toxins away,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.310
and then the next day, you're working

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.370
with a poison brain,
which isn't a good idea.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.870
- So making this very tangible.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.585
If I have an exam coming
up, let's say next week,

00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:34.610
what would you, based on what you know,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.562
and based on what the science tells us,

00:09:36.562 --> 00:09:37.395
what would be the optimal strategy.

00:09:37.395 --> 00:09:39.080
And let's just say I don't know much

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.010
of what is covered on the
exam in a week from now.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.440
How would you tell me to approach that?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.414
- Don't sit there and
say, I'm gonna do 10 hours

00:09:46.414 --> 00:09:49.340
of studying the day before the exam.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.840
Instead, I'm going to take, let's say

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.040
you have 10 hours available.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.462
Parse that out, do an hour,
hour and a half each day,

00:09:57.462 --> 00:09:59.884
and each day as you learning,

00:09:59.884 --> 00:10:02.100
that night when you go to sleep,

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.624
you're making some more connections.

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:06.380
The next night, you've studied some,

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.900
and you're making more connections.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.800
And as each day goes by, you're building

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.370
a really solid set of connections.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.245
If you wait until the
day before and then cram,

00:10:16.245 --> 00:10:19.780
you're building very poor connections,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.360
'cause you only have one night of sleep

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.940
to actually do the connections with.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.933
- And sometimes, it's even worse.

00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:26.110
I remember from college,
what most students do

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.831
is actually use that last night of sleep

00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:29.260
to study those 10 hours.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.580
And then they go in without
any sleep oftentimes.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.290
Which sounds like the
worst possible thing.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.590
- It is, and then what sometimes happens

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.740
is they'll come to me and say,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.110
I suffer from test anxiety.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.220
And actually, test anxiety is very real.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.160
Some people study really hard,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.970
and they get very nervous.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.310
But other people use poor strategies,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.550
and then they freeze on the test,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.580
and it's because they didn't actually

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.295
learn the material well.

00:10:57.295 --> 00:10:59.600
Because we don't teach about how

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.740
the brain learns very much,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.674
that's part of why people
make these kinds of

00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:07.490
sometimes tragic mistakes.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.270
- So if this makes sense, and I think,

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.030
even before knowing about the science,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.076
a lot of students, all
of us, intuitively know,

00:11:14.076 --> 00:11:16.900
yes, I should probably
start working on it sooner.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.470
I shouldn't do it last minute.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.740
So why do we, as humans, do that?

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.750
Why do we put it off to the last minute?

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.425
- Oh, because when you even
just think about something

00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:27.410
you don't like or don't want to do,

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.460
it activates the insular cortex,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.300
the portion of the brain
that experiences pain.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.790
So the brain naturally
enough skitters away

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.740
from that thought to a new thought

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.970
that's like, ooo, this
is so much more fun,

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.180
and it'll go surfing the web

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.040
or doing whatever's more fun,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.200
and you've just procrastinated.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.860
So a very powerful way of
tackling this kind of thing

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.266
is to use something called
the Pomodoro Technique,

00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:54.897
that was--
- Pomodoro?

00:11:54.897 --> 00:11:58.310
- Pomodoro, and that was
invented by an Italian,

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.120
Francesco Cirillo, and
Pomodoro is Italian for tomato.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.490
It's so simple.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.750
What this does is it sneaks your brain

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.660
past that tendency to go
away from whatever's painful.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.430
You just set a timer for 25 minutes,

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.270
you get rid of anything
that's possibly a distraction.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.890
So no little ringy
dingies on your cell phone

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.860
or that kind of thing,

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.110
and no popups on your computer,

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.830
but then you set that
timer for 25 minutes,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.550
and you focus as intently
as you can for 25 minutes,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.730
realizing that we all, of course,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.470
have these monkey minds,
and you may catch yourself

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.702
and have to bring yourself back,

00:12:37.702 --> 00:12:39.404
but the most important part,

00:12:39.404 --> 00:12:41.842
is when you're done with the 25 minutes,

00:12:41.842 --> 00:12:46.350
you relax, you reward
yourself with something.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.200
And what that's doing, is
that's actually allowing you

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.710
to get into the diffuse mode,

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.410
this more task-negative, relaxing thing

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.650
where you're consolidating
what you've just learned.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.883
So this is a big reason why
this technique is so powerful.

00:13:01.883 --> 00:13:05.210
- So, and is there something
magic about the 25 minutes?

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.310
Why not 15 minutes or 40 minutes?

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.720
- Oh, there is, very good question.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.030
So, the magic is that, remember
that pain in the brain?

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.810
Well, it goes away after about 20 minutes.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.620
So 25 minutes is that perfect sweet spot

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.730
that kind of starts
getting you in the flow,

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.940
and you may even find, oh, wait,

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.973
I'm at 25 minutes, it says I should stop,

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:28.530
well, sometimes, I'm in the flow,

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.030
so I'll just keep right on going.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:36.030
And that's okay if I go 25, 45, two hours,

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.400
whenever, when I do stop, I reward myself,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.742
and that helps program my brain

00:13:42.742 --> 00:13:46.070
to enjoy the focusing process even more.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.700
It's like Pavlov with the dogs.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.940
He'd ring a bell and then after a while

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.650
the dogs knew they were
gonna get a reward,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.520
so they'd enjoy that time in between.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.290
We're even like that as humans.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:00.280
We can begin enjoying
that focusing period.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.827
- And so, make sure I understand,

00:14:03.817 --> 00:14:06.411
it's not that you have
to stop at 25 minutes.

00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:08.160
It's just that at 25
minutes, the bell rings,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.919
you have earned the right for guilt-free

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:12.888
whatever it might be.

00:14:12.888 --> 00:14:13.900
- Bingo.
- Surfing the web,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.200
go for a walk, and that even
that time is still productive.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.610
You shouldn't have guilt
associated with it.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.130
One, you did your focused time,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.860
but you're also saying
you're getting into this,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.320
the default mode is how you described it,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.527
and that's where your
brain, if you go for a walk,

00:14:27.527 --> 00:14:28.822
you're starting to form the connections

00:14:28.822 --> 00:14:29.655
based on what you just focused.

00:14:29.655 --> 00:14:30.993
- That's right, and we often think

00:14:30.993 --> 00:14:33.073
that if you're relaxing
and you're not focusing,

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:34.600
that you're not doing any work.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.070
But actually, your brain is doing a lot

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.800
of productive, yet subconscious, work

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.340
when you're taking these breaks.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.370
Which is part of why these
breaks are so important.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.549
And they also, if you focus,
focus, focus all the time,

00:14:48.549 --> 00:14:51.700
there is some evidence
that it might actually

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.880
reduce your creativity, reduce the ability

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.510
of the default mode to
kind of kick into play.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.640
So when you're taking these little breaks,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.450
you're actually also sort of
encouraging your creativity.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.909
- And when the bell rings
but you're in your flow,

00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:09.100
and if you're getting,
if you're feeling like

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.926
this is really good, and the pain,

00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:12.910
I mean, that is
fascinating, it's literally,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.580
'cause I don't feel physical pain.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.413
There's all sorts of things,

00:15:15.413 --> 00:15:17.060
I'm procrastinating at
least 20 things right now.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.800
And I'll, I don't feel pain,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.180
but it's triggering the
same part of the brain.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.180
- Well, everybody procrastinates,

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.870
because when you're working on one thing

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.960
you're not working on another thing.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.960
But you're a little bit, different,

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.800
to use as a model case
for procrastination,

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.360
because you don't think
like a lot of people do.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.470
But for me--

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.722
- Probably a good thing.

00:15:40.722 --> 00:15:43.992
- But a lot of times you can get really,

00:15:43.992 --> 00:15:48.930
you can have a lot of good
things, good options on the table

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.750
and then you may not feel
that pain in the brain.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.850
For me, usually there's something,

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.090
I'll have this thing I wanna work on,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.590
this thing, this thing, this thing,

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.480
and I'll work happily away,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.728
and there's this one thing,
and I've been putting it off,

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:04.980
and that's the one that can kick in

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.060
that pain in the brain sort of feeling.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.017
- And it's really, I mean,
you definitely avoid it,

00:16:09.017 --> 00:16:11.145
and it's like a subconscious pain almost.

00:16:11.145 --> 00:16:14.040
For just that point about this,

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.277
I'm fascinated by this, the Pomodoro,

00:16:16.277 --> 00:16:18.860
and the timer, if you're
feeling in the flow.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.760
You don't have to stop.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.380
You can keep going.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.180
- Yes, and what I'll often do,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.610
is I have a little timer on my computer,

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.310
I'm using it, I'm working
away maybe on something,

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.660
and I don't have my sound
turned on on the computer.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.800
So I can always just go check and see,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.830
oh, has it expired or not?

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.050
But it doesn't actually
kick me out and say,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.180
check, do you wanna quit now?

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.140
I can just decide that when I feel free.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.872
But there's a lot of great apps

00:16:47.872 --> 00:16:50.600
using the Pomodoro Technique,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.070
so people like to use these
apps a lot of the time,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.020
and they'll collect Pomodoros.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.654
So Forest is a very popular app,

00:16:58.654 --> 00:17:03.510
and if you complete a
Pomodoro, you plant a tree.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.100
If you don't, you kill a tree.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.650
But you can collect like
two to three Pomodoros

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.140
on a certain topic, another
number on another topic,

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.292
if you like, if you're sort of,

00:17:15.292 --> 00:17:18.969
if that helps your productivity,

00:17:18.969 --> 00:17:20.700
it's a great approach.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.210
For me, I generally just love to work,

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.950
so I'm working away, but occasionally,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.822
I will find myself surfing the web,

00:17:27.822 --> 00:17:30.361
and there's this one
thing I should be doing.

00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:33.080
So I'll set the timer and I'll get going

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.100
with the Pomodoro, and I can feel it now.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.670
My brain is trained.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.550
As soon as I set that timer,
I start kind of working away

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.060
and actually getting excited

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.120
about even stuff I don't like.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.610
It's a great technique.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.350
- And there might be skeptics out there,

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.950
says, okay, Professor
Oakley, she's saying it,

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.390
but she's a fancy professor.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.862
You said, you know, my brain
might be wired differently,

00:17:55.862 --> 00:17:58.940
but they might say, your brain is probably

00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.773
wired differently.

00:17:59.773 --> 00:18:00.606
You're a professor.

00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:04.010
You've done, has this
always, how has learning

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.300
been for you most of your life?

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.380
- Well, before I talk about that,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.310
I should mention, so I
teach a very large course

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.340
called Learning How to Learn

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.358
with Terry Sejnowski on learning,

00:18:14.358 --> 00:18:17.919
and I have to say that out of

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:20.620
two and a half million students,

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.320
it almost seems sometimes
like I've heard from them all

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.900
and they love the Pomodoro Technique.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.390
So it is, I've just
gotten a lot of feedback,

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.520
and it really helps for everybody,

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.150
not just people like me.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.552
But people like me, well,
my own background is

00:18:37.552 --> 00:18:41.040
I hated math and science
when I was growing up.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.090
I flunked my way through
elementary, middle,

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.460
and high school math and science.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.420
I just didn't have the math gene,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.799
knew I couldn't do it.

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:51.150
And then when I was 26 years old,

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.560
I was getting out of the military,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.440
and you know, for some weird reason,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.670
nobody wanted to get me
with my Slavic languages

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.070
and literature degree, and I thought,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.740
maybe I should see if I
can learn something new,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.630
like maybe even this math stuff.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.386
Because I could see the
officers I'd worked with,

00:19:10.386 --> 00:19:12.850
they had great job opportunities,

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.280
they were often West Point engineers,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.400
and so I started, and see,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.830
I wish there had been
Kahn Academy back then,

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.450
but I started with remedial
high school algebra

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.050
and started working my way
up, and now, and it worked.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.170
I'm a professor of engineering.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:36.170
But if you use some of
these ideas about learning,

00:19:36.293 --> 00:19:39.970
I've found that the way I learned Russian

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.130
at the Defense Language Institute

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.269
is actually very similar to how you learn

00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:47.933
in math and science, and when I applied

00:19:47.933 --> 00:19:50.930
those same techniques, which
are actually the techniques

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.930
that involve how your brain
really learns, it worked.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.540
But if I'd known then what I know now

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.110
about learning, I still
could've made it much easier.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.171
- So after the military, you went on this

00:20:03.171 --> 00:20:05.130
wanting to go back into math.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.150
But at that time, you did not
know about these techniques.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.760
You just, what was different about it

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.010
when you were learning it in your 20s

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.370
versus when you first tried to learn it

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.893
when you were 14 or 15.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.310
- I didn't have to have
a job when I was 14 or 15

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.321
because I was supported by my parents.

00:20:20.321 --> 00:20:21.950
Yeah, I lived in that home.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.070
- So there was an urgency to it.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.090
There was a high stakes.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.710
- And I think part of it, too,

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.332
is I looked at the future, and I thought,

00:20:30.332 --> 00:20:35.280
you know, we know language and culture

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.710
is always gonna be really important,

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.610
but in today's world, math and science

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.720
is really important as well.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.260
And it's not like you
have to become an engineer

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.944
or a computer scientist, but
if you have some knowledge

00:20:49.944 --> 00:20:53.123
of those fields, it really
broadens your ability

00:20:53.123 --> 00:20:56.400
to get decent jobs today.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.770
So I always say, I did the
thing everybody told me,

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.254
I followed my passion.

00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:02.480
I learned a language.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.100
But I didn't broaden my passion.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.030
And that left me in a box.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.611
And so today, I often encourage people,

00:21:10.611 --> 00:21:13.560
it's great to follow your passion,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.310
but broaden it also, and
you'll find that it's

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.010
really helpful in today's working world.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.660
- And how did you, so
you went back into math,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.828
motivated, to some degree, by economics,

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.680
and you, it seems like you learned it.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.260
How did you fall into
this area of research?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.400
When you went back to grad school,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.590
did you say, I want, this
learning is interesting to me

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.390
because it, there's a phase in my life

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.640
where I had trouble and
now I figured it out?

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.440
Or did you, how did you get to this field,

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.680
which is a fascinating one?

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.340
I think it applies to everyone.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.300
What was the trigger
that got you interested?

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.540
- Oh, good question.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.380
So I did kind of just dink
around a lot in my life.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.980
I mean, I was in the military as enlisted

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.550
and an officer, I worked
at the South Pole Station

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:00.707
in Antarctica--

00:22:01.569 --> 00:22:04.053
- [Sal] Wouldn't categorize
that as dinking around.

00:22:04.053 --> 00:22:07.320
That seems, that's kind of
hard core dinking, I guess.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.540
- Yes, hard core.
- That's quite

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.547
impressive dinking.
(audience laughter)

00:22:09.547 --> 00:22:12.935
- And I used to work as a translator

00:22:12.935 --> 00:22:17.176
for the Russians on Soviet
trawlers up in the Bering Sea.

00:22:17.176 --> 00:22:20.566
But in all of these kinds of things,

00:22:20.566 --> 00:22:24.120
now, see, there's one problem, though.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.830
See, I'm not like you.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.130
You have this incredible working memory.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.780
My working memory is
like one thing at a time,

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.270
and when get on, I get
it, and it's like, so,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.560
Ooo, it's shiny, and
then I get distracted--

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.052
- [Sal] We are more
similar than you imagine.

00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:41.240
- So what was the question again?

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.630
- For real?

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.944
- For real.
(audience laughter)

00:22:46.944 --> 00:22:48.433
- Oh, yeah, no, that's,
I thought that was,

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:49.266
how did you get interested?

00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:51.140
Maybe I do have slightly
longer working memory,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.990
if that was for real.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.403
But how did you get
interested in this field?

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.503
- The thing is, I, well,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.230
it just, a student asked
a question, and said,

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.949
he found out, 'cause I was
just a typical professor,

00:23:06.949 --> 00:23:11.237
maybe with a little bit
lower working memory

00:23:11.237 --> 00:23:13.270
than many professors,

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.960
but I did my engineering
research and so forth.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.430
And one day, but I loved to write.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:20.850
And so on the side, I'd write,

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.990
but I'd keep it hidden because tenure,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.900
and all that kind of stuff.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.010
So one day a student asked me,

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.410
he found out I was terrible
at math growing up,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.950
and said, you know, how'd you do it?

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.300
How'd you change your brain?

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.350
And I thought, how did I change my brain?

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.460
And so I wrote him a little email,

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.213
and then I thought, well,
because of the past books

00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:45.870
I'd written, I knew a
little about neuroscience,

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.570
about cognitive psychology.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.540
And I thought, well, I should put together

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.150
some of these ideas,
because a lot of information

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.106
that's out there on learning
comes from education

00:23:56.106 --> 00:23:59.060
or some from the field
of cognitive psychology,

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.610
but there's actually all
this incredible research

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.780
that's being done in the
field of neuroscience.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:08.780
And so I put together a manuscript,

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.882
and that became the
book, A Mind for Numbers.

00:24:12.882 --> 00:24:15.790
I just kinda wrote a book about it

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.410
and it turned out really super popular,

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.500
and so I was just surprised.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.698
'Cause it was kind of a
little side venture for me

00:24:24.698 --> 00:24:26.930
because I just thought I was gonna do

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.580
my normal engineering stuff,

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.110
and then people really liked it.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.480
It was a very fresh approach,
I think, to learning

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.820
that brought in, a lot of times,

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.880
what, there's great, great information

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.763
about how to learn effectively,

00:24:40.763 --> 00:24:44.080
but it really only
encompasses a small portion

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.840
of what is truly needed to
know how to learn effectively.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.973
So, for example, you
find these great books

00:24:50.973 --> 00:24:54.205
in cognitive psychology
and they don't even mention

00:24:54.205 --> 00:24:57.630
that procrastination
is the number one issue

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.584
for students and how do you tackle that?

00:24:59.584 --> 00:25:02.660
And there's just so much information

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.760
that's not being put together,

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.720
and so I like to synthesize
and stand on the shoulders

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.380
of these great researchers, but bring in

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.507
a lot of different ideas, and so that's,

00:25:15.507 --> 00:25:18.420
I just kind of backed
into it accidentally.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.740
- 'Cause it is fascinating,
'cause there is

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.630
all this research going on that I actually

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.670
had no idea about until starting to look

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.820
at some of your work,
and it is so practical,

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.483
and it so relevant to frankly everyone,

00:25:29.483 --> 00:25:31.720
but no one was really communicating,

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.410
or maybe, communicating
it in the right way.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:39.240
Why isn't this part of, why
doesn't every orientation

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.570
at every school and college and workplace

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.430
start off with these techniques?

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:44.930
'Cause it seems like,
it's not just school,

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.090
it seems like even in
the workplace, you know,

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.850
there's I gotta get that memo

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.860
out to my coworker by Wednesday.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.454
I go, I'll do it Tuesday night.

00:25:53.454 --> 00:25:57.250
Why isn't this more
widespread in your sense?

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.410
- I think that it's, it's really only

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.070
in the last 10 years or so

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.810
that we have gotten a good understanding

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.554
of how the brain works,
or a better understanding.

00:26:07.554 --> 00:26:09.610
There's still a long way to go.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.140
And it hasn't caught up
with modern pedagogy,

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.230
and so if you asked,
let's say you ask someone

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.350
to create an online course on
how do you learn effectively,

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.580
or you ask some university,
a major university,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.000
to produce such a course.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.820
They'd say great, we'll
do it for teachers.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.410
And if you said, no,
actually, normal people,

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.340
ordinary people would
like to know this, too.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.500
They'd say, good, we'll produce a course

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.150
and it will have two weeks
on the history of education,

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.928
two more weeks on theories of education,

00:26:37.928 --> 00:26:39.919
two more weeks on how babies learn,

00:26:39.919 --> 00:26:42.610
a little bit on how people learn,

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.030
but no neuroscience,
maybe just one lecture,

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.203
'cause it's too hard.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.890
So what Terry and I did was kind of flip

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.466
that all on its head and say,

00:26:51.466 --> 00:26:53.850
well, let's start from neuroscience.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.110
If it's too advanced,
we'll use some metaphors

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.440
to help bring you along.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.590
And it actually is easy stuff,

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.880
and it's so useful, and that's why

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.810
the Learning How to Learn
course is so incredibly popular.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.780
It's simple and easy kinds of information,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.560
but I think some of it, too,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.170
is let's say you are a professor
of cognitive psychology

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.040
and you've just spent the
last 30 years of your life

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.906
researching issues
related to working memory,

00:27:22.906 --> 00:27:26.064
you know, there's part
of you that screams,

00:27:26.064 --> 00:27:29.200
well, it can't be that easy.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.780
You know, I've been working
forever on this thing

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.600
and she's making it just like,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.110
but it actually is, the fundamental ideas

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.980
are really, really easy
for anybody to understand.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.971
And so, I've been working with Terry

00:27:43.971 --> 00:27:48.971
and Greg Hammons to make some
great videos for kids now

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.130
that also explain some of these ideas,

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.590
because everybody says,
these ideas about learning

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.550
are so simple that anybody can learn 'em.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.760
I wish I had known them when I was a kid.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.950
Actually, that's true, so that's what

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.280
we've been working on.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.377
- Yeah, it's so surprising, because one,

00:28:05.377 --> 00:28:08.160
they seem, they make intuitive sense,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.640
but then when you back it up

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.690
with the neuroscience, then it...

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.880
Are there skeptics here?

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.760
It feels like you could
say the sky is blue

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.593
and there'll be skeptics.

00:28:15.593 --> 00:28:17.323
There'll be someone who will say,

00:28:17.323 --> 00:28:18.850
are there people who say, well, no,

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:20.430
that's not exactly right,

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.987
sometimes it's better to pull
an all-nighter, I don't know.

00:28:22.987 --> 00:28:25.223
Are you hearing push back from anyone?

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:30.723
- No, I mean, every great
once in a while, you get,

00:28:30.723 --> 00:28:33.360
anybody will get push back.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.570
But, when you're working with

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.035
one of the world's
greatest neuroscientists,

00:28:38.035 --> 00:28:40.113
all I kinda have to do is say,

00:28:40.113 --> 00:28:42.270
okay, you wanna argue
about the neuroscience?

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.460
Go talk to this guy.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.897
And Terry is really one
of the world leaders.

00:28:47.897 --> 00:28:52.897
I think if you use a metaphorical approach

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:55.710
to explain some of
these fundamental ideas,

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:59.083
and you say, I'm using a
metaphor, this is the main idea,

00:28:59.083 --> 00:29:02.913
it's kind of hard to argue with that.

00:29:02.913 --> 00:29:07.030
- And going back to the
very practical tips,

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:07.863
I guess you could say.

00:29:07.863 --> 00:29:09.239
We talk about the importance of sleep.

00:29:09.239 --> 00:29:12.600
Would you say that it's,
is there any research,

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.440
or even rules of thumb, about
maybe the best time to study?

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.530
Morning, evening, or is that kind of,

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.000
the jury's out on that?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.445
- Jury's out, because some people,

00:29:21.445 --> 00:29:25.410
some people are morning
people, others are night owls.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.540
They find that as the day goes by,

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.350
you're metabolites will come out

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.320
and you're getting, accumulating toxins,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.180
but even so, some people
just seem to be able

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.530
to perform better at night.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.567
And so, you know, bless 'em.

00:29:41.567 --> 00:29:43.942
I wish I could be that way.

00:29:43.942 --> 00:29:46.575
But there's just, everyone's different.

00:29:46.575 --> 00:29:51.575
We do find that there's
about four hours or so

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:57.310
of really intense time you
can do deliberate practice

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.140
and do something that's really hard.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.385
So, for example, if
you're a concert pianist,

00:30:02.385 --> 00:30:06.660
about four hours is
your best practice time,

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.428
or mathematician, whatever.

00:30:09.428 --> 00:30:12.895
But you can still get a lot done.

00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:17.770
Sleep, though, there do
seem to be a few people

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.550
that have this short sleep gene

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.700
that can get by on three
or four hours of sleep,

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.770
I want that gene.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.280
Can they maybe introduce it somehow?

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.520
But for most people, you need
around eight hours or so.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.690
Younger people need more sleep.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.310
Naps can help, but they
can't really replace

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.540
a good solid block of sleep at night.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.180
- It's interesting as
connected to Khan Academy,

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.399
this four hour number that you mentioned,

00:30:42.399 --> 00:30:45.520
it definitely syncs with
my person experience.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.060
'Cause when I make videos,
videos are actually

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.720
quite mentally taxing to do,

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.310
because most of them,
they're done in real time.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.700
So you're trying to do
the problem in real time,

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.400
but at the same time
there's a part of your brain

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.190
that's making sure, are you
saying all the right things?

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.230
Will this be understandable for someone?

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.070
Are you speaking cohesive, you know,

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.652
all of these types of things.

00:31:03.652 --> 00:31:07.600
Since I've started this
journey on Kahn Academy,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.113
about four hours is my cap.

00:31:09.113 --> 00:31:11.750
After four hours, I
really can't produce more,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.144
and then I try to do less
mentally intensive things.

00:31:15.144 --> 00:31:17.170
But it is amazing, I kind of just

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.740
hit a wall after four hours.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.480
- Yeah, I find that myself.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.700
And so people say, well,
then we should only have

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.318
four hours in the workday.

00:31:24.318 --> 00:31:29.030
I wish, but actually, four
hours of really intense,

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.840
and then the other hours as,

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.360
you can still be very
productive, just doing things

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:39.340
that are a little less
intellectually demanding.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.620
- And my old boss, and I didn't realize,

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.578
his advice was based
in sound neuroscience,

00:31:43.578 --> 00:31:46.044
but even when I worked at the hedge fund,

00:31:46.044 --> 00:31:48.570
finance and hedge funds
are normally associated

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.070
with people working 80 hours a week,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.900
and always on and all this,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.330
he was very adamant that as
soon as the markets closed

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.910
at, you know were were in Boston, at 4:30,

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.720
when we were out in
California, it was at 1:30,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.830
he'd say, go home, recharge,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.920
make sure you get a night's sleep,

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.870
because our whole job is
to make good decisions

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.280
and to avoid bad ones, and as soon as you,

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.220
but I think he's also
implicitly saying that,

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.880
look, you've been studying
all of these stocks

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.762
and doing all of this analysis all day.

00:32:11.762 --> 00:32:15.750
Part of it is let those, let
that default mode happen.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.110
- That's right.
- And so you might start

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.328
seeing some insights.

00:32:18.328 --> 00:32:20.410
- I think that's very true.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:21.770
It's very good advice.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.320
I think another piece
of advice that I give,

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.580
and I don't know that there's actually

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.198
neuroscience based on this,

00:32:29.198 --> 00:32:32.797
is to try, during your recharge hours,

00:32:32.797 --> 00:32:36.800
to learn about something
that's completely unrelated

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.130
to whatever your main task is.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.800
And I think what that
does is that allows you

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.660
to think more creatively.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.810
Let's say that you're trying

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.800
to really learn about investing.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.488
So you read all the books about investing.

00:32:51.488 --> 00:32:54.400
But you're actually
reading all the same books

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.867
about investing that
everybody else is reading.

00:32:56.867 --> 00:33:00.530
If you are learning something
completely different,

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.850
just a tiny bit of the time,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.090
you will bring, through,
metaphor and analogy,

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:08.760
creative new ideas and new approaches

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.990
to whatever you're learning about.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.210
- That's fascinating, 'cause I sometimes,

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.890
you see this pattern in people's lives

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.470
that when they're school-aged,

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.950
they're studying multiple subjects,

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.870
but then as soon as they get
into their field of specialty,

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.940
they start only reading or doing

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.964
in that field of specialty,
and what you're suggesting,

00:33:24.964 --> 00:33:27.960
and it does seem right, I am curious,

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.397
maybe someone will do
research on this eventually,

00:33:30.397 --> 00:33:31.650
that you might be doing
yourself the best service,

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:33.560
do that four hours, maybe do three hours

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.330
of the thing that you have
to do in the next week

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.730
or whatever, in the next year,

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.090
but then maybe give yourself some time

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.050
to do something completely different

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:40.980
and don't feel bad about it.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.260
It might actually be forming connections

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.781
that you don't even appreciate.

00:33:44.781 --> 00:33:46.252
- That's exactly right,
I couldn't agree more.

00:33:46.252 --> 00:33:49.510
- Well, I have many more questions,

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.380
but I wanna open it up to
those of y'all in the audience.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.310
Any questions?

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.710
Yes, Julia.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.640
- [Julia] Can you talk about how you learn

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.810
during the course of your life?

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:02.812
Like they say, a young
child can learn a language,

00:34:02.812 --> 00:34:05.672
and after a certain age,
you can't really develop

00:34:05.672 --> 00:34:07.773
the same language skills.

00:34:07.773 --> 00:34:11.790
When you get older, your
brain starts to slow down.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.480
Is there truth to that?

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.160
- And repeat the question, just for folks.

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.026
- So, does your brain slow
down when you're older,

00:34:18.026 --> 00:34:22.000
and can you still learn
languages and so forth?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.430
And the answer is, yeah,
there's a little evidence

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.903
that you slow down, and part of the reason

00:34:26.903 --> 00:34:30.412
that you slow down is that you
have so many more connections

00:34:30.412 --> 00:34:33.981
that it's kind of hard to
do the search and accessing

00:34:33.981 --> 00:34:38.719
of what you're trying to
remember and learn and so forth.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:41.725
It is, there's only a certain window

00:34:41.725 --> 00:34:46.725
when you can learn a language
with an appropriate accent.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.470
But you can still learn a language.

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:50.430
In fact, there is plenty of examples,

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:55.027
there's a whole language learner ecosystem

00:34:55.027 --> 00:35:00.027
with some terrific individuals,
Benny the Irish Polyglot,

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:04.640
for example, who will
introduce you to people

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.700
who are even in their 60s and 70s

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.000
and are learning new languages.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.840
But have you ever met those kinds of,

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.360
really, they're older people,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.684
and they're kind of curmudgeons,

00:35:15.684 --> 00:35:19.812
and they think their way
is right, no matter what?

00:35:19.812 --> 00:35:24.380
You don't want to be like that person.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:28.450
So the best way to avoid
that is to keep your,

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.550
keep learning, keep your
mind open to new things,

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.410
and so I think these
are the kinds of things

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.300
you make available to
everyone in a way that,

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.660
whatever level you're
at, you can start there,

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.370
and then move upwards
in so many different...

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:48.070
I have to admit, I used your videos

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.980
to help improve my statistics course,

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.300
because you had such a great approach

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.300
for kind of weaving in different ideas

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.160
about poisson and binomial
and how they're related.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.669
And then my younger daughter said,

00:36:02.669 --> 00:36:06.750
the reason I passed calculus,
and she did very well,

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.950
was because of Kahn Academy's videos.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.560
So, you've done some great work.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.950
- Thank you, I'm
flattered, and team effort,

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.750
and you're making a brown man
blush, so congratulations.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:21.850
No, but look, I will also
admit, I also use Kahn Academy,

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.330
'cause I think my working memory

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.280
is shorter than you give
me credit for, but--

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.730
- No, no.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:33.540
- It is, everyone has
to relearn and review.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.600
And I actually met a Nobel
prize winner in economics

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.070
who said that he was using
the Kahn Academy videos

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.832
to refresh on certain parts of economics,

00:36:39.832 --> 00:36:42.820
because he had gotten so
deep in his specialty,

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.980
that when he had to review some more

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.170
of the basic ideas, it
was a good refresher.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.223
So there's no shame, no shame in that.

00:36:49.088 --> 00:36:51.650
- That's right, I think that's what I love

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.610
about the Kahn Academy approach,

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.360
is that when you have those gaps,

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.234
and everybody's got those gaps,

00:36:57.234 --> 00:37:02.070
if you are climbing
higher in that particular

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.750
subject matter, you can
go and fill in those gaps

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.700
so much more easily with the
videos that are available.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.000
- And we have thousands
of practice items, too,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.833
just my little plug.

00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:14.560
But yes, that's, they
can test their knowledge.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.800
Yes, Irene.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.830
- [Irene] Could you share more about what

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.730
are some of the concepts behind
the Learning How to Learn?

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.580
- Okay, so we've talked
about focused and diffuse,

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.160
and then there's also, and
the Pomodoro Technique,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.920
creating sets of links, of neural links,

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.872
and practicing with those
sets of neural links

00:37:34.872 --> 00:37:39.080
so that you build stronger sets.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.940
What that does, is, see what hap--

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.588
- Give an example of that.

00:37:44.588 --> 00:37:46.510
What does it mean to practice
with sets of neural links?

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:50.633
- Okay, so I'll give, so for example,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.470
when our younger daughter was
learning to back up the car,

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:59.470
she was, I mean, it was
really, really hard for her.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.400
I mean, it is hard for anybody.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.470
Do you look in the front mirror?

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.560
Do you look in the side mirrors?

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.550
Do you look behind you?

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.250
Which way do you go, and
then you're off in the ditch.

00:38:10.476 --> 00:38:13.140
So, what is happening, is
you have a very limited

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.836
working memory that can hold usually

00:38:14.836 --> 00:38:17.750
a maximum of around four items.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.220
And so, what, you're trying to hold all

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.276
these concepts at once,
and it's difficult.

00:38:23.276 --> 00:38:26.880
But once you have
learned to back up a car,

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.680
so you've learned it,
you've practiced with it,

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.290
you really know it, what you've done is

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:34.827
you've kind of parked this
new set of long-term links,

00:38:34.827 --> 00:38:38.290
or of links in your long-term memory.

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.740
And what's happening
with your working memory

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.860
is it's going, oh, I
wanna back up the car.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.350
Well, I've only got four
arms that I can work with.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.500
Well, I already know how to do this,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.440
so I'm just gonna reach
out to this subroutine

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.800
that I've parked out in long-term memory.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.200
I'll grab that, pull that
into my working memory,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.410
and oh, yes, while I'm doing that,

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.610
my other arms of my
attentional octopus are free

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.580
so I can be listening to the radio,

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.040
maybe checking to see if
my seatbelt is fastened,

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.910
and this is what happens
in a lot of learning.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:15.240
If you have practiced and created

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.820
this nice set of neural links,

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.776
then what happens is when
you're taking a test,

00:39:20.776 --> 00:39:25.339
you take the test and you
go, well, now wait a minute.

00:39:25.339 --> 00:39:29.690
Now, they're wanting me to
put a binomial distribution

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:31.489
together with a geometric,

00:39:31.489 --> 00:39:33.670
they're being a little tricky here,

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.270
but you can haul them both
up into working memory

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:41.255
because you've got these nice
sort of procedural fluency,

00:39:41.255 --> 00:39:43.430
sets of links you've already set up,

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:46.010
so you can just connect 'em in the limited

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.150
working memory that you do have.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:52.215
So the more you, experts
are, they're differentiated

00:39:52.215 --> 00:39:55.590
from normal, non-experts by the fact

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.660
that they have all sorts
of sets of neural links

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.409
that they've created and
parked in long-term memory,

00:40:02.409 --> 00:40:05.070
and they can access 'em and bring 'em

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.480
up into working memory
whenever they want to.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.970
And so, that is such an
important part of learning.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:15.240
We often just think, well,
you should conceptually

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.160
understand this idea, so
you should pull it all

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.559
into working memory and
really have it all in mind,

00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:24.960
but our working memory's
really restricted.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.610
You can't have it all in mind.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.610
So you wanna have practiced enough

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:31.020
so that important parts
of what you're learning

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.000
are already parked down
in your long-term memory.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.170
And this is, let's say you're learning

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.824
to play a musical instrument.

00:40:38.824 --> 00:40:41.391
So you learn a chord.

00:40:41.391 --> 00:40:44.240
And then you get that
parked in long-term memory.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.520
Now you connect that
up with another chord,

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.270
and maybe another, and then suddenly,

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.150
you can play part of a song.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.680
And if you practice enough,
you can just get it started

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.592
and it'll play on its own.

00:40:56.592 --> 00:40:58.490
Actually, that's another story.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.730
But, same for learning a language.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.500
If you're learning, and you practice

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.220
with a different conjugation,
verb conjugations,

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.916
it becomes very natural, very automatic,

00:41:09.916 --> 00:41:12.810
and so, really, the important,

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.400
a really important part of learning

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.400
is creating these nice sets
of long-term memory links

00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:23.655
that you can just instantly
pull into working memory

00:41:23.655 --> 00:41:25.870
whenever you need to.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.363
- So would those by kind
of the headline concepts

00:41:29.363 --> 00:41:30.350
that you talk about.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:34.150
So there's the focused and the default...

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:36.150
- Uh, default mode network.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.450
Sometimes I call it diffuse network.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.150
- So focused and diffuse.
- Right.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.350
- The Pomodoro, and then this idea of

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.560
getting things, I liked
that, kind of these

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.050
mental tentacles, the extra
arms that we can build

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.250
through practice by
reinforcing those networks

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.170
as much as we can.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.415
- Right, so working memories
are your prefrontal cortex,

00:41:55.415 --> 00:42:00.300
and it can connect in to
the long-term sets of links

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.610
that you've created there.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.333
So that's another really important thing.

00:42:03.333 --> 00:42:08.333
If, so here's, often,
we think that students

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.296
best traits are really bad traits.

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:15.161
And what I mean by this,
is sometimes we'll think,

00:42:15.161 --> 00:42:19.450
oh, well, you've got
a poor working memory.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.457
That's really bad.

00:42:20.457 --> 00:42:23.164
But actually, I am here to tell you,

00:42:23.164 --> 00:42:26.252
and it's not just self-justification,

00:42:26.252 --> 00:42:29.100
that having a poor working memory

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.490
can actually be a really good thing.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.260
And the reason for that is,

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.730
remember those four arms
of that attentional octopus

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:39.500
in your working memory,
well, some people are just,

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.070
they have really retentive
working memories.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.980
And other people are
a little more like me,

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.920
you know, they got it, it's all in my,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.200
oooo, shiny, and then
it's, something falls out.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.850
But when something falls
out, something else comes in,

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:57.153
and research has shown
that individuals that have

00:42:57.153 --> 00:43:01.839
problems with their working
memory are often very creative.

00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:06.020
And, indeed, my hero in science is a man

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.427
named Santiago Ramón y Cajal,

00:43:08.427 --> 00:43:13.000
and Cajal was a terrible
student, awful working memory,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.480
couldn't really retain stuff very easily,

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.280
was a troubled student,
got kicked out of school

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.690
several times, and ended
up winning the Nobel Prize

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:27.400
and is now considered the
father of modern neuroscience.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.400
And Cajal was once asked, how'd you do it?

00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:36.320
What's your secret that can help us?

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.320
And he said, I am no genius.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.363
And he wasn't, he really struggled

00:43:41.363 --> 00:43:43.459
to try to learn something new.

00:43:43.459 --> 00:43:48.237
But he said, I was successful
because I was persistent,

00:43:48.237 --> 00:43:53.237
and I was flexible when the
data told me I was wrong.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.120
He said, I've worked with many geniuses,

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.720
and the challenge with
geniuses is they can be

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.440
so smart that they get
used to always being right.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.632
And then, in adult life, they can tend to

00:44:06.632 --> 00:44:10.340
jump to conclusions without
having all the data,

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.910
and when they're wrong, they
aren't used to being wrong

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:15.500
so they can't change their mind.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.260
Instead, they'll use their
considerable intellect

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:23.260
to justify whatever they've been wrong at.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.730
So, I think the real point here is,

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:30.370
if you're one of those slower thinkers

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:34.070
that really kind of has to
struggle, congratulations.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:38.977
You can sometimes do things
even geniuses cannot.

00:44:38.977 --> 00:44:40.468
- And that makes you question
the whole title of genius,

00:44:40.468 --> 00:44:43.300
'cause obviously, by most definitions,

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.980
the gentleman you just spoke of would be,

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.160
but it's just not in the traditional,

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.410
you know, he can't memorize dictionaries

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:49.540
or whatever else, but clearly,

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.370
he made insights that
weren't available to others.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.633
And that flexibility is a form
of genius in and of itself.

00:44:54.633 --> 00:44:56.930
- I think so, yes.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:59.150
- Other questions, yes.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.983
- [Woman] Hi, Barb.

00:44:59.983 --> 00:45:02.690
I notice you sprinkle a
lot of humor in your videos

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.440
and I was wondering if
you could say a few words

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.350
about the role of humor in learning.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:12.350
- Oh, so, the challenge for
me is I'm not very funny,

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:17.300
so I like to have to
script it so carefully

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.870
because it just doesn't
necessarily come naturally.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:23.070
This one fifth grader
was taking our course,

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.200
and she said, I never understood

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.850
that professors could be so witty.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.753
And I'm like I scripted that witty in!

00:45:29.632 --> 00:45:31.274
(audience laughter)

00:45:31.274 --> 00:45:32.275
- [Sal] Reading a script right now.

00:45:32.275 --> 00:45:36.678
- No, I've just prepared
that very carefully.

00:45:36.678 --> 00:45:39.600
But humor--
- I was making the point

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.410
that you're overly self-deprecating.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.290
You clearly are witty without a script.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.130
But I'll let you continue your story.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:48.055
- Wow, I've heard it from the maestro.

00:45:48.055 --> 00:45:51.670
But I think that people, a lot of times

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:56.670
university professors,
it is hard to be funny.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.038
I mean, some people are funny naturally,

00:46:00.038 --> 00:46:03.270
and that's the way they are,

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:06.670
but a lot of people, it
doesn't come naturally,

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.255
and so it's not something that they,

00:46:09.255 --> 00:46:12.020
when they're teaching, they would prefer

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.850
to just teach the topic and not also have

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:16.370
to worry about humor.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.821
And you can understand that.

00:46:17.821 --> 00:46:20.800
But the online world, I think of it as

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.800
a mixture of academia with
Silicon Valley with Hollywood,

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.130
and if you're gonna be really competitive

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:31.937
in the online world, it's
not like universities,

00:46:31.937 --> 00:46:35.380
it's not like grandma's
university anymore,

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.210
it's something that you've
gotta be competitive

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.170
with everything else
that's going out there

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:41.890
if you have quality material.

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:43.575
And if you have a course that's just

00:46:43.575 --> 00:46:47.755
a staid presentation of the material

00:46:47.755 --> 00:46:50.670
versus a course that
presents the same material

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.027
but it's got some nice humor in it,

00:46:53.027 --> 00:46:56.680
people are gonna pick the
funny course every time.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.730
So I think that simply hasn't
received enough attention

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:02.560
from research and MOOC makers,

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.500
and I think it's such an, being funny,

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.163
even when it's hard, is important,

00:47:07.163 --> 00:47:09.360
because it helps people to connect

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.010
with who the instructor
is and to have more fun

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:16.390
with the material just as
the instructor is doing.

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:18.310
- The point you're bringing
is an interesting one,

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:21.510
because you're kind of
making market-based argument,

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.040
that people will be drawn
to the funnier courses,

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.280
but I do suspect that, I'm
curious if neuroscience

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.200
has even come up with anything,

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.814
or it should be an area of study,

00:47:29.814 --> 00:47:32.260
the intuition would be, if people are able

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.880
to laugh a little bit,
it de-stresses them,

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:38.180
it opens their mind up so
that they're less likely

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.877
to be stressed as the new
information's coming in,

00:47:39.877 --> 00:47:43.610
which is actually, might
lead to better learning.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:44.660
But it is interesting.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.630
Humor is such a big thing in our society,

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.870
it's such a big thing of what makes us us,

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.190
but it doesn't seem to be that studied.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:53.450
- It's not.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:56.820
There's a very good paper,
I believe from 2015,

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.590
that's a meta-analysis of humor studies.

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:04.340
And actually, it kind of
concluded the verdict is out

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.646
as to whether humor is helpful,

00:48:06.646 --> 00:48:08.476
and I think part of that is

00:48:08.476 --> 00:48:09.309
- [Sal] Sounds like a
very non-funny study.

00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:12.593
(audience laughter
Not much fun to read.

00:48:12.593 --> 00:48:15.579
- Well, actually, it had
some funny stuff in there.

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:17.130
I was impressed with it.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.570
But it, one of the things I think they,

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:24.410
they make the mistake of
looking at a particular topic

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.466
and saying, okay, we've
got five minutes of funny

00:48:26.466 --> 00:48:28.890
and five minutes of non-funny,

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.950
a little bit of humor, no humor.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:33.730
But that's the wrong way to look at humor.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:37.140
You can't dissect it into a topic.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.970
It's a course.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:42.060
Does it uplift people's
affect through the course,

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.650
and that really has not been studied.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.530
- And attitude, it's a total,

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.950
and I wonder, I know we're
going a little off-topic,

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.044
but just form an evolutionary
biology point of view,

00:48:50.044 --> 00:48:52.290
where humor and laughing, it's funny,

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.670
'cause an alien might be afraid

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:55.940
if we're baring our teeth
and we're going ha ha ha,

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.370
you know, it almost seems threatening,

00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:00.410
but we view it as a, somehow,
it's crept into who we are

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:04.190
as organisms, and it seems to be at least

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.880
some of our related organisms, at least,

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.713
seem to relate to it.

00:49:06.713 --> 00:49:08.300
But it is fascinating.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.998
- It is, I should say,
there's been a little bit

00:49:10.998 --> 00:49:14.700
of research on full courses and so forth,

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.070
but there's a lot, from a
neuroscientific perspective,

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.610
there's a lot of similarity between

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:25.770
that a-ha, creative insight, and the ah,

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.260
you're starting to laugh about something.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.070
There's a lot of neuro overlap there.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.284
So I think you're right when you say

00:49:32.284 --> 00:49:35.870
that it relaxes people,
and we tend to think

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.630
of default mode network as only arising,

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.490
like, when you take a few
minutes, a break, and so forth.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:44.045
But actually default
mode network can arise

00:49:44.045 --> 00:49:46.580
just momentarily, even when you blink.

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:50.020
In fact, martial arts experts
like to launch attacks

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.870
when you blink, not
because you're not looking,

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:57.120
so much as your brain is
temporarily disconnected

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.040
from the outside world and
you go into default mode

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.530
during that blink.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:05.790
And so then, even when you're, I think,

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:08.260
when you're learning
something and you take

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.100
that tiny a-ha, laughing break,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.080
my suspicion, and I haven't
seen research evidence

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.160
to this effect, is you
temporarily go into default mode,

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.750
and it is, it's, you're able to come back

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:24.020
and look at things with a
fresh perspective as a result.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.310
- I now understand why
my offensive charges

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.760
in the past weren't as successful.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.135
I timed them wrong.

00:50:30.135 --> 00:50:31.940
Other questions?

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.840
- [Man] I think we have some questions

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.910
over here from students.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.488
- Yeah, Tristan.

00:50:37.488 --> 00:50:41.450
- [Tristan] One of the
main problems I have

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:43.193
is that I'm not good at starting something

00:50:43.193 --> 00:50:45.488
that I don't like to do, such as math.

00:50:45.488 --> 00:50:49.900
Do you have any advice
on starting something

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.623
you just haven't been able to start before

00:50:51.623 --> 00:50:54.323
because you think it's gonna
take a really long time.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.950
- Oh, that, I so sympathize with you,

00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:00.500
because I hated math for so long.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:05.370
And the thing for me, is you hate a topic

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:08.660
until you start getting traction with it.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.077
You get better at it.

00:51:10.077 --> 00:51:13.750
And math can take a little
while to get better at.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:16.300
So I just go the completely different way.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.954
I'm like, use the Pomodoro Technique.

00:51:18.954 --> 00:51:23.160
It means a tiny bit of
something you don't like.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.530
25 minutes is, in the
greater scheme of things,

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.690
anybody can do 25 minutes.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:31.340
So when you're sitting
down, don't sit there

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.663
and go, I'm gonna do my math.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.090
And what that's doing
is activating the pain.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.150
Say, I'm sitting down to do a Pomodoro.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:42.780
And that tricks your brain so you don't

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.900
experience the pain quite so much,

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.540
and then, oh, I gotta do my 25 minutes.

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.720
Now, if you're like me, I
will sit there sometimes,

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.260
and something I don't wanna do,

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:56.540
I really work, I set the
timer, I'm on the Pomodoro,

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.960
I'm working away, and I
can't help, I look up,

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.240
'cause I'm kind of proud of
myself, how much work I've done,

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.810
and I've just done two
minutes of the Pomodoro.

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:10.810
And my mind screams, I
can't do 23 more minutes!

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.350
But, then I just do the zen thing.

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:16.010
I let that thought flow right on by,

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:18.500
and I continue working for the 25.

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.490
And then I give myself a nice reward.

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:22.750
I maybe listen to my favorite song.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.520
Go do a computer game.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.400
Whatever you want to do.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.230
And I think if you try this approach,

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.403
it might be very helpful for you.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.002
- Grishawn?

00:52:35.002 --> 00:52:37.500
- [Grishawn] Yeah, so as a
student, I don't always like

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.270
get to decide when my classes
are, when my breaks are.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.764
So how can I really implement
the Pomodoro Technique

00:52:43.764 --> 00:52:47.620
when I'm in my classes or in my goal time,

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.863
trying to get work done?

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.920
- Oh, okay, so the Pomodoro Technique

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.270
kind of presumes that you've
got 25 minutes available

00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:01.160
to do that and you block
everything else out.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.790
So what you wanna do is,

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:06.774
if you have self-directed time available,

00:53:06.774 --> 00:53:11.495
whatever that time is, just
put away all distractions,

00:53:11.495 --> 00:53:15.070
and try to work with as
much focus as you can

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:18.176
on that topic during that
time that you have available.

00:53:18.176 --> 00:53:23.176
25 minutes is great, it's
kind of optimal in a way,

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:25.536
but whatever you do have.

00:53:25.536 --> 00:53:28.600
One of the core ideas of the Pomodoro

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.575
is to not allow yourself to be distracted

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:34.690
by other things, because if,

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:38.790
let's say you're listening
to songs with music in it.

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:40.373
It can be okay to listen to music

00:53:40.373 --> 00:53:43.220
as long as it's not loud,

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.881
and as long as it doesn't
have lyrics in it.

00:53:45.881 --> 00:53:50.550
If it has someone singing, your,
part of your working memory

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.716
is gonna be following
along with those words,

00:53:52.716 --> 00:53:56.190
and if you're doing something,
writing, in writing,

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:59.300
or you're reading
something, it can interfere,

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.035
because you've got that
limited working memory.

00:54:02.035 --> 00:54:05.594
So it's a really good thing to just

00:54:05.594 --> 00:54:10.594
do the Pomodoro, or do
that period of time,

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.228
and try to block everything
out that you can.

00:54:15.228 --> 00:54:18.093
Don't be switching tasks.

00:54:18.093 --> 00:54:21.400
In other words, oh, I'm
doing this for two minutes,

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.620
oh, now I've gotta do this,

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.160
oh, and I'm doing this.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:28.040
Sometimes you'll have to
because of what's being taught,

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.815
but as much as you can,
try to keep your focus

00:54:29.815 --> 00:54:32.328
'cause the longer you're on there,

00:54:32.328 --> 00:54:36.590
the deeper, it's like you're
building these networks,

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:38.519
this connection, you're
bringing it all to mind,

00:54:38.519 --> 00:54:43.500
and you wanna just keep
that without multitasking.

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.010
'Cause if you're going to another task,

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:48.460
it's like you're ripping
out of those neurons,

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.614
and now you're going to
another set of neurons,

00:54:50.614 --> 00:54:53.840
and then you've gotta go back to that set

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.880
of original neurons and
that can be really tiring.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.450
So hopefully this might help.

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:00.770
- Is there a, we talk
about the 25 minutes.

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:02.360
We don't wanna get too prescriptive,

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.180
but is there a sense of
how long the diffuse time,

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.910
is there a ratio that
people think is good?

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.650
- This is not studied enough.

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:12.190
What I just hear anecdotally is,

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:14.320
if you have a fair bit of work to do,

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.340
then maybe five to 10
minutes, something like that.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.515
If you have trouble getting
yourself back on task

00:55:19.515 --> 00:55:24.090
after you're taking a break,
set a timer for the break.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:26.320
Some people like to have a timer

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.250
that's a ticking timer when
they're doing their Pomodoro

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:32.250
because it helps remind
them to keep on task.

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:36.400
For me, I like silence when I'm doing it.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.130
But five to 10 minutes,
and then after you've done

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:43.100
several in row, then maybe
take a 15 minute break.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.410
- 25 minutes on, five to 10 minutes off.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:47.023
It would speak to Grishawn's question,

00:55:47.023 --> 00:55:49.850
you know, we have a lab school downstairs,

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:51.970
and one of the goals
of it is to think about

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:53.560
what school should be like.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.060
And so even this technique,
and we already have

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.184
a principle around as much
active learning as possible

00:55:58.184 --> 00:56:00.715
versus passive learning, but
even that active learning,

00:56:00.715 --> 00:56:03.250
we might have to get
everyone timers or something

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:05.340
to think about how to do this,

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.450
followed by maybe 10, 15 minutes breaks

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:09.109
could be interesting.

00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:11.707
- And I had to point out, when
it comes to active learning,

00:56:11.707 --> 00:56:14.440
there's a large
meta-analysis that was done

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.990
of STEM learning, and what they found was

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:21.250
that one in three students would

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:22.720
drop out of STEM programs,

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.530
science, technology,
engineering, and math,

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:27.290
if it was just the traditionally taught.

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:29.240
But only one in five would drop out

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.750
if it was active learning.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:34.220
And part of what's
going on, I think of it,

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.010
and I think there's some truth to this,

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.520
is when you're active learning,

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.760
you're not not just
passively watching someone.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.235
You are, in some sense,
like here's your dendrite

00:56:47.235 --> 00:56:52.235
on your neuron, you are almost
pulling a dendritic spine

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:55.490
to start coming out and
making a little connection.

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:57.775
And that's what active,
that's almost, I think,

00:56:57.775 --> 00:57:01.709
and maybe studies will
show this, we'll see,

00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:05.360
but that's almost why
when you're really working

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.647
on something hard with
deliberate practice,

00:57:07.647 --> 00:57:09.423
it almost hurts.

00:57:10.637 --> 00:57:15.576
So I can relate this to why I
cannot play the piano today.

00:57:15.576 --> 00:57:19.448
So when my parents wanted
me to play the piano,

00:57:19.448 --> 00:57:24.448
so I found out, though,
I was not a dumb kid,

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:27.980
I found out that as
long as you were hearing

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:32.130
music come out, they didn't
mind whatever I was doing.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:34.626
So I learned a song,
and I played that song

00:57:34.626 --> 00:57:39.626
over and over, I put a comic book up,

00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:41.730
and I could just play
that song over and over

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:44.840
for an hour while I was
reading my comic book,

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.580
and I could read my comic book--

00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.690
- [Sal] That's actually quite impressive.

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:51.250
- If you learn a song really well,

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:54.220
but did I advance in my studies?

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:57.020
No, I didn't, because I wasn't
doing deliberate practice.

00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:59.525
I wasn't pushing myself beyond,

00:57:59.525 --> 00:58:04.525
and so that is the essence
of why deliberate practice,

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.550
kind of focusing on the harder stuff--

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:09.970
- A little bit out of your comfort zone,

00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:12.317
stretching a little bit,
zone of proximal development,

00:58:12.317 --> 00:58:14.940
Goldilocks zone, whatever people call it.

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.100
You did not do that.

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:20.010
- I did not do that, and
now I cannot play the piano.

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:21.723
- You do many other things very well.

00:58:21.723 --> 00:58:24.400
Other, maybe, we have time
for one or two more questions.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.233
Yeah?

00:58:25.233 --> 00:58:26.360
- [Woman] I had a quick question.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.660
There's this phrase,
it's like riding a bike.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.060
And something that you
haven't done for a while,

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.210
but have learned, you might be able

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:33.811
to pick that up very quickly.

00:58:33.811 --> 00:58:36.240
That doesn't seem to be
the case for all things

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.830
that one learns, so I was wondering

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:41.590
is it to do with the
learning, the activity type,

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:43.680
or what is it to actually
increase retention

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.850
of things that you've already learned?

00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:47.440
- That's a very good question.

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.240
From an evolutionary perspective,

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:52.550
we think of what we learn, it actually,

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.260
there's two different types
of things that we learn.

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:59.710
And one is like evolutionarily primary,

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.800
and that is things like learning

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.960
to speak a language and so forth.

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.084
Well, evolutionarily secondary learning

00:59:07.084 --> 00:59:09.530
are things like learning to read,

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:14.530
learning how to write, and
learning how to do math.

00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:18.494
Those come with more difficulty.

00:59:18.494 --> 00:59:22.140
And that is why, a lot of times teachers,

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:24.160
with great intent, will say,

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:28.634
oh, learning should always be as fun,

00:59:28.634 --> 00:59:33.390
in high school as it was
when you were a little kid,

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:34.820
a baby, and so forth.

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.250
Well, that's when you were learning things

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.600
that came naturally to human beings,

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.750
like speaking a language,
your native language.

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:46.599
And so, I think that when
you're learning something,

00:59:46.599 --> 00:59:50.105
it depends a lot on whether it's a primary

00:59:50.105 --> 00:59:52.629
or a secondary type of learning thing.

00:59:52.629 --> 00:59:57.355
And it also depends, there's a,

00:59:57.355 --> 00:59:59.870
it's a really complicated subject.

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:04.700
So for example, if I try
to learn Spanish now,

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.500
I learned Russian before,

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.610
and it will come out sometimes in Russian

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:12.440
whether I like it or not,
and if I have a little bit

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.500
of vodka, the Russian comes
back even more easily...

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.660
- [Sal] Vodka, in particular.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.740
- Vodka, in particular,
vodka from the freezer.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.240
Properly stored,
- We're not advocating

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.263
anything...
- It's in the freezer.

01:00:27.618 --> 01:00:29.398
(audience laughter)
That's for sure.

01:00:29.398 --> 01:00:30.949
But it is funny how the environmental cues

01:00:30.949 --> 01:00:32.203
that you had can also be helpful.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.467
- And so, unfortunately, I
think we're all out of time.

01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:38.320
But thank you so much for this.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.910
I think for everyone watching,

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:42.170
for all of us here at Khan Academy,

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:45.480
I think, personally, we're all
gonna maybe get some timers

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.510
or use some of these apps,

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:49.490
but I think it really does,
it is very tangibly useful

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:50.660
to have some of these frameworks.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.960
And I think as we think
about Khan Academy,

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.420
even the product and the experience,

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.198
as we think about how we
do practice on Khan Academy

01:00:56.198 --> 01:00:57.660
and all of these things,

01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.280
I think it will be very
valuable for us to say,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.760
maybe some of these ideas that we learned

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.976
from Professor Oakley will be,

01:01:01.976 --> 01:01:04.880
could make a big difference here.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.010
So thank you so much,

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:07.300
and for any of y'all are interested,

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.630
do a web search for
Professor Barbara Oakley.

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.130
You'll see all sorts
of interesting things.

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:14.130
(audience applause)
