00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.169
- Bladesmiths, this

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.629
I'm going to be taking
each of your dirks

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.006
and testing them by
hammering them six times

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.675
each into this oil can.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.261
Remember, this test is all
about what happens to the dirks.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.512
Phil, you're up first.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.013
You ready?
- Yes, sir.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.224
[music playing]

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.810
I'm feeling nervous because
when I see the oil drum

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.562
for the first time,
I'm thinking, well,

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.688
that could break at that point.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.107
[music playing]

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.401
[thudding]

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.575
No respect for that barrel.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.034
[laughs] That poor barrel.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:36.786
[music playing]

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.168
Well, Phil.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.669
It held up pretty well.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.921
A little bit of rolling
at the edge here.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.048
Minor, but still there.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.301
In all, the dirk
held up very well.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.136
Good job, man.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.053
Doran, you're up next.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:54.846
You ready?

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.723
Kill that thing.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.683
[thudding]

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.518
[music playing]

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.858
Die.
[music playing]

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.154
Well, Doran, you
still have a dirk.

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.864
It's not razor sharp anymore.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.574
Down here, there's
just a little rolling.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.786
But the handle is
relatively small for a dirk,

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.496
but comfortable.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.206
Overall, very well done.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:22.081
Thank you, sir.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.082
Jonathan, you're up.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.793
Ready.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.587
I'm a little worried because
you can crack the blade,

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.005
you can dull the blade.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.257
You can drive the blade
clean out of the handle.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.634
Anything can go wrong.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.136
[thudding]

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.013
[music playing]

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.858
Well, Jonathan, in
all, it held up well.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.945
But at the handle, it's a
little sharp towards the front.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.948
It's not quite as comfortable
to grip as some of the others.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.991
But I like your choice of wood.

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.619
In total, it's still
a fighting knife.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.704
Well done.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:02.705
All right, gentlemen.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.249
Next up, the sharpness test.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.251
Now, unlike the strength
test, this is all about what

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.127
your knives do to these apples.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.421
A sharp edge should
give me a good clean cut

00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:11.965
straight through those apples.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.259
A dull edge, well, we
could see the apples crack,

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.927
or you could see the skin torn.

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:16.886
Phil, you're up first.

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.221
You ready?
- Yes, sir.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.806
[music playing]

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.812
- Good job.
- Yeah.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:28.273
All right, Phil,
right off the bat,

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.941
I love the profile
of your knife.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.693
That classic shape.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.570
It cut cleanly
through these apples.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.282
But right at the edge, you can
see these little flaps of skin.

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.702
There's one section on this
knife where it took that roll.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.161
Definitely a sharp knife though.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.037
A good cutter.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.330
Nicely done.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.999
- Thank you, sir.
- Doran, you're up.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:46.791
You ready?

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.459
I am nervous.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.461
I might spent too much time
on my handle and not enough

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:51.880
time on my blade.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.673
[music playing]

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.478
You blade does have
an edge and it will cut.

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:11.316
But that one inch by 3/8
of an inch is a wedge.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.734
OK.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.569
This first apple, it's
got a cut to about here.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.446
And then the rest of
this is actually broken.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.448
For a slicing blade, it just--

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:19.741
it's fighting.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:20.867
All right, Jonathan.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:21.576
You're up.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.202
Let's do it.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.872
My blade suffered the worst
damage in the barrel stab.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.626
It has the least finished
handle on the floor.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.461
Anything could send
me home at this point.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.254
[music playing]

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.176
Nice.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:42.013
First off, you've got a
big convex edge to this,

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.431
which cut really nicely.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.351
But there are a
couple of small rolls.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:50.188
And your handle, though
shaped nicely this way,

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.065
is very lean here.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.483
But it's definitely a cutter.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:54.442
Nicely done.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:55.151
Thank you.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.277
[music playing]

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.198
Bladesmiths, the judges'
deliberation is complete

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.325
and they've made
their final decision.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.826
The bladesmith
leaving the forge is--

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.620
[music playing]

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.124
--Doran.

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:12.085
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.671
David Baker's going
to tell you why.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.172
Doran, you made a
solid knife there.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.882
And I really appreciate
the fact that you listened

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.176
and re-profiled that tip.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.845
But in the slice test
and the sharpness test,

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:26.641
your blade with that wedge
profile, just didn't cut.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.977
That's why we're letting you go.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.436
Doran, please
surrender your weapon.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.313
[music playing]

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:35.233
I'm not upset that I lost
or I didn't get to where I

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.484
need to be in this competition.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.987
These are tears of joy.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.279
This has happened.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:41.990
I just lived out a dream.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.119
And for somebody who's living
in a little town like I do,

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.078
this is worth more than gold.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.079
