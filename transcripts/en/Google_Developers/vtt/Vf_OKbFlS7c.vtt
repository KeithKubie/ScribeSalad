00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.350
JONATHAN BERI: Now, I'd like
to kick off with some easy

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.390
questions, and raise your hand
if this applies to you.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.810
Who's here that has ever
done a Hangout?

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.160
OK, in a room about 400
people, everybody

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.350
raises their hand.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.740
Now this question, I always
love to hear the answer.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.190
Who's here met somebody truly
interesting in either a

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.660
limited or a public Hangout, and
now you engage with them

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.420
on a regular basis?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.170
Raise your hand.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.620
All right.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.150
About 25% of the room.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.720
This is new.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.620
This is the next generation of
social, and it's in a Hangout.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.240
So who am I?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.890
I am Jonathan Beri, and I'm
the developer advocate for

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.720
Google+ Hangouts.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.160
And today we're going to talk
about the Hangouts, the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.020
Hangouts as a platform, and
we're going to begin by

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.270
talking about the
Hangouts story.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.980
The Hangouts story-- how an
internal tool that we were

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.576
testing with became a global
communication service.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:58.440
And we're going to go into some
demos of people building

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.530
on top of the platform and
making compelling experiences

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.210
within Hangouts.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390
And here, live onstage, I'm
actually going to build a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.540
Hangout app in front
of all of you.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.150
And to kick us off, I'd like
to introduce Amit Fulay,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.740
project manager for
Google+ Hangouts.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.630
AMIT FULAY: Thanks, Jonathan.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.470
Thank you to everyone in the
room for joining us and those

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.310
on the live stream.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.590
We have a great session
planned for you today.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.360
I want to begin by telling
you how the Hangouts

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.640
platform came about.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.250
We built Hangouts product as
part of the Google+ project,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.440
as a new way of doing social.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.550
It is live, it is face-to-face,
and you can do

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.100
things together.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.260
We wanted to mimic
the real life.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.400
This is how you socialize
in the real world.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.610
And the product has been hugely

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.910
successful since we launched.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.710
We've seen it being used
to the most amazing

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.610
and creative ways.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.419
We've seen guitar lessons
happen, cooking classes happen

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:10.690
in Hangouts.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.950
We've seen the President of the
United States hang out.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.750
Heck, we even saw guys
jumping off a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.520
plane to be in a Hangout.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.770
How cool was that
in the morning?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.970
But when we started this
project, we wanted to build

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.500
something for the users to do
when they'd get in a Hangout.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.990
So we took our existing
YouTube Player, built

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.650
an app out of it.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.830
You could come in, you can
search through videos, you can

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.080
queue them up.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.535
You can have this real social
viewing experience.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.840
Then we started looking at the
usage of Hangouts, and we

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.160
realized Hangouts
were being used

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.660
increasingly in business settings.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.870
And one of the tools you want
in that environment is the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.660
ability to collaborate over
docs and presentations.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.790
So we took our Google Docs and
created an app out of that.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.640
And we looked at the usage of
these two things, the YouTube

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.240
app and the Docs app.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.240
And we quickly realized, the
best way to take this ahead is

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.510
to create APIs around our
functionality and give it in

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.780
the hands of all of
you developers.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.755
So we launched the Google+
Hangouts platform a little

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:25.320
over three months ago.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.940
It's open to all developers.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.810
Anyone can write and
distribute an app.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.450
And as soon as we launched, we
started to see a lot of unique

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.310
activities come online.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.930
Here's an example
of a poker game.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.760
This small company acted on
a very simple but kind of

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.420
obvious insight, which is,
poker is best played when

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.790
you're face to face.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.330
So they took our API and
they built this app.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.110
You get in a Hangout, you launch
the game, you take a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.180
seat at the table, the
cards are dealt.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.040
And as you go around, whoever's
turn it is, their

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.460
live video shows up in the main
window of the Hangout.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.090
Simple.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.310
Engaging.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.830
Just like real life.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.010
Here's another example of a
start-up in San Francisco

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.136
called Scoot &amp; Doodle that
built a doodling app.

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:20.029
And it, again, turned out
to be really popular.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.940
You get in, you get
to pick a color,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.170
you're doodling together.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.310
It's the same canvas.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.090
It's synced in real time.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.200
You can play Pictionary,
teach art, learn art,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.380
and just have fun.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.850
And it turned out, as we saw
these activities come

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.450
together, users were spending
2 and 1/2 times more than

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.600
those Hangouts.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.520
That is 2 and 1/2 times more
in the app that you write.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.250
We started to see another class
of usage for our API.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.380
People were trying to enhance
live conversations.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.510
And it all started
with this slide.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.000
Now, before you laugh, that's
not a real 'stache.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.790
That's the overlay of
an image on my face.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.490
And there's a reason I put this
slide here, because I

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.420
want to tell you a story.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.290
A couple of engineers on our
team looked at the capability

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.020
that we had in the platform.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.680
We could detect faces of people
in a Hangout and their

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.830
features with pinpoint
accuracy.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.886
So they built this prototype--

00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:18.180
a silly little thing.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.255
You could put a mustache
on the face.

00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:22.070
And they're like, we should
do something with it.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.420
So I go to my marketing team,
and I said, hey, we have this

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.620
new feature in Hangouts.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.550
It's a mustache feature.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.030
And they were like, wow!

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.080
That's brilliant!

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.660
Really?

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.690
Turns out they were running
a Movember campaign.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.690
This was last November.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.300
So they turned this
on in Hangout.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.650
So we put a little button
that said Mustache.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.780
It randomly picked mustaches
and put an

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.910
overlay on people's faces.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.940
Within hours, the stream was
full with people taking

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.620
pictures of themselves with
a mustache, having fun.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.950
Again, we realized we were
on to something.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.730
Let's build this API, and we've
shipped it again as part

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.560
of the platform.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.980
We've also shipped an effects
app that you might have seen.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.870
You can see the accuracy of
overlaying images here.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.230
That's a snorkeling girl
on a live video feed.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.440
And I put that mustache just to
prove that wasn't my real

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.690
one in the previous.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.920
We saw developers take
it to another level.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.340
Here's an example of
an app built by a

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.740
developer in Germany.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.500
It's a simple app you can use
to support your team.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.710
You come up with a tagline.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.410
You pick the flag
of your country.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.402
It creates this nice little
banner at the bottom.

00:06:31.402 --> 00:06:33.550
It stays there when you're
in a Hangout.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.110
A simple little enhancement
to your live conversation.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.530
And you can dynamically
update the message.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.530
Something, again, that
can be very popular.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.490
I'm going to talk about the
third class of usage for the

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.030
Hangouts platform.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.920
And this is all about bringing
the power of Hangouts to your

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.250
existing app.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.150
Starting with SlideShare.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.610
They have an enormous amount
of content, from

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.730
presentations, to
docs, to deck.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.590
They use their API to build a
simple ability to launch a

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.750
Hangout with a pre-populated
presentation.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.550
Again, really useful.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.250
You can get in on a Hangout
together and view things.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.980
It saves you a lot of time.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.320
Another example of an
app called Cacoo.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.470
It's a small Japanese company.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.530
They had an existing Chrome
Web Store app.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.980
It's a really good diagramming
software.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.710
You can build things
together, sketches.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.020
You can buy stencils.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.360
What they did was took Hangouts
and brought it into

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.390
their app, and it really
lights up.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.230
It saves you so much roundtrip
when you're collaborating with

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.050
folks, because you can now get
in a Hangout, get in a live

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.030
synchronous conversation,
and get your work done.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.250
Another example of a Norwegian
company called Symphonical.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.460
They took their existing project
management software

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.470
and added the powers
of Hangouts to it.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.840
So as you can see, if you are
a developer thinking about

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.990
looking at this new platform,
looking at this new way of

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.170
socializing which is Google+
Hangouts, there are three ways

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.630
you can contribute.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.890
You can build activities inside
of Hangouts, you can

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.600
build enhancements for live
conversations, and most

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.030
importantly, you can bring
the power of this

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.570
face-to-face-to-face platform
to your app.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.570
I have talked a lot
about apps.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.830
Let's see some live demos.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.909
Jonathan, do you want
to start a Hangout?

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:37.749
JONATHAN BERI: Sure.

00:08:37.749 --> 00:08:39.669
And I'll invite some our
friends, Amy and

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.919
Wolf, to join us.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.050
AMIT FULAY: What I'm going to
show you is three apps that we

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.150
announced today we
are featuring.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.040
These are unique apps built
by different teams.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.080
We're going to start with
Google Art Project.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.170
And Jonathan here--

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.440
this is a live Hangout--

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.310
is joined by Amy and Wolf, who
are our colleagues somewhere

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.950
outside of Moscow, and hopefully
not on the roof.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.490
And what we're going to do here
is start looking at art

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.560
that interests us.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.700
And as you can see, Amy
likes a painting.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.830
She shares it.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.900
It shows up.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.970
Jonathan can go to that, look
at what interests other

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.330
participants in the Hangout.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.550
Now let's take it
a step further.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.610
It turns out, Wolf, in this
Hangout, is a little

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.170
bit of an art freak.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.420
Hey, Wolf, how you doing?

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.150
JONATHAN BERI: Oh, I don't
think we can hear him.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.130
JONATHAN BERI: Can
you unmute Wolf?

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.750
Hey, Wolf. how you doing?

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.055
WOLF: Hello.

00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:36.180
JONATHAN BERI: There we go.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.640
AMIT FULAY: All right.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.720
We've got a big crowd here.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.248
Do you want to show them
something cool?

00:09:40.248 --> 00:09:41.196
WOLF: Sure.

00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:42.618
Let me show you this thing.

00:09:42.618 --> 00:09:44.590
I really like it.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.840
I'm going to start a tour.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.390
OK.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.930
So this is by a Flemish
Renaissance painter who liked

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.970
to paint in sort of an
arbitrary antiquity.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.250
So even though we have a big
kind of Roman Colosseum here.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:05.542
If you look off to the left,
there is sort of a Flemish

00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:06.850
village over here.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.530
JONATHAN BERI: That's
pretty amazing--

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.580
WOLF: There's all--

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:08.850
JONATHAN BERI: Oh, sorry.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.048
Go on.

00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:11.410
WOLF: No, go ahead.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.740
JONATHAN BERI: I was going to
say, we have this exact same

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.800
print in our office and I've
never been able to see this

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.790
level of detail before.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.290
WOLF: There's also all kinds of
period construction detail.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.830
If you look at this
here, there's--

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.340
this is as far as
we can go in.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.400
There's cranes and all
kinds of things here.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.215
Oh, here is a human-powered
crane over here, with big

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.415
wheels that people can run on.

00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:34.665
It's really neat.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.060
AMIT FULAY: That is amazing.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.490
Again, you can see, this
is not screen share.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.390
This is different people from
different locations, live in a

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.060
Hangout, exploring
art together.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.310
Really engaging.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.450
Really powerful.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.550
It's actually better than real
life, in this specific case.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.610
Let's take a look at
another app here.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.260
Again, we are featuring
this today.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.710
A Story Before Bed.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.330
This is an app built
by a company called

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.080
Jackson Fish Market.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.050
And we're going to do a little
bit of role-playing

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.430
here for the demo.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.960
Jonathan is young,
you would say.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.370
But he's going to play the role
of a grandfather, and

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.610
he's going to try and grab the
attention of those two kids in

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.980
the Hangout.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.260
Now, if you've done a Hangout
with a young one, how

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.920
difficult is it to keep
them around for

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.790
more than 30 seconds?

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.890
Impossible?

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.870
I would agree.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.140
It's probably tougher than doing
a skydive in a Hangout.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.320
What we're going to try
and do is read a book.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.380
Hopefully they're engaged.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.250
So play the role, Jonathan.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.090
JONATHAN BERI: All
right, kiddies.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.080
Let's read Five Little
Monkeys.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.035
WOLF: Oh boy.

00:11:40.035 --> 00:11:41.490
AMY: OK, Grandpa.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.430
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.610
JONATHAN BERI: I'll grab it off
the bookshelf and begin.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.040
Let's open it up.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.300
Aw, there's some monkeys.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.450
"Five little monkeys jumping on
the bed, one fell off and

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.250
bumped his head."

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:54.920
AMIT FULAY: All right,
that's good.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.870
That's good.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:56.890
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.010
JONATHAN BERI: It's
a good one.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.600
AMIT FULAY: I don't
know about you--

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.410
AMY: OK, I think we're ready
to go to the end.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.690
AMIT FULAY: But if you're
actually doing these kind of

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.810
activities in a Hangout,
you'll probably

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.650
lose track of time.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.140
And that's great for
our developers.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.380
Because that's what you want,
attention of your consumers.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.960
We're going to take a look
at another example.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.120
A classic game, pool.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.500
It's always fun to challenge
someone to a game of pool.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.710
We're going to show this app
that's built by Miniclip.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.600
And let's take a look at
the experience, how

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.930
it mimics real life.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:28.500
It's going to load.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.890
We've tried it before.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.430
JONATHAN BERI: Somebody's
streaming this

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.685
talk, aren't they?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.610
AMIT FULAY: All right.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.280
There we go.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.620
Let's play pool.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:52.900

[SIMULATED SOUND OF BALLS
BEING RACKED]

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.820
JONATHAN BERI: All right.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.458
WOLF: By the way, Jonathan,
I'm really

00:12:58.458 --> 00:12:59.916
good at computer pool.

JONATHAN BERI: I
guess I'm not.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.120
You guys want to keep playing
or should we go to code?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.030
AUDIENCE: Keep playing.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.810
AMIT FULAY: Keep playing?

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.620
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.850
AMIT FULAY: We've got a bunch of
these apps in the demo and

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.020
in the Google+ Sandbox, so
you're welcome to try those.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.190
I'm going to hand
it to Jonathan.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.890
Let's switch monitors here.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.360
What I really wanted to do with
these examples and the

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.440
demos is give you a glimpse into
what's possible in this

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.410
new way of doing social.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.930
And how to make it happen?

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.750
What's the mechanics behind
writing these apps?

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.550
I'm going to hand it back to
Jonathan, who will walk you

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.415
through that.

00:13:45.415 --> 00:13:48.500
JONATHAN BERI: Great,
thank you, Amit.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.286
I want to begin with a story.

00:13:50.286 --> 00:13:53.010
A story about two developers,
Joshua and Charles.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.190
Now, Joshua and Charles really
enjoy playing role-playing

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.170
board games, and they've been
using video chat technology to

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.190
enable themselves to play with
other fans around the world.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.200
And while it lets them play
the game, it actually adds

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.070
complexity.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.690
They've got to fiddle with the
camera, make sure it's facing

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.050
the board, back at their face,
back at the board again.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.090
They've got to deal
with managing

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.910
cards, rolling the dice.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.000
It's got to be in the frame,
because you don't want to be

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.450
blamed for cheating.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.530
And it's just cumbersome.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.700
So when we launched the
developer platform last year,

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.570
they both jumped on it and
said, this is the best

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.260
platform to bring RPG
games online.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
They started developing a
framework for RPG games, and

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.030
of course they discovered each
other through Hangouts and

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.280
started collaborating.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.320
It became wildly successful,
and they decided to start a

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.660
modest Kickstarter of $8,000
to help fund for

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.445
licenses and designs.

00:14:48.445 --> 00:14:49.920
$5,000.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.720
All right.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.460
In less than 24 hours,
they met their goal.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:00.650
I think last time we checked, it
was about $19,000, $20,000

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.970
from volunteers.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.490
And about 900 folks were
investing in what is now

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.740
Tabletop Forge.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.590
This is an opportunity.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.290
This is real.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.030
Users want to have
these types of

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.730
experiences inside of Hangouts.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.450
And honestly, if you're not
building the next Tabletop

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.660
Forge, somebody else will.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.340
So let's look at what you can do
within a Hangout by talking

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.210
about some scenarios you
might want to build.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:28.660
OK.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.760
Let's say you wanted to build a
poker game, and you want it

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.280
to have a table.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.610
And you want it to show when
people are at the poker table

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.130
and when they leave.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.040
So we have APIs that let you
access information about who's

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.920
in the Hangout, the Google+
profile information, like

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.210
their picture, and actually
respond to events when they

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.820
join or leave the Hangout.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.715
So you can make that
poker table like a

00:15:51.715 --> 00:15:54.390
real life poker table.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.020
All right.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.480
Let's say you want to build a
drawing application where,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.620
when somebody in the Hangout
draws a path, it shows up in

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.230
everybody else's Hangout.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.090
And also, you want them to
have their own color and

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.440
synchronize that color.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.870
Well, we have data
channel APIs.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.930
The data channel APIs allow you
to easily synchronize app

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.720
state across everybody in the
Hangout, as well as high-speed

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.280
data, like that smooth curve
you want to see.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.540
And that's built on Google's
infrastructure, so you don't

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.230
have to build a crazy
amount of servers to

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.920
do a real-time system.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.130
Now let's say you want to go
all the way with a fun

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.980
interactive application.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.995
Say, dress up like a unicorn and
catch falling doughnuts.

00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:35.900
Well, you can do that.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.700
Now, this is an actual
application that was built in

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.500
an experiment we did last
month where we have

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.590
face-tracking overlays that
move with your facial

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.800
positions, like this unicorn
head, and the ability to

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.400
respond to movement
in real time.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.750
And that's how you can catch
those amazing doughnuts.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.810
Now that what you can do, let's
talk about how you can

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.350
do that, by looking at
the building blocks

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.780
of a Hangout app.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.180
And it all starts with the
JavaScript and HTML that you

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.690
write, which is your application
code, and the

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.839
features of a Hangout.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.710
Let's look at the JavaScript
first.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:18.430
Right here is the simplest
Hangout app ever.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.079
And you'll notice
that it's XML.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.900
And we take that XML-- it's just
boilerplate, but it forms

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.369
the foundation for
your application.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:28.150
What you really care about is
the little bit of JavaScript

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.330
wrapped in a CDATA tag.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.250
And that CDATA tag is what we
serve inside of a Hangout.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.850
And we take that and it's
iFramed into the Hangout

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.520
experience.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:43.075
We also allow you to serve an
iFrame from your own servers.

00:17:43.075 --> 00:17:44.710
Let me repeat that.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.630
We allow you to serve an iFrame
from your own servers

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:48.990
inside of a Hangout app.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.370
If you only take away one thing
from this entire talk

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.560
about the technical implications
of a Hangout app,

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.510
it's that anything you
can do in an iFrame,

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.920
you can do in a Hangout.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.890
Anything you can do
in an iFrame,

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.500
you can do in a Hangout.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.330
That means you can use the
technologies that you're

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.270
comfortable with and the
environment you like to build

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.330
in to develop Hangout apps.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.010
This is probably my most
favorite feature of Hangout

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.410
app development.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.460
So that means you can use the
server-side technologies you

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.780
like to use, whether it be
Python on App Engine, Ruby on

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.840
Rails-- no JS.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.770
You can use the database
technologies

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.940
that scale for you.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.810
MySQL, NoSQL, YourSQL,
HerSQL--

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.570
anything under the sun.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.340
And of course, you can use the
environments and the IDEs that

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.720
work best for you.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.190
So if you have an existing game
with aliens and laser

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.340
blasters, you can easily bring
that into Hangout.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.590
And if you have a new game that
you want to build, a new

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.485
application, it's easy to
migrate it onto the Hangout

00:18:44.485 --> 00:18:45.735
apps platform.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.140
Now let's go over the features
of a Hangout, which is

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.060
encapsulated in the
Hangout JS.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.850
I mentioned that everything
is a JavaScript.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.270
So we have a single JavaScript
file that you include inside

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.030
your application, and it gives
you access to all the rich

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.460
features of a Hangout that you
can include inside your

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.360
application.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.110
Things like participant
information--

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.920
so who was at that
poker table?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.530
The data channels, the
high-speed smooth curve of

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.030
that drawing.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.310
Other things, like
the audio-video

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.300
effects, the overlays.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.650
And other metadata about the
Hangout, like the Hangout ID

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.890
and the URL.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.170
And with this one simple
JavaScript include, you have

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.600
the power of Hangouts within
your application.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.150
Great.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.910
It's now time to show
you how easy it is.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.910
On this stage, you'll probably
hear other people saying that

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.230
it's easy to build something
on Google.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.060
But I have the luxury that I can
actually code it live here

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.190
in front of all of you
in the live stream.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.940
Quick question--

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.190
who's played Guess the Pastry?

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.030
OK, I guess I'm the
only one who codes

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.560
while they're hungry.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.900
So I'm going to build a very
simple application.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.410
All it's going to do is
show a picture of a

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.830
pastry to the audience--

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.280
to the players, rather--

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.980
they have to guess, and
they get a prize.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.600
So what I'm going to do is
first show who's playing,

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.290
using the API, and list all the

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.740
participants in the Hangout.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.110
Then I'm going to take a guess
and validate whether

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.240
it's true or not.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.790
And the winners will get
a web badge of honor.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.390
And by web badge of
honor, I mean--

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.450
yeah, the Nyan Cat.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.150
All right.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.570
Let's get started.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.850
And if you guys notice any
syntax errors or spelling

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.120
mistakes, please feel free to
shout it out, because this is

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.350
partly collaborative.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.480
Now, to build on the Google+
platform, or any platform at

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.750
Google, you have to
first start at the

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.020
Google Developer Console.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.630
That's where you create a new
project and enable the

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.730
services you want to integrate
with that project.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.350
So I'm going to go ahead and
create a new project.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.310
Let's go head and create.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.170
I'm going to call this
Guess the Pastry.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:54.410
And once it's finished loading,
we now have a new

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.890
project called Guess
the Pastry.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.870
You'll see here, there's a bunch
of Google services that

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:58.690
you can use.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.550
We're just interested
in Hangouts today.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.590
So to enable that service
within this project, I

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.560
go from Off to On.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.090
Now, scrolling up, you may have
caught that there's a now

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.350
Hangout tab.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.270
And that is the most
important tab for

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.210
developing this Hangout.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.580
And there's a bunch
of stuff here.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.250
There's a place to
do descriptions,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.570
icons, privacy policy.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.670
But the most important thing is
you tell Google where your

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.990
XML, where your application
is hosted.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.950
It's got to be publicly hosted,
so I'm going to throw

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.110
it up on an app engine, and
as we develop we can

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.540
move on from there.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:42.510
I actually have a starter
project kicked off with some

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.070
boilerplate.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.810
And we're going to go ahead and
publish this to the App

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.570
Engine right now, and we'll
see what this looks like.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:57.180
So I go back to our hosting
service, choose that file,

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.918
it's on the--

00:21:58.918 --> 00:22:00.230
gonna cheat there.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.220
So I have a URL for this XML.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.170
It's now publicly available.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.710
Let's verify that is the case.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.145
And this is what
the Application

00:22:09.145 --> 00:22:10.090
Store will look like.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.430
But it's not a Hangout
app yet until I

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.090
publish it to my project.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:16.990
Great.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:21.250
So once I save it, there's a URL
to the Developer Sandbox.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.120
I click this off.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.900
It's firing up a Hangout.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.990
This is the Developer
Sandbox environment.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.070
It's not publicly available, so
you can-- don't worry about

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.060
while you're developing to
expose it to other users.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:41.050
Now I'm in here, and we
have our application.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:47.770
So there's the Guess the Pastry,
and the picture and

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.500
the form field.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.660
So now let's go ahead and add
some-- let's look at the code

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.780
that we had in the boilerplate
before we begin adding some

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.030
functionality.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.310
So you'll recognize this
XML from earlier.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.770
It's just the boilerplate.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.325
And I have some empty functions
and some functions

00:23:05.325 --> 00:23:07.680
that I've started already.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.880
So let's look at the HTML
part, because that's the

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.710
simplest of what you
can see now.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.310
Here we have a header tag, an
image, which is the pastry,

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.330
and some form fields.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.520
And that's really about it.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.995
The first piece of the API
is already started.

00:23:22.995 --> 00:23:25.530
And what we want to do is wait
for the API to be initialized.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.450
And there's a simple event
listener, which is the

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.580
hangout.onApiReady.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.520
And you notice that everything
is prefixed with gapi.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.920
So everything is namespaced,
it's logical, and the

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.480
documentation matches that.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.350
So it's really easy to
start developing.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:46.210
Let's go ahead and start
our first API call.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.040
I'm actually going to do this
directly within the Hangout,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.650
because the beauty of building
JavaScript applications is you

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.480
can test it while
it's running.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.510
And the Chrome Developer Console
has some great tools

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.192
to develop with.

00:23:59.192 --> 00:24:00.810
Let's clear that out.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:01.950
So all I have to do
is make sure I'm

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.920
in the Hangout itself.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.990
And I can start calling
something in the

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.350
gapi.hangout namespace.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.730
Right?

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:14.130
Ooh, I gotta spell
correctly first.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.130
So the first thing I want to
do is show who is in the

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.610
Hangout, so what I'm going
to do is call the

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:21.800
getParticipants method.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.210
And what that'll do is return
an array of all the

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.940
participants in the Hangout.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.310
You'll notice there's only
one, which is me.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.270
So there should only
be one entry.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:35.200
Let's call it and see
what it returns.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.780
This is an array of objects.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.880
And you can see, if I look into
the person, that's me.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.790
Jon Beri.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.120
And so we're going to use that
function right now to get the

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.150
list of participants and
display it inside the

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.120
application.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.160
So going back to the code, what
I want to do is have this

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.600
function called
showParticipants.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.190
And I'm going to
do var party =

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.440
gapi.hangout.getParticipants.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.370
So I got that object.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.880
Next we're going to just
loop through it

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.230
and set it as a string.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:32.080
So var display +=, let's do
a People and do an

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.330
unordered list.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.660
And now let's do party.forEach
function, let's do player.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.730
So now we're going to iterate
through that array.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:57.770
And what I want to do is display
an  element for

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.660
each participant.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:09.145
And we're just going
to do , and--

00:26:09.145 --> 00:26:10.610
yeah, let's do it this way.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.280
We'll do--

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.260
break it up.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:19.096
Display += and I want to do
player.Person.displayName.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.780
And we're going to close
up that element.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.570
OK, so we're listing everybody
who's in the Hangout.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:47.320
Let's just do a simple
display.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.650
Close up the URL.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.500
It's hard to type on
a Windows machine.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.690
And then, so you've
closed that up.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:04.690
And what we're going to do is
insert that into an element

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:10.500
that we have stored, which
is just the div =

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.750
document.querySelector.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.745
And then I want to
do #participants.

00:27:18.745 --> 00:27:28.080
So I'm grabbing this simple
display  and setting its

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.850
inner HTML to--

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.790
OK, this is display.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.040
Right?

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.820
And that should iterate and
spit out everything

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.500
we want it to do.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.830
So let's go back to this
hosting device.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.590
I'm going to choose to make sure
that I got the right one.

00:27:55.034 --> 00:27:56.510
Great.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.210
Open.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.700
Re-upload.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.690
And we should now see
it as we refresh.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.100
OK.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.450
So nothing is being displayed.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.380
That's because we haven't
called that method.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.300
So what I'm going to
do is manually

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.210
call that method again.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:14.520
Oh, there's a token error.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.030
Ooh.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.280
Did anybody catch that?

00:28:24.432 --> 00:28:25.380
AUDIENCE: 19.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.350
JONATHAN BERI: 19.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.630
JONATHAN BERI: Oh, good call.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.000
Thanks.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.220
So we upload again.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.765
I told you this gets
collaborative after a while.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:41.200
Cool.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.530
No syntax error, and now
it's being displayed.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.630
So what we want to do is call
that when the application

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.940
starts and every time
somebody joins.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.010
So the next thing we'll
do is register--

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:54.780
we've actually already had
this registered, so the

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.390
gapi.hangout.onParticipant is
the first event that we want

00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:59.210
to register for.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.900
And I've done something
really simple here.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.760
All I've done was call the
showParticipant again, so it

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.640
just keeps on looping
and checking the

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.720
gapi.getParticipants object
and redisplaying it.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.040
It's clean.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.250
It's not very efficient, but
it gets the point across.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.650
So now the guess piece.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.180
When somebody makes a guess,
we actually call the

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.100
JavaScript function directly
from the onclick handler.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.670
So I'm going to go fill
up that guess.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:31.990
And for this example, all I want
to do is just store the

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:33.280
fact that they've guessed.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.980
I'm not going to do anything
fancy with the shared-state

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.310
functionality.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:42.130
And that's all I'm going
to do, is call the

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.370
shared-state API.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.980
And the shared-state API is a
key value pair of strings,

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.740
very easy to use, and it's
guaranteed across all

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.700
participants.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.720
So the call is
gapi.hangout.data--

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.840
again, another namespace--

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.090
.setValue.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.030
And the key we're going to use
is the actual person's ID, the

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.165
Hangout ID.

00:30:08.165 --> 00:30:10.290
And so there's a method
for that too, which is

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.540
gapi.hangout.getParticipants.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.270
Sorry, not the easiest
word to spell.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.520
By ID.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.570
And that's going to be the
key to our key value.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.080
And then the value will just
be a string that's true.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.170
JONATHAN BERI: OK, yeah.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.670
Thanks, Gerwin.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.426
Another save by Gerwin.

00:30:38.426 --> 00:30:39.380
It's very simple.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.910
This is just going to
push that value.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.420
And we actually look that up.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.740
So anybody in a Hangout from the
API can call and check any

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.920
value in the shared state,
which is very useful,

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.530
especially with this
asynchronous-type application.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.610
And the call is, as you
can guess, getValue.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:01.070
So what I'll do is, I'll add a
getValue for the hasGuessed

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:05.450
method, and we can use that
by passing in the ID from

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.440
somewhere and retrieving it.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.780
Now it's just
gapi.hangout.data.getValue.

00:31:17.974 --> 00:31:21.200
And it's going to be the ID.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.060
But to actually check what the
value is, we're using strings.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.620
And so I actually
have to check if

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.070
that's a valid string.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.270
It's not a true, like as
a Boolean operator.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.600
So we'll just do a simple
if-else statement, right?

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.066
It's saying if--

00:31:37.066 --> 00:31:42.850
and I gotta attach this to
a var guessed equals.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:50.916
So if ( guessed === "true"),
we're just

00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:52.166
going to return true.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:00.710
Else, return false.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.420
This is a simple check.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:08.100
So now let's go ahead
and save this.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.610
Go back to the hosting
and push it to

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:14.100
the app engine server.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.550
OK, so it's updated.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.800
Refresh the application.

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:26.440
And put in any string, right?

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.990
OK.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.260
Now to verify that actually
worked, because we're not

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:36.220
responding to that function,
let's go ahead and call

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.470
gapi.hangout.data.getState.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.610
And what this will do is just
dump the entire state object,

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:51.600
the entire collection
of key in value.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.170
And you can see that this is
actually my participant ID

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.550
that I just guessed with, and
the value I said was true.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.875
So this is actually being
saved and persisted.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.300
Now for the last piece is the
web badge of honor, and that's

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.230
the Nyan Cat.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.380
And this is using
our av.effects.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.490
And we're going to do
a very simple thing.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.470
We're just going to display a
static image of a Nyan Cat if

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:16.830
I guess correctly, and then from
there, I can position it.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:20.640
But we're just going to render
it straight on the video feed.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.310
So I've actually started
this here.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.570
Well, I've actually already
completed this here, but let's

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.330
walk through it.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.670
So what we're going to do is
we're going to grab the value

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:33.060
of the text box, and that's--

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.840
just ID it as guess and
check for the answer.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.260
I have an answer variable
stored up here, and the

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.350
correct answer is 'nom.' OK.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.630
Not exactly a pastry, but
it's easy and fast.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.130
And then what we're going to
do is, again, call our

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:53.770
gapi.hangout object and
do an av.effects and

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.140
create an image resource.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.690
And when you create an image
resource, we just pass in a

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:01.790
URL of a publicly-accessible
image, and that

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.636
loads it into memory.

00:34:03.636 --> 00:34:04.880
It's not being displayed.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.650
It's not being shown, but it's
available for us to access.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:13.139
So all we have to do at that
point is set showOverlay.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:17.580
And showOverlay will, by
default, render that image and

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.350
center it at full size
on the video feed.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.630
We can also pass in
configuration information,

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.460
like scaling it, and
offsetting it,

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.300
and positioning it.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.480
But for this demo, we just
want to have this.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:36.840
And what we'll do is, whenever
they guess we'll call

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.330
guessedCorrectly.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.010
And that will look up to verify
that they actually

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.449
guessed correctly, and
if it does work, it

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.699
should show an overlay.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:54.040
Let's re-upload it to the app
engine server, refresh this

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:59.570
and make sure I can be
in frame, reset,

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.600
and see if this works.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:05.640
There we go.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.280
Nyan Cat.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.880
So I guessed right.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.340
That's it for this
application.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.020
As you can see, it's
simple but it's

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.600
actually very powerful.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.650
I've touched on a bunch of the
lowest-level APIs that are

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.510
sort of core to what
you want to do.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.570
And we actually have
a functioning app

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.160
in, what, 10 minutes?

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.820
So imagine, if you want to build
your application, how

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.180
quickly you would get it up and
running and focusing on

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.760
building a fun, more powerful
user experience.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.200
Now this was just very
high-level, but we actually

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.190
have a Code Lab that takes a
deep dive in later today.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.020
That looks like it's going
to be a space-themed one.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.580
So definitely check it out.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.220
The Code Lab link is here,
for those who are

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.480
watching on live stream.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.260
And it's going to go from
everything from walking you to

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.710
getting you up and running
and advanced

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.360
techniques on debugging.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.440
Definitely check it out.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.740
Now, Google's built several
applications.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.600
You saw some of them today.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.500
And we've worked with many other
partners who've launched

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.320
initially, and more have
come out today.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.380
And we've learned a lot.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.260
You know, when you build a
platform, it's not always easy

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.190
to see the vision in the future
of what people are

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.450
going to do with it.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.210
So we have a lot of lessons
learned from building these

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.960
applications, and we want to
pass them onto you so when you

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:27.270
get started, you can build the
best user experience that you

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.300
can within a Hangout app.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:34.150
So the first insight we have,
which may seem obvious, is put

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.390
people first.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.410
You're building a social
application, a multi-user

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.500
social application.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.400
So that means people are doing
things within your

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.720
application.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.260
Things are flying around
the screen.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.610
So you need to make sure that
you identify who's doing what

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.740
within the context of
the application.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.780
So use the Google+ profile
picture if you can.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.100
Attach overlays or colorize, and
somehow distinguish users

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.560
as they're interacting to make
it easier for everybody else

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.520
to know who's doing the turn.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.870
The next insight we
have is social

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.630
is about being together.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:12.030
From the fundamental level of
your application design, it

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.660
should be collaborative
and synchronous.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.230
See, Hangouts are not
really interesting

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.830
when you're by yourself.

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:19.220
You have a mirror for that.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.360
And when you go to two people
or even three people, it's

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.410
just a little bit better
than a video chat.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.000
But it gets magical when
you get to five, ten.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.480
Or public Hangouts-- they can
go to hundreds and hundreds.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.950
So make sure that everything
you do is collaborative and

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.030
synchronous.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.430
And make the games
really sticky.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.350
Users will join when you
least expect it.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.330
Like this poor monkey who didn't
see this other one

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.140
flying at him, the way that
people find, discover, and

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.100
join Hangouts is through the
stream, which is real-time,

00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.010
notifications, and
mobile updates.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:03.900
So people will be joining
Hangouts at random intervals.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.320
There won't be a start time and
an end time, unless you do

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.340
events, and that might be
a little bit better.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.030
But if you're doing an
application, or let's say a

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.090
game, it can interrupt
the flow.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:19.100
So we've built into the system
many callbacks that trigger

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.550
whenever events happen, so you
can make your applications

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:24.580
respond correctly when
somebody joins.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.650
So there are a ton of
Participant callbacks.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.365
And use them liberally
and intelligently.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.820
The next thing that we learned
was that playing alongside

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.780
friends can be fun, too.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.920
The classic use case of a
Hangout app is having 10

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.500
people, all in a room at
the same time, using an

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.805
application together.

00:38:43.805 --> 00:38:46.320
But there's different ways
you can group things.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.860
If you saw, in the pool app,
we were playing two-on-two.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.920
In that application, you can
actually play multiple games

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.900
of two-on-two.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.830
And what's that like?

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.000
That's like real life.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.570
That's like a pool hall, where
you have multiple games with

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.300
people who can trash-talk to
each other, can comment on

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.100
technique, or maybe learn
from each other.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.760
There's even other ways
of dividing it, right?

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.360
You could have a semi-private
mode, where you only see part

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.730
of your world and everybody else
has a shared experience.

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.420
Or something that we have not
seen yet, which I'm hoping you

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.030
guys come up with, which
is the MMO style.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.720
So you could have n-many
Hangouts, all participating in

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.660
the same shared space and
interacting together.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.830
I think that's really
interesting and compelling.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.050
So think about different ways
you can group users within

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.300
your application.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.040
And make sure that you react.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.440
Make sure you react
immediately and

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.820
respond in real time.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.715
Like this poor guy, he wasn't
following the ball and got hit

00:39:40.715 --> 00:39:42.810
in the face.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:46.370
Similar to the way that
participants join a Hangout,

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:48.310
they interact with your
application in real time.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:52.100
We have data channels, and we
encourage the interactivity

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.730
and responsiveness of
your application.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.420
So you have to make sure that
you respond to things that are

00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.650
happening, because the user
experience will be broken if

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:03.840
there's delays or if the
flow is not great.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.340
So make sure you take advantage
of these high-speed

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.370
Google-powered data channels
to synchronize your

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:10.270
applications.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.770
And you saw it was quick
and easy to implement.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.650
And now, back to Amit.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:19.550
AMIT FULAY: Thanks, Jonathan.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.820
I think that was great.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.720
So in the last 45 minutes, we've
looked at how we started

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.590
with building a platform with
this Hangouts product.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.900
We're still early.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.880
We're learning, and we're always
looking for feedback

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.310
from you guys.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:36.720
We looked at some demos to give
you a sense of what's

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.340
possible, and you saw Jonathan
take you through the details

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.270
of what it takes to
build an app.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:47.360
I think the road ahead of us,
for all of us in this room, is

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.230
full of possibilities.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.140
I think we have, for the first
time, a way to reimagine the

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:58.390
web with live synchronous
conversations and activities.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.910
This wasn't possible
a few years ago.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:04.170
This was certainly not possible
at this scale and

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.510
free of cost.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.890
So I encourage all of you to
take a look at what we've

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.930
built and join us
in the journey.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.760
With that, here's
some pointers to

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.960
how can you get started.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:20.550
We also have a Code Lab later
today at 4 o'clock.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.250
Following the session, we also
have a fireside chat with some

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:26.390
more members of the
Hangouts team.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:28.970
We will talk about aspects
of our product

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:30.310
beyond the app platform.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:33.630
We'll talk about Hangouts On
Air, mobile, and where we're

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:39.410
going in the future with this
communications platform.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:42.530
With that, I think we'll
take questions.

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.926
Thanks for being patient.

00:41:43.926 --> 00:41:50.165
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:50.165 --> 00:41:53.633
AMIT FULAY: We've got two mics
on the sides, if you want to

00:41:53.633 --> 00:41:55.480
ask a question.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.000
JONATHAN BERI: And speak loudly
so the people on video

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.250
can hear you.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.410
AUDIENCE: Are there persistent
Hangouts, or can you

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:11.110
programmatically create an
instance of a Hangout?

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.115
AMIT FULAY: Persistent, as
in, they live forever?

00:42:13.115 --> 00:42:15.986
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like you don't
need a person to host it.

00:42:15.986 --> 00:42:18.780
It's just there and people
could show up.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.040
AMIT FULAY: Yeah, we have a
notion of named Hangouts,

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.280
where you have a fixed URL.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.370
And we can use that in
the meetings context.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.670
We had this as part of what we
call as Hangouts With Extras,

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:34.590
and we folded it into one
product, Hangouts.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.520
And we're going to introduce
it pretty soon, with

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.420
integration with Calendar
and stuff.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.050
So you can create a meeting,
have a fixed URL, and anybody

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.010
can drop in at any time.

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:46.765
JONATHAN BERI: And to add to
that, you mentioned how could

00:42:46.765 --> 00:42:48.060
you programmatically
create Hangouts?

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.850
Well, we don't have, let's
say, a REST-based API to

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.740
generate Hangouts, but we do
have this notion of the

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.800
Hangout button.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.750
And the Hangout button
is pretty awesome.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.310
It's a simple link you
add to your website.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:58.490
We have an image for that.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.000
And it could do three things.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.490
One, it could launch a brand new
Hangout from your site, or

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.310
from an ad, or from anywhere
else in the web.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.640
It can launch a Hangout
with an app preloaded.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.320
And it can launch a new Hangout
with an app preloaded,

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.760
plus you can pass in
initialization data.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.220
So for example, if you're a
publisher and you have a

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.560
football team's page, you can
actually build a custom

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.266
application using the Hangout
apps platform and have a

00:43:24.266 --> 00:43:26.620
button, say, Talk About
the Broncos.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.950
And that will launch a new
Hangout with your app

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.630
preloaded, and it'll say, hey,
this guy was on the Broncos

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.580
page, and actually show that
state of the Broncos app.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.750
I think we had a question
and they sat down.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.510
OK, great.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.620
AMIT FULAY: And for those of you
leaving the room, if you

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.620
liked this session, there's
those +1 cards.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.520
Put those in the box.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.206
If you didn't, you can
just walk out.

00:43:52.206 --> 00:43:56.100
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.730
AUDIENCE: So we set up a few
MacBook Pros, maybe four

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:05.340
MacBook Pros, to capture
a presenter at a gTalk.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.240
So we wanted to basically
broadcast different dimensions

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.280
of the speakers, standing up,
using the whiteboard, and just

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.910
capture the volume.

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:16.750
And we noticed that the
MacBooks, they all seemed to

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.270
timeout after a period
of time.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:22.260
Not the screensaver, but it
seemed like the Hangout.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.910
And of course, we just
left them on some

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:26.050
seats just to stream.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.490
So I'm wondering, is there a
stay-alive command that you

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:33.060
can pipe through or some sort
of scripting you can do to

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.300
kind of ping the Hangout if
you're streaming, without

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.540
somebody to rock the laptop?

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:40.950
AMIT FULAY: Yeah.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.550
So I think what you're referring
to is the timeout

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.330
that we have built in.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.610
After 90 minutes, if you're
inactive Hangouts,

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:49.850
we time those out.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:52.870
And we built that provision in
to kind of safeguard against

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:57.200
abuse and using it for scenarios
that we didn't want.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.950
But that's great feedback, and
we're actively looking on how

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.540
to change that configuration.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.550
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.680
AUDIENCE: Can you create Hangout
apps on Android?

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.580
AMIT FULAY: So that's
a big question.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:16.030
We don't have support for
Hangout apps on the phone, but

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.170
we're looking at an option
in the coming days.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:20.220
And once we have something to
announce, you'll hear it.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.990
AUDIENCE: Will you be making
the code that you were just

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.080
putting up available?

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:33.540
JONATHAN BERI: So, yes.

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.760
So the question was, will I be
making the code available.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.130
Definitely.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.460
It's actually publicly available
now, because I was

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.430
pushing it live to production.

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:43.420
AMIT FULAY: Google
Guess the Pastry.

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.240
JONATHAN BERI: And I'll just--

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.980
I'll post it on my
Google+ stream.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.980
If you're not following me, you
probably should, if you're

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.820
interested in Hangouts.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:49.800
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.390
JONATHAN BERI: And this is
actually just a more advanced

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:54.830
version of some of
our samples.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:57.400
So if you saw the link up there,
that's our developer

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.300
site for everything to do with
Hangout apps for developers.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:05.060
And in there, we have about 10
different samples that go from

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.440
very basic, you know, this
is the boilerplate to get

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.450
started, to making fun overlays
and using the facial

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.480
movement response API.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.440
So definitely check those out.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.450
And follow my stream.

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:19.845
AUDIENCE: Can you into include
Flash as part of the Google

00:46:19.845 --> 00:46:21.560
Hangout apps?

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.450
Like a Flash player or
a Flash application?

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.400
JONATHAN BERI: That it's
a great question.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.550
Actually, what you saw today--

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.050
AMIT FULAY: We have
had Flash games.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.220
JONATHAN BERI: The pool game was
actually built in Flash.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.560
So because you can serve it from
your own iFrame, because

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.840
you can figure out the cross
domain and all those issues

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.915
that are kind of hard without
an iFrame, you can serve a

00:46:40.915 --> 00:46:42.165
Flash game, or Flash player.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.670
AUDIENCE: Can you say a little
bit about what your plans are

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.065
with higher resolution and
higher frame-rate video, and

00:46:49.065 --> 00:46:52.330
where that's going over time?

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.070
AMIT FULAY: I think the best
place to ask that question is

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:55.660
in the next fireside chat.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.044
I think those folks who work on
that aspect might be able

00:46:58.044 --> 00:46:59.294
to answer that.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.240
Any other questions?

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.490
Comments?

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.900
JONATHAN BERI: I will say that
some of those apps that we

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.620
demoed are turned on in
production already.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.360
So they're in the Featured
section of Hangouts.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.080
So you can give them
a try right now.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.340
Actually, in the front row,
some of our community

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.830
developers are here, so if you
have questions that you didn't

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:27.050
feel like asking on camera,
you can ask these guys,

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:28.300
because they're pretty
awesome.

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:35.150
AUDIENCE: This question might be
more for the fireside chat,

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.950
but I'll ask it anyway.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:43.080
Are there any plans to unify
Hangouts, Google Chat,

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.560
Messenger in the near future?

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.920
AMIT FULAY: That's
a great question.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.090
I think that's a problem we're
thinking about, and you'll

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.980
hear more in the next session.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.840
JONATHAN BERI: And we've already
made some inroads on

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.330
that, right?

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:59.550
So when somebody invites you
to hang out, we send an IM.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.110
And there's other touch
points where you

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:02.230
can launch a Hangout.

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:06.460
So definitely something
we're looking into.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.820
AUDIENCE: If you wrote a great
app and you want to promote

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.406
it, what's--

00:48:11.406 --> 00:48:18.490
are those apps also
in the apps list?

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:18.700
AMIT FULAY: Yeah.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.685
So the apps that are visible
within a Hangout on the apps

00:48:21.685 --> 00:48:25.180
list, those are the
featured apps.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.740
Think of those as Staff Picks or
Editors' Picks that we have

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.330
on Chrome App Store and
Android Market.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:33.120
So we have a team that carefully
goes through a bunch

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.170
of apps and promotes those.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:38.270
And we look at that all the
time, so if we find something

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:41.130
compelling, we promote those.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.810
But having said that, I think
there's various ways for you

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.210
to distribute apps widely.

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:47.600
You can have--

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.760
Jonathan talked about the +
Hangout button, where you can

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.240
embed a button with
an app launcher.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.520
You can do that on the Google+,
on your + page.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.870
You can do it on your
own website.

00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:02.990
Once you have a Hangout app
that's loaded in, that sticks

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:04.280
within your recent list.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.240
So we kind of remember
all the things that

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.290
you've played with.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.470
It's there for easy recall.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:10.190
And you can share that
app with other

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:12.286
folks within a Hangout.

00:49:12.286 --> 00:49:15.450
AUDIENCE: How about the
Chrome Web Store?

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:16.630
AMIT FULAY: What about
Chrome Web Store?

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.940
So are you referring to
distributing apps through

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:19.850
Chrome Web Store?

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:20.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:23.837
If you have a Hangout app you
want to put it out on Web

00:49:23.837 --> 00:49:24.580
Store, is it--?

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.195
AMIT FULAY: So that's, again,
something we're looking at.

00:49:26.195 --> 00:49:29.160
We have nothing to announce
right now.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.420
Hey, [? Mart ?].

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.960
AUDIENCE: What about Flash and
GIF support as an overlay?

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.800
JONATHAN BERI: Ooh, Flash--

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.190
so Flash as an overlay and
GIF as an overlay.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.396
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:42.030
Right now, you can only
add PNGs and JPGs.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:43.930
JONATHAN BERI: And we also
support data URIs.

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:44.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.452
JONATHAN BERI: So the data URI
was recently introduced to add

00:49:47.452 --> 00:49:48.702
a lot more flexibility.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.960
I think people are trying to
animate with overlays now.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.310
I think the first thing we're
going to do is try to support

00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:58.670
that better.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.850
Make the ability to switch on
and off overlays first before

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:03.130
we look to other formats.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:06.470
I'm not quite sure Flash
would ever make sense.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.690
It may be just not a capability
we want to explore.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.120
But that's great feedback
around the GIFs.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.660
AUDIENCE: Another question is,
when you create an overlay or

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.000
an image resource, you
allocate memory.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.360
And there's still some kind of
memory leak, because the

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.430
resources you allocate
never get released.

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:27.870
So if you created a lot of
resources, at some point you

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:28.730
exceed your memory.

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:32.810
So is there a fix in the works,
or something you work

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.950
on, that this will
be sorted out?

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:36.244
JONATHAN BERI: Yes.

00:50:36.244 --> 00:50:36.671
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:50:36.671 --> 00:50:38.220
JONATHAN BERI: That was
the short answer.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.510
The long answer,
actually, tails

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.590
into what I just responded.

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:43.970
By looking at how people are
using the overlays and really

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:49.160
pushing the limits, we've seen
500 image resources of decent

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.290
quality being able to run
on a standard machine.

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.820
Not even a MacBook Pro.

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.660
But obviously, it varies.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.540
So we're going to look into
how we can better help you

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.620
manage those resources, how
the plug-in can manage the

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.230
resources for you, and how you
can really get awesome types

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:05.695
of animations within
the overlays.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.900
AMIT FULAY: We'll
take a question.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.420
AUDIENCE: So I'm not sure if
this is an Events question or

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.830
a Hangouts question, so I'm
posing it in both places.

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:20.220
First of all, tying Hangouts
to Events is huge, for us,

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.090
especially.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:21.670
It's awesome.

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:22.820
Thank you so much.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.680
I know I've been annoying
people with that

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.330
question for a while.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.880
What we'd like to do is we'd
like to tie the end of the

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.170
Event to the end of the Hangout,
if that's possible.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.720
So right now, we run games.

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.120
We run the Tabletop Forge, and
you never know how long the

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.990
game is going to go.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:39.850
Sometimes it'll go two
hours, and sometimes

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:41.090
it goes five hours.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.250
It kind of goes until
it's resolved

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:44.230
itself for the evening.

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:46.090
It would be really nice
if the Event just

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.460
spanned that period.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:53.210
Because initially people will
just add two hours to whatever

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.460
they think it's going to be in
order for it not to run out

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.030
before the game ends.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.320
Is that in the works
or on the table?

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.290
Or should I go talk to the
Events people again?

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:06.500
AMIT FULAY: Yeah, so I don't
know about the definite plans,

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.390
but we have some folks I can
connect you with who are

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:11.090
working on integration with
Events, and we can take a look

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:11.760
at this feedback.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.672
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:52:12.672 --> 00:52:13.700
JONATHAN BERI: Thanks.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.882
AMIT FULAY: Just talk to me
after I get off the stage, and

00:52:15.882 --> 00:52:17.790
I'll connect you.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:18.195
Yes sir?

00:52:18.195 --> 00:52:18.550
JONATHAN BERI: Please.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.420
AUDIENCE: Three quick questions
related to inviting

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.600
agents to a Hangout.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.630
Inviting from within the Sandbox
doesn't seem to work.

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:28.600
AMIT FULAY: Yeah.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.770
AUDIENCE: There's no PST and
dialing from within a Hangout

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:34.670
in the Sandbox, to test
PST and calling.

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:41.260
And the other one was, if I have
an agent get invited out

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.180
of [INAUDIBLE] to a given
Hangout, the Join

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:43.890
button shows up.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.760
Is there any way to bypass the
Join button or some of the

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.955
manual nature of that?

00:52:47.955 --> 00:52:50.700
AMIT FULAY: So let me take
the first two here.

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.210
The Invite functionality
is disabled.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:54.460
That's by design.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:58.375
I think we built the Sandbox
environment as a test bed for

00:52:58.375 --> 00:52:59.900
our developers.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.350
And the way to access it is
through a whitelist that the

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:03.900
developer gets to choose.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.950
So while you are in development,
we don't want for

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.990
your app to actually get
promoted with the larger

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:14.080
Google+ user base when
you're not ready.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.850
So that's the reason we kind
of kept it that way.

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:19.120
You have to go in the Developer
Console and

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.510
explicitly publish your app to
migrate it to the production

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:23.540
environment.

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:27.430
And that's where you'd get
the Invite functionality.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.750
Regarding PST and [? out ?],
again, Sandbox is something

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.970
that the Hangouts API team uses
to roll out functionality

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:38.410
quickly, get your feedback
before we graduate things into

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:39.330
production.

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.990
It's not a full-fidelity
environment, so we don't put

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.110
all the features that we have
in regular Hangouts into the

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:47.240
developer Sandbox.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.850
But if that's something we
expose through our API, we'll

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.630
definitely include it
in the Sandbox.

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.550
And the third question,
I'm forgetting.

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:56.654
Was--

00:53:56.654 --> 00:53:57.390
AUDIENCE: The join button.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.360
JONATHAN BERI: The join flow.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.660
The join flow in develop--

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.100
JONATHAN BERI: In developing
environment?

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.660
So maybe you can just jump on.

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.450
AUDIENCE: It's Hangouts
in general.

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:09.370
If someone comes into a Hangout,
they have to click

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:10.760
Join implicitly to join.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.460
If you're trying to invite an
agent to a call, having to

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.830
have them manually click a
Join button is kind of

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:17.240
inconvenient.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:17.830
AMIT FULAY: OK.

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:20.550
That's good feedback.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.750
OK, we've got time for maybe
one or two more questions.

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:24.350
Then we've got to--

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:26.480
AUDIENCE: It's just
a short question.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.980
If I develop an app for an On
Air Hangout, there is no way

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:35.120
to test it at the moment because
the Sandbox only

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.610
provides testing for
regular Hangouts.

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:40.520
Is there something also
coming in the future

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.870
to test on-air features?

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.320
AMIT FULAY: There's nothing
coming, but you just gave us

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.285
something to work on.

00:54:45.285 --> 00:54:45.975
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:54:45.975 --> 00:54:46.970
AMIT FULAY: That's
great feedback.

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.750
We'll take a look at that.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.960
AUDIENCE: And we just--

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.580
since we rolled out On Air we've
added a very limited

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.880
functionality to the API
so you can tell if a

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.960
Hangout is On Air.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.000
And now that we've seen how
people are using On Air and

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.230
Hangout apps, we have all these
great ideas of our own

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.820
and some feedback.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.530
And that's definitely something
that we're going to

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:10.005
look at as we expand the
API around On Air.

00:55:10.005 --> 00:55:10.900
AMIT FULAY: OK.

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:11.250
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:11.980
For sure.

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:12.880
Please.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.930
AUDIENCE: So real quick--

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.950
the format of Hangouts
is very similar to

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:20.920
OpenSocial in some ways.

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.650
I notice there's no mention
of OpenSocial.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:25.860
Are there any plans to move
towards the OpenSocial

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.990
standard for some of this?

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:29.730
Or are you guys completely
giving up on that?

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.210
JONATHAN BERI: Sure.

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:34.170
Great question, and we've
gotten it before.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:37.420
If you've done OpenSocial or if
you've done Google Gadgets

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.640
and you're doing Hangouts now,
you'll see there's--

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.930
it's part of the DNA from
all that technology.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.390
And actually, Google prides
itself in building a product,

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.360
learning from it, and
expanding on it.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.620
So if you look at the early
Google Gadgets to what we have

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:53.540
in Hangouts, you'll see pieces
of all these technologies.

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.570
And we're using it in smarter
ways, and better ways, and

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.300
applying it specifically
to that environment.

00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.740
So you're right.

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:03.130
This is not
OpenSocial-compatible, and for

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:03.800
good reason.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.810
OpenSocial is not a Hangout
app platform.

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:12.060
But OpenSocial is a thriving
community, so as we mature

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.240
this product and follow where
OpenSocial's going, we'll see

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.124
if we can bridge the gap in
some way in the future.

00:56:18.124 --> 00:56:19.374
Thanks.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:24.030
We have time for one question
on stage, but if there's

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.620
anybody who wants to ask us
questions one-on-one, we'll be

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:27.790
right outside.

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:28.800
You can follow us out.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.770
And of course we have the
Developer Sandbox for more

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:33.020
one-on-one questions.

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:36.930
Nobody else?

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:37.390
AMIT FULAY: Thank you guys.

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:38.160
Thank you for joining us.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:38.460
JONATHAN BERI: Thank you.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.163
[APPLAUSE]
