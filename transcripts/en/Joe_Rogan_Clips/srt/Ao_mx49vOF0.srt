1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,400
What makes you nervous about
this? Alright, three big areas.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,840
First humans and all of buys,
incredibly complex.

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:16,890
Homeo talk about genetic code,
which is mindbogglingly complex,

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,270
but our genetics exists
within the incredible,

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,820
incredibly complex systems biology.

7
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:27,870
We have all of these things like our
microbiome, our virome are proteome,

8
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:32,160
the Metabolome, and then that exists
within the context of our environment.

9
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:34,620
And everything's always changing and,
and interacting.

10
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:38,940
And so we are messing and we have the
tools to mess and we will mess because

11
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:43,680
we're this hubristic species with
these really complex ecosystems,

12
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,140
including ourselves. We don't fully
understand. That's number one,

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,120
two and you mentioned it
before, this issue of, of
equity. What happens if we have,

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,120
every technology has to have first
adopters. If you don't have it,

15
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,200
you never get the technology.

16
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,340
But what happens if a group of people
move much more quickly than other people,

17
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,850
whether it's real or not, even if they
believe it's real. You could imagine big,

18
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:06,460
dangerous societal changes.
And the third big area is diversity.

19
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:07,620
And we think about diversity.

20
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:11,270
We think why it's great to have
diverse workplaces and schools. And,

21
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,240
and we're more better people for
it and we're more competitive.

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,860
The diversity is something much,
much, much deeper. In Darwinian terms,

23
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:21,870
diversity is random mutation.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,560
Like that's our core survival strategy
as a species. If we didn't have that,

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,650
you could say we distilled be single
cell organisms but we wouldn't,

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,070
we would have died because the environment
would have changed and we wouldn't

27
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:35,130
have had the built in resilience to adapt.
Yeah.

28
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:37,630
That is really important when
thinking about diversity, right? Yeah.

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,210
We need a non uniformity when it
comes to our own biology. Yeah.

30
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:45,120
Because you a bunch of different kinds
of people. We have to have it be as,

31
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:49,230
even if we optimize for this
world, um, the world will change.

32
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,880
There's no good and bad in evolution.

33
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:53,400
There's just well suited for
a particular environment.

34
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,690
If that environment changes,

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,000
the best suited person for your old
environment may be the least suited person

36
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:03,170
for the new environment.
So even if we have things that seem real,

37
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,670
like really great ideas now,
like optimizing health.

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,160
So if you have sickle cell disease,

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,280
you're probably going to die
and you're going to die young.

40
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:14,160
And it's going to be excruciating pain,
excruciatingly painful.

41
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,370
And so you would say, well, let's
just get rid of sickle cell disease,

42
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,204
which we can do.

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,540
But if you are a recessive carrier of
the single of the sickle cell disease

44
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,590
gene,
you don't have it.

45
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:29,280
You're just carrying it and you have a
pretty significant risk of passing it on

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,020
to your kids, but you also have an
additional resistance to malaria.

47
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,210
And so we are probably are almost
certainly carrying around all kinds of

48
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:43,890
recessive traits, maybe even ones that we
don't like that are harming us now. Um,

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,240
but that could be some protection against
some future danger that we don't yet

50
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,920
understand or how are haven't faced.

51
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,790
And so the challenge is that diversity
has just happened to us for 4 billion

52
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,510
years now we're going to have
to choose it. And that's a big,

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,170
it's a big challenge for us.

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
So essentially we were
going to have without doubt,

55
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,330
some unintended consequences,
some unintended domino effect,

56
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,670
things that are going to take
place that we really can't predict.

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,350
We just have to kind of go along with
this technology and see where it leads us

58
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:18,220
as it improves.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,660
Like if you go back and look at surgeries
from the 1950s comparison to surgery

60
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,900
of 2019 giant leaps,
I mean,

61
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,740
I would never advise someone to get
their knee operated by a 1950s physician.

62
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,330
Right? Right. Yeah. Right.

63
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:35,380
But that's kind of someone's going to
have to be an early adopter when it comes

64
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,590
to these genetic therapies.
Yeah, no, I agree with you.

65
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,570
But where I would slightly,

66
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,450
or I would add to what you're
saying is these technologies,

67
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,490
they're going to happen,
they're going to play out,

68
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,540
and what's at play now is not where
these technologies are going to advance.

69
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,010
They will,
it will do it.

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,430
They will advance in a way that is
going to just blow people's minds.

71
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,930
What's at play is what are the values
that we are going to weave into the

72
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:03,550
decision making process so that we can
get a better outcome than we otherwise

73
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,520
would have had and that that's
what, in my view, that's the real,

74
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,720
the important issue.
Now.
