00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:12.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ThinkQuest is a global
website building competition

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:16.866
for kids nine to nineteen, sponsored
by the Oracle Education Foundation.

00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:19.646
The contest has a few simple rules.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:23.356
Students recruit a coach and form
teams of three to six members,

00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:26.086
either with fellow
classmates or with peers

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:28.556
from other towns, regions
or countries.

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:33.206
Each team has up to seven months
to create an educational website

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.136
on any topic of their choice.

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:41.586
One team focused on the inequities of
digital access, know as the e-divide.

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:43.916
&gt;&gt;Gerben: The e-divide, I
think is an important issue,

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:47.816
because there is still parts of the
world where people don't have access

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:50.956
to computers and internet, and they
don't get an equal opportunity.

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:54.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The team
separated the e-divide

00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.426
into four categories,
physical barriers.

00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:59.946
&gt;&gt;Ammu: Just the common, people
have computers or they don't.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Digital barriers.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.096
&gt;&gt;Ammu: Whether they have
access to the internet

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.646
and educational software.

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:05.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Human barriers.

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:07.836
&gt;&gt;Ammu: Whether they
have access to teachers

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:10.406
who can effectively use
technology in their curricula.

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:12.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And socioeconomic
barriers.

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:14.576
&gt;&gt;Ammu: And also whether
there is enough funding

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:17.716
and cultural recognition of
how important technology is.

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:20.391
&gt;&gt;Teacher 1: [speaking Romanian].

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Young people today
have an unprecedented opportunity

00:01:23.426 --> 00:01:26.016
to understand and interact
with the world around them,

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:30.236
in large part because of twenty
four seven access to information.

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.796
&gt;&gt;Deborah: It's making the kids
think about more social issues,

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:38.636
more global issues, and think
beyond what's happening in their day

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:40.546
to day lives, and think
about their future.

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:44.976
&gt;&gt;Gerben: Things that would eliminate
or reduce the e-divide is awareness,

00:01:45.116 --> 00:01:47.206
make people aware that
it is an issue,

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:52.976
and that the resources are
available to solve the problem.

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:54.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The team was
able to use its diversity

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:57.186
to deliver a global
perspective on the issues.

00:01:57.476 --> 00:01:59.316
&gt;&gt;Ammu: There were six
of us all together.

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:01.876
I wrote a lot of the
content for the site.

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:03.806
There was Ngoc from Australia.

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:07.826
We did this survey of students
in the US and in Vietnam,

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.326
and she did the statistical
analysis for that,

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:12.146
'cause she's amazing with statistics.

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:15.756
Viet Anh from Viet Nam did a
lot of the flash animations.

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:20.396
Jasmine from India and Gerben from
the Netherlands did the web design.

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:25.426
And Loeh from Egypt did
the French translation.

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:29.836
&gt;&gt;Ngoc: It's just the idea that we
can have friends all over the world,

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.366
on the five different
continents, and we can meet online

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:37.166
without meeting each other, but
we can talk to each other and get

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.126
to know each other so well.

00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:40.406
&gt;&gt;Man: I think it's the best one, but
I think it's still a very strong one.

00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:43.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: All ThinkQuest entries
are judged by an independent panel

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:48.546
of educators who, in 2006,
awarded first prize in the nineteen

00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:51.186
and under category
to the e-divide team

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:55.126
at the annual ThinkQuest live
celebration in San Francisco.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:58.276
Since ThinkQuest's inception,

00:02:58.326 --> 00:03:01.986
over ten thousand students have
participated in the competition.

00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:05.396
All of their websites are
published on ThinkQuest dot com,

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:08.846
a protected online community
for students and teachers

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:12.036
from around the world, to
collaborate on learning projects,

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:14.976
share experiences and
build knowledge together.

00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:19.836
&gt;&gt;Safra Katz: Using technology
and being able to communicate,

00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:21.936
these are skills that last forever.

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:25.746
These kids really have
the drive to be great

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.326
and once you give them
the tools in their hands,

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:31.146
it's really no, no borders for them.

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:35.256
&gt;&gt;Gerben: It's absolutely an
experience I will never forget.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.636
