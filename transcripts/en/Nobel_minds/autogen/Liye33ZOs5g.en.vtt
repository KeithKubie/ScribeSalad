00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439
it has been proven but when chloroform

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
it has been proven but when chloroform
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.940
it has been proven but when chloroform
is added to four is their structure

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
is added to four is their structure
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.490
is added to four is their structure
changes from a cubic network of baggage

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500
changes from a cubic network of baggage
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.740
changes from a cubic network of baggage
to a hex angle on a process with impact

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
to a hex angle on a process with impact
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.660
to a hex angle on a process with impact
on super conductivity why do this

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
on super conductivity why do this
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.270
on super conductivity why do this
structural change okay I don't know

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
structural change okay I don't know
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.359
structural change okay I don't know
I think the difference between hexagonal

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
I think the difference between hexagonal
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.210
I think the difference between hexagonal
and cubic packing probably a very very

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
and cubic packing probably a very very
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.230
and cubic packing probably a very very
low energy barrier or very low very

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
low energy barrier or very low very
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330
low energy barrier or very low very
small difference in barrier and so the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
small difference in barrier and so the
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.929
small difference in barrier and so the
impact of an intercalated molecule will

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
impact of an intercalated molecule will
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.190
impact of an intercalated molecule will
be quite strong and the intermolecular

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
be quite strong and the intermolecular
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.900
be quite strong and the intermolecular
forces will favour in the case of the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
forces will favour in the case of the
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.960
forces will favour in the case of the
chloroform structure
