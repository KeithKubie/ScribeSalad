I can imagine I think there's work going
 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.680
I can imagine I think there's work going
on at MIT in other places we're starting

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
on at MIT in other places we're starting
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.390
on at MIT in other places we're starting
to treat biological materials as an

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
to treat biological materials as an
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.580
to treat biological materials as an
engineering material itself so can you

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590
engineering material itself so can you
 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.949
engineering material itself so can you
actually design and print out neural

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
actually design and print out neural
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.840

the way I see it is that what we have to
get used but we have to get better at as

should you and then I think we're going
 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.610

the minute they get a little bored so

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:31.990
the minute they get a little bored so

the minute they get a little bored so
this is what I think it's both a design

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:33.850
this is what I think it's both a design
 

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.090
this is what I think it's both a design
and a policy issue the minute they get a

and a policy issue the minute they get a
 

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.590
and a policy issue the minute they get a

there so it is a very tricky design and

there so it is a very tricky design and

between people and machines I think

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:56.650
between people and machines I think
 

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.320
between people and machines I think
historically there's been this

certainly my own work I think what we're
 

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.890
certainly my own work I think what we're
finding is that fascinating design

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:07.900
finding is that fascinating design
 

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.470

they're never gonna be human but they

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:12.760
they're never gonna be human but they
 

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.420
they're never gonna be human but they
can compliment us in really intriguing

difference and how they can help us to
 

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.680

be more effective than we would if we

again we as human beings we work with

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:41.769
again we as human beings we work with
 

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:44.190
again we as human beings we work with
non-human entities like you know people

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:44.200
non-human entities like you know people
 

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.810

think robots and other technologies are

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360
think robots and other technologies are
 

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.720
think robots and other technologies are
intriguing to think about they bring

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:57.730
intriguing to think about they bring
 

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.150
intriguing to think about they bring
their own capabilities and I think

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160
their own capabilities and I think
 

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.550
their own capabilities and I think
people actually can think about them as

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560
people actually can think about them as
 

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.960
people actually can think about them as

them with trying to be exactly like
humans in that process I also think one

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:07.810
humans in that process I also think one
 

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.199
humans in that process I also think one
really important thing for those of us

mindful of the adaptability of people
and that actually we should be building

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:18.220
and that actually we should be building
 

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.660
and that actually we should be building
machines to adapt to us and I one of my

who are using them they've been designed
for a billing department and so we're

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880
for a billing department and so we're
 

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.720

allow them to deliver the best care that
 

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.690
allow them to deliver the best care that
they could deliver and I'm sure

that machine that way so let me ask the
 

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.640
that machine that way so let me ask the
whole panel if you can describe your

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:14.650
whole panel if you can describe your
 

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.449

what sort of scenario do you see that

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880
what sort of scenario do you see that
 

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.059
what sort of scenario do you see that
working well in and how would it all be

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:27.069
working well in and how would it all be
 

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:30.810
working well in and how would it all be
like to be in it I can start sure so it

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:30.820
like to be in it I can start sure so it
 

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.750
like to be in it I can start sure so it
turns out we've actually implemented one

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760
turns out we've actually implemented one
 

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.669
turns out we've actually implemented one
or two such scenarios today and I can

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679
or two such scenarios today and I can
 

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:39.810
or two such scenarios today and I can
you know just describe one of them if

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:39.820
you know just describe one of them if
 

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.990
you know just describe one of them if
you are trying to make a really complex

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000
you are trying to make a really complex
 

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.960
you are trying to make a really complex
decision as a group and you know I come

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:45.970
decision as a group and you know I come
 

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.340
decision as a group and you know I come
from the corporate world so I can I can

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:47.350
from the corporate world so I can I can
 

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.940
from the corporate world so I can I can
use a complex example like if you're

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:50.950
use a complex example like if you're
 

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.630
use a complex example like if you're
trying to acquire a company you know

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640
trying to acquire a company you know
 

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.550
trying to acquire a company you know
which is a very difficult decision

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:56.560
which is a very difficult decision
 

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.660
which is a very difficult decision
because there's so many parameters that

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:57.670
because there's so many parameters that
 

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.430
because there's so many parameters that
you have to worry about there's a huge

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440
you have to worry about there's a huge
 

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.980
you have to worry about there's a huge
amount of information that you need to

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:01.990
amount of information that you need to
 

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.960
amount of information that you need to
do research on and typically this is

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:03.970
do research on and typically this is
 

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.180
do research on and typically this is
going to have to happen within a few

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.190
going to have to happen within a few
 

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.750
going to have to happen within a few
hours maybe a couple days you know and

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760
hours maybe a couple days you know and
 

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.240
hours maybe a couple days you know and
there's a lot of perspectives that

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.250
there's a lot of perspectives that
 

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.620
there's a lot of perspectives that
somebody has to bring in you know it's a

somebody has to bring in you know it's a
 

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.660
somebody has to bring in you know it's a
financial perspective there's you know a

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:15.670
financial perspective there's you know a
 

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.520
financial perspective there's you know a
business strategy perspective you know

you know an instinct about what's the
 

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.090

when we enhance it through adding
 

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.500
when we enhance it through adding
computation to it we have a very high

standard for the computation we add to
 

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.750
standard for the computation we add to
it so through example when somebody says

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760
it so through example when somebody says
 

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.860
it so through example when somebody says
oh I know what we should do to this

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:30.870
oh I know what we should do to this
 

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.620

to look at your patient during an
 

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.740
to look at your patient during an
interview with a patient will say is

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:39.750

the work the conversation does in that
 

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.990
the work the conversation does in that
medical encounter is too important to

medical encounter is too important to
 

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.310
medical encounter is too important to
just add something that primitive let's

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320
just add something that primitive let's
 

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.520
just add something that primitive let's
hold off on that and I think that we've

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:55.530
hold off on that and I think that we've
 

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.000
hold off on that and I think that we've
rushed in to adding computation in a lot

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.010
rushed in to adding computation in a lot
 

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.480
rushed in to adding computation in a lot
of places before we sort of allowed

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:02.490
of places before we sort of allowed
 

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.730
of places before we sort of allowed
ourselves to really understand the power

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740
ourselves to really understand the power
 

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.790
ourselves to really understand the power
of face-to-face conversations in some of

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:07.800
of face-to-face conversations in some of
 

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.930
of face-to-face conversations in some of
our most crucial human encounters with

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940
our most crucial human encounters with
 

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.840
our most crucial human encounters with
our children with our colleagues with

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:14.850
our children with our colleagues with
 

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.640
our children with our colleagues with
our partners with our intimates with our

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:16.650
our partners with our intimates with our
 

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.250
our partners with our intimates with our
with our physicians so I think that a

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260
with our physicians so I think that a
 

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.320
with our physicians so I think that a
more profound understanding for example

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.330
more profound understanding for example
 

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.870
more profound understanding for example
in the medical context means that the

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880
in the medical context means that the
 

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.470
in the medical context means that the
next generation of collaborative

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480
next generation of collaborative
 

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.240

computational partners in medical
 

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.000
computational partners in medical
encounters really will be ones in which

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.010
encounters really will be ones in which
 

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.790
encounters really will be ones in which
there is a computational partner that's

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:34.800
there is a computational partner that's
 

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.550
there is a computational partner that's
adding to the conversation not

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:37.560
adding to the conversation not
 

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.560
adding to the conversation not
systematically detracting from it

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:39.570
systematically detracting from it
 

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.750

I think that I think that that we're

I think that I think that that we're
going to begin to take that you take the

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:41.870
going to begin to take that you take the
 

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.070
going to begin to take that you take the
measure of the cost of our having been

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080
measure of the cost of our having been
 

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.590
measure of the cost of our having been
so vulnerable and I don't think that

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600
so vulnerable and I don't think that
 

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.640
so vulnerable and I don't think that
we're going to see that I notice I don't

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:51.650
we're going to see that I notice I don't
 

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.410
we're going to see that I notice I don't
think that's going to persist because I

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:53.420
think that's going to persist because I
 

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.670
think that's going to persist because I
think we're going to take the measure of

up on this because I've recently been
 

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.240
up on this because I've recently been
doing some work with physicians and so

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:04.250
doing some work with physicians and so
 

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.980
doing some work with physicians and so
I'll give you I'll give you two examples

are afraid to ask their doctors
 

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.420
are afraid to ask their doctors

that would remind you you wanted to ask

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:31.540
that would remind you you wanted to ask
 

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.990

a little sound that would signal to the
 

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.860
a little sound that would signal to the

you don't interfere with our ability to
engage these competencies I would call

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:30.910

them our signature strengths on the
negative side that could be

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:33.610
negative side that could be
 

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:34.800
negative side that could be
vulnerabilities but they're also our

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:34.810
vulnerabilities but they're also our
 

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.930

able to support us to be the most
 

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.530
able to support us to be the most
effective so I think technologies that

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:40.540
effective so I think technologies that
 

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.690
effective so I think technologies that
address deeply our social selves and

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:42.700
address deeply our social selves and
 

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.100
address deeply our social selves and
emotional selves in addition to the

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.310
cognitive in the physical in the right
way is going to be really important to

way is going to be really important to
 

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.810
way is going to be really important to
create technologies that support us to

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:48.820
create technologies that support us to
 

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.370
create technologies that support us to
our best ability so let me go on from

our best ability so let me go on from
 

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.250
our best ability so let me go on from
there and ask you whether it's important

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:56.260
there and ask you whether it's important
 

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.470
there and ask you whether it's important
for machines to at least appear to

display emotions in their way in their
 

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.600
display emotions in their way in their
interactions with human beings and then

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:03.610
interactions with human beings and then
 

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.850

after that if you've seen the movie her
 

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.090
after that if you've seen the movie her
I'd be interested in your reaction to

I'd be interested in your reaction to
 

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.710
I'd be interested in your reaction to
that particular relationship and how

that particular relationship and how
 

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.420
that particular relationship and how
that evolves okay

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:14.430
that evolves okay
 

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.100
that evolves okay
so again speaking to the point Barbara

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:17.110
so again speaking to the point Barbara

so again speaking to the point Barbara
made and certainly in a lot of my own

it's a different question as to can you
 

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.340
it's a different question as to can you
create a machine that has human emotions

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:26.350
create a machine that has human emotions
 

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.650
create a machine that has human emotions
which I would say no because machines

about it as theory of mind which i think
 

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.560
about it as theory of mind which i think
is a very far out goal but I think in

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:24.570
is a very far out goal but I think in

even in the small in the short-term you

even in the small in the short-term you

even in the small in the short-term you
can have state of mind as as an

just Stewart mentioned I did a long time

ago that you can't in fact carry on a

that those things are very very hard to

00:32:48.619 --> 00:32:48.629
that those things are very very hard to
 

00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:51.610
that those things are very very hard to
do well in a computing system

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:51.620
do well in a computing system
 

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.130
do well in a computing system
and I think those are also important

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:54.140
and I think those are also important
 

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.890

about the new materials and what
difference they'll make but there's a

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.500
actions down now at the level of
individuals have impact right and so the

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:26.510
individuals have impact right and so the
 

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.730
individuals have impact right and so the
one thing that we as humans are still

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:27.740
one thing that we as humans are still
 

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.820
one thing that we as humans are still
not good at is you know call it global

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:30.830
not good at is you know call it global
 

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.849
not good at is you know call it global
intelligence how can we as a planet as a

00:34:33.849 --> 00:34:33.859
intelligence how can we as a planet as a
 

00:34:33.859 --> 00:34:36.839
intelligence how can we as a planet as a
people all over the planet make

00:34:36.839 --> 00:34:36.849
people all over the planet make
 

00:34:36.849 --> 00:34:40.990
people all over the planet make

for the global good we're just we're not

00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879
for the global good we're just we're not
 

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:45.639
for the global good we're just we're not
good at that and you know with climate

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:45.649
good at that and you know with climate
 

00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:46.720
good at that and you know with climate
change and all these things we're facing

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:46.730
change and all these things we're facing
 

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.070
change and all these things we're facing
the point where either through our

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.080
the point where either through our
 

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.220
the point where either through our

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240
right so can technology help us become
 

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.010
right so can technology help us become
intelligent at a global scale so that we

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:00.020
intelligent at a global scale so that we
 

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.390
intelligent at a global scale so that we
as the people in the planet can

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400
as the people in the planet can
 

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.580
as the people in the planet can
can address these these huge challenges

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:04.590
can address these these huge challenges
 

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:09.410
can address these these huge challenges
we face that's a great question so I you

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420
we face that's a great question so I you
 

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.480
we face that's a great question so I you
were to ask one more question before

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:11.490
were to ask one more question before
 

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:13.580
were to ask one more question before
before we throw it open to questions

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:13.590
before we throw it open to questions
 

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.380
before we throw it open to questions
from the audience and there oh there are

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:15.390
from the audience and there oh there are
 

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.850
from the audience and there oh there are
microphones so if you have a question

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:16.860
microphones so if you have a question
 

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.060
microphones so if you have a question
please raise your hand and someone will

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:20.070
please raise your hand and someone will
 

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.250
please raise your hand and someone will
bring the mic to you so the question I

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260
bring the mic to you so the question I
 

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.990
bring the mic to you so the question I
wanted to ask is to look further ahead

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000
wanted to ask is to look further ahead
 

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.660
wanted to ask is to look further ahead
and if we do have machines that are much

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:26.670
and if we do have machines that are much
 

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.910
and if we do have machines that are much
more intelligent than us will they need

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920
more intelligent than us will they need
 

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.620
more intelligent than us will they need
to hide their intelligence though is not

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:30.630
to hide their intelligence though is not
 

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:40.010
to hide their intelligence though is not
to crush our poor little egos by

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020
to crush our poor little egos by
 

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.490
to crush our poor little egos by
answering the question about her which

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500
answering the question about her which
 

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.630
answering the question about her which
was that in the end the intelligence

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640
was that in the end the intelligence
 

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.410
was that in the end the intelligence
that was developed in her really wanted

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420
that was developed in her really wanted
 

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:56.390
that was developed in her really wanted
to hang out with other AIS and really

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400
to hang out with other AIS and really
 

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.920
to hang out with other AIS and really
didn't want to hang out with Joaquin

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:00.930
didn't want to hang out with Joaquin
 

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.020
didn't want to hang out with Joaquin
Phoenix after she had tidied up after it

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:03.030
Phoenix after she had tidied up after it
 

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.290
Phoenix after she had tidied up after it
had tidied up his his a book proposal

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300
had tidied up his his a book proposal
 

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.700
had tidied up his his a book proposal
and had his you know has kind of

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:10.710
and had his you know has kind of
 

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.300
and had his you know has kind of
organized his files in his life and she

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:14.310
organized his files in his life and she
 

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.060
organized his files in his life and she
was ready to I keep saying she because

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.070
was ready to I keep saying she because
 

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.740

it was voiced by Scarlett Johansson it's

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:18.750
it was voiced by Scarlett Johansson it's
 

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.260
it was voiced by Scarlett Johansson it's
impossible not to imagine it is a woman

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:21.270
impossible not to imagine it is a woman
 

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:22.550
impossible not to imagine it is a woman
but I mean there she was ready to move

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560
but I mean there she was ready to move
 

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.270
but I mean there she was ready to move
on to you know to others of her kind and

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280
on to you know to others of her kind and
 

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.930
on to you know to others of her kind and
so I think this is our insistence that

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:28.940
so I think this is our insistence that
 

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.520
so I think this is our insistence that
we're going to create an object whose

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:31.530
we're going to create an object whose
 

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.010
we're going to create an object whose
really main interest will be hanging out

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020
really main interest will be hanging out
 

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.490
really main interest will be hanging out
with us I think is also part of a kind

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.500
with us I think is also part of a kind
 

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.680
with us I think is also part of a kind
of a very old-fashioned fantasy I think

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:39.690
of a very old-fashioned fantasy I think
 

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.720
of a very old-fashioned fantasy I think
Barbara's trying to get us moved away

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:41.730
Barbara's trying to get us moved away
 

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.960
Barbara's trying to get us moved away
from this is you know let's think about

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:44.970
from this is you know let's think about
 

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.790
from this is you know let's think about
you know creating artificial

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800
you know creating artificial
 

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.770
you know creating artificial
intelligences will enhance our life and

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780
intelligences will enhance our life and
 

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.140
intelligences will enhance our life and
stop thinking them as our as our kind of

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:51.150
stop thinking them as our as our kind of
 

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:55.520
stop thinking them as our as our kind of
best friends yeah I think our premise in

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:55.530
best friends yeah I think our premise in
 

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.500
best friends yeah I think our premise in
what you said Stewart which is that they

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:57.510
what you said Stewart which is that they
 

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.530
what you said Stewart which is that they
will get it will be smarter than us but

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540
will get it will be smarter than us but
 

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.630
will get it will be smarter than us but
I think they will be differently smart

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640
I think they will be differently smart
 

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.030
I think they will be differently smart
from us and that's what we should aim

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040
from us and that's what we should aim
 

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.660
from us and that's what we should aim
for yeah you know I would I would add

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:08.670
for yeah you know I would I would add
 

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.370
for yeah you know I would I would add
that it's you know again come back to

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380
that it's you know again come back to
 

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.089
that it's you know again come back to
the goal of enhancing our life

00:37:15.089 --> 00:37:15.099
the goal of enhancing our life
 

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:17.579
the goal of enhancing our life
bring us with our goals and intentions

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:17.589
bring us with our goals and intentions
 

00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:22.289
bring us with our goals and intentions
so if you know hiding or showing is the

00:37:22.289 --> 00:37:22.299
so if you know hiding or showing is the
 

00:37:22.299 --> 00:37:24.380
so if you know hiding or showing is the
right thing to do in order to do that

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:24.390
right thing to do in order to do that
 

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:28.229
right thing to do in order to do that
that's the world model that the you know

00:37:28.229 --> 00:37:28.239
that's the world model that the you know
 

00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:31.620
that's the world model that the you know
the the AI system should adopt so you're

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:31.630
the the AI system should adopt so you're
 

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.059
the the AI system should adopt so you're
saying yes they should hide their

00:37:33.059 --> 00:37:33.069
saying yes they should hide their
 

00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:34.859

microphones in circulation although it's
 

00:37:51.849 --> 00:37:55.109
microphones in circulation although it's
very hard for me to see from here if

00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119
very hard for me to see from here if
 

00:37:55.119 --> 00:38:02.549
very hard for me to see from here if
anyone has a question okay down the

I was wondering why do you think after

00:38:25.799 --> 00:38:25.809
I was wondering why do you think after
 

00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:28.349

20 years there's still only three

00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359
20 years there's still only three
 

00:38:28.359 --> 00:38:32.099

them is this good or bad I think we all

00:38:36.089 --> 00:38:36.099
them is this good or bad I think we all
 

00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:44.150
them is this good or bad I think we all
know it's bad how can we change it I

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160
 
 

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.150
 
think it's amazing that it's your your

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160
think it's amazing that it's your your
 

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.709
think it's amazing that it's your your
contention is that there should be more

00:38:49.709 --> 00:38:49.719
contention is that there should be more
 

00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:51.420
contention is that there should be more
or you through door that should have it

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.430
or you through door that should have it
 

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.099
or you through door that should have it
should have it should have narrowed down

00:38:53.099 --> 00:38:53.109
should have it should have narrowed down
 

00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:56.249
should have it should have narrowed down
to the best I think that you can't

to the best I think that you can't
there's seven billion people and I think

00:38:57.599 --> 00:38:57.609
there's seven billion people and I think
 

00:38:57.609 --> 00:38:59.880
there's seven billion people and I think
you can have one best system right so

00:38:59.880 --> 00:38:59.890
you can have one best system right so
 

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.680
you can have one best system right so
you're wondering why there aren't so

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:01.690
you're wondering why there aren't so
 

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.719
you're wondering why there aren't so
many why don't I have my own personal

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:03.729
many why don't I have my own personal
 

00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:06.660
many why don't I have my own personal
operating system yeah so why do I have

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:06.670
operating system yeah so why do I have
 

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.920
operating system yeah so why do I have
to use Windows 8 you know so I actually

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:10.930
to use Windows 8 you know so I actually
 

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.809
to use Windows 8 you know so I actually
this question has so much more to do

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:12.819
this question has so much more to do
 

00:39:12.819 --> 00:39:16.349
this question has so much more to do
with markets and business models and and

00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359
with markets and business models and and
 

00:39:16.359 --> 00:39:19.200
with markets and business models and and
you know dynamics there are well beyond

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:19.210
you know dynamics there are well beyond
 

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.349
you know dynamics there are well beyond
the scope of you know technology and and

00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359
the scope of you know technology and and
 

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:26.039
the scope of you know technology and and
and even society I think right but you

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:26.049
and even society I think right but you
 

00:39:26.049 --> 00:39:27.450
and even society I think right but you
know at the end of the day there you

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:27.460
know at the end of the day there you
 

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.380
know at the end of the day there you
know there

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:28.390
know there
 

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:33.539
know there
are so many new ideas floating around in

00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:33.549
are so many new ideas floating around in
 

00:39:33.549 --> 00:39:36.690
are so many new ideas floating around in
the entrepreneurial ecosystem you know I

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:36.700
the entrepreneurial ecosystem you know I
 

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.930
the entrepreneurial ecosystem you know I
look at you know dozens of different

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:39.940
look at you know dozens of different
 

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.920
look at you know dozens of different
great ideas and which one will catch on

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:43.930
great ideas and which one will catch on
 

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.250
great ideas and which one will catch on
and which one will succeed is a much

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:47.260
and which one will succeed is a much
 

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.990
and which one will succeed is a much
bigger question than you know then what

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000
bigger question than you know then what
 

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.180
bigger question than you know then what
the technologies are good for and what

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:51.190
the technologies are good for and what
 

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.039
the technologies are good for and what
people think about them today but I

00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:53.049
people think about them today but I
 

00:39:53.049 --> 00:39:55.920
people think about them today but I
definitely would say that many new

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:55.930
definitely would say that many new
 

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.980
definitely would say that many new
elements even if those companies don't

00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:58.990
elements even if those companies don't
 

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.480
elements even if those companies don't
succeed many new ideas from those

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:00.490
succeed many new ideas from those
 

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.549
succeed many new ideas from those
companies will make their way into our

00:40:02.549 --> 00:40:02.559
companies will make their way into our
 

00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:05.670
companies will make their way into our
lives so I have a I have a flip answer

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680
lives so I have a I have a flip answer
 

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.160
lives so I have a I have a flip answer
in a serious answer the flip answer is

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:08.170
in a serious answer the flip answer is
 

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.410
in a serious answer the flip answer is
the architecture of one brain seems to

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:10.420
the architecture of one brain seems to
 

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.930
the architecture of one brain seems to
have done the human race pretty well now

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:12.940
have done the human race pretty well now
 

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.450
have done the human race pretty well now
toast operating systems obviously none

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:15.460
toast operating systems obviously none
 

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.700
toast operating systems obviously none
of them is quite as well architected so

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:17.710
of them is quite as well architected so
 

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.490
of them is quite as well architected so
that's my my flip answer to the we

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:20.500
that's my my flip answer to the we
 

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.740
that's my my flip answer to the we
should we should maybe only have one but

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:22.750
should we should maybe only have one but
 

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.329
should we should maybe only have one but
we don't know what the right one is so

00:40:24.329 --> 00:40:24.339
we don't know what the right one is so
 

00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:27.539
we don't know what the right one is so
we better try a multiplicity as we do in

00:40:27.539 --> 00:40:27.549
we better try a multiplicity as we do in
 

00:40:27.549 --> 00:40:30.690
we better try a multiplicity as we do in
research I think that the the second

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:30.700

issue this the second more serious

00:40:32.549 --> 00:40:32.559
issue this the second more serious

answer is really related to what guru

00:40:35.009 --> 00:40:35.019
answer is really related to what guru
 

00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:37.799

these systems out there there's a lot

00:40:39.749 --> 00:40:39.759
these systems out there there's a lot
 

00:40:39.759 --> 00:40:42.720
these systems out there there's a lot
invested in what's recorded in those

getting the industry to move and users

00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:46.869
getting the industry to move and users
 

00:40:46.869 --> 00:40:49.829
getting the industry to move and users
to move that is people who are users to

00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839
to move that is people who are users to
 

00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:52.440
to move that is people who are users to
move is a rather difficult in the

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:52.450
move is a rather difficult in the
 

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:57.960

industry question and challenge okay but
 

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.339
industry question and challenge okay but
I ask if people who asked questions

00:40:59.339 --> 00:40:59.349
I ask if people who asked questions
 

00:40:59.349 --> 00:41:01.740
I ask if people who asked questions
could at least give us an idea of what

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:01.750
could at least give us an idea of what
 

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:09.359
could at least give us an idea of what
their students are not students er okay

00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:09.369
their students are not students er okay
 

00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:12.839

we have one up about halfway up on the

00:41:12.839 --> 00:41:12.849
we have one up about halfway up on the
 

00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:20.069
we have one up about halfway up on the
right technology while it is important

00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079

would you say about if it were to flip

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:23.740
would you say about if it were to flip
 

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.269
would you say about if it were to flip
is is it important for them to or would

00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:27.279
is is it important for them to or would
 

00:41:27.279 --> 00:41:29.400
is is it important for them to or would
it be beneficial if they recognized

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:29.410
it be beneficial if they recognized
 

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.599
it be beneficial if they recognized
human emotions and adapted approach and

00:41:32.599 --> 00:41:32.609
human emotions and adapted approach and
 

00:41:32.609 --> 00:41:35.910
human emotions and adapted approach and
even tone in accordance to what the

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920
even tone in accordance to what the
 

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.259
even tone in accordance to what the
human they're interacting with this

human they're interacting with this
 

00:41:37.269 --> 00:41:41.249
human they're interacting with this
feeling absolutely I think I think if

00:41:41.249 --> 00:41:41.259
feeling absolutely I think I think if
 

00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:42.270
feeling absolutely I think I think if
you know we talked about this

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280
you know we talked about this
 

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.260
you know we talked about this
but before I think there's got to be a

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:45.270
but before I think there's got to be a
 

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:49.530
but before I think there's got to be a
recognition of the the intention of the

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:49.540
recognition of the the intention of the
 

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.660
recognition of the the intention of the
state of a person it's it's very

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:51.670
state of a person it's it's very
 

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:55.710
state of a person it's it's very
different when a computer you know let's

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720
different when a computer you know let's
 

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.770
different when a computer you know let's
say a personal assistant like Siri talks

00:41:58.770 --> 00:41:58.780
say a personal assistant like Siri talks
 

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.790
say a personal assistant like Siri talks
to you about you know some question you

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800
to you about you know some question you
 

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.510
to you about you know some question you
asked about let's say you know you know

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520
asked about let's say you know you know
 

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.790
asked about let's say you know you know
calling somebody or whatever and not

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800
calling somebody or whatever and not
 

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.350
calling somebody or whatever and not
finding that person to call might have a

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:13.360
finding that person to call might have a
 

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.960
finding that person to call might have a
very you know different way of

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:15.970
very you know different way of
 

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:18.570
very you know different way of
articulating to you why the you know the

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:18.580
articulating to you why the you know the
 

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.060
articulating to you why the you know the
computer did not find the person if they

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:21.070
computer did not find the person if they
 

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.920
computer did not find the person if they
if the computer knew what were the

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:22.930
if the computer knew what were the
 

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:24.270
if the computer knew what were the
actions that you did before you know

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280
actions that you did before you know
 

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.720
actions that you did before you know
maybe it was because you know the person

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:27.730
maybe it was because you know the person
 

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:29.550
maybe it was because you know the person
is not in your network maybe they're not

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:29.560
is not in your network maybe they're not
 

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.330
is not in your network maybe they're not
a friend you know whatever it is right

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:32.340
a friend you know whatever it is right
 

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.770
a friend you know whatever it is right
so it's very important for the computer

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:34.780
so it's very important for the computer
 

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.960
so it's very important for the computer
to be able to articulate answers to your

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:36.970
to be able to articulate answers to your
 

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.030
to be able to articulate answers to your
questions in the context in which it is

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040
questions in the context in which it is
 

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:47.160
questions in the context in which it is
most natural to you just quickly to have

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:47.170
most natural to you just quickly to have
 

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.080
most natural to you just quickly to have
some perception of emotion when replying

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:49.090
some perception of emotion when replying
 

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:53.690
some perception of emotion when replying
as well so I don't notice that in effect

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700
as well so I don't notice that in effect
 

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:57.240
as well so I don't notice that in effect
interactionism way I'm sorry what is the

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.250
interactionism way I'm sorry what is the
 

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:01.710
interactionism way I'm sorry what is the
point about if the Machine replies in a

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720
point about if the Machine replies in a
 

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:07.370
point about if the Machine replies in a
way that a person if interpreters as

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380
way that a person if interpreters as
 

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.630
way that a person if interpreters as
insensitive with that you have some

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640
insensitive with that you have some
 

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:14.220
insensitive with that you have some
effect yeah I agree with you that that

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.230
effect yeah I agree with you that that
 

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.810
effect yeah I agree with you that that
it's it's important for the machine to

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:15.820
it's it's important for the machine to
 

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.280
it's it's important for the machine to
understand whether to answer in in in a

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:20.290
understand whether to answer in in in a
 

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:23.940
understand whether to answer in in in a
maybe a current way or an or a nice way

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:23.950
maybe a current way or an or a nice way
 

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:27.360
maybe a current way or an or a nice way
right and yes machines are very bad at

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:27.370
right and yes machines are very bad at
 

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:27.870
right and yes machines are very bad at
it today

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880
it today
 

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.190
it today
and and that's why we get frustrated

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200
and and that's why we get frustrated
 

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.990
and and that's why we get frustrated
with machines all the time and so we

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000
with machines all the time and so we
 

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.370
with machines all the time and so we
need to improve and we need to not only

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:32.380
need to improve and we need to not only
 

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.290
need to improve and we need to not only
research but also develop a lot of these

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:34.300
research but also develop a lot of these
 

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.880
research but also develop a lot of these
technologies that understands the state

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:35.890
technologies that understands the state
 

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:40.560
technologies that understands the state
of mind but also I disagree in this and

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:40.570
of mind but also I disagree in this and
 

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.510
of mind but also I disagree in this and
it could be of interest I you know I

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520
it could be of interest I you know I
 

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.240
it could be of interest I you know I
think that if our expectation was that

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:45.250
think that if our expectation was that
 

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:47.310
think that if our expectation was that
the machine wasn't trying to be a person

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:47.320
the machine wasn't trying to be a person
 

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.900
the machine wasn't trying to be a person
I think this is a theme that's come up

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:48.910
I think this is a theme that's come up
 

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.480
I think this is a theme that's come up
but the Machine was trying to be a

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:51.490
but the Machine was trying to be a
 

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:53.559
but the Machine was trying to be a
gracious machine

00:43:53.559 --> 00:43:53.569
gracious machine
 

00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:56.930
gracious machine
but not trying to be a person but a

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:56.940
but not trying to be a person but a
 

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.940
but not trying to be a person but a
gracious machine a machine that

00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:58.950
gracious machine a machine that
 

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.920
gracious machine a machine that
interacted well with people but not a

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:00.930
interacted well with people but not a
 

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:04.460
interacted well with people but not a
person it would have addiction and a way

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:04.470
person it would have addiction and a way
 

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:08.780
person it would have addiction and a way
of addressing us where we would be less

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:08.790
of addressing us where we would be less
 

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:10.670
of addressing us where we would be less
vulnerable to being hurt and wouldn't

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680
vulnerable to being hurt and wouldn't
 

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.819
vulnerable to being hurt and wouldn't
have expectations of its we wouldn't

00:44:13.819 --> 00:44:13.829
have expectations of its we wouldn't
 

00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:15.859
have expectations of its we wouldn't
substitute what you are very delicately

00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:15.869
substitute what you are very delicately
 

00:44:15.869 --> 00:44:19.750
substitute what you are very delicately
calling expectations of user state with

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760
calling expectations of user state with
 

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.890
calling expectations of user state with
empathy and expectations that it

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900
empathy and expectations that it
 

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.540

understands things that it couldn't
 

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.770
understands things that it couldn't
possibly understand

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:27.780
possibly understand
 

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.780
possibly understand
and we're really we could get into kind

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:29.790
and we're really we could get into kind
 

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.270
and we're really we could get into kind
of emotional trouble if it did so and I

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280
of emotional trouble if it did so and I
 

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.549
of emotional trouble if it did so and I
think that's the that's the research and

00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559
think that's the that's the research and
 

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:36.440
think that's the that's the research and
design area where I think Cynthia and I

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:36.450
design area where I think Cynthia and I
 

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.140
design area where I think Cynthia and I
are sort of talking about where you can

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:39.150
are sort of talking about where you can
 

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.750
are sort of talking about where you can
get into trouble or you cannot get into

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760
get into trouble or you cannot get into
 

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.700
get into trouble or you cannot get into
trouble depending on how we play it I

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:43.710
trouble depending on how we play it I
 

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.440
trouble depending on how we play it I
think over the next little bit of time

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:45.450
think over the next little bit of time
 

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.319
think over the next little bit of time
so it so I think what Cynthia was saying

00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:48.329
so it so I think what Cynthia was saying
 

00:44:48.329 --> 00:44:49.760
so it so I think what Cynthia was saying
earlier about animals I mean animals

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:49.770
earlier about animals I mean animals
 

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.010
earlier about animals I mean animals
display emotions and they're different

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020
display emotions and they're different
 

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.770
display emotions and they're different
from ours you know dogs have a variety

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780
from ours you know dogs have a variety
 

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.799
from ours you know dogs have a variety
of emotions that we typically don't

00:44:56.799 --> 00:44:56.809
of emotions that we typically don't
 

00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:59.089
of emotions that we typically don't
display ourselves but we sort of

00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099
display ourselves but we sort of
 

00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:00.710
display ourselves but we sort of
unleased we think we understand kind of

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720
unleased we think we understand kind of
 

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.130
unleased we think we understand kind of
what's what's in the dog's mind and that

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140
what's what's in the dog's mind and that
 

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.770
what's what's in the dog's mind and that
that's said of that emotional repertoire

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780
that's said of that emotional repertoire
 

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.039
that's said of that emotional repertoire
hasn't been developed yet for machines I

00:45:10.039 --> 00:45:10.049
hasn't been developed yet for machines I
 

00:45:10.049 --> 00:45:13.010
hasn't been developed yet for machines I
mean there's one emotional indicator

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020
mean there's one emotional indicator
 

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.750
mean there's one emotional indicator
that they have which is some kind of

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760
that they have which is some kind of
 

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.849
that they have which is some kind of
rotating things right which basically

00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859
rotating things right which basically
 

00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:19.069
rotating things right which basically
says I'm sorry I haven't a clue and I

00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079
says I'm sorry I haven't a clue and I
 

00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:21.140
says I'm sorry I haven't a clue and I
can't get the answer to a question I'm

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:21.150
can't get the answer to a question I'm
 

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:22.490
can't get the answer to a question I'm
just going to go around and round around

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500
just going to go around and round around
 

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.289
just going to go around and round around
around right as opposed to the stripe

00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:24.299
around right as opposed to the stripe
 

00:45:24.299 --> 00:45:25.789
around right as opposed to the stripe
which goes across which kinds as I'm

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:25.799
which goes across which kinds as I'm
 

00:45:25.799 --> 00:45:27.559
which goes across which kinds as I'm
getting there I'm getting there okay I'm

00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:27.569
getting there I'm getting there okay I'm
 

00:45:27.569 --> 00:45:29.599
getting there I'm getting there okay I'm
done so there's two different versions

00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:29.609
done so there's two different versions
 

00:45:29.609 --> 00:45:31.670
done so there's two different versions
of that emotion repertoire that's about

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680
of that emotion repertoire that's about
 

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.140
of that emotion repertoire that's about
it right there's really there's really

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:33.150
it right there's really there's really
 

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.750
it right there's really there's really
nothing else that is sort of widely

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760
nothing else that is sort of widely
 

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.520
nothing else that is sort of widely
accepted and understood as a kind of a

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:37.530
accepted and understood as a kind of a
 

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.940
accepted and understood as a kind of a
robot state of mind but eventually and

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:40.950
robot state of mind but eventually and
 

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.559
robot state of mind but eventually and
it'll depend on the capabilities there's

00:45:42.559 --> 00:45:42.569
it'll depend on the capabilities there's
 

00:45:42.569 --> 00:45:44.000
it'll depend on the capabilities there's
no point developing an emotion

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:44.010
no point developing an emotion
 

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.559
no point developing an emotion
repertoire that the machines

00:45:45.559 --> 00:45:45.569
repertoire that the machines
 

00:45:45.569 --> 00:45:48.410
repertoire that the machines
capabilities can't really support but

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420
capabilities can't really support but
 

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.240
capabilities can't really support but
eventually I think we will start to see

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:50.250
eventually I think we will start to see
 

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.299
eventually I think we will start to see
a wider repertoire of emotions so you

00:45:53.299 --> 00:45:53.309
a wider repertoire of emotions so you
 

00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:55.280
a wider repertoire of emotions so you
know confusion how do you express the

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:55.290
know confusion how do you express the
 

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:57.440
know confusion how do you express the
fact that the system doesn't understand

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:57.450
fact that the system doesn't understand
 

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.240
fact that the system doesn't understand
the input that you're providing to it

00:45:59.240 --> 00:45:59.250
the input that you're providing to it
 

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.160
the input that you're providing to it
other kinds of things like that will

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:01.170
other kinds of things like that will
 

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.250
other kinds of things like that will
will start to emerge in

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:03.260
will start to emerge in
 

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.740
will start to emerge in
yeah I think they're they're really you

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:05.750
yeah I think they're they're really you
 

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.420
yeah I think they're they're really you
you've asked a question that has two

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:07.430
you've asked a question that has two
 

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.700
you've asked a question that has two
sides one is what should the machine be

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:09.710
sides one is what should the machine be
 

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:11.950
sides one is what should the machine be
able to detect in the person and I think

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960
able to detect in the person and I think
 

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.510
able to detect in the person and I think
the answer is it should be very very

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520
the answer is it should be very very
 

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.420
the answer is it should be very very
good at understanding us that that's one

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:16.430
good at understanding us that that's one
 

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:17.650
good at understanding us that that's one
of the important things and the other is

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:17.660
of the important things and the other is
 

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.630
of the important things and the other is
what it should display to the person and

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640
what it should display to the person and
 

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.099
what it should display to the person and
there it should display in a way that is

00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:23.109
there it should display in a way that is
 

00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:26.080
there it should display in a way that is
responsive to what it's a text in us but

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:26.090
responsive to what it's a text in us but
 

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:27.670
responsive to what it's a text in us but
still makes clear it's a machine and

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680
still makes clear it's a machine and
 

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.710
still makes clear it's a machine and
there are many studies I think of all

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720
there are many studies I think of all
 

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.010
there are many studies I think of all
the cliff Nass studies that show that we

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:33.020
the cliff Nass studies that show that we
 

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.130
the cliff Nass studies that show that we
we respond differently to machines in

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:36.140
we respond differently to machines in
 

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.710
we respond differently to machines in
some ways and similarly in other ways we

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720
some ways and similarly in other ways we
 

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.540
some ways and similarly in other ways we
have different expectations of machines

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:40.550
have different expectations of machines
 

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.700
have different expectations of machines
than of each other and so it's important

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:42.710
than of each other and so it's important
 

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:45.820
than of each other and so it's important
to have that right signal processing

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:45.830
to have that right signal processing
 

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:47.440
to have that right signal processing
though I just want to say that you know

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:47.450
though I just want to say that you know
 

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:50.020
though I just want to say that you know
when a machine is responding in English

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:50.030
when a machine is responding in English
 

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:53.020
when a machine is responding in English
say there's so many more dimensions of

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:53.030
say there's so many more dimensions of
 

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.590
