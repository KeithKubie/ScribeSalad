00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
Today, we're going
to be building

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.900
a Harry Potter style magic wand
with a shocking twist.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:13.360
[Music]

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.840
Guys, I love Harry Potter.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.200
I love Harry Potter so much.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.200
I've read all the books.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.300
I've watched all the movies,
and just a fan all around.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.100
And something that I've
been wanting to build

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.000
for a long time is a magic wand

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.100
that actually will deliver
a small electric shock.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.500
Now, I don't want anything

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.100
that's going to truly
incapacitate or injure someone,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.180
but I did want something
that's sort of a prank,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.880
and you can just touch someone
with it, press a button,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.466
and they get zapped
a little bit.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.600
So, here's what
we're going to be doing.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.400
We've got these
gag shocking pens.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.300
If you've never seen one

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.700
of these before, here's
how they work.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.600
It's pretty simple.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.224
There is a functioning
pen to it,

00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:49.407
but it looks
like it's gonna be a click pin.

00:00:49.407 --> 00:00:52.200
And so you give it to someone
with the pen not extended,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.300
they try and click it,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.266
and when they do,
it's zaps them.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.400
The body of the pen
and the top here are conductive,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.900
and when you press
down on the top,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.700
it connects all
of the wires inside,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.600
and it delivers a small buzz.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000
It's not something
that's going to hurt,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.200
because it's intended as a joke.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.100
It's just startling

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.900
when it's suddenly
buzzes your thumb,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.866
instead of just extending
the pen at the bottom.

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.000
So what we're going to do
is we're going to take all

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.920
of the electronic guts
out of this pen,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.010
change things up a little bit
so we have a button

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.100
that turns it on and off,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.999
and some leads
at the front of the wand.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.399
Hopefully, we'll end up
with a wand with a shock.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.500
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.000
We'll use a couple of dowels
and the inside parts

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.200
of a shocking gag pen
to build a wand

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.900
that can deliver a tiny
electric shock to your friends.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.900
Along with the dowels
and the shocking pens,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.688
that were going to take all
of the insides out,

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:36.350
we've got a few things
we're going to add in.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.218
First, I picked up a set
of these other batteries.

00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:39.400
I grab these at Harbor Freight.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.930
This whole pack was about $4.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.200
There's a lot
of different varieties.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800
We're going to be using one
of these smaller sizes.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.100
The bigger ones won't be able
to fit too well.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.300
I also grab this cheap
little flashlight.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.733
It didn't even work
when I bought it.

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:52.249
That's okay,

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:53.900
because all we want
is the push button

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.500
on the inside of the flashlight.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
We're going to be
taking that out.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.800
If you have a good way to buy
those buttons individually,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.400
that works too.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.900
This just happened
to be at the store

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.800
where I already was.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.474
And then I also have a couple
of varieties of wire.

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:07.000
This is some insulated wire

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.469
that I pulled out of
some old Cat 5 cable,

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.600
and this right here is
a decorative copper wire.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.234
It has an enamel coating on it,

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.763
and that enamel coating
is actually non-conductive.

00:02:16.763 --> 00:02:18.230
You can scrape it away to get

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.988
to a conductive portion
of the wire,

00:02:19.988 --> 00:02:22.300
so this stuff works really
well as enamel wire,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.200
which is also
weirdly hard to find.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.400
Now, the reason we
got additional batteries,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.800
even though the shocking pens
do come with some,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.500
is that the batteries
in the pens are really weak.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.560
These pens are
not very expensive,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.400
and the batteries that come
with them are pretty cheap.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.880
They die quickly,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.000
and I suspect that they
don't have quite the voltage

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.900
that they're supposed
to in the first place.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.799
These batteries that I'm using
are actually also fairly cheap,

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.312
but they definitely seem
to have more of a charge

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:48.510
to them than the ones
that come in the pen.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.540
Time to break
into our shocking pen,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.000
and look at
the electronics inside.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.100
So this part just
sort of twists off,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.100
that's some metallic insides
that just kind of get shredded

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.800
as we do that.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.820
This plastic portion up here
we're going to use part of

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.800
this down here,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.890
we're not going
to be using in there.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.000
Glued together, so the easiest
way to separate them...

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.600
Just to break through it.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.500
That's okay because we
didn't want this portion.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.400
We're just going
to be using this top bit.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.800
So now this splits apart,
we can see our insides.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.900
Here's what we need.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.330
There's this portion,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.056
here which has all
of our connection points

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.080
to the wires.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.160
I'm actually going
to be taking my gloves off.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.820
The point of this thing is

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.185
that it gives off
an electric shock,

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:28.700
and I want to be able
to feel it to know

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.758
that I have it set up right.

00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:32.049
If it's not working correctly,
I need to know.

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.200
And easiest way to do that is
just to touch the things,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.395
and see if it's zapping me.

00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:36.900
So let's take a look
at this thing,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.900
how it works.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.500
So if I am touching this spring,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.500
which is in contact
with those batteries,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.987
and I touch this end as well,
it starts buzzing,

00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:47.500
and you've, maybe heard
my voice jump a couple of times

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.000
when I touched it by accident
when I wasn't expecting it.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.659
It's not that
it's super painful.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.200
It's just surprising
when you're not ready for it.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.522
So as long as I'm in contact

00:03:55.522 --> 00:03:57.700
with this lead here
and this lead here,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.300
it gives me a nice little buzz.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.640
We don't want it
to be always on.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.360
We want to add a switch,
a button on the outside,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.760
and that's why we have
our tiny little flashlight here.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.640
[Music]

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.960
This is why we
got the flashlight.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.760
It is for this
tiny little switch.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.100
It doesn't click on it off
the same way as some switches.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.700
It's just if you're holding
down the button, it's on,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.400
and that's exactly what we want.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.542
We only want the electricity
of the one to be connected

00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:25.000
while we're pressing the button.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.749
We are not going
to be using the LED bulb,

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.200
so we can just clip that off.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.080
There's our little button.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.850
We'll have this red wire
here going to our button.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.620
We will take the spring off
and attach it up here.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.689
We'll have the wire

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.023
on the other side
of our button going back,

00:04:39.023 --> 00:04:40.241
touching the spring,

00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:43.040
and then a second wire,
coming off of that,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.300
going out through our wand.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.817
Those two will run all the way
up to the tip of the wand,

00:04:46.817 --> 00:04:49.200
and that's what we're going
to use our shocking point.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.900
We've got a couple of
these pieces of the plastic case

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.420
that were inside of the pen,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.005
and we actually
do want to use those.

00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.900
We just need to trim
them down a little bit,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.120
sort of the right size.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.820
Now, these two,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.420
the little pegs at the bottom,
hold this all together...

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.000
It's very nice and compact.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.900
That's something we can fit
inside the handle of the wand.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.500
One of the trickiest things
about this whole setup is

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.162
how small we need
to get everything.

00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:16.300
We really need to compact
it down quite a bit.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.520
So I'm just going to do
a little bit of wire bending

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.200
on these pieces right here
to make everything fit

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.335
a little bit nicer.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.800
So before this little plastic
plate was facing straight up,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.751
I have bent it back in
and over again.

00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:29.451
So you can see

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.400
that the wire is here
are doubled around.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.680
That's just going to keep
everything a little bit shorter,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.500
and that will make it

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.650
so we can fit inside
the handle of our wand.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.600
Our springs and our
battery are in place.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.300
So now, we're just going
to take this cover,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.400
and throw it back on.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.600
That will stop our batteries
from popping out

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.590
like they like to do.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.454
All right.

00:05:45.454 --> 00:05:46.538
This part is prepped.

00:05:46.538 --> 00:05:48.500
Let's set that aside
for a few minutes.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.500
Get started on the want itself.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.620
Right here, I have
a 1/2 inch dowel.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.640
We need to run wires
through a portion of this.

00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:58.292
We're going to cut it off,
so it's about that long.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.520
We're going to cut it
in half lengthwise first though.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.800
We want to be able to run wires
in the inside of this dowel,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.000
and carve out a channel,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.500
and then glue it together
around the wires.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.720
[Music]

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.580
Now, we need to split
it in the long way.

00:06:14.581 --> 00:06:16.800
And to do that,
we're going to use a band saw.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.080
[Music]

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.200
Now, we want to choose a length.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.716
I think that looks pretty good.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.480
I'm going to cut
that off right about here.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.940
Because we use the bandsaw,

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.100
these two pieces fit
really nicely together.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.640
However, it does leave a little
bit of tooth mark on the inside,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.200
so we're just going
to take some sandpaper,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.760
and try and smooth
that out a bit.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.840
[Music]

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.720
And we want to cut a channel

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.560
all the way down the length
of the whole thing,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.360
and we can cut into one side
or both sides,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.960
either way works.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.100
This split actually ended
up being quite even,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.300
and so I think we're just going
to cut a little bit of a groove

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.100
into both of those.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.800
There's lots of ways you
could cut this groove.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.951
You could use just a razor blade
and a steady hand.

00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:02.500
I'm going to try
using a rotary tool.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.600
I think it will be
a little bit quicker and easier.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.380
[Music]

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.880
What we need is a channel
that's just big enough

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.000
for some of this wire.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.900
Two strands of it,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.000
and they come with
two strands twisted together.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.540
So that's just like...

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.039
To be able to fit down
through the channel of the wand,

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:19.549
and now, a space
that we can glue them together,

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:21.693
and have the size
of the wood meeting up.

00:07:21.693 --> 00:07:23.693
One other change
we're going to do.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:24.244
You can see

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:27.297
that I didn't take the channel
all the way to the end of wood.

00:07:27.297 --> 00:07:30.397
And that's because we don't just
want a big open channel there.

00:07:30.397 --> 00:07:31.153
We're going to add

00:07:31.153 --> 00:07:33.000
two more smaller channels
coming off of that,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.300
and a little bit of the wire
with the coating stripped off is

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.300
what's going to stick out
from the top of those.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:46.600
[Music]

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.500
Got our two lead wires.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.800
However, these are just
a little bit to stabby.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.720
We don't want to
be injuring people.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.800
We're going to be shocking them,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.327
but it's a light shock that's
not supposed to really hurt.

00:07:56.327 --> 00:07:58.900
So what we're going to do to
round these out is we're going

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.460
to add a little drop of solder
on to the tip of each one.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:08.900
[Music]

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.480
Now, we need to glue this wire
inside that channel.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.640
[Music]

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.560
That should be plenty of clamps.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.600
While that glue is drying,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.600
let's work on some of the
internal portions of our wand.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.820
We've got the basic housing
and battery set up,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.720
and that's all going to fit
inside of our handles.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.100
So now we need to go
about making that handle.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.100
We're actually going

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.140
to drill a hole lengthwise
down into the dowel,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.032
and that's gonna be
just large enough to fit

00:08:38.032 --> 00:08:39.050
our electronics inside,

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.000
as well as working
as a connection point

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.200
between the handle
and the shaft of the wand.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.900
With the hole drilled out
into the larger dowel piece,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.100
we can see that everything
can now fit down inside.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.340
That's exactly what
we're going to need.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.800
We do want to do a little bit of
decorative work on the handle,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.200
and we're actually going to do
that right now.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.100
Because it's going to end up
thinning out parts of the top,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.483
and we just want to make sure

00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:01.200
that we have
everything all complete,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.400
and lined up just right.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.790
It's gonna be
a little bit easier

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.040
if we do this part
first rather than after.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.980
[Music]

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.800
All right, there's some
decoration put on the handle.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.059
I've seen some other people do
some interesting stuff,

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:15.960
making their own Harry
Potter wand handles,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.500
where they use things
like hot glue

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.900
or melted wax to add
some other texture onto those.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.600
If that's something
you like doing,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.600
by all means,
you should go ahead and do that.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.300
For this one,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.652
I'm just going
to use some sanding,

00:09:25.652 --> 00:09:28.300
give it a little bit of shape
and texture down at the bottom.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.300
You can see I didn't do
too much of the top.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.865
That's because the walls
up at the top

00:09:31.865 --> 00:09:33.600
where I've drilled it
out are fairly thin.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.412
I didn't want to risk
cracking or sanding

00:09:35.412 --> 00:09:36.500
through the edges there.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.860
So the top part
is mostly untouched,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.300
and I did quite a bit
more texture down at the bottom.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.900
Wingardium Leviosa.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.700
Which is not going to work
because the ones not done yet.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.200
Time to do a little
bit more soldering.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.920
[Music]

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.240
Our button is going to go
on the outside of the wand.

00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:57.100
So we need to add
some access points

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.710
for the wires to go
through the side of the handle.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.800
We're now using
our smallest drill bit.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.800
[Music]

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.200
Glue has had plenty
of time to dry.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.800
Now, we need to shape
this little bit more.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.800
Right now, it's just
shaped like a dowel.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.050
That's not very exciting.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.130
So back to the belt sander.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.230
I'm going to take some
of these sides down,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.700
make it a little more tapered.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.700
There we go.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.625
As I was tapering it,

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.146
I decided I kinda wanted to
match the handle a little bit,

00:10:25.146 --> 00:10:27.312
and it gave it a little bit
of a spiral cut to it.

00:10:27.312 --> 00:10:29.700
Kind of makes it look like
a unicorn horn or something.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.200
Okay.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.100
So now we need to have

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.376
one of these two wires
attaches to the spring,

00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:36.500
and the other one
of those wires attaches

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.207
to this green piece
of wire here.

00:10:38.207 --> 00:10:40.200
So let's clip
everything shorter,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.300
do some more soldering.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:55.240
[Music]

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.332
All right. I gotta try something.

00:10:56.332 --> 00:10:57.520
It's not going to feel good.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.200
[Music]

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.720
That like causes
a muscle in here

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.900
to just completely cease all at once.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.700
Okay.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.200
Last thing I want
to do is just add a bit

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.603
of finishing color to this.

00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:13.630
So it doesn't just look
like plain pine,

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.800
so we're at least going to make
it look a little bit snazzier.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.360
[Music]

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.400
The wand is complete,
and I have some volunteers.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.745
I volunteered them

00:11:23.745 --> 00:11:26.100
to participate in me
testing this out.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.436
Josh, how do you
feel about that?

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:27.980
I feel great.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.263
Yeah.

00:11:28.263 --> 00:11:29.200
I feel like a victim.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.060
Don't worry.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.100
You can shock me with it too.

00:11:31.102 --> 00:11:32.101
So, it's pretty simple.

00:11:32.101 --> 00:11:32.852
There's a button,

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.400
and then these two leads have
to make contact with the skin.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.180
It's a little bit of a tingle.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.200
And and it depends.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.100
It changes a lot depending on
where on your skin it is.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.350
Yeah.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.600
So I've had lots of times

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.049
where just like
buzzes a little bit,

00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:46.199
and then I've had times

00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:48.700
where I feel it running all
the way up through my fingers.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.300
If I put it right
here on my arm,

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.740
I can actually feel it buzzing.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.300
It's nothing crazy
like a taser or stun gun.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.000
Exactly.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.700
I didn't want something that
was going to like injure people.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.840
It's completely involuntary,
isn't it?

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.300
Makes the muscles contracted.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.300
Let's go for
a right, right here.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.500
[inaudible] on me.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.200
I'm going to try one finger on,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.500
and then touch the other side
with my tongue.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.800
[Music]

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.490
I can feel it in my finger
and my tongue.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.840
I don't feel it traveling
the path between them.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.480
All right.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.515
But I have done it on my tongue.

00:12:19.515 --> 00:12:20.710
Just one side on your tongue,

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.167
and the other side
on Josh's tongue.

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:22.500
What?

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.000
No.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.420
We're not going to try that.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.212
Just kidding.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:26.964
That's funny.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.200
The trick of this
is really engineering

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.331
everything to be small enough
to fit inside the handle,

00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:31.869
but it works,

00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:33.805
and you can wave it around,
and do magic spells.

00:12:33.805 --> 00:12:34.600
Wingardium Leviosa.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.300
It's Leviosa.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.140
Wingardium Leviosa.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.400
Made the camera float away.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.320
I'm very talented wizard.

00:12:42.323 --> 00:12:48.640
[Music]

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.200
