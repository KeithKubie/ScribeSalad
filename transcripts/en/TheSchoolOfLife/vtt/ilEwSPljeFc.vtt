00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.500
Our brains are brilliant instruments,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.400
able to reason, synthesise, remember and imagine at an extraordinary pitch and rate.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.700
We trust them immediately and innately – and have reasons to be deeply proud of them too.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.800
However, these brains – let’s call them walnuts in honour of their appearance – are also very subtly and dangerously flawed machines.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.300
Flawed in ways that typically don’t announce themselves to us

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.960
and therefore give us few clues as to how on guard we should be about our mental processes.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.420
Most of the walnut’s flaws can be attributed to the way the instrument evolved over millions of years.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.000
It emerged to deal with threats; some of which are no longer with us,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:54.600
and at the same time, it had no chance to develop adequate responses to a myriad of challenges generated by our own complex societies.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.600
We should feel pity for its situation

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420
and compassion for ourselves.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.500
Attempting to live requires us to adopt a focused and ongoing scepticism

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.300
towards a great many of the ideas, schemes and feelings generated by the faulty walnut

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.940
that stands at the top of our spinal column.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.540
Here are just some of the many things we need to watch out for:

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.080
&gt; The walnut is influenced by the body to an extent it doesn't recognise:

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.200
The walnut is extremely bad at understanding why it is having certain thoughts and ideas.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.800
It tends always to attribute them to rational, objective conditions out in the world,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.200
rather than seeing that they might be stemming from the impact of the body upon its thought processes.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:45.360
The walnut doesn’t typically notice the role that levels of sleep, sugar, hormones and other physiological factors play upon the formation of ideas.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:54.000
The walnut adheres to a psychological intepretation of plans and positions that are, at heart, frequently merely bodily.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.680
Therefore, the walnut can feel certain that the right answer is to divorce or leave the job right now

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.680
rather than go back to bed or eat something to raise blood sugar levels.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.020
&gt; The Walnut is influenced by its past, but can’t see its own projections:

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.480
The walnut believes it is judging each new situation on its own merits,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.100
but it is inevitably drawing upon patterns of action and feeling shaped in previous years.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.320
This saves time, and has real evolutionary advantages,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.660
except that many situations in the present are in fact deceptive,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.820
resembling the past only sufficiently to trigger a familiar response,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.580
while in fact having many unique characteristics that get overlooked.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.020
At moments of ambiguity, the walnut can jump to some catastrophic conclusions.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.060
&gt; The Walnut doesn’t like to stop and think:

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.460
The walnut evolved for rapid, instinctive decision-making --

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.500
and has a grievously hard time stepping back to address what we might term the big first order questions.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.700
So bad is the walnut at thinking, it often needs another walnut nearby to help it along its way.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.340
Thinking generates anxiety and a desire to run fast in the opposite direction

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.580
because of the difficult truths the walnut might unearth.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.020
But in the presence of another walnut, we can’t so easily bolt and turn back to the web.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.600
That’s why philosophy started as a conversation

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.820
and psychoanalysis depends on two people unpacking one person’s thoughts and associations.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.580
Sadly, we rarely call on other walnuts to help us to think

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.040
and usually pass the time with walnuts chatting idly about sport or the latest celebrity scandal.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.440
&gt; The walnut is bad at self-control and gets passionate about, and scared of the wrong things:

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.000
The walnut constantly gets excited about things which aren’t good for it:

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.180
sugar, salt, and sex with strangers for a start the list.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.400
Advertising knows how to exploit this cognitive frailty to perfection.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.520
Our confusions can generally be traced back to targets that would once have been crucial and fitting for us to focus on.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.440
Our desires used to be reliable in simpler environments,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.620
but in the complicated conditions of modernity, they cause chaos.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.500
The same holds true for our fears:

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.300
in the past, fears were simply bound to things that could kill us.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.640
Fears were a good idea to get us out of genuine dangers.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.580
But nowadays, many things excite our fear systems without there being any real threat.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.380
We have panic attacks before speaking in public for no good reason

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.800
while at the same time, the real, more subtle threats of modern life (global warming or another subprime mortgage financial crisis)

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.700
evade our detection radars entirely.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.700
&gt; The walnut is egocentric, not polycentric:

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.400
The walnut is primed to look at things from its own point of view.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.360
It often simply can’t believe that there are other ways of considering an issue.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.600
Other people can therefore seem perverse, or horrible to it – sparking outrage or self-pity.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.180
It’s only in the last second, from an evolutionary point of view,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.620
that the walnut has started to try to imagine what it might be like to be someone else

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.220
(a symptom of this is that it’s learnt to take pleasure in novels).

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.600
But this is still a fragile empathetic capacity, which tends to collapse,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.040
especially when the walnut is tired, and someone is trying to persuade it of a strange-sounding idea.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.940
&gt; The walnut isn’t an independent thinker:

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.480
The walnut grew up dependent for its survival on the mood of the group or clan.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.780
It's  therefore highly primed to fit in with common sense and prevailing opinion.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.000
It doesn’t generally like to use itself as a source of original data or insight.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.800
Other people’s opinions matter hugely irrespective of how foolish they might be – or indeed widespread.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.800
Because we came from small groups, one or two compliments can delight us; one criticism can sow panic.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.160
This is tricky in the age of Twitter.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.140
&gt; The walnut misunderstands causality:

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.280
The walnut used to think it might have been responsible for the lightning in the sky

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.660
and that earthquakes were a result of its own bad thoughts and deeds.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.280
It took a while for that skewed perspective to be overcome.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.740
But the walnut so constantly projects personal dynamics and overproduces generalities based on things that have happened to it:

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.580
the walnut is trapped by personal rather than statistical or objective experience.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.620
Being more vigilant about the flaws in our walnuts gives us a range of important advantages:

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.860
We can get better at noticing the potential errors in our judgments and ideas.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.100
We start to avoid mistakes when we know mistakes are a constant active possibility.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:28.080
Then, when we deal with other people, we can start to ask ourselves whether they might be acting from a walnut flaw, but not be aware of this.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.160
This can make us both bolder about disagreeing with them

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.200
and also kinder and more generous in the face of their less than sensible behaviours.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.900
And then, when we deal with large groups of people, we can be aware that the walnut does very weird things in packs

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.940
but that’s OK

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.020
and no reason to panic if we find our ideas are meeting with resistance.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.120
At heart, compensating for the faulty equipment that nature has given us is the task of what we call:

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.160
education, culture and civilisation.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.600
The flaws in the walnut are also what makes it imperative that we try to act with kindness and tolerance:

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.500
we should at all times go easy on ourselves and others,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.000
for we’re trying to do some very difficult things around one another,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.500
with the use of a highly troublesome and only intermittently accurate tool.
