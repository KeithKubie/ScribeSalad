00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.510
We've talked a lot about
the formations of mountains

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.080
and volcanoes when plates
are running into each other,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.290
or when one plate is being
subducted under another.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.930
But that isn't
the only place, it

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.430
is the dominant place
or the most likely place

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.349
to find mountains and volcanoes
on the surface of the Earth,

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.890
but that's not the only place
that mountains or volcanoes can

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.390
form.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.900
And probably the biggest
example of volcanic activity,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.400
or the most popular
one-- this might

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.480
be a slightly American,
Amerocentric point of view,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.510
but the most often cited
example of volcanic activity

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.075
away from a plate
boundary is Hawaii.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.980
So this right here, these
are the Hawaiian Islands.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.110
This is the big
island of Hawaii,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.020
and it is experiencing
an active volcano.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.130
Lava or magma is flowing
from underneath the ground,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.170
and once it surfaces
we call it lava.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.360
And that lava is actively
making the island bigger.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.250
So where is that volcanic
activity coming from?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.599
And then how can we think
about that volcanic activity

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.680
or that kind of heat rising from
below the surface of the Earth

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.380
to explain some of the
geological features we

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.700
see around Hawaii?

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.850
So what we think is happening,
and once again, this

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.500
is all theory right
here, is that Hawaii

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.460
is sitting on top of a hot
spot, and in particular,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.880
the big island of Hawaii is
sitting on top of the hot spot

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.140
right now.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.870
And this hot spot,
there's different ways,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.790
different theories on
how it might emerge.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.640
But we think that at the
mantle core boundary--

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.890
and I don't know in this
diagram whether they intended

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010
this white area to be
the core, but let's just

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.020
say that this is the
outer core down here.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.640
Let's just say that
this is the outer core

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.630
for the sake of
explaining things.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.120
It's possible that just based
on the fluid dynamics of what's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.840
happening at that mantle
outer core boundary,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.576
that plumes of really hot
material can kind of rise up.

00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:07.950
Let me do this in
a darker color.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.610
They could rise up
from the outer core,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.220
and then create hot spots
underneath the moving

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.120
lithospheric plates.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.930
Now, we don't know for sure
whether the hot spots are being

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.010
created by these mantle plumes,
these material formed or heated

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.020
up at the outer core
mantle boundary.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.920
But what we do feel
pretty confident about

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.630
is that there is
this hot spot here,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.490
and it's independent of any
of those convection patterns

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.990
that we saw.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.156
I shouldn't say independent.

00:02:39.156 --> 00:02:40.850
It's obviously all
related because we

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.480
have all this fluidic motion
going on in the mantle,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.339
but it's separate on some degree
from all of those convection

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.380
patterns that we talked
about that would actually

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.310
cause the plates to move.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.260
And to a large
degree, or the way

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.960
we think about it right
now, this is stationary,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.210
this hot spot is stationary
relative to the plates.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.600
And the reason why we feel
pretty good about thinking

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.280
that it's stationary
relative to the plates

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.250
is we see this
notion right here,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.400
if you look at the volcanic
rock in Kauai, which

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.020
is one of the older inhabited
Hawaiian Islands, the oldest

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.970
rocks that we've observed
there is 5.5 million years old,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.534
and it's all volcanic rock.

00:03:24.534 --> 00:03:26.200
Now, the oldest
volcanic rock that we've

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.810
observed on the big island
is about 700,000 years old.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.730
We also know that
the Pacific Plate,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.950
you could look at this
diagram right over here,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.090
is moving in this
general direction.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.320
We know it from
GPS measurements.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.910
It's moving exactly
in the direction

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.920
that the Hawaiian Islands
are kind of a distributed in.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.100
So frankly, the only
good explanation

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.260
for why we see this pattern,
why we see newer land here,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.100
and then as we go further and
further up the Hawaiian Island

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.620
chain we see older
and older land,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.630
and actually if
we keep going, we

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.470
have the Leeward
Islands over here.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.350
And as we keep measuring the
rock on the Leeward Islands

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.660
they get older and older
as you go to the Northwest.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.680
And then if you even look
at what's below the ocean,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.110
this is the big
island of Hawaii,

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.610
these are the main
Hawaiian Islands,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.990
these are the Leeward Islands.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.010
But you see even beyond that
submersed under the Pacific

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.620
Ocean you continue to
see a chain of islands.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.520
So the explanation for
what's happening here

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.280
is that you have a
stationary hot spot that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.790
is right now underneath
the big island of Hawaii.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.880
And I just want to be
clear, the big island

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.500
is called the island of Hawaii.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.050
It is one of the islands
in the state of Hawaii.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.830
So I don't want to
cause you confusion.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.210
I'll just call it the big
island from here on out.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.650
So the hot spot is right
under the big island.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.450
But if you were to rewind
5 million years ago,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.100
the entire Pacific
Plate was probably

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.990
on the order of about
150 to 200 miles,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.020
however far Kauai is
from the big island,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.390
it was probably shifted
that much to the southeast

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.820
if you go back 5
million years ago.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.750
So 5 million years
ago, when all of this

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.700
was shifted down and
to the right, then

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.390
Kauai was on top
of the hot spot.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.220
And so this is how each of
these islands are formed.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.059
If you rewind a ton of years
then maybe this area over here

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:30.850
on the Pacific Plate
was over the hot spot.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.750
An island formed there.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.900
Then the Pacific Plate kept
moving to the Northwest.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.760
It kept moving to the Northwest,
and new islands, new volcanoes

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.340
kept forming.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.440
Those volcanoes would release
lava that would keep piling up,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.910
keep piling up, keep
piling up, eventually go

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.060
above the surface of
the water and form

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.250
this whole chain of islands.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.080
And as the whole Pacific Plate
kept moving to the Northwest,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.420
it kept forming new islands.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.980
Now, the one question
you might ask

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.580
is, well, how come the
big island is bigger?

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.440
Has a plate kind of
paused over there?

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.510
Is it spending more
time over the hot spot

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.720
so that more lava can kind
of form there to form this?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.960
Essentially, it's an
underwater mountain

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.850
that's now also above the water.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.530
And actually if you go from
the base of the Pacific Ocean

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.500
to the top of the
big island of Hawaii,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.590
it's actually 50% higher
than Mount Everest.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.450
So you could really just
view it as a big mountain.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.820
But the question is this looks
so much bigger than Kauai,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.319
and they keep getting
smaller as you

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.620
keep going to the Northwest.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.610
Is it somehow the
Pacific Plate slowing?

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.030
Is it spending more time here?

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.140
And the answer is it's
probably not slowing.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.750
What's happening is at one time
Kauai was also probably also

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.700
a relatively large island.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.520
If you rewind maybe
5 million years ago

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.390
Kauai also might have
been about that big.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.800
But over 5 million
years it's just

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.801
experienced a ton of erosion.

00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:52.050
Remember, once it moved over
the hot spot and new land

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.797
wasn't being created it's in
the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

00:06:54.797 --> 00:06:55.880
It's experiencing weather.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.250
5 million years is a
long period of time.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.110
And so it just got
eroded over that time.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.320
So the older the island is, the
more eroded it's going to be,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.800
and the smaller
it's going to be.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.541
So if you go to these
underwater mountains

00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:10.040
up here that don't even surface
above the ocean, at one time

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.030
they might have surfaced, but
due to the ocean and weather

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.060
and whatnot they've just
been eroded over time

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.662
to become smaller and smaller
kind of remnants of volcanoes.

00:07:19.662 --> 00:07:21.120
So anyway, I thought
you would find

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.720
that entertaining of how the
Hawaiian Islands actually got

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.220
formed, and how we
can actually have

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.140
these hot spots, and
this volcanic activity,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.740
and actually even
earthquake activity

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.764
outside of actual
plate boundaries.

00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:36.680
Actually, while we're
looking at this diagram,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.330
we talked about the trenches
at plate boundaries.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.020
You can actually see it here
because this shows the depth.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.370
And the really dark,
dark, dark, dark blue

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.840
is really deep
parts of the ocean.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.920
So this right here is
the Mariana Trench.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.030
And you can see over here
the Pacific Plate just

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.420
getting abducted.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.340
Or not abducted, getting
subducted into other plates

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.890
underneath and forms
these trenches here.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.420
Anyway, hopefully you
found that entertaining.
