00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:05.940
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.550
Welcome to the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.420
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.550
I'm Dean here at the
Institute and I'm

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.350
so glad to have you all here
on this beautiful sunny day,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.780
finally.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.060
At the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.160
we support and convene scholars,
policy makers, scientists,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.710
and artists from
all around the world

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.710
to work across disciplines
and at the forefront

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.240
of their fields.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.850
And we are committed to
sharing that knowledge

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.210
and thought provoking discussion
with a broad and interested

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.560
public.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.680
In order to do that, Radcliffe
offers a full calendar

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.630
of public events
throughout the year,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.440
including lectures, exhibitions,
seminars, conferences,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.640
and more.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.730
For example, right now you
can visit an exhibition

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.040
at the Schlesinger
Library entitled,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.080
"Playing Fair, Title IX at 45,"
which displays photographs,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.250
video, and archival materials
to tell the story of women

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.660
athletes before and after the
landmark legislation of Title

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.740
IX.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.590
The exhibition can be found two
doors down from this building

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.190
at the Schlesinger library
and it will be up until June.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.150
It's open all day and you can
visit during lunch or breaks

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.450
today.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.690
Later this spring, we'll
continue the exploration

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.440
of title IX's legacy and
its impact with a panel

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.860
discussion co-hosted with WBUR.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.550
And featuring Maura Healy,
who brings her experience,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.910
not only as Massachusetts's
Attorney General, but as

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.320
a former basketball player.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.210
Many people may not know
that Maura co-captained

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.180
the basketball team at
Harvard as an undergraduate

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.790
before going on to play
professional basketball

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.290
in Austria.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.720
Maura will be joined by Olympic
ice hockey medalist, Angela

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.180
Ruggiera, and Boston Globe and
WBUR sports reporter, Shira

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.330
Springer for a probing
discussion on the progress

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.450
we have made towards
gender equality in sports

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.970
as well as the obstacles
that still remain.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.040
That panel will take place
on Tuesday, May 16th at 7:00

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.380
PM, right here in
the Knafel Center,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.690
and you can register
on our website.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.770
And finally, on Friday, May
26th our spring programming

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.400
will culminate in Radcliffe
day, an annual celebration

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.760
of Radcliffe's past,
present, and future.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.030
Each year on this day we
award the Radcliffe medal

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.270
to a person who has had
a transformative impact

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.810
on society.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.500
This year we will
honor two women

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.770
who have made a profound mark
on the field of journalism,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.650
Judy Woodruff and
the late Gwen Eiffel.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.690
That day long event
is an opportunity

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.290
to honor Judy and Gwen's
groundbreaking accomplishments,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.440
both as a team and
as individuals.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.210
It will include a
panel discussion

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.150
to probe the challenges
facing journalism today.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.079
Please visit the
Radcliffe website

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.870
for more information
on the day and how you

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.510
can obtain tickets to attend.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.540
Today we are gathered for
Radcliffe's annual gender

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.650
conference.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.030
Each year we examine an issue
such as violence, immigration,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.260
or the evolving use of language
through the lens of gender.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.190
Such complex topics require
an interdisciplinary approach,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.050
which we will bring
to bear today,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.490
drawing on the expertise
of coaches, CEOs, athletes,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.240
journalists, and a neurologist,
just to name a few.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.780
A conference like this one
is only possible with lots

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.610
of help and support.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.710
I'd like to take a
moment to thank everyone

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.140
who has made today a reality.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.020
First, thank you to our
supporters, many of whom

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.520
are with us today.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.070
Your generosity
allows us to ensure

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.270
that events like this one remain
free and open to the public.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.780
Thank you for your participation
in our annual fund.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.140
Thank you as well to the faculty
organizers at this conference,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.510
Janet Rich-Edwards
and Yukio Lippit,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.760
who worked with Executive
Director of Academic

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.040
Ventures, Rebecca
Wasserman, and her team

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.290
to organize today's event.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.540
Thank you to the members
of our hardworking planning

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.870
committee including Sean
O'Donnell, Susan Ware, and Ceri

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.950
Blauwet.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.860
And thank you to the performers
at last night's art event

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.920
as well as to the former
fellows, Lydia Diamond

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.170
and Martha Ackmann,
whose collaboration

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.930
brought that wonderful
performance to life.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.140
And thank you to the many
professors, coaches, students,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.820
and Harvard
community members who

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.160
gathered last
spring to brainstorm

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.770
for this conference
with us, and they

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.500
held associated events
all year long related

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.000
to today's conference.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.340
And finally, thanks
to all of you

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.380
who are coming here
today for this conference

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.860
from as near as Harvard
Yard, and as far away

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.220
as Atlanta, San Francisco,
and Lubbock, Texas.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.740
We also welcome many people
from around the world

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.470
who will be viewing
our conference online.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.010
It's exciting for us to see
such an enthusiastic response

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.030
to this year's topic
from so many corners.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.100
One reason for
such great interest

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.650
in a conference about
sports and gender

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.860
is that the topic is both
very timely and timeless.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.730
Its current relevance
is all around us.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.090
Athletic teams at Harvard and
at many other universities

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.020
this year have had to confront
troubling demonstrations

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.260
of demeaning attitudes
towards female athletes.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.110
Just last week, the
US women's hockey team

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.160
made the news when they struck
an unprecedented deal with USA

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.440
hockey for higher wages.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.450
All it took was the
threat of a boycott,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.930
15 months of tense
negotiations, and an open letter

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.970
from 16 US senators.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.120
The questions raised by
the intersection of gender

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.210
and sports are certainly
newsworthy today,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.220
but those questions
have been present

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.100
around the world
for much of history.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.340
Early artwork from ancient
Egypt to medieval Europe

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.070
featured male and
female human figures

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.680
swinging at balls with sticks.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.870
But despite their
widespread appearance

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.800
across many times and places,
neither sports nor gender

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.360
are unchanging.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.550
Both are shaped by social,
political, economic,

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.250
and cultural context.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.350
Let me give you an example.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.880
In the early decades of
the 19th century, sports

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.610
we're actually regarded
poorly in Western society.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.020
Games were all very well for
children, but for adults sports

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.880
were morally suspect.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.940
Men who aspired
social respectability

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.970
rejected popular sports
like prizefighting

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.190
as vulgar and overly physical
pastimes of the lower classes.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.810
But by the
mid-nineteenth century,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.320
things began to change
with new movement called

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.420
muscular Christianity.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.030
Beginning in England and
spreading to the Northeastern

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.120
United States,
muscular Christianity

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.900
equated physical fitness
with moral health,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.870
and linked both to masculinity.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.120
In order for members
of the upper class,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.670
both men and women,
to claim sports

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.640
as elite and respectable,
however, sports

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.780
had to be repackaged from
a rough and tumble pastime

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.970
into an activity
befitting gentlemen.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.510
And it wasn't an
easy shift to make.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.630
As late as 1859,
Harper's Magazine

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.470
insisted that grown adults
who indulged in sports

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.640
must be either, and I
quote, "milksops or bad me."

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.940
How then, did proponent's
of athleticism

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.170
finally legitimize men's
participation in sports?

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.230
Promoters of sporting
events began inviting women

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.890
to sports games in an effort
to infuse those events

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.580
with the values of Victorian
womanhood such as refinement,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.950
delicacy, and propriety.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.340
Team owners provided special
tents and refreshments

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.360
for women spectators, and
women assumed specific roles

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.310
such as presenting bouquets or
game balls to winning teams.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.490
For sports to become
more respectable for men,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.540
both men and women
took on new roles.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.890
Of course, in 1860, women's
roles were decidedly limited.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.660
They could attend games.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.330
They could bestow
flowers on winners.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.940
They could even play
a number of sports,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.300
so long as they
didn't keep score.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.350
As for competing, only men were
supposed to do that for fear

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.010
that competition might
make women too coarse.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.090
It should be clear that
sports provide a powerful lens

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.280
for understanding
much larger questions

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.640
of an historical
time, and sports

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.650
continue to offer that
similar critical lens today.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.410
Now as then, sport
and gender are

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.760
inseparable from each other.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.310
Now as then, gender disparity
is a major characteristic

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.780
of sports.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.620
Today, women compete,
but not on equal footing.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.760
Even in tennis, the sport
lauded for coming closest to pay

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.730
equity, discrepancies remain.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.980
In 2015, Roger Federer won the
men's Western and Southern open

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.250
and received more than $700,000.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.610
Just hours later, Serena
Williams, arguably

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.690
the world's most outstanding
athlete, won the women's title

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.060
and she collected a prize
of less than $500,000.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.510
If inequities between men
and women have persisted,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.080
in other ways the relationship
between sport and gender

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.280
has changed over time.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.030
We now face questions
about steroid use

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.090
and athletic performance,
neurological damage

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.800
while competing, and the rights
of transgender participants.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.180
These questions and more require
an interdisciplinary approach

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.260
capable of considering the many
complexities of gender, sports,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.640
and society.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.740
That is what brings
us all here today.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.890
I just want to say
before we move on

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.190
that we want to treat
you to a reception

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.920
at the end of the
day at Fei House

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.170
to celebrate our
panelists and organizers.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.170
So I look forward to
talking with you then.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.390
It is now my pleasure
to turn things over

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.570
to Susan Ware, who will
moderate the first panel.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.240
Susan is an acclaimed
historian and the biographer

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.570
of such notable figures as
Billie Jean King and Amelia

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.390
Earhart, as well as the
editor of the latest

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.550
volume of Notable
American Women,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.320
a biographical dictionary.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.410
Susan currently serves as
general editor of the American

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.830
National Biography and she
is also the honorary Women's

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.710
Suffrage Centennial Historian
at the Schlesinger Library,

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.850
here at Radcliffe.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.080
Please join me in
welcoming Susan Ware.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.455
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.320
- Good morning.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.840
Thanks so much for coming and
very glad to have you here.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.370
This session is organized around
a seemingly straightforward

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.280
question, who gets to play?

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.110
Yet like many of
the other issues

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.950
we'll be discussing today,
the answer is far from simple,

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.140
and certainly not static.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.380
Our main focus is on
what role gender plays

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.720
in access to
sports, but we can't

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.090
address that in isolation.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.130
So we'll also be
exploring questions

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.930
of race, class, sexual
identity, and disability.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.380
We want to think carefully
about which sports

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.410
we're talking about,
recreational sports,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.140
high school or
college athletics,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.070
international competitions,
or professional leagues.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.940
We want to explore how the
United States system conforms

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:56.250
to or differs from how sport
is organized around the world.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.660
We want to think about special
challenges to sports access.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.350
How can an athlete compete
in international competition

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.280
if she's a stateless refugee
or cannot find the appropriate

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.180
athletic gear to accommodate
her religious beliefs.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.570
We won't necessarily be able
to cover all of those topics,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.070
but we certainly
hope that we will

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.950
start conversations
that will continue

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.180
for the rest of the day.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.930
So in many ways,
in certain ways,

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.480
this is the history panel.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.780
We're exploring how the
question, who gets to play,

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.430
has changed over time, and
how this historical trajectory

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.150
might influence who's
next in staking a claim.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.730
So it seems
especially appropriate

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.650
that it's taking place in the
former Radcliffe gymnasium.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.800
One glorious summer
afternoon several years

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.850
ago, I snuck into the
building in my running gear,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:59.790
and I ran 16 laps, a mile,
around the upper level track.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:05.160
And as I circled the gym,
I felt a literal connection

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.280
through the floorboards
to the generations

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.960
of Radcliffe athletes who
had also run on that track.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.330
What must they
think, I wondered,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.680
of the opportunities available
to female athletes today.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.260
Opportunities that would
have been inconceivable

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.070
in their time, indeed
inconceivable probably

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.830
to certain members
of this audience.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.070
And yet-- and there's
always that catch--

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.760
so much has happened, especially
in the last five decades,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.810
and yet women athletes are
still nowhere near anything

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.570
approaching gender
equity in athletics.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.680
So drawing up a balance sheet
between the undisputed progress

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.630
in widening access versus the
ongoing structural and societal

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.060
barriers to full
participation will

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.780
be a recurring theme
of our panel, indeed,

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.440
of the whole conference.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.720
And it's especially
relevant to take stock

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.160
as Title IX, the US law that
played such an important part

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.890
in fostering the revolution
in women's sports,

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.100
turns 45 this year,
which is a plug

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.710
to visit the exhibit,
Documentary [INAUDIBLE] History

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.540
at the Schlesinger library.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.760
So now it's time
to hear about who

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.020
gets to play from our stellar
panel who's full biographies

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.940
are in the program.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.290
But I am delighted to share the
stage with Donna Lopiano, who

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.560
is the former CEO of the
Women's Sports Foundation,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.110
one of my favorite
groups, and now president

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.750
of Sports Management Resources.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.470
With Anita DeFrantaz, a longtime
member of the International

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.840
Olympic Committee, and boy
I'm sure she could tell us

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.740
stories about that, and a
bronze medalist in rowing

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.080
at the 1976 Olympics.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.890
And Stephanie Wheeler,
a 2004 and 2008

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.460
Paralympics gold medalist in
women's wheelchair basketball,

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.550
who now coaches at the
University of Illinois.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.010
So after their
presentations, the panelists

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.010
will spend some time
talking among themselves

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.220
about common concerns,
and potential points

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.250
of disagreement, and then we'll
open the floor to questions.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.530
So with that, I just have to
say, let the game changers

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.006
games begin.

00:15:18.006 --> 00:15:20.436
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.610
- So, it's my job in
this first 15 minutes

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.090
to give you the
history of Title IX.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.190
From 30,000 feet,
give you a sense

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.280
of what the current statistics
are and to answer the question,

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.440
how close are we
to gender equity?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.820
And then I want to take a
view from ground zero look

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.120
at Harvard's athletic program.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.190
Wherever I go to speak,
I always make sure

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.120
that the home team gets
my attention, for sure.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.560
So let me see if this works.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.630
OK, so, this is quick and dirty.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.360
Research shows that the
faster the speaker speaks,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.400
the greater the
retention of the audience

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.660
because you can't fall asleep.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.820
I learned that when I
went to my first job

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.990
at the University of Texas.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.980
Everybody was kind of
scary in terms of Yankee

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.350
speed of speech.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.330
Anyway, I've always
I've always referred

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.830
to the civil rights laws in
the US as the perfect trifecta.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.310
They all use the same language,
whether it's the Civil Rights

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:30.550
Act of 1964, or Title IX of
the 1972 education amendments,

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.980
or the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.620
followed by the
Disabilities Act of '93,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.600
it's all the same language.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.720
If you are receiving
federal funds,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.140
you cannot discriminate on
the basis of, and then fill

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.880
in the blank.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.860
Very simple law.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.430
Nobody knew it applied to
intercollegiate athletics

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.730
until the law firm,
the Washington D.C law

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.730
firm the NCAA asked the
question, in early 1974,

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.869
does it apply to
extracurricular activities?

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.240
And the answer was
then yes, but you

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.540
should know that Title IX
was never an athletics law.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.569
It was fully intended
by Edith Green and Birch

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:17.109
Bayh, who were the co-sponsors
of the original law,

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.510
it was fully intended
to open the doors

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.750
of professional graduate
education to women.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.510
It was an Equal Pay
Act issue at the time

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.690
that they realized that women
couldn't get paid more if they

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.412
didn't have advanced degrees.

00:17:30.412 --> 00:17:31.870
And there were
quotas on the number

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.330
of women who were admitted
into medical school, who

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.810
were admitted into law
school, who became engineers.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.880
If your father didn't
build a building,

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.509
you didn't get
into those programs

00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:44.800
because they were afraid you
were going to have babies,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.450
and your education would
be absolutely wasted.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.350
But anyway, so the
NCAA in 1974 says,

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.250
does this law apply to
intercollegiate athletics

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.080
and extracurricular activities?

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.110
The answer is yes and
all hell breaks loose.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.750
Darrell Royal, who is then
the president of the American

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.350
Football Coaches Association
was quoted across the country

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.120
as "Title IX of
women's athletics

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.460
would be the death of big
time football as we know it."

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.900
Horrors, horrors to be.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.610
And one of the great things
about the entry of the football

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.730
establishment was that it was
the invitation to the media

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.150
to equally cover the issue.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.880
If Darrell said
this about what was

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.740
going to happen
to football, what

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.080
were the women going
to say in terms

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.030
of the effect of Title IX?

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.330
And the leaders of women's
athletics at the time

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.750
were female physical educators.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.220
Well-educated,
they've researched

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.480
the impact of sport
participation on girls,

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.080
and they hit the media
with a salvo of research

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.910
supported fact that to this
day has never been rivaled.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:58.810
They were quick.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.120
They didn't attack football.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.170
They were just
simply saying, guess

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.340
what, girls who play sports
are less likely to experience

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.640
sexual harassment, are less
likely to get a heart attack.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.090
They just listed all the
physiological benefits

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.680
of sport.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.260
Psychologically, they
have stronger self-images.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.440
They have higher levels
of competence, confidence,

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.950
they are more likely to
succeed in life after sport.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:28.000
And the end question was
hey, sport does great things

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.560
for your son and your daughter.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.530
Do you want your son and
daughter to be treated equally?

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.860
And the answer was
a resounding yes.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.300
So this benefits to
girls media message

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.440
wielded by fact supporting--

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.060
I know you haven't heard that
recently-- fact supporting

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:53.380
women in the business
really made a dent in terms

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.290
of public sentiment, and you
can see what the figures are

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.260
in terms of the percentage
of the public that

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.690
is in support of Title
IX, even if it means

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.550
lost opportunities for men.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.860
And then the last point
to be made, historically,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.150
is it really was a
father led movement.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.250
Mom never had the
chance to play sports.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:17.410
Dad all of a sudden had
a single point of contact

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.600
with surrogate son.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.150
My daughter is playing sports.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.530
I can have a catch with
her in the backyard

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.210
and the biggest advocates
of sport became fathers.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.510
And it was this
father-mother combo

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:38.030
that really has been
responsible for the staying

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.480
power of the law.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.830
Let me mention one more
piece of this puzzle.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.460
There was an accident
in history that

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.100
ensured that Title IX could
never be tampered with,

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.040
and that accident was when
the football coaches made

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.900
their stink.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.920
Congress responded
by saying well,

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.680
we'll make sure that the
regulations interpreting

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.470
the law's application
to sport get

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:08.990
issued before the law goes
into effect so everybody

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.720
knows what the game's about.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.180
That never happens
to regulations.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.530
Usually a law
passes, it's debated

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.900
in the courts for
10 years, and then

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.600
regulations eventually evolve.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.940
In this case, tons
of regulations

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.060
on the application of title
IX, specific to sports,

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.630
were issued, and every
single court case

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.660
has deferred to
those regulations.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.900
And you don't have any of the
disagreements in the court that

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.200
typically follow the passage
of a new law like this.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.230
And I think that
accident of history

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:52.890
is singularly responsible for
the stability of Title IX.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.350
All right, the view from
30,000 feet-- and I'm

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.140
going to go through
this stuff very quickly.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.530
When you look at
high school sports,

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.220
you're looking at
in 1971 and '72.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.010
Men having about 3.6
million opportunities

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:12.120
to play compared to
294,000 for women.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.300
What is interesting is when you
look at it in '14-'15, the last

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.770
available data.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.080
Women at the high
school level still

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.690
have not achieved the
participation levels

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.690
that men had in 1971.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.980
They are still 1.1 million
opportunities short

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.170
from matching up
to their proportion

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.340
in the general student body.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.510
One thing this data shows
us is that it has not

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.340
been a zero sum game.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.500
The fears that the football
coaches and everybody

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.960
else expressed
with Title IX where

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.780
oh, if you give women the
chance to play then they're

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.300
going to take opportunities
away from your son.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.690
And you can see from this
data that it never happened.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.030
Men's participation
and boys participation

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.640
has continued to grow at the
high school and the college

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.540
level.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.170
It has not been a zero sum
game, and interestingly,

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.170
over the last decade,
men's participation

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.160
has grown at a quicker rate.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.910
More opportunities
have been added for men

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.210
than have been added for women,
despite the fact that women

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.790
are still under-represented
in high school sports.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.730
The picture at the
college level is the same.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.960
It's almost identical.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.920
So you're looking at numbers
in '72-'73 versus '14-'15.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:34.380
At the college level, 57% of
all college undergraduates

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.460
are female.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.690
Only 43% of all
athletes are female.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.810
And same animal in terms
of more opportunities

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.150
have been added for men
in the last 10 years

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.250
than have been added for female.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.550
So instead of this
gap getting smaller,

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.910
which it started to do in
the first 30 years or so,

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.700
it's now starting
to peel apart again.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.480
So the gap is greater.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.250
So why is this happening?

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.590
Right?

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.720
As the wrestling
coaches will tell you,

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.540
every time a wrestling
program is dropped

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.540
it's because of Title IX.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.390
Men's sports are suffering
because of what's

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.320
happening for women, with
women, and the answer

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.290
is just the opposite.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.850
What is happening
is that men's sports

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.920
are getting dropped
so that money

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.530
can shift to fund the arms race
in football and basketball.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.350
And you can tell because
men have been growing

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.220
more than women, and women
are still not close to equity,

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.740
and nothing's been done
over the last 10 years.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.750
You can tell that's
true, but you can also

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.160
tell from this chart.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.200
If you look at that bright
yellow 328 up there,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.760
this shows you the net gain
and loss of sport programs

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.440
for men and women.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.660
You can't just look
at drop programs.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.940
We add and drop
sports all the time.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.426
In the 70s women
didn't play soccer.

00:25:02.426 --> 00:25:04.050
Men didn't play soccer
in this country.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.030
We sure didn't play lacrosse.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.230
We were playing badminton.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.090
We we're playing field hockey.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.310
So sports change all the time.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.590
So you have to look at what
the net gains and losses are.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.700
So you can see that in women's
sports, it's always net gains.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.760
In men's sport, in Division
two and three, which

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.760
are the least financially
supported sports,

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.230
in Division two and three,
men's sports continue to grow.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.050
Division one, the richest
programs in the United States

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.240
are the ones that
are dropping sports,

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.810
and they're doing it
to fuel this arms race.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.920
If you look at the percentage
of the men's sport budgets

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.280
that go to just
these two sports,

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.910
and knowing that Division one is
the highest competitive level,

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.890
you're looking at FBS, the
college football playoff,

00:25:54.890 --> 00:26:00.630
81% of the men's sports
budgets among these 125 FBS

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:05.670
institutions, 81% percent
go to just those two sports.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.430
And the number that really
kills me on this chart

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:13.570
is look at Division 1, no
football, third row down.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.910
Right, Division 1, no football.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.110
So there's no football
players, zero.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.790
There's just men's basketball.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.920
And men's basketball,
those 12 players

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.430
are getting 44% of the
men's operating budget.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:32.380
So have no doubt that why this
is happening in terms of men's

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.860
non-revenue sports
being dropped.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.920
This is a quick and dirty in
terms of the financial support

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.600
of men's versus women's sports.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.940
Title IX does not
require equal dollars.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.070
It doesn't.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.970
But if you look at the money
picture, follow the money,

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:52.970
you can see there's smoke
here, and where there's smoke,

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.760
there's usually fire.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.980
And this gives you a good idea
of how poorly women's sports

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.430
are still supported in
every single division.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.820
Yes, football is more
expensive than other sports,

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:12.120
but when you look at
these of funding gaps--

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.270
I testify in Title IX
lawsuits all the time.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.520
Believe me, there are
very few institutions

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.930
in this country that are in
compliance with Title IX.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.180
Media coverage of women's
sports-- and Mike Messner,

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.700
I love Mike Messner, is going
to speak on this later on.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.390
So I'm not going to
spend time on this.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.890
But fortunately, we have--

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.820
Mike, is it still true that
we are getting more coverage

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.990
than the horses and dogs?

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.460
[CHUCKLES]

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.930
- Unless the horses
and dogs are being used

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.420
to make fun of women's sports.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.390
- I got it.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.840
But seriously, horse
racing and dog racing

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.580
used to be covered
more than women.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.290
I think we might
have surpassed that.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.895
Newspaper coverage is
a function of what does

00:28:00.895 --> 00:28:03.980
a sports editor want to see.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.130
What does the sports editor
want his writers to write about.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.530
Sports editors do
not take surveys

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.200
and see what the public wants.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.926
So we don't have very
many women or people

00:28:14.926 --> 00:28:16.800
of color, for that
matter, in sports editors.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.590
You can see that
in our coverage.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.910
When you look at college
sports leadership,

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.960
this is where the real
crimes are being wrought.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.437
You're looking at
roughly 80% of--

00:28:28.437 --> 00:28:30.020
I don't care whether
you pick coaches,

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.560
athletic directors,
administrators, 80%

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.330
are white males.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.370
And that's a large statement.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.340
But roughly, that's
about what it is.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.720
And these numbers are
worse for persons of color.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.160
So you can see that in
terms of employment,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.840
Title IX has not had a
concomitant effect on women

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.460
in terms of employment.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.500
Now, the view from
ground zero, and I know

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.020
you don't have glasses, OK so--

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.610
and these are very
small numbers,

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.100
but I want you to look
at the last column only.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.360
OK?

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:11.330
This is the female participation
gap at each of the Ivy League

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.280
institutions.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.990
So that is the number of women's
participation opportunities

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:23.330
that need to be added
for women to comprise

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.140
their percentage in these
respective student bodies.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.740
So I've kept men's
participation constant

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.030
and just did a simple
mathematical formula.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:39.980
So as you can see,
Harvard is only 122

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:44.780
shy in terms of
having to do something

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.349
more for women's sports.

00:29:46.349 --> 00:29:48.140
So I'm here to tell
you that Harvard is not

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.570
in compliance with Title IX.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.614
But why don't I end with that.

00:29:52.614 --> 00:29:56.486
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:56.486 --> 00:29:58.910
- Well done.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:29:59.960
- Thank you.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.290
Good morning.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.730
My name is Anita DeFrantz and
I come from points beyond.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:09.260
I was just in
Denmark where there

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.680
was a gathering of all the
international federations

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.380
of the world that are part
of the Olympic movement.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.100
And this is important to
us because, in many senses,

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.970
the Olympic movement has
kept sports alive worldwide,

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.440
not intentionally.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.120
And certainly, people know that
Pierre de Coubertin wasn't that

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.620
much of a fan of women's sport.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.470
In fact, he's quoted as saying
that the purpose for women

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:39.890
is to applaud politely the man
as they endeavor through sport.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.410
To his credit, he
never prohibited women

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.160
from competing.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.900
He never put up a rope.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.750
He just did not support it much.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.700
I wanted you to
get a sense for how

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.030
the Olympic movement has grown.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.980
Sports opportunities
have grown and I

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.850
hope you can see it
better than I can.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.970
You'll see that in
the year 19,000,

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.220
the number of sports
for women were two,

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.610
the number of national
Olympic committees were five,

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.770
and the number of
participants were 22.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.300
As you go down,
eventually you'll

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.980
get to the Olympic
Winter sports,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.854
when that lighter color is--

00:31:14.854 --> 00:31:16.520
boy, that's really
hard for you to read.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.470
I'm sorry.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.340
The lighter color is
added, then you have

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.260
both the Olympic Winter Games.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.470
Look at 1924, both
the Olympic Winter

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.660
Games and the Olympic games.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.250
Very modest number.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.970
The men's numbers are not
that much more significantly,

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:35.690
but over time, slowly but
surely we have more numbers,

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:39.200
and that means across
the world, if we

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.870
were to put up the numbers
of women competitors

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.580
from the United
States, it would be

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.870
much larger than any other
country, for which I am proud.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:51.110
I then learned that
by the year 2000

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:54.320
there were fewer than 2000 women
who had represented the United

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.890
States at the Olympic games,
which is such a tiny number.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:01.760
The numbers will get larger
because we needed to do that.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.790
Still, this gives you a
snapshot of the numbers

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:10.730
of women competing at the games
throughout modern time, which

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.320
for us, started in 1900.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.500
Now this one-- percentage
is also important.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.840
The percentage of
events for women because

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.280
at a certain point women had a
better chance at winning medals

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.370
than men did, mathematically,
because there were actually

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.160
more events for women,
and a smaller number

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.920
of women competing,
and that helped

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.820
the national Olympic
committee to recognize

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.300
that they could be more
successful if only they

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.060
were to support their women,
and they could go home

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.410
with more medals.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.780
Now, I didn't announce
this too loudly,

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.710
but we kept putting the numbers
up, and they finally got that.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:50.200
And indeed, you'll note
starting in at least 19--

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.280
I'm sorry, starting
in 2008, '12, and '16,

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.490
many of the larger teams
had more women than men.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:02.630
And Indeed, the mighty
nation Bhutan had no men,

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.950
but only had women on their
Olympic team in Rio de Janeiro.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.230
You start seeing that
there is a recognition

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.850
that your country can be made
proud by having women athletes.

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:18.230
When one of the goals of
the IOC, since our Congress

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.910
in 1994--

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.140
Congress means we bring together
not just this International

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.820
Olympic Committee, our annual
meeting is called the Session.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.640
But we bring together along
with IOC members, the National

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.630
Olympic Committee members.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.170
There are now 206 National
Olympic Committee members.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.610
That's more members
than there are

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.500
members of the United Nation.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.160
In part because Puerto Rico
has its own National Olympic

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.500
Committee and others who
would not necessarily

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.890
be recognized by the UN
as separate countries.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.490
So there are more NOCs
than there are countries

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.530
for historical reasons.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:59.660
And we also, for the games
in Rio, created something

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.010
called the refugee team.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.790
We recognized that there
are people in these refugee

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.560
camps, some of whom have
been there for decades,

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.909
and we wanted the
young people who've

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:12.000
grown up there to have a
chance to be Olympians.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:17.897
So the first ever refugee
team competed in Rio.

00:34:17.897 --> 00:34:19.730
And by the way, we don't
just say OK, great.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.479
Thanks for coming.

00:34:20.479 --> 00:34:22.880
You competed, you did well, bye.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.889
We stay with those
members of the team.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:26.660
We help them get placed.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.159
We help them develop
the skills they

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.130
need to get back into
society and some of them

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.230
are continuing to compete.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.630
So moving on, I wanted
you to see the overall--

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.480
the curve.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.540
And you'll see that the men are
continually on an upward swing,

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.179
but that's the total number
of athletes at the games.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:51.920
And the women start to
go up, and up, and up.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.030
Just quickly, from
1900 to 1984, there

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.970
were about 12,000 women who
competed at the Olympic games.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.300
From 1988 to 2016,
there have been

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.330
over 30,000 women who have
competed at the Olympic games.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.240
Which to me, says that there
is a large cadre of women

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.680
available to give back, who
are of the proper age group

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.410
to be able to give
their time, and take

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.300
on positions of leadership.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.670
The IOC has made it
clear that we believe--

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.700
if you can believe
that we believe this--

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.140
that the world is made
up of at least 50% women,

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.170
probably more, but
at least 50% women,

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.750
and therefore the number
of athletes at the games

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.020
should reflect the
world, and the number

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.480
of positions in
leadership should likewise

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.201
reflect the world.

00:35:41.201 --> 00:35:43.200
Studies have been done
throughout the world that

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.900
show that boards of
directors that are equally

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.850
made up of women and men,
what a shock, equality means--

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.520
none of this equity
stuff for me, equality.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.360
Those boards do
a much better job

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.430
of leading their organizations.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.400
They're much more successful
than other boards.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.460
So if you know of any boards
they are predominantly made up

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.024
of one sex other than
the other, you can just

00:36:08.024 --> 00:36:10.440
tell them they would do better
if they would get their act

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.850
together and even it out.

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.347
It's all for the better.

00:36:13.347 --> 00:36:14.430
That's what we want to do.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.110
We want to make things better.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:21.330
So, you can see from this chart
that slowly, far too slowly,

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.520
but certainly, we're
moving towards equality

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.810
at the Olympic games.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.100
One other thing that happened.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.530
As we move towards
more equality,

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.220
we noticed that the reporting
at the Olympic games

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.800
became proportionate.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.990
In other words, if
your team was made up

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:45.450
of 40% men and 60% women,
the reporting on the games

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:50.820
was made up of 60% women
stories and 40% male stories.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.000
I don't know how the
journalists do that,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.910
but it followed that trend,
which is even more compelling

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.650
to have equal numbers of
athletes, men and women

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.990
in the game so we can get
equal number of reporting.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:08.010
And the remarkable thing is
they can do it for two weeks

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:09.630
during the games.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.490
I think you can
probably do it forever

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.930
if you really wanted to.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.980
It works.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.860
So we need to get
people understanding

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.200
that it does work
and the world will

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.780
be a better place when we get
more of the stories out there.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.590
OK, the next slide has
to do with the new sports

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.060
on the program.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.890
There are new sports
on the program

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.710
and that is one messed up chart.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.070
I'm sorry.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:38.640
Where it says year, just put
the zero over so it's 1900.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:43.129
1994, things like that.

00:37:43.129 --> 00:37:43.920
So you can do that.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.050
You guys are at Radcliffe.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.380
You can move the
chart, move the column.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.930
And you see how long it took
to get some of the sports

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.170
on the programme, which
is really amazing.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.570
1976, which were
the great games--

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:58.780
yes, that's when I competed.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:37:59.780
There we go.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.980
1976, go!

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.930
Yeah!

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.112
Finally, rowing, basketball.

00:38:06.112 --> 00:38:08.070
Did you realize that
women's basketball was not

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.240
on the program of the
Olympic games until 1976?

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.240
Then it goes much faster as
we move along from that point

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.300
and the games in London
was the first games when

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.140
all the sports on the
program had women's events.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.350
It took us from--

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:31.140
let's see, 1896 to 2012
to get all of the sports

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.960
on the program for
men, for women.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.770
It's often pointed out to
me that men do not take part

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.750
in synchronized swimming.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:40.530
Not true.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:45.300
At the Fino World Championships,
it was a mixed event.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.290
And the gentleman who all
those many years ago complained

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.630
bitterly that he was
not allowed to compete,

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.270
his duet actually won
the world championships

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.510
in mixed synchronized swimming.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.500
I've lost his name, but I'm sure
Twitter, Google, or somebody

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.880
can find his name for you.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.680
So, yes, synchronized
swimming has found its way

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.670
to making opportunities
for men and women.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.710
It's important to
know that there are

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.000
sports that continue to go on.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.780
In the Olympic
Winter Games we were

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.200
coming very close to parity,
then new sports came on,

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.720
and I will confess I was
asleep at the switch.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.780
I was no longer in charge of
the Women and Sports Commission

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.760
and what happened was a lot
of these new sports came on,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.470
and nobody was
reminding them that you

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.620
have to have equal numbers
of women athletes and men

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.670
athletes.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.130
And they didn't because
unfortunately, guys

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.650
were in charge again,
and guys do what they do.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:47.080
They say OK, let's have
a lot more guys here.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.360
Oh, women, let's
have some women.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.640
These are new sports
so who's going

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.400
to notice that we have
twice as many men as women.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.420
Well, after the fact I noticed.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.740
So it's going to take us a
while to get back to equality

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.590
at the Olympic Winter Games
because of one set of games

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:07.390
where they put 20 men in and
only 10 women in the sport

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.410
of say, border cross.

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.830
You all know what
border cross is.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:17.270
And I'm not making a
political comment on this.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:18.430
It's a lot of fun.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:23.410
You line up four skiers at the
top of essentially moguls hill

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:26.530
and they race to get across
to the finish line first,

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.150
often bumping into one
another along the way,

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.090
making it exciting to
see who will make it

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.190
to the finish line.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.137
But that sport-- how many
women really why do that?

00:40:36.137 --> 00:40:36.970
Well, I'll tell you.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.860
A lot of women want to do that.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.510
It's fun.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.180
But not so many got the
chance at the games.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.790
All right, now I do
have to hurry along.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:46.990
The last games.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.900
What we do at the IOC
is we pay attention.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.360
You'll see here, if you can't
see it, that we pay attention

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.670
not only to the number
of athletes there,

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.389
but we pay attention to the
National Olympic Committees

00:40:57.389 --> 00:40:59.680
and whether or not they have
women in their leadership.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.320
Where they have
women, [INAUDIBLE] who

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.010
is the person in charge
of the team at the games,

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.780
where they have women as
flag bearers and where

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.450
they have accredited media.

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.760
We're looking at the
numbers because if you

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.680
watch the numbers,
you can see if things

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.310
are going that direction we
say we want them to go or not.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.460
We are paying attention to
how the games are presented.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.250
We're paying attention
to who gets to be there

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:28.060
and what their experiences
are at the games.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.130
This has been a very
fast overview of a very--

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:37.870
complicated is not the right
word, but confusing might be.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.150
The way the Olympic
movement is structured,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.650
the International
Olympic Committee

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.600
owns the Olympic games.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.460
We're the only ones
who can say, yes,

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.070
this is where the
Olympic games will be.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:51.400
The IOC decides what sports
will be on the program,

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.030
but the International
Federations control the sports.

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.100
The National Olympic
Committees are the ones

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.210
who enter the athletes.

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:04.740
It's often said that
there's three pillars

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.740
of the Olympic movement.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.270
Well, I think there
are four, and I

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:11.780
prefer the pyramid, which oddly
enough has four sides to it.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.670
We think of a pyramid
and the triangle,

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.050
but it has four sides.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.760
So I think the athletes
are a very essential part

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.750
of the Olympic movement.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:20.840
We have to have athletes.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.270
We have to have
International Federations.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.095
We have to have National
Olympic Committees

00:42:24.095 --> 00:42:25.970
and we have to have the
International Olympic

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:30.760
Committee, or sports would
exist, but the others would not

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.247
without the International
Olympic Committee.

00:42:34.247 --> 00:42:35.830
I'm sure they'll be
lots of questions.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:39.460
I've spoken a lot of Olympic
languages with alphabet soup

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.794
and I hope that you'll be
able to remember the questions

00:42:41.794 --> 00:42:44.209
because you're going to hear
a lot more interesting things

00:42:44.209 --> 00:42:45.280
than I have to offer.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.890
Bottom line, we had Title IX.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:52.210
How on earth did women get to
the starting lines in countries

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.520
throughout the world that
didn't have Title IX?

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.040
In part, the NCAA
helped that greatly

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.230
to get women to the line,
but it is really miraculous.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:06.280
And through the determination of
other women like Alice Milliat,

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.950
who is a French woman who
in the 1920s made sure

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.980
that women had track and field.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.420
They called it athletics.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.570
track and Field, and she put on
track and field events that had

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:20.920
20,000 spectators, which
is why you see in 1928,

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.460
track and field coming onto the
Olympic program in the way it

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.070
should have back in the 1900's.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:30.370
And with one minute and
22 seconds left, oops 20,

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:31.738
I will end my presentation.

00:43:31.738 --> 00:43:32.238
Thank you.

00:43:32.238 --> 00:43:34.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:38.850
- OK.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.800
I'm going to stay here
and do my presentation

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.335
because you guys wouldn't be
able to see me over there.

00:43:44.335 --> 00:43:46.800
So I'm kind of rounding
everything up and talking

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.810
about disability
and how disability

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.690
plays into who gets to play.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.360
And I come at this from a couple
of different perspectives,

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.943
three different
perspectives actually,

00:43:55.943 --> 00:43:57.927
as I go through my presentation.

00:43:57.927 --> 00:43:59.760
So the first is kind a
landscape of where we

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.400
are with just disability sport.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.100
I think it's really relevant
and important to talk about that

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.630
before I move onto
the gender piece,

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:09.780
because they intersect and
they do play into one another.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.240
And I'll talk a little bit
about the role that gender plays

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.490
in disability sports,
and then wrap it up

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.340
with a current example
of this question of who

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.140
gets to play, where
do they get the play,

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:23.480
and what's the structure
around them getting to play.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.600
All right, so, to start
out with where we are,

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.260
I'm not going to bore you
guys with too much relevant US

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.600
law and case law, but I
think the biggest thing

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.310
to understand with that is--

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:36.570
and I know Anita talks about
this a lot in her presentations

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.440
and what she believes as far
as sport being a human right,

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.300
and who's allowed to play.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.910
Well, as you guys can see
through some of this US law

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:47.340
and case law, for
the longest time

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.220
it's been a privilege for
individuals with disabilities

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.660
to be able to play sport.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.662
It has not been a right.

00:44:52.662 --> 00:44:55.120
And so the only way that they've
been able to access sport,

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.450
that we have been
able to access sport,

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.150
is through law
that you see here.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:01.980
Relevant US law,
Title IX, Rehab Act,

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.480
which Donna spoke about in
her presentation, the ADA.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.140
And in relevant case law with
Casey Martin vs. the PGA,

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.810
McFadden vs. Cousins, which
is Tatiana McFadden, who's

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.460
a pretty well-known
female racer right now.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.060
And so those are
the opportunities

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.870
that we have had to sort of
assert our right to play sport

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:24.410
and our right to get
to the line, basically.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:27.090
That's how we as individuals
with disabilities

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:29.230
get to the starting
line, quite often,

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:32.250
is it has to be through
relevant case law.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.890
The last two pieces, and more
importantly the last piece,

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:38.010
the OCR "Dear Colleague
Letter" of 2013,

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.960
that's been one of the
most important pieces

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.180
of clarification
and legislation that

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.320
moved our opportunity the
most for that I've seen,

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.990
in the past probably
10 to 15 years.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.620
And basically, what that is was
a clarification of section 504

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.240
for the Rehab Act.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.150
Stating that you do have
to provide extra curricular

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.240
opportunities for your
students with disabilities

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.090
in your schools.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.450
And so it's a clarification
of that saying

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:04.680
this is what you have to do.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.580
OK, so along with
that kind of privilege

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.990
by having to go
through case law,

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.000
and having to go
through US law, we

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.310
talk a lot about
who gets to make it

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:19.220
to international and
professional opportunities

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.330
to play sport.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:22.314
On the left you have
able-bodied individuals.

00:46:22.314 --> 00:46:24.480
They kind of have this
defined path of where you go.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.156
Play at recreational
level, youth

00:46:26.156 --> 00:46:28.280
sport level, scholastic,
intercollegiate, national,

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.710
international, professional.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:33.680
It's a pretty linear progression
for able-bodied individuals

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.240
to get there.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.700
On the right side, you have
people with a disability

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:42.230
and we have play and recreation
level to some extent.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:44.090
That's more your
interscholastic level

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:46.160
where you have
opportunities for PE

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.130
or you have
opportunities outside

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.555
of school for those
extracurricular activities.

00:46:51.555 --> 00:46:53.180
They're not completely
there right now.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.763
They're moving in
the right direction,

00:46:54.763 --> 00:46:57.950
but there is some
opportunity that exist there.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.170
Youth and sport level,
there are youth sports

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:02.930
level opportunities for
kids with disabilities

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.430
to play sport, depending
upon the sport.

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:08.990
Scholastic, that's more
of your high school.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.050
Not a lot of that exists
outside of special recreation

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:16.160
opportunities, special
recreation associations.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.930
You don't see a
lot of students who

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:20.099
get to compete for
their high school.

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:22.640
You see it-- and this is where
some of that relevant case law

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.026
comes into play.

00:47:24.026 --> 00:47:25.400
You get to see
it, on some level,

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.490
in individual sports
where students

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:29.750
have been awarded the right--

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.940
the right and the
privilege to be

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.820
able to compete on their
track teams and earn

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.012
points for their teams.

00:47:36.012 --> 00:47:37.970
And they go to state and
national competitions,

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:39.428
or the right to
practice with them.

00:47:39.428 --> 00:47:40.880
You see it in swimming a bit.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.490
Where you see the hole
is in team competitions.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:45.050
And later on in the
presentation I'll

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:47.060
talk a little bit about
that differentiation

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.710
and what that looks like.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.882
Intercollegiate, another
huge hole exists.

00:47:50.882 --> 00:47:52.340
Again, later on in
the presentation

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.230
I'll come back and
address that a little bit.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:55.730
And then international
professional.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.410
That's actually
far more developed

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:00.200
than we see at the national
intercollegiate level

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.020
with the Paralympic games,
with professional opportunities

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.570
to play sports, team
sports actually,

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.354
and the opportunity to be
professional swimmers, racers,

00:48:08.354 --> 00:48:10.020
and that kind of thing
across the world.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.290
So who makes it to here?

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.110
We can all make it
to there, but there's

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.690
significant gaps in our
ability to be able to play

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:19.160
at those different levels.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.602
Just to kind of make this
tangible and show examples.

00:48:21.602 --> 00:48:23.060
At the University
of Illinois we're

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.610
really fortunate to have
a pretty robust disability

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:26.780
support program.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:31.370
And our student athletes achieve
at a very, very high level,

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.920
winning championships,
winning races.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.560
What we think of as achieving
on the athletic side.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.600
And our student athletes,
when they come back

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.480
from an international
competition,

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.780
winning, succeeding,
there's zero recognition.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.740
There's zero support
from athletics

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.140
from my university
in the same way

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.657
that you would see their
able-bodied peers received at.

00:48:53.657 --> 00:48:55.740
We have had teams that won
national championships.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:00.260
We come back and it's just null.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.380
Mentioning Tatiana
McFadden earlier.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.730
Her legend is growing, and it's
getting bigger, and bigger,

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:06.230
and bigger.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:07.610
And those of you
in the Boston area

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.360
will get to see that
in a couple of weeks.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:14.000
But she was a student athlete on
our campus for a very long time

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.465
before she made this
transition into being

00:49:17.465 --> 00:49:18.710
a professional athlete.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.810
And the way I kind of
conceive and think of this

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:24.540
is who wouldn't want her to
represent their university?

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.040
Right?

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.036
And who wouldn't want any
of our student athletes

00:49:28.036 --> 00:49:30.410
wearing Illinois, or wearing
Harvard, or wearing whatever

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:32.390
school that might be across
their chest because they're

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.340
such great representatives
of your university

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.760
or of your high school
where those gaps exists.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.260
They train in the
exact same way.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.590
They compete in
the exact same way.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:47.840
That gap exists there and it's a
gap that we're looking to fill.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.256
Just looking at-- based off
that last little chart, when

00:49:51.256 --> 00:49:52.880
we talk about being
otherwise qualified

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.860
to participate in all of
these levels of competition,

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.730
what we're basically talking
about is skill and talent.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.790
You meet certain criteria
of age, or of gender

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:07.160
or of classification level,
whatever it might be.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.940
But then we have this
otherwise qualified caveat,

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.450
and that equals skill, and
it narrows as you get higher.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.450
You have to have a higher
level skill as you get

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.250
higher and higher on the chart.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.780
And for athletes
with disabilities,

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.360
you don't move up this chart
just because you're disabled.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.490
You don't move up this
sort of progression

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.576
just because you
happen to be somebody

00:50:24.576 --> 00:50:26.450
that has a disability
that live in this area.

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.100
You have to have skill.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.317
It's an intentional way for
you to get to that point.

00:50:30.317 --> 00:50:32.900
And so it's really important to
understand those two parallels

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:37.229
between how able-bodied
athletes rise to that pinnacle

00:50:37.229 --> 00:50:38.645
and how athletes
with disabilities

00:50:38.645 --> 00:50:39.561
rise to that pinnacle.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:43.940
Just to kind of
touch on and go back

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.070
to the case law a
little bit, there

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:47.762
is a growing demand
for participation,

00:50:47.762 --> 00:50:49.220
and that's the
question that we get

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.770
a lot is who's going to play?

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:52.511
Where's the critical mass?

00:50:52.511 --> 00:50:54.260
Where are the athletes
that are demanding?

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.740
Well, it's there.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.610
We kind of have our outliers of
people like Tatiana McFadden,

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.005
or when you look in
the Olympic games

00:51:01.005 --> 00:51:02.630
with like a Natalie
Du Toit or somebody

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.060
like that, who has competed
with a disability at both

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.460
the Olympic and
Paralympic level.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.210
You have these outliers,
and while they're

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.820
great to sort of start
the conversation,

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.080
they don't sustain.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.680
Critical mass is what sustains
competition at a higher level,

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.390
and so there are
student athletes that

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:22.727
are demanding equal treatment
as varsity athletes, excuse me.

00:51:22.727 --> 00:51:24.560
It's through those
administrative complaints

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.181
and lawsuits.

00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:27.680
Athletes with
disabilities are going

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.350
to impact a greater demand
for similar opportunities

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:33.560
at the collegiate level, where
we're beginning to see that now

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.741
as we move forward.

00:51:34.741 --> 00:51:36.740
And then I think as this
generation's coming up,

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.895
they're going to be more
expectant of equality,

00:51:38.895 --> 00:51:40.520
and they're going to
know their rights,

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.410
and they're going to
know that this is not

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.743
a privilege for them to be
able to participate in sport.

00:51:44.743 --> 00:51:47.117
It is their right.

00:51:47.117 --> 00:51:48.700
This is kind of where
we start to move

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:49.600
a little bit into gender.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.725
I'm going to talk a little
bit about what the needs

00:51:51.725 --> 00:51:54.114
and barriers are with
athletes with disabilities,

00:51:54.114 --> 00:51:56.530
but it's going to bleed a
little bit into gender because I

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.236
think the two are very similar.

00:51:58.236 --> 00:51:59.860
I think that athletes
with disabilities

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.330
are almost following
a path where we've

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:04.854
seen women athletes come from.

00:52:04.854 --> 00:52:06.520
No matter how it's
presented or couched,

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.395
discrimination towards
students of disability

00:52:08.395 --> 00:52:09.850
is still discrimination.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:12.650
And it's very similar to issues
surrounding race, gender,

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.020
sexual orientation.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.410
So the process
that women athletes

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.979
had to go through during Title
IX to get access to sport,

00:52:20.979 --> 00:52:23.020
our student athletes are
going through right now.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:28.874
It's a very relevant time
for our student athletes.

00:52:28.874 --> 00:52:30.790
We are often viewed as
not equal to our peers.

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:33.057
I see this every
single day on campus

00:52:33.057 --> 00:52:35.140
at the University of
Illinois, and we are actually

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.910
seeing someone who is a
leader in this aspect,

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:41.500
but on a day to day basis,
I see the inequality

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.350
of what our student
athletes have to go through.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:48.520
Small example, access to the
student athlete dining hall.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.777
Something that
seems pretty simple.

00:52:50.777 --> 00:52:52.360
Where student athletes
can go in, they

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.526
can grab food on their way
to class, after practice,

00:52:54.526 --> 00:52:56.440
ability to recover,
our student athletes

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.900
don't have access
to that option.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:02.500
They have to fend for meals
however they can fend for meals

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.210
to properly recover.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.490
Small example, but
has a huge impact

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:10.590
across the board in what our
student athletes experience.

00:53:13.907 --> 00:53:15.240
I think oldness and perceptions.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:15.739
I think

00:53:15.739 --> 00:53:18.984
That is probably the
single biggest barrier

00:53:18.984 --> 00:53:20.650
to students with
disabilities right now.

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:23.024
Again, it goes back to that
similarity of women in sport.

00:53:23.024 --> 00:53:25.140
Like what were the old
myths and stereotypes

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.270
that women had to deal with as
we spoke about earlier with.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:30.029
It's not good, physically.

00:53:30.029 --> 00:53:32.070
You're going to stop having
your menstrual cycle.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.930
All of those things
that are there

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.540
based on myths and
stereotypes, you

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.760
encounter those with our student
athletes with disabilities.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.932
So we see able-bodied
sport is the norm.

00:53:42.932 --> 00:53:45.390
There is a diminished value of
sport and leisure activities

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.010
for people with disabilities.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.500
There's lack of education and
expertise on what disability

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.720
sport is and who can play.

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.535
And there's a wide
range of individuals

00:53:53.535 --> 00:53:57.450
of who can play disability
sport, and that kind of leads

00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:01.362
into that next piece,
which is classification.

00:54:01.362 --> 00:54:02.820
I'll come back to
that in a second.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.490
So just the role
of gender and how

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.160
it combines with disability.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.930
When we go back
and we look at what

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:14.340
those myths and stereotypes
are for gender, again--

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.410
sorry, with disability--
they bleed into gender.

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.090
So how does society attach
meaning to disability?

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:21.336
When we have an
image in our minds

00:54:21.336 --> 00:54:22.710
of what someone
with a disability

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:24.530
looks like, what
they're able to do,

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.740
we have pretty low standards.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.698
Or historically we've
had pretty low standards,

00:54:27.698 --> 00:54:28.920
low expectations.

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.960
We don't expect
them to be physical.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.440
We don't expect them to
expect physical activity.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.350
We don't expect them to be able
to achieve on a high level.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:40.080
We hold them to lower standards.

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:44.790
A lot of this evolves out of
the medical model of disability.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:47.310
And I think in order to take
that next step with disability

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.350
sport, it's evolving into
more of a social model

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:52.232
with disability, and so
it's surrounded with pity.

00:54:52.232 --> 00:54:53.940
You look at that person
with a disability

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.398
and you kind of feel sorry for
them that they can't do this

00:54:56.398 --> 00:54:57.810
or can't do that.

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:01.237
And so what we try to do with
disability sport, and now

00:55:01.237 --> 00:55:02.820
adding in gender
into it, we're trying

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:04.830
to flip that and attach
a different meaning

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:06.142
to disability.

00:55:06.142 --> 00:55:08.100
So looking at the social
construction of sport,

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.960
that is also a
critical factor that

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.450
impacts perceptions related
to the participation of women

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.197
with physical
disabilities in sport.

00:55:14.197 --> 00:55:15.780
Because now you have
these conceptions

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.420
of what individuals with
disability looks like,

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.090
what they're capable are,
now you add gender onto it

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:23.190
and you get that
double whammy effect.

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:24.414
And so someone who--

00:55:24.414 --> 00:55:25.830
an individual with
a disability is

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:30.420
supposed to be frail, fragile,
weak, low expectations,

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.650
not being physical.

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:33.840
You confound that
now with a female who

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.440
is supposed to be weak, sit on
the sidelines, clap politely,

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.330
and you put those
two together, and you

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.840
create this rub between
what our expectations are,

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.200
and what reality can be, and
what we have the opportunity

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.080
to do.

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:50.620
So it leads to those
conflicting expectations.

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:52.980
We do have negative
perceptions and stereotypes.

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.110
I can't tell you how
many times that I've

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:56.839
heard it's so great
that you guys get

00:55:56.839 --> 00:55:58.380
to get out and play
sport, and that's

00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.910
just on the disability level.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:05.710
Or as a female athlete, times
where my team was really good,

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:07.710
and we had to play against
men's teams, and some

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:11.300
of the derogatory terms that you
heard, telling you to get off

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.800
the court, telling you you're
not welcome against this team,

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.550
telling you they're
going to come back out

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:17.070
and beat up one
of your teammates.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.890
Those were things that were just
realities as we moved forward

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:21.660
through this process.

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:25.020
Just to give a couple
of examples touching

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.265
on the Paralympic games.

00:56:26.265 --> 00:56:29.460
So we had about
38% participation,

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.590
43% of medal events,
which was almost

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:32.950
a 10% increase from London.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.050
So that's positive.

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:35.430
That piece is growing.

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:38.161
So that's kind of the
role that gender plays.

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.660
What I'm going to
do really quickly,

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.776
because I'm running
out of time, is

00:56:41.776 --> 00:56:44.400
run through a real world example
of what's happening right now.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.170
There's been a little bit of
slowed progress with this,

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:47.795
but those of you guys
on the east coast

00:56:47.795 --> 00:56:52.230
know about the ECAC, a really
awesome athletic conference.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:55.200
What they have done is they've
adopted an inclusive sport

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.820
model a couple of
years ago, and it's

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.570
based on principles
of inclusion depending

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.120
on a person's specific
disability, and their ability

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.570
to compete at a varsity level.

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.420
Otherwise qualified, right? ?

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.880
So as we kind of go through
of what inclusive sport

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.700
looks like, and this will be
a really quick run through,

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.620
the first couple of principals--

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:17.010
student athletes can
participate on existing teams

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:20.040
with either no accommodations
or some small accommodations

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.870
that don't effect the sport.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:22.870
So if we look at--

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:23.790
that's Marla Runyan.

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:26.760
She's the first runner
there, blind athlete,

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.260
able to run without a guide.

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.242
Doesn't significantly
impact the sport.

00:57:30.242 --> 00:57:32.200
We have Anthony Robles
here, who is a wrestler.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.140
Won a division one national
title at Arizona State.

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.590
A swimmer here, competing
for her university.

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:40.930
So that does not
significantly alter sport.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:42.960
You're not changing the sport.

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.150
Third principle,
inclusion of athletes

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:47.550
with a disability through the
addition of adapted events.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:50.100
This is when you see track
and field athletes who compete

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.280
in our wheelchair divisions.

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.970
That's Tatiana McFadden.

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:56.430
The addition of
events with a guide

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:59.430
runner for amputees that
are separate events,

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:03.750
but you're still winning points,
so to say, at your events.

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:07.332
Swimming, there's rowing,
wheelchair tennis.

00:58:07.332 --> 00:58:08.790
And then lastly,
it's the inclusion

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:10.890
of athletes with a disability
through the creation

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:12.032
of adapted team sports.

00:58:12.032 --> 00:58:14.240
And this is kind of what I
was talking about earlier.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.830
This is where the
donut hole exists.

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:18.140
This is where we don't do a
really great job right now

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.690
at the Scholastic level
of inclusion of athletes

00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:21.969
with disabilities.

00:58:21.969 --> 00:58:23.510
And so this is
wheelchair basketball.

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:25.430
It's kind of your
traditional team sports.

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:28.940
Sled hockey, sitting
volleyball, and goalball.

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:32.120
So that's a really
quick and dirty version

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:35.180
of where we are with
disability sport.

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.500
Where we've come from.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.710
How it's been seen as a
privilege for individuals

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:41.390
with disabilities to be able
to participate in sport.

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:44.590
How that then
compounds with gender

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:47.210
and makes it even more
difficult to access with

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:50.000
added layers of discrimination
for women with disabilities.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.380
And then where we can
be, and the future,

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:55.010
and where we can go
with disability sport

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:56.900
if we just think
outside of that model

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.218
that we have right
now for sport.

00:58:59.218 --> 00:59:01.154
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:11.560
- Well, I would like
to commend my panelists

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:16.870
for coming in on time or
under time, and also giving us

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:19.900
so much to think about
just to start our day,

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.370
and that's really
what we had hoped

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:23.900
for when we're planning this.

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.770
I think what I'd like
to do is allow them

00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:33.270
to step back and talk about
some big issues and some

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:35.920
of the themes that
have come through.

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.100
And I think the one
that really sticks out

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:44.230
for me is this idea of
sports as a birthright

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:48.850
that all humans
enjoy and then also

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:51.700
what are the
challenges women face

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.110
in claiming that birthright?

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:55.240
But I think, Anita, for
you especially, that's

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.786
your philosophy of sports.

00:59:57.786 --> 01:00:00.984
- Yeah, for a long
time I believed that.

01:00:00.984 --> 01:00:03.400
Maybe growing up with three
brothers and not understanding

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.280
why I couldn't get onto
the basketball court,

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.950
and I couldn't, I couldn't,
couldn't, couldn't.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:13.510
It didn't make sense to me why
I did not have this access.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.100
My parents were well evolved.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.790
I could cut the grass and my
brothers could wash the dishes,

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:22.960
but there was this whole
area that disallowed me.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.560
And it did not seem
fair and it wasn't fair

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.420
because all humans have this
desire to take part in sport.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.180
It's the one thing
that we do as a species

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.910
that no other species does.

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:39.850
If you've heard me speak before
I reference the fact that

01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:42.830
what other species sets up
hurdles and races across them

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:45.250
to see who gets across
the finish line first?

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.920
I referenced that I've seen
an ant climb onto a twig

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.270
to get across a puddle of water.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:51.130
I've never seen them
line up those twigs

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:52.990
to get across a puddle of water.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:55.480
It's something that
we enjoy doing.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.860
We enjoy talking about it.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.600
We enjoy taking part in sport.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.060
We enjoy the history of it.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.130
It brings us together
as communities.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:06.970
It helps us enjoy
people's success.

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:09.940
It helps us get into that
zone of excellence, which

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.680
I think we need to study more.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.260
But it's something
that we do as humans

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.880
and it's not just some humans.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.680
It's not just one
half of humanity.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.140
It's all of humans.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.570
- I completely agree and
I, again, I look at this

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:26.400
through the lens of disability.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.670
And it's something,
like I mentioned,

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:33.120
where it's seen as
individuals with disabilities,

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.040
that they don't have
the desire to compete.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.570
They don't have the desire
to challenge themselves

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.880
at that high level, and
that's just completely untrue.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.090
I think if you look
across the board,

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:48.690
internationally, there are
no barriers in place over

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.790
and over again that
show those individuals

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.050
that it is a privilege.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.640
It addresses that
larger question

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.260
of what bodies
are able, and what

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.350
bodies do we see as able,
and from a gender perspective

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.000
and from a disability
perspective.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.760
And what bodies have the right
to be able to participate.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.510
So I completely agree with that.

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:14.640
And it's important that
we, as much as we can,

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.790
remove those systemic barriers.

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:20.880
That's what creates
sport as a privilege,

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.880
is that there's those
systemic barriers in place

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.421
of saying who can play and who
can get to that starting line.

01:02:25.421 --> 01:02:27.540
And so it's kind of
on us and everybody

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.570
here to begin to remove
those and re-conceptualize,

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:33.960
especially-- again, I come from
the disability sport angle.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.080
Re-conceptualize
what that looks like.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.960
Re-conceptualize what sport
looks like, and what bodies

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.900
that can compete look like,
and how it's their right.

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:48.000
- I think we're speaking
to the choir in terms

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.680
of our birthright.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.610
Seriously, no child should ever
be told that you cannot pursue

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:56.260
your dreams.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.480
I don't care whether it's sport,
or being an engineer, or a fire

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.100
person, or any of it.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.960
I think we're all in that mode.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.810
But if the right
has been denied,

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:09.830
then I think we have
to jump into can

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:15.230
we change the legal system
to make sure it's a right?

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:16.890
And that's what was
done with Title IX.

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:18.890
I thought it was very
interesting in Stephanie's

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:22.010
presentation, you can
see the Dear Colleague

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:27.080
letter on disability did
not come out until 2014.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.050
And that's the equivalent
of the regulation

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:33.740
that got done before Title
IX was even in place.

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:37.730
And I could kick myself having
been with the Women's Sports

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:42.350
Foundation in not
embracing the need,

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:44.270
in the case of
disabled sport, to go

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:49.040
after those same regulations
under disability.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.860
No excuse.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.632
Fortunately, Terri Lakowski
from the foundation

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:57.590
was very helpful in that
Dear Colleague letter.

01:03:57.590 --> 01:04:01.800
But if McFadden never called
the Women's Sports Foundation,

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.290
Terri wouldn't have been there.

01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:06.470
That Dear Colleague letter
wouldn't have been there.

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:08.240
We've got to make
this legal thing

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.800
and I have a question for Anita.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.350
Is it true that in the
rest of the world, when

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.660
you look at our
experience with Title IX,

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:21.830
we have a legal right that
is actionable in the courts,

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:24.860
where in the rest of the
world, most countries take

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:28.100
civil rights and throw
them under a Civil Rights

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:36.230
Commission that is not as strong
an enforcement body as courts?

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:37.870
Is that accurate to say?

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:40.060
Or does anybody in
the audience who's

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.060
a lawyer want to come in on--

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.520
- My answer would be possibly.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.450
- Because that's what
happened in Canada.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:52.030
When our American
women challenged

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:55.660
the use of artificial
turf for World Cup--

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.820
- Soccer, football.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:03.610
- In Canada, they
don't have a right

01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:06.640
to pursue civil rights
actions in the courts.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.689
It's a Civil Rights Commission
that's a weak sister.

01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:12.480
So that would have been
the place to do it,

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.420
you now what I mean?

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:15.190
- But they have a
different system

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:17.270
because sports is a
part of the government,

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:19.540
unlike the system in
the United States.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.200
So they have other
avenues to take action.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.230
- It's an interesting place.

01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:27.560
- We still haven't
signed [INAUDIBLE] yet.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.260
- Yeah.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.680
- I'm a historian, and I at one
point had looked to see whether

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.920
there was anything equivalent
to Title IX, globally,

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.020
and there wasn't.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.500
There does seem to be, through
the various United Nations

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:45.550
commissions on women in
International Women's Year,

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.760
the topic began to
get on the agenda.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.810
And it seems that the break out
decade for the United States

01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:54.130
was the 70s.

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:56.470
I think, globally,
the breakout decade

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:58.930
was the 90s, when
things really started

01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:01.330
to pop in terms of gender.

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:04.210
And I think that the UN
had a lot to do with that.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.260
But I think this
raises another question

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.280
I wanted us to weigh in on
because it's relevant really

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.560
to what we're doing
the rest of the day.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.830
The United States
sports system is not

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:19.270
the way sport is organized
in the rest of the world.

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:23.999
And I know we have a
very literate audience,

01:06:23.999 --> 01:06:25.540
but I thought we
should maybe explore

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.870
some of the ways in which
the situation we kind of take

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:34.030
for granted is not necessarily
how sport is organized starting

01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:37.390
with state support for sports.

01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:40.100
So I don't know which of you--

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:42.241
- Let me just say this
one piece of the puzzle

01:06:42.241 --> 01:06:43.990
and I think that's a
very important point.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.570
Because we're one of the
few countries in the world

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:49.530
by to embed sport within
educational systems,

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:52.990
and because
education is a right,

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:55.900
our legal system
followed that thinking.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:00.750
And what Congress really did
was as part of the Education

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:04.180
Amendments Act, as a condition
of higher education funding,

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:10.570
it attached this right
to education to sport.

01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:12.430
We're the only place
in the world, I think,

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:15.280
that does that because
everything else is

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.435
clubs outside of the
educational system.

01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:20.350
- Well, in Europe,
there's a have a right

01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:24.010
to work part to it.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:27.670
Sports are protected, but only
once you get to the point where

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:29.620
it your advocation--

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.200
your vocation, not advocation.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.120
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.730
- I think for us, for
athletes of disabilities,

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:43.480
I think our process is directly
tied to the education process.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.760
Physical activity is a part
of the education process

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.060
of children with disabilities
that has been largely ignored.

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.920
And I can speak from
personal experience

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.710
on that as far as physical
education opportunities

01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.990
within school and
then opportunities

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:59.950
outside of school for
recreational opportunities.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.960
And so that's been
the big push, is

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.130
the tie to education for
individuals with disabilities.

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:08.530
They're missing this huge piece
of their right to be educated.

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:10.840
And then the other
side of that too

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:15.760
is we see the education process
of the larger population

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.170
or public of that school.

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:19.422
Because we have such
that ingrained picture

01:08:19.422 --> 01:08:21.880
of what an individual with a
disability looks like and what

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.960
they can do.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.660
And so when you take that
individual for someone

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:29.036
who sits on the sidelines
at PE, they keep score.

01:08:29.036 --> 01:08:30.910
They're the goalie that
just sits in the goal

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:32.140
and they don't do anything.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.473
When you take them and you
move them from that position,

01:08:34.473 --> 01:08:37.090
and you put them into a
position where they're active,

01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:40.090
and they're actively giving
to that social environment,

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:41.620
it completely
changes the paradigm

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.859
and the lens through
which you see that person.

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:46.750
So it educates the rest of
the class, or the school,

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.340
or whatever it might be.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.620
And so it's tied to
the educational process

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.109
in two really big
ways, which makes it--

01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:56.600
that's that educational
right of everyone.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.600
- I think I have one more
question for the panel

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.229
before I open it up.

01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:01.930
It really came to
me this morning

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:07.180
and I was thinking that
here I have three women who

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:12.010
have been able, or are in the
process, of making a career out

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:14.470
of being in the world of sports.

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:17.350
And I think that is
something we should mark

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:19.510
and it didn't used to happen.

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:21.490
But I wondered,
since you all have

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.890
been able to really
do that, if you

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:28.630
had had any advice for people
as they're contemplating

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:30.370
a career in this area.

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:31.840
I mean, we've
certainly given them

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.240
plenty of reasons to realize
why it needs to be done,

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.328
but if there is anything
you wanted to pass along.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:45.051
- Well, you know [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:48.050
I think the barriers
to women in sport right

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.439
now are the male
dominance of men.

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:55.520
This whole issue of
homologous reproduction

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.400
where the current
white male power

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.790
structure is in the process
of reproducing itself,

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:05.600
not necessarily
intentionally, but we

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.280
hire people who look like us.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.820
We hire people who
are comfortable

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.175
and this is a systems problem.

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:17.390
We have to have schools and
support organizations that

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:20.300
follow systems that
prevent discrimination

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.780
in terms of hiring, and
that means search committees

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.250
that are a minority dominated.

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:28.790
That means not one
of your finalists

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:32.690
being a minority person,
it means at least 30%.

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:36.080
Research shows at least
30% of that finalist pool

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.120
has to be an under-represented
minority in order

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.220
for this change to take place.

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.520
We've got to hit all those
spots and we have not

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.240
done that in terms of this
organizational system that

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.200
has to be put in place.

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:57.350
- One thing I would say
is I didn't listen to--

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.422
I had a couple of opportunities.

01:11:02.422 --> 01:11:04.880
So I've been fortunate to coach
at the international level,

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.340
both at the junior and
senior national team level.

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:11.160
And at the Paralympic games
last year, I was the--

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.160
for wheelchair basketball,
I was the only female

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.535
with a disability that was
the head coach of a wheelchair

01:11:15.535 --> 01:11:21.450
basketball team, and that's
just unacceptable in our sport.

01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:25.580
And the path to get
there was challenging.

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.710
My first international
coaching job

01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:32.840
I actually gotten a roundabout
way with a male being

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.410
selected to do the job who was
significantly under qualified.

01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:37.520
I was his assistant coach.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.210
He quit.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:40.250
Now he's moved up to the
head coaching position.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.584
And when I was starting
to think that coaching

01:11:42.584 --> 01:11:44.000
the senior national
team was going

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.150
to be where I wanted
my career to go,

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:49.670
our high performance
director at the time

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:51.950
told me that I needed
take an opportunity

01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:56.780
to be an assistant coach with
our men's junior national team

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.680
first.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.990
And I was like, nah,
that doesn't sound right,

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:01.490
and that's not
what I want to do.

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:03.115
I want to make sure
that I'm continuing

01:12:03.115 --> 01:12:06.170
on this path with coaching
women and empowering women,

01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:08.780
and I don't need
to take that step

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:13.120
over in what he saw was a
step up, this lateral step,

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.260
to make myself look better.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.010
There's no way.

01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:20.630
And so I think for me it
was I had the strength

01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:24.154
to stick to my guns in that way,
and know the path that I wanted

01:12:24.154 --> 01:12:25.820
to be on, and who I
wanted to influence,

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.230
and where I wanted to go.

01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:29.540
Fortunately, I was
able to overcome that,

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.970
but what always sticks in
my mind in my conversation

01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:33.860
with him is he told
me-- he's like you know,

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:36.110
you came into that junior
national team coaching job

01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:37.460
through the back door.

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.409
And I'm like, you have
got to be kidding me.

01:12:39.409 --> 01:12:40.700
You have to be kidding me like.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.440
I outright earned that job.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.360
And so that always
sticks with me

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.190
in that process of
just really critically

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:51.846
thinking about the opportunity
that's in front of you

01:12:51.846 --> 01:12:53.720
and knowing if that's
really going to get you

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:54.860
where you want to be.

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.920
And if what this person
who is a-- and he

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.810
was a white, able-bodied
male, what he was telling me

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:02.409
I needed to do in
order to achieve

01:13:02.409 --> 01:13:03.450
what I wanted to achieve.

01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:04.670
And so that's something
that's always stuck with me,

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:06.590
and I try to tell
that to anybody

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:08.360
that I talk to, female
with a disability,

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.651
without a disability, whatever.

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:12.410
Is just that you kind of have
to know where you're going

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:16.820
and have an idea of it, and know
that what someone is telling

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.950
you that's a move up,
if it's not a move up,

01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:23.349
if it doesn't vibe with
what your passion is,

01:13:23.349 --> 01:13:24.390
and where you want to go.

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:27.470
So that would be the
advice that I have.

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.150
- I want to agree
with Stephanie.

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:31.550
Naivety is a great thing.

01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:33.080
- Oh, I was super naive.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.819
I was young and super naive.

01:13:34.819 --> 01:13:36.860
- So was I when I went to
the University of Texas

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.872
as the first Director
of Women's Athletics.

01:13:39.872 --> 01:13:42.080
I really thought Texas wanted
a National Championship

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.230
Program and that's what
I was supposed to do.

01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:50.090
And so I was a 29-year-old naive
person, but I acted that way,

01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:52.400
and I didn't know any
better, which is good.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.040
And I think the
other thing is do not

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.330
go through this mental process
of I have to be qualified.

01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:02.930
No male ever did that for a job.

01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:03.860
Ever.

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.630
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:11.330
You are probably more educated
than your male counterpart

01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:14.060
and there's no job
that you can't learn

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:17.690
and so you might as well just
go after what it is you want.

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:21.230
You're going to be better
than 90% of the population.

01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:23.780
- I think one more thing to
add-- sorry, really quickly--

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.340
that I think is
really important,

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.167
and something I had to
learn through my naivety,

01:14:28.167 --> 01:14:29.750
was that it's really
important to have

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:32.120
a strong team around you.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.570
And I have been really fortunate
to have a lot of great mentors

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:36.780
throughout my career.

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.821
And one of the things I
was really hesitant to do

01:14:38.821 --> 01:14:43.130
was reach out, and reach out to
people for advice and support.

01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:46.160
I thought that was kind
of a brown nosing thing

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.990
or I just had a really
negative conception

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:50.480
of what that whole
networking piece looked like.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.990
But it's so important that
you find people, and surround

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.760
yourself with people who
have been on that path,

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.760
and who can help guide
you through that journey.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.550
I wouldn't be
anywhere near where

01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:03.980
I am without those people
significantly influencing me.

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:06.740
So ask, reach out, a
lot of times people

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.822
are more than happy to help.

01:15:08.822 --> 01:15:11.030
We might think that they're
not and they're too busy,

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:14.040
or they had this going on,
that's totally not true.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.365
- I think, with that, I'd like
to open it up to questions.

01:15:17.365 --> 01:15:19.490
And those of you who have
been to other conferences

01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:22.220
know the drill, but maybe
some of you are new to it.

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.710
There's a microphone in
the middle of the aisle.

01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:28.700
We ask you to come up,
to identify yourself,

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:33.876
and to frame it as a question.

01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:35.750
You're welcome to frame
it to the whole panel

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:41.390
or to a specific panelist,
not to go into a comment,

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:46.220
and that way we can get as
many questions in as possible.

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:48.350
So if you'll start, please.

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:52.520
- Hi, I'm Elizabeth
Guggenheimer and when

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.340
the 2012 women's
Olympic team came back

01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:59.190
or when they were
competing, I thought

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:02.160
this is going to bust
that stereotype of women

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.340
not being competitive.

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:11.700
And then the 2016 Olympics
team, the women right, they

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.600
outshined the men,
and somehow I think

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.710
the question of women being
competitive is kind of still

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:20.790
out there.

01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:24.990
And the other thing that
goes with this idea that

01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:28.200
being collaborative means
you can't be competitive.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.840
And the most
dramatic illustration

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.720
of this that I
saw, collaborative

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.750
plus competitive,
was last Sunday,

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:39.900
the Oxford and
Cambridge boat race

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:44.640
that the Cambridge women, when
they won and they were just

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.780
joyous, collaborative,
they didn't look exhausted,

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.470
and yet they were full
of the joys of having

01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:53.350
been competitive.

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:58.500
So I just wonder if we can
get through that stereotype.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.940
I'd love to hear her thoughts.

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.966
- OK it's a rowing event.

01:17:04.966 --> 01:17:05.466
[CHUCKLES]

01:17:05.466 --> 01:17:06.885
- Yes, it's yours, Anita.

01:17:06.885 --> 01:17:07.620
- Mine.

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:10.830
And rowing was the very
first intercollegiate sport

01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:14.100
where Yale and Harvard lined
up, lo, those many years ago--

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:18.530
1852-- to compete and
it's continued since then.

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:21.540
Collaborative, the
sport of ruling is the--

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.610
I call it the
ultimate team sport.

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:24.840
you have to collaborate.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.350
You can't say I'll be back in a
couple of strokes and help out.

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:28.980
See you then.

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:34.890
It's a team sport, and yet it's
called an individual sport,

01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:35.520
oddly enough.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.770
There's so many confusions.

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:41.339
How can you not be competitive
driving someplace today.

01:17:41.339 --> 01:17:42.630
How can you not be competitive?

01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:45.004
For example, you want
to get that space,

01:17:45.004 --> 01:17:46.420
and there's a car
in front of you,

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.253
and you know they're
going to get the space.

01:17:48.253 --> 01:17:51.690
Life is about competition
in so many ways,

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:54.360
and for an individual not
to be able to compete,

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.110
is to have to not be
prepared for today's society.

01:18:00.354 --> 01:18:02.520
I mean, there were terrible
things being told to me.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.060
I had no idea that
when I started college

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:10.950
that I was going to embark
upon a college sports

01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:13.110
where it was not supposed
to be competitive,

01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:15.960
because after all, we're
supposed to be young ladies,

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.210
and competition
is something bad.

01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:20.160
It just never occurred
to me that that

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.730
would be the type of
collegiate experience

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:28.290
that was being offered
to women at that time.

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:31.620
When and where you're
born is so important

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.030
and the time was just right
because things were changing.

01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:39.540
I don't know how many of you
are a part of that era where

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.980
competition was bad.

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.830
You were supposed to learn
skills, that was good,

01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:45.532
but that was enough.

01:18:45.532 --> 01:18:47.490
It's just a terrible
thing to do to tell people

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.830
that you can learn a skill,
but never put it into action

01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:52.350
and test it.

01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:55.410
- I think we live in a-- so the
first part of that question,

01:18:55.410 --> 01:19:00.720
we live in a media culture
and the control of what gets

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.350
on television does not rest
with those who are enthusiastic

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:08.220
about women's sports, especially
here in the United States.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.700
And as a result,
it's this dilemma

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.010
that you so aptly expressed.

01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:17.220
Once every four years we see
this bright light of talent

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.740
and then it disappears.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:24.450
And society places a value
on the amount of exposure

01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:25.950
and who they see.

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:28.140
And so when did
women disappear, they

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:32.790
must not have quality staying
power in terms of athletes.

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:38.310
It's some terrible
kind of a conclusion.

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:43.020
And until our
digital environment

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:48.120
enables us to catch
up on television--

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.760
our media platforms are
such that they're not

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:54.344
under the control of the people
that they're under control

01:19:54.344 --> 01:19:56.010
right now, I'm not
sure that we're going

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:57.630
to make a change like that.

01:19:57.630 --> 01:20:01.170
Domestic television right now is
dominated by the big four men's

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:05.280
sports and each of
our major distributors

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.860
have overpaid for that product.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:11.910
And they're so busy now using
every promotional minute,

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:16.260
every two hours before the
game, two hours after the game,

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.510
every predictable
time and place,

01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:22.770
trying to recapture that money,
that there are no media rights

01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:24.660
fees for women's sports
in the United States.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:32.040
Do you see a solution other than
a digital solution [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.020
television.

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:39.000
- Right now, the IOC is
working on having a channel,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.360
and it's stepped all over the
US because without the US,

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.260
it's going to work.

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:48.570
And the deal was made for NBC
to have the actual channel

01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:52.020
in the United States, which
could limit the US Olympic

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:55.770
team's ability to raise
funds, but we'll see.

01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:57.390
We don't know if
it's going to work

01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:59.610
because we've been taught--

01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:02.389
to point out-- we've been
taught to just wait a while,

01:21:02.389 --> 01:21:03.930
and then the games
will come, and you

01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:05.850
get force fed for
two weeks, and then

01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:08.840
you have to starve for the
next four years, or two years,

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.860
until the next forced
feeling comes along.

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.960
And that was Dick
Ebersol's approach

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.300
to making the games
more valuable,

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:19.380
but also we are denied the
stories of these athletes

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.880
around the world.

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.720
Euro sport did the opposite.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.680
They taught you who the athletes
were so you could follow them,

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.600
and then came the
Olympic games, you

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.630
could understand the path that
they had taken to get there.

01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:33.690
So please look at
the Olympic channel.

01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:34.830
It's digital now.

01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:40.590
I think it comes onto
a channel platform

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:44.100
and by July, if not sooner, NBC.

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.117
- Let's move on to
another question.

01:21:46.117 --> 01:21:48.450
- Well, actually I was going
to-- my name is Jane Regan.

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:49.930
I'm a journalist.

01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:52.050
But I don't do
sports journalism,

01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:54.060
that's one reason I came.

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.250
I also teach journalism
and my question

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:59.820
is exactly related to Donna's
comment and the other comments.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:03.630
I'm wondering if in the
women's sports world,

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:07.050
maybe in the journalism world,
or sports journalism world,

01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:10.410
are there pressure groups,
or associations, or movements

01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:13.650
to put pressures on
the news organizations

01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:17.280
and the newsrooms to include,
and to go out and recruit,

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.710
and include more female
journalists, and sports

01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:20.700
journalists.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.580
Because certainly,
there are movements

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.770
that have not been
that successful,

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:30.180
and it goes up and down,
but of journalists of color.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:35.100
There is than non-journalists
and editors and stuff of color,

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.850
feel it acutely, the
whiteness of their newsrooms.

01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:43.410
And so there are great
proactive activities

01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:44.970
that the bigger
media outlets do,

01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:48.300
that the bigger universities
do to recruit, and promote,

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:50.340
and encourage
journalists of color.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:54.310
I'm wondering if you know of,
or if we could all take part in

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:59.190
somehow, something similar
for female sports journalists.

01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:03.030
Because I agree that
our society is so

01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:06.900
influenced what's on the box,
or on the tablet, or whatever,

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:10.900
and it's all-male sports, except
for once every four years.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:15.360
So that's my question
and provocation.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.320
- There are organization
[INAUDIBLE] Women in Sports

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:22.350
and Entertainment is one
such group that promotes

01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:25.200
women's sport journalism.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.012
- Association for Women
in the Sports Media.

01:23:29.012 --> 01:23:32.190
- There are some
groups out there.

01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:36.210
- I despair because now
there's such direct access

01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:39.150
through the digital world.

01:23:39.150 --> 01:23:40.650
I can't do it all,
I wish I could.

01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:43.980
I don't understand
why we're not doing

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:47.010
more of telling the stories
and telling it directly.

01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:48.390
But we're not,
and I don't why, I

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:51.130
guess because everybody's busy.

01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:54.580
But it seems logically that once
the world opened up for people

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:57.366
to be able to directly
communicate, and to have

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.740
networking, and be able to
get the information out there,

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.940
that it would.

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:04.010
- In terms of putting advocacy
pressure on the system,

01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:05.260
it will also start with data.

01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:08.710
And I have to applaud
AP, Associated Press,

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:12.601
for at least starting to keep
a report card on sports editors

01:24:12.601 --> 01:24:13.100
and--

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.190
- Guidelines.

01:24:16.190 --> 01:24:19.480
- Who is in our system
and I think we just

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.220
have to do more of that.

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:27.280
And TIDES, Dick Lapchick's
group in Florida,

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.440
keeps it to an
extent, but I think

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.160
we have to get more data
about the discrepancies,

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.910
and that is going
to ignite advocacy.

01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:40.260
Hopefully that's the path.

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:43.220
- I think that really is
a challenge to all of us

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.650
to really always be counting.

01:24:45.650 --> 01:24:48.350
Counting how many women,
how many people of color,

01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:52.160
how many people with
disabilities, because if you

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.660
don't, and then
demanding that it

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.190
changed-- because
if you don't, it

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:58.700
reverts to white male control.

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:02.060
And I think that what we have
to avoid is a sense of well,

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:05.970
nobody in this room
is smug or satisfied,

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:09.260
but if you just sort of accept
it as business as usual,

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.820
the progress is going to stop.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.490
It may not backslide
all that far back,

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:15.950
but you have to just
keep staying vigilant.

01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:19.370
And all the things that we're
saying-- here it is, 2017,

01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:21.530
and we're still
raising these issues.

01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:24.080
And I think we just have
to stay on top of it

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.030
because the problem is
there and it's deep.

01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:28.580
- Just one more point on that.

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:31.752
I think one of the great
things that has happened--

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:33.710
the only great thing that
has happened in terms

01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:36.750
of Trump's election is--

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:37.970
no, seriously.

01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:42.860
We have finally had a
catalyst from moving

01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.630
from identity politics to
all for one and one for all.

01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:49.550
And you're seeing that
at the grassroots level

01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:53.150
now that if you can
give me the data

01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:56.420
point, if you can
give me a reason,

01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.790
everybody is going to help me.

01:25:58.790 --> 01:26:01.600
Now do this.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.530
That has not existed before.

01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:07.730
We've stayed in a Black
Lives Matter silo.

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:10.130
We've stayed in a woman's silo.

01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:12.680
And now I'm seeing
something I've never

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:16.730
seen before in terms of
a lot of people jumping

01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:20.840
into issues that aren't theirs.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.940
- Another question.

01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:23.740
- Hi, my name is Karen Flynn.

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.640
I'm from the Harvard
summer school.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.559
I have a question about how--

01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:31.600
or I wanted to see if the
panelists could comment

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:37.210
on how sports are organized
by gender, just fundamentally,

01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:40.870
and whether you can see
that potentially changing

01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:42.592
in the future.

01:26:42.592 --> 01:26:44.050
In other words,
whether there could

01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:47.500
be an opportunity for girls
to play against girls,

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:51.610
and women to play against women,
but also to try to break down

01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:55.120
that complete
separation by gender

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.210
that exists in sports
because I think

01:26:58.210 --> 01:27:03.550
that that separation,
in itself, underscores

01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:08.060
a sense of inferiority
about women in sports.

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:11.680
So can you see potential
in future decades

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.612
for that to change?

01:27:12.612 --> 01:27:14.320
- Stephanie, do you
want to talk to that?

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.200
Because in some ways
I think your model--

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.990
- Sure.

01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:23.590
In a lot of disability sport,
we do that out of necessity

01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:26.080
initially because just
with the critical mass.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.710
And so I can speak from
a wheelchair basketball

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:32.500
perspective, where we
have teams that are coed,

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:36.370
or teams that compete either--

01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:38.350
I've played on
full women's teams

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:40.060
that compete against
full men's teams.

01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:48.260
One of the ways that our
organization incorrectly,

01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:50.540
I think, tries to--

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:53.150
they call it, "accommodate"
for that, and without getting

01:27:53.150 --> 01:27:56.270
into a sort of a long
discussion about our sport,

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:58.460
with wheelchair basketball
you have a wide range

01:27:58.460 --> 01:27:59.780
of disabilities that can play.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.571
And so in order to
level the playing field,

01:28:01.571 --> 01:28:05.240
you have this classification
system based on that,

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.530
and you're seeing a point value.

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:10.340
And one of the ways,
globally and in the US that--

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.340
and I think it actually does
a complete disservice to women

01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:18.320
athletes within our sport,
is if you're rated as a 2.5,

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.720
then if you play on a men's
team, you go one point down.

01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:27.140
It's absurd, absolutely absurd.

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.870
So I think we're kind
of already doing it.

01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:31.880
We don't do it in
the most perfect way,

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.060
I don't think, because if we do
have women included on teams,

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:41.480
they're treated as of lower
value, and in essence,

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.550
sometimes become like
pylons on the court.

01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:45.650
They're just there to be there.

01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:47.900
So while we do this
out of necessity,

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.760
I don't think we do it
very well right now.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.730
I think in order for
disability sport to grow,

01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:56.630
I think there's going to have to
be coeducational opportunities

01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:58.910
just because there
isn't the critical mass.

01:28:58.910 --> 01:29:02.329
And while it might
address what you

01:29:02.329 --> 01:29:04.370
were talking about with
the inferiority of women,

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:06.161
I think it has to be
done in the right way.

01:29:06.161 --> 01:29:08.870
And I think that
classification example for us

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:12.260
is a way that it's not
being done in the right way.

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:15.500
I would much rather see them
play at whatever classification

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.360
they are, they hold
value, they bring

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.960
what they bring to the team,
and then it's a non issue then

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:21.920
at that point.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.440
So we're sort of
there right now.

01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:32.720
- We had that very interesting
discussion when we're

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:35.810
redrafting the Olympic Charter.

01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:38.060
And I was the only woman in
the room among attorneys,

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.550
and we're talking
about equality,

01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:43.210
and so the other guy, well,
you know, women and men,

01:29:43.210 --> 01:29:44.600
they're not equal.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.250
And I said, what do you mean?

01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:48.200
And they said,
well, you know, they

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:51.530
have the heavyweight
boxing gold medal,

01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:55.414
and then they have the feather
weight boxing gold medal,

01:29:55.414 --> 01:29:57.080
and you would never
put a feather weight

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.410
against a heavyweight.

01:29:58.410 --> 01:29:59.960
I said, no, of course not.

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.620
And so that's not equal, I
said, but are the medals gold?

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.770
Are they the same medals?

01:30:05.770 --> 01:30:06.962
The same champions?

01:30:06.962 --> 01:30:08.420
And he said, well,
yeah [INAUDIBLE]

01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:13.220
Listen guys, men and
women are different,

01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:15.170
and thank goodness
for the difference,

01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:17.090
but can anyone in
this room tell me

01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:20.990
that we are not absolutely
unequivocally and forever

01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:22.837
equally human?

01:30:22.837 --> 01:30:24.170
That's what we're talking about.

01:30:24.170 --> 01:30:26.990
We are equally
human and therefore

01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:30.080
once you go from there, you
stay on a level playing field

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.530
with respect and treating
people with respect.

01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:36.110
And that's how we got sex
back into the Olympic Charter.

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:43.910
- We do a great job in
intramural in doing this

01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:47.450
because we specify how
many men and how many

01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:49.430
women are on the same
team, and in many cases,

01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:52.070
don't make any other
rules adjustments at all.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:55.130
In some cases we do,
but we have to change

01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:57.860
the rules of these
sports that have

01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.040
become cultural
rituals, which is what

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.780
makes it so difficult to do.

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:06.610
We know how to do it, but
the willingness isn't there.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.630
- Hi, I'm Lily Judan, a
senior at the college,

01:31:11.630 --> 01:31:14.870
and I had a question about
the role of female athletes

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:16.220
as advocates.

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:20.450
And my question is, is it fair
to ask all female athletes

01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:23.550
to advocate for their sex?

01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:25.720
Or is there also a role
for female athletes

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.610
just to be athletes
and play without having

01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:31.662
to worry about what their
sex brings to the table?

01:31:31.662 --> 01:31:32.745
- That's a great question.

01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:38.650
- Take athlete out of it.

01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:40.349
Do-- what's her name?

01:31:40.349 --> 01:31:41.140
- I can't remember.

01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:43.200
- She's walking away.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.870
- She's out of here.

01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:50.770
- So the point is, in the face
of looking at wrong, if you

01:31:50.770 --> 01:31:53.904
stay silent, are you complicit?

01:31:53.904 --> 01:31:54.820
- Exactly.

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:59.395
- So if you see wrong, do
you have a responsibility

01:31:59.395 --> 01:32:03.100
to advocate, at least
to say it's wrong?

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:10.280
- My question's relevant.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.250
I'm Sara [INAUDIBLE]
I'm a staff member here,

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:15.490
also a graduate of the college
and the softball program,

01:32:15.490 --> 01:32:18.250
and I'm actually curious about
in your different context,

01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:20.980
the role of male athletes
in this equation.

01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:23.800
And I think the US men's
hockey team made a statement

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.940
about the women's plight.

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:27.760
I couldn't help but wonder,
what if Federer had refused

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.224
to take more money than Serena?

01:32:30.224 --> 01:32:32.890
So I'm curious what you think in
terms of outlook in the future,

01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:35.305
where do male athletes
fit into that equation?

01:32:38.290 --> 01:32:40.090
- I have great hope.

01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:44.950
I really do because we're
seeing the first generation

01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:48.490
of male athletes who are willing
to buck their coaches power

01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:51.805
and the power of the institution
at great personal risk.

01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:56.800
We haven't seen that before.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.320
We're looking at the
beginnings of unionization

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.540
among college athletes.

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:04.556
We are now talking about the
right of athletes to speak.

01:33:04.556 --> 01:33:06.430
We're now talking about
the right of athletes

01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:08.410
not to be controlled
by coaches, in terms

01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:11.830
of what they put on Facebook, or
what they put in their Twitter

01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:12.730
account.

01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:16.120
That's a new conversation,
a really new conversation.

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:19.670
So I'm very hopeful
in that regard.

01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:21.880
- Well, I think in
disability sport

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.380
you kind of have an
interesting intersection

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:25.640
with disability and gender.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:28.976
And so quite often when
you look at male athletes

01:33:28.976 --> 01:33:30.350
with disabilities,
a lot of times

01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:32.930
their fight is coming
from the disability angle

01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:35.300
and they don't bring
gender in with it.

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:39.410
And so I know we struggle
a little bit with that,

01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:42.020
just to make sure that that
intersection is understood.

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:43.660
And that kind of
like Donna mentioned,

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:47.150
we can't stay in our
silo in those moments.

01:33:47.150 --> 01:33:51.470
And so if you're
fighting for your right

01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:54.140
to be able to go compete
as a disabled athlete,

01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.020
then it has to be all
disabled athletes.

01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:59.640
It can't just be fighting
for the men or vice versa.

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:02.660
So I think for us, it's
kind of getting over

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:05.420
that step of just fighting
it or just advocating

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:06.890
in your one silo.

01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:10.780
It has to be an across
the board fight.

01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:13.174
- Yeah, there's a
group called RISE,

01:34:13.174 --> 01:34:14.840
and I don't know what
it all stands for,

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.310
but they're working
with athletes

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:20.060
to help them decide to make the
decision of whether to speak

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:22.640
up, and what risks that
they face with speaking

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.150
up, and helping them understand
that the risk of not speaking

01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:30.330
up is you go for decades
and years wishing you had,

01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:32.840
and figuring out how to
balance those things.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.010
Because when you speak up, and
you might find that suddenly

01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:39.740
you're not being given
the same amount of time

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.750
on the field of
play, and you have--

01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:44.960
the coach-athlete dynamic
is a powerful one,

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:49.175
which needs a lot more
exploration as well.

01:34:49.175 --> 01:34:50.540
Enough said.

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.720
- I say this to young
people all the time.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.360
That if you feel because of
your personality or your lack

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:59.210
of even experience
in speaking out,

01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:01.880
that it's not something that's
going to sit well with you,

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:04.010
find somebody who can.

01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:06.680
Is there a tenured
female faculty member

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:08.600
who can make your case?

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.880
Is there somebody else on your
team that you can work with?

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.250
You could be the researcher.

01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:14.625
You could be the
one that gathers

01:35:14.625 --> 01:35:17.300
the ammunition and starts
planning what should be said.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.850
You don't have to actually
absolutely say it,

01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:22.130
you just have to make
sure it gets said.

01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:28.370
- I think we're pretty
much out of time.

01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:31.010
And what I would
like us all to do

01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:32.930
is to thank our
panelists for getting--

01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:34.430
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:36.230
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:41.080
- Nice job.
