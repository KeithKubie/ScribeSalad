00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.440
LOUISE: It's my pleasure
to welcome today

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.110
Doug Stone and Sheila Heen,
the authors of the new book,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.080
"Thanks for the
Feedback: The Science

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.360
and the Art of Receiving
Feedback Well."

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.430
Sheila and Doug are
lecturers of law at Harvard

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.180
and founders of the
Triad Consulting Group.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.390
They authored the classic
best-seller "Difficult

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.640
Conversations" and have now
released their latest book,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.600
"Thanks for the
Feedback," the first book

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.840
to assert that
receiving feedback

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.070
well is a skill that can
be taught and refined.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.090
We all get feedback-- informal,
formal, explicit, implicit--

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.690
in our personal and
professional lives every day.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.160
Feedback is fundamental.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010
We can't grow without it.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.960
Giving and receiving
feedback is also

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.580
central to Google's culture.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.150
It's how we're able to make
the products that change

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.151
people's lives and how we're
able to help one another grow.

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:52.775
Many of us are currently in the
process of asking and receiving

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.260
for feedback through our
performance review cycle.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.360
So this is a timely topic
we can all learn more about.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.264
Please join me in
welcoming Sheila and Doug.

00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:05.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.900
SHEILA HEEN: Thank you.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.340
And thank you so
much for coming.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.935
I'm Sheila and this
is Doug, just in case

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:13.760
you need to keep
us straight, OK?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.300
So as Louise
mentioned, 15 years ago

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.390
we published "Difficult
Conversations."

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.680
What were you guys
doing 15 years ago?

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.890
Google barely existed, right?

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.090
So you guys have been busy.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.756
Which raises the
question, what the heck

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.210
have we been doing
for the last 15 years?

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.480
"Difficult Conversations" came
out and pretty quickly started

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.200
doing well.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.430
And over the last
15 years, we have

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.510
been amazed to find what
people are doing with it.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.100
I was talking to somebody
at NASA last week

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130
and learned that it
has been downloaded

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.480
onto the International
Space Station.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.150
Which is fascinating, but I
guess if you're out on a space

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.200
walk, you really want
to be getting along

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.870
with the guy who lets
you back in, right?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.910
I also met a woman
recently who uses

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.030
it to teach Argentinian
tango, which has very subtle

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.580
signaling apparently
between the two partners.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.040
It's not the melodramatic thing
that we see in the movies.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.210
And she told me
that actually when

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.520
couples come to her to
learn this together,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.710
by the end of the first
lesson, they are fighting.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.599
Like, you're not
signaling clearly enough,

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.640
you're not communicating.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.140
Well, you're never
listening to me.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.440
I'm trying to tell you
what we're going to do.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.720
So she sends them home with
"Difficult Conversations."

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.660
So in addition to all of the
usual graduate school business

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.790
management applications, it's
being used in marriage therapy.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.540
Now here's what happens when
you have a book that does well.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.077
They want you to do another one.

00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:45.410
They want you to do another one.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.050
I'm being coached
to walk this way.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.010
I'm trying to
receive the feedback.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.590
And they want you
to do another one.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.289
And they want it to be as close
as possible to the original.

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.330
Because then all the people
who like the original

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.617
will buy the follow-up.

00:02:58.617 --> 00:03:00.200
So they're suggesting,
well, you could

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.850
do "Difficult
Conversations at Work"

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.650
and "Difficult
Conversations at Home"

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.880
and "Difficult
Conversations for Chefs"

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.380
and "Difficult
Conversations on the Patio."

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.959
And that made sense
in the business world,

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.250
publishing world that we're in.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.510
But we really felt like
we covered that here.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.130
We really wrote this to span
personal and professional life.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.110
And, I guess, for chefs, too.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.310
So we really need to
learn something new

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.942
before we can
write another book.

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:29.650
And that became the
question of the hour.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.426
What are we learning that's new?

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:33.050
Then it became the
question of the year

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.380
and then the question
of the decade.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.171
And during this time,
what we were actually

00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:40.830
doing is going around
working with corporations

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.640
across all different kinds
of industries as well

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.660
as non-profits working
in ethnic conflict,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.410
working with
families, et cetera.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.260
And the first thing that we
do when we work with a group

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.742
is that we ask them, so what
are your hardest conversations?

00:03:54.742 --> 00:03:56.450
Because we want to be
working on the real

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.180
stuff that they're
grappling with

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.840
to make it realistic
and relevant.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.990
And we started noticing
a pattern, which

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.340
was that feedback
was coming up a lot.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.020
To put a finer point
on it, feedback

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.330
showed up on that
list 100% of the time,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.690
across six continents and
all different industries.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.420
It didn't matter who
we were talking to.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.045
It didn't matter why
they brought us in

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:18.410
or what we were talking about.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.118
The first thing that
would always come up

00:04:20.118 --> 00:04:22.200
is giving honest feedback.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.820
Because the receiver,
they get defensive

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.890
or they get demotivated or
you hurt your relationship.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.010
So, like, who needs it?

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.380
But quickly on
the heels of that,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.700
people would name, well, but
receiving feedback that's

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.040
unfair or it's off base and
definitely poorly delivered.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.610
Like, really?

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.630
In front of everybody
else at the meeting?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.440
Or by text?

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.990
Seriously?

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.180
And so the usual fix for
that in organizations

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.649
is to teach givers how to give.

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:52.190
So you get all the
managers together.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.880
And you train them to
give it more skillfully

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.450
and more often and more
persistently if it's resisted.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.650
And that makes a lot of sense.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.030
We teach that stuff, too.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.130
But eventually it occurred to
us that actually, in many cases,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.050
it doesn't matter how much power
or authority or skill the giver

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.700
has, the receiver is
actually the one who's

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.200
in charge of what they let in,
what sense they make of it,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.980
and whether and how
they choose to change.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.540
And so we started
to look at, well,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.890
gosh what's out
there for receivers?

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.790
Because one of the fundamental
human challenges in life

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.637
is figuring out how to
learn about yourself.

00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:34.470
And so what we're going
to talk a little bit

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.360
about this afternoon
is what we've

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.260
learned about the challenges.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.930
Now I don't know
about you, but I

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.620
have a very ambivalent
relationship

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.524
to receiving feedback.

00:05:44.524 --> 00:05:46.690
Like there are times where
I'm working with someone.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.010
It's so incredibly helpful.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.240
I can feel myself improve.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.260
I'm getting better at something.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.910
You've got a mentor that
you really trust or a coach.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.130
It's exhilarating.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.410
And then there are
other times where

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.870
I get the offhand criticism
from my mother-in-law

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.000
or from up here, who's
clearly the problem is them

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.620
in terms of them being
difficult to work with.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.450
And feedback can also
be incredibly painful.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.540
And there's this
funny phenomenon--

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.700
and I'm curious what your
experience has been--

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.124
that sometimes the things
we learn the most from,

00:06:23.124 --> 00:06:25.540
either about ourselves or that
change us the most in life,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.410
are experiences that
are most painful.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.700
How many people would say for
them that rings true sometimes?

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.610
So one of the reasons,
then-- and this

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.680
is the starting place
for us-- feedback is hard

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.060
because we are
conflicted about it.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.680
And we have really varied
experiences with it.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.490
Feedback actually sits at
the crux of two human needs.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.670
Number one, is the human
need to learn and grow

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.650
to achieve mastery to
get better at something.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.280
That is hardwired
into us, right?

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.847
It's why we're addicted
to those games, right?

00:07:00.847 --> 00:07:01.930
To getting a better score.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.200
It's also why we take up hobbies
in retirement where you're

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.680
supposed to be
done with learning.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.520
It's why people who
otherwise seem normal

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.020
stick with golf, because
the good round makes

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.610
you think actually you're
getting better at it.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.830
But sitting right
alongside that is the need

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.160
to be accepted,
respected, loved,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.280
to feel safe just
the way you are now.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.690
And the very fact
of feedback often

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.150
suggests that how you
are now isn't quite A-OK.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.720
And so I don't think this
tension is going to go away,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.920
but it helps us understand
why even though we're always

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.820
told we sometimes experience
feedback as a gift, sometimes

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.280
it feels more like a colonoscopy
because of this safety

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.020
question.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.690
So what we want to
do is just invite

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.960
you to think about the feedback
that you have received.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.970
I'm going to turn
things over to Doug.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.412
DOUGLAS STONE: So we're going
to put you to work a little bit.

00:07:54.412 --> 00:07:57.460
I'd like you to think
of a time in your life

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:03.330
when you received feedback
that you did not take.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.485
And I want you to think
of what that feedback was.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.860
And then I want
you to see if you

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.640
can identify the reason
that you didn't take it.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.380
And we'll give you
about three minutes.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.710
And if you could pair up
with someone near you,

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.190
just quickly share some
feedback you didn't take

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.060
and then what was the reason
that you didn't take it.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.560
Question?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.796
AUDIENCE: By taking,
do what they suggested?

00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:26.170
DOUGLAS STONE: Do what they
suggested, take it to heart--

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.630
SHEILA HEEN: Or agree with it.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:27.850
DOUGLAS STONE: [INAUDIBLE]
want to do that change.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.380
SHEILA HEEN: So it might
have been an evaluation

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.820
that you didn't agree with.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.870
So you're like, I'm
not accepting that.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.506
So it could either be
advice or evaluation.

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:37.630
DOUGLAS STONE: So we'll
come back in three minutes,

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.280
and we'll get a sense
of where you're at.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.039
So let's just get a quick sense.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:48.390
What are some reasons why
you didn't take the feedback?

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:48.900
Yes?

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.792
AUDIENCE: Didn't
trust the feedbacker.

00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:53.750
DOUGLAS STONE: You didn't
trust the feedbacker.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.650
AUDIENCE: Or their motivations.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.419
DOUGLAS STONE: Their
motivations, right?

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:57.460
Like what's up with that?

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.751
Why are they giving this to me?

00:08:58.751 --> 00:08:59.940
A little suspicious.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.785
Yep?

00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:03.160
AUDIENCE: Because
the feedback was

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.907
given in a very poor manner,
if either aggressively or--

00:09:07.907 --> 00:09:09.615
DOUGLAS STONE:
Aggressively, poor manner.

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:12.330
AUDIENCE: Aggressively
and personally.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.260
DOUGLAS STONE: Yeah.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.429
So it was sort of an
attack on you a little bit.

00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:17.304
AUDIENCE: Yeah, rather
than-- so the feedback

00:09:17.304 --> 00:09:19.160
could have been
perfectly adequate

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.539
if it would have been done--
given in the right tone.

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:22.330
DOUGLAS STONE: Yup.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.976
SHEILA HEEN: Be sure to repeat
because people remotely can't

00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:25.600
hear otherwise.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.581
DOUGLAS STONE: OK.

00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:27.080
Others?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.580
Yeah?

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.230
AUDIENCE: I just don't think
the feedback makes sense.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.188
DOUGLAS STONE: The feedback
doesn't make sense.

00:09:32.188 --> 00:09:33.380
It's wrong, stupid, right?

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.220
Something like that?

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:35.720
Others?

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.220
Others?

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.490
In the back?

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.416
You guys also have
rejected feedback.

00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:42.157
Yep?

00:09:42.157 --> 00:09:43.740
AUDIENCE: I had a
competing commitment

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.210
that I was trying to
integrate the feedback

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.680
with this competing commitment.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.360
DOUGLAS STONE:
Yeah, so you say you

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.130
have a competing commitment.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.090
It may not be sort of what
you're working on right now.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.880
Or it contradicts something
else that's important to you.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.480
Good.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.610
So there's lots of reasons that
we don't take feedback, right?

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.630
And often people like me
will stand up in front

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.310
and say, look, you're
supposed to take feedback.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.230
It's good for you.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.050
You know that.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.850
So just get over it
and take the feedback.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.385
But in fact, we see that
there are real reasons.

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:18.224
There are real
challenges, tensions

00:10:18.224 --> 00:10:19.890
that we experience
when we get feedback.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.280
And we've good reasons
for not actually

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.180
taking the feedback sometimes.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.660
So that the first step in being
good at taking feedback-- and I

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.610
should say, being good at
receiving feedback well

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.620
doesn't mean that you
take the feedback.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.400
It means that you
engage well with it,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.000
that you understand
it, and then sort out.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.530
So step one in
receiving feedback well

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.640
is knowing your own
tendencies when you get it.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.720
How do you respond?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.460
What are those internal voice
thoughts, the ways that you get

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.470
triggered, that may get in
the way of you engaging well?

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.670
And you might think, as you
reflect on yourself and others,

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.200
you might think,
well, there's got

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.740
to be a billion reasons,
a googolplex, if you will,

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.890
of reasons why a person
might reject feedback.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.700
But in fact, Sheila and I've
been teaching this material

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.010
all around the world.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.210
And the reasons
sort pretty nicely

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.120
into three different categories.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.250
So if you can get a grip
on these three categories,

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.090
then you've got some real
insight into typical ways

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.450
that we hear feedback.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.620
So the first category is
what we call truth triggers.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.980
Or it's the problem to see
the feedback, understand it.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.130
This is your comment about,
it doesn't make sense.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.340
So how many people
would take feedback

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.030
if you knew it was
wrong and stupid?

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.840
Probably not so much.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.100
So it makes sense
to sort feedback

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.240
for is it good, bad, right,
wrong, helpful, stupid.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.750
Someone says, you've got to
speak out more at the meetings.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.540
In that last meeting you
were at, you were very quiet.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.120
And you're thinking, OK, but
I wasn't at that meeting.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.640
And my name is not Mike.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.730
And so this feedback
is just all wrong.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.510
So we are very smart to sort
for whether the feedback make

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.980
sense, whether it
seems right and useful.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.700
The challenge is that very
often we sort before we even

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.360
know what the feedback means.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.410
So we've decided what
the feedback means.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.190
And we think, OK, now I'm going
to put it in the reject pile.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.900
But we actually don't
know yet what it means.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.630
And we'll say a little
more about that.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.820
Or we're listening
to the feedback

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.220
through what we
call wrong spotting.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.580
We're patrolling for whether
it's totally right or not.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.940
And if we can find
anything wrong with it--

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.660
that we don't like
the tone of voice,

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.200
maybe the feedback,
the content, was

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.260
OK-- if we can find
anything wrong with it,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.920
we might set the
whole feedback aside.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.280
And there may be 90%
of the feedback that

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.130
really doesn't
make sense for us.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.290
But there could
be that golden 10%

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.260
that would actually
be quite helpful.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.220
So we'll come back to this
truth trigger in a moment.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.510
A second category has to
do with the relationship.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.560
This was your
comment about, well,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.170
I don't trust their motivations.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.510
Maybe I'm not sure why are
they giving me this feedback.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.920
Or maybe I don't
trust their expertise.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.350
There's something
about them that

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.650
makes me a little suspicious.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.072
Or it could be-- do
you have-- I just need

00:13:25.072 --> 00:13:26.072
a little glass of water.

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:30.010
Or it could be that you
feel uncomfortable by how

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.560
you're treated by them.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.186
You might feel under
appreciated by them.

00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:39.560
Let's say you do
someone a favor.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.200
You cover for them at work
while they're on sick leave.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.200
Then they come back, and
the first thing they do

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.000
is they say, well while
you were covering for me,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.332
you didn't even finish that
project I was working on.

00:13:51.332 --> 00:13:52.040
That wasn't good.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.510
Now I'm in a hole.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.510
And you're thinking, OK,
let's talk about the project,

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.200
but you're not going to
thank me for covering first?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.200
The first words out of
your mouth are criticism?

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.700
If you feel under
appreciated, it's

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.620
like an automatic
feedback defeat button.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.760
Like you can't take
feedback from someone

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.780
as you're feeling also
under appreciated by them.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.220
So there are relationship
triggers, often defeat feedback

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.900
as well, whether or not
the feedback make sense.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.250
And then the third category is
what we call identity triggers.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.050
We all go through
life with a sense

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.090
of who we are, a
sense of how we are.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.230
And there are ways that
we are that matter to us.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.560
So you might think of
yourself as a fair person

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.490
or a smart person
or hardworking,

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.840
kind-- whatever it is to you.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:47.370
And feedback represents a
threat to how you see yourself.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.990
Or it has the potential to
threaten how you see yourself.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.640
And here, we end up rejecting
the feedback not even

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.520
necessarily because we think the
feedback is wrong or unhelpful.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.450
We simply reject
it because we're

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.450
feeling overwhelmed by what
that threat might represent.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.070
If this feedback is right
about me and I take it in,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.180
I become flooded.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.240
I feel anxious,
depressed, overwhelmed.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.660
So we set it aside.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.310
And people are very differently
sensitive around that kind

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.810
of thing.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.940
In fact, there's a statistic
where one study showed

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:28.700
that people vary up to 3,000%
in their ability to recover,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.060
or the time it takes
for them to recover,

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.460
from very challenging feedback.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.850
And so some of us are on
the more sensitive side

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:36.610
of the continuum.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.380
And some of us are on
the insensitive side

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.370
of the continuum.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.250
Maybe insensitive isn't
the right word for that.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.070
Maybe even-keeled is better?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.276
Although if you're on
the insensitive side,

00:15:48.276 --> 00:15:49.400
you're kind of insensitive.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.820
So you probably don't
care what I call you.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.600
How many of you
would say that you're

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.330
toward the more sensitive
side of the spectrum?

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.700
And how many would say you're
on the more even-keeled side?

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.360
One person at Google
is even-keeled.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.590
So a few in both categories.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.080
So one of the interesting
things is knowing yourself

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.280
on that continuum,
but also you're

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.230
giving each other feedback.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.720
When a person on one
side gives feedback

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.100
to someone on the
other side, it's

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.210
interesting because we
all assume, more or less,

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.946
that people are like s.

00:16:23.946 --> 00:16:25.320
And if you tend
to be even-keeled

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.240
and you're giving
feedback to someone

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.460
who is more easily
triggered, you

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.210
might give it very
directly because you're

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.090
thinking that's how
I like the feedback.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.190
And it might upset them
far more than you're

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.564
aware, and vice versa.

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.730
Someone who's more sensitive
might give the feedback

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.684
in a kind of roundabout
way, and the person

00:16:42.684 --> 00:16:44.850
on the other side of the
continuum is thinking like,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:45.729
just say it.

00:16:45.729 --> 00:16:46.270
Just tell me.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.340
Just get to the point.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.250
So it can create these
interesting mismatches.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.230
So this first step,
though, as we say,

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.960
is getting to know
your own tendencies

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.640
in the face of feedback.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.440
Which of these are
being triggered

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.040
when you get
feedback is step one.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.569
And then so now what do we do?

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.547
How do we handle each
of these triggers

00:17:07.547 --> 00:17:08.880
as we move through the feedback?

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.000
So we're going to say a
few things about each.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.440
So I'm going to put
up this statement.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.859
And I'm going to ask you,
let's just brainstorm.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.730
So we're in the "see."

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.319
We're talking about
now the substance

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.569
of the feedback,
this first trigger.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:29.360
If someone says to you,
or you say to someone,

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.120
"I don't like the
way those pants look

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.670
on you," what might that mean?

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.920
What's a range of
meanings that someone

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.450
might have if they say this?

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.427
AUDIENCE: You're fat?

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:42.510
DOUGLAS STONE: You're fat.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.740
Yes, correct.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.720
So, in fact, the person's
saying the word "pants"

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.320
but they really mean the word
"you" and the word "fat."

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.450
What else might it mean?

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.025
AUDIENCE: Those
pants are hideous.

00:17:55.025 --> 00:17:56.650
DOUGLAS STONE: Those
pants are hideous.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.389
So maybe it really
is about the pants.

00:17:59.389 --> 00:18:00.930
It might have nothing
to do with you.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.740
It's just those pants.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.846
What else?

00:18:03.846 --> 00:18:04.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.157
DOUGLAS STONE: Sorry.

00:18:05.157 --> 00:18:06.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.010
DOUGLAS STONE: Say it again?

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.290
AUDIENCE: Our tastes
are different.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.020
DOUGLAS STONE: Our
tastes are different.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.520
So it's just my taste
versus your taste, right?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.675
And you were--

00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:15.262
AUDIENCE: I was going to say
that the speaker didn't sew

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:17.427
them properly or didn't
pick them out or something.

00:18:17.427 --> 00:18:20.954
And maybe actually the comment
is referring back to maybe

00:18:20.954 --> 00:18:22.718
what the speaker
had done before.

00:18:22.718 --> 00:18:24.850
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.200
DOUGLAS STONE: So the speaker
had some contribution.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.240
I didn't pick them
out properly for you.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.320
So it's a comment about me.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.820
Other?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.802
AUDIENCE: When you wear
them, it reminds me of my ex.

00:18:34.802 --> 00:18:36.293
And you're nothing like my ex.

00:18:36.293 --> 00:18:38.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.200
DOUGLAS STONE: When you wear
them, it reminds me of my ex.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.210
And you're nothing like my ex.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.700
Because my ex is so
great or so horrible?

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.542
AUDIENCE: Horrible.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.230
DOUGLAS STONE: Oh.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.830
So this is like the biggest
compliment you could ever give.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.849
So you are so much better
that you just erase all this.

00:18:56.849 --> 00:18:58.640
"I love you so much"
is what you're saying.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.350
And I hated my ex.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.297
OK, so a very
positive statement.

00:19:03.297 --> 00:19:05.630
How long do your relationships
tend to last, by the way?

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.590
So here's the thing.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.960
So we have a range from
it's about these pants--

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.350
maybe their wrinkled
or maybe their--

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.990
to the match of the
pants on the person.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.700
Could be about just the person.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.810
You're out of shape or
you've gained weight.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.800
Could be about the
person's judgment.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.520
It's a comment on your ability
to function as an adult

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.380
and dress yourself.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.130
It could be about a
whole range of things.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.930
And when we give or
receive feedback,

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.070
very often we're using
words that are-- actually

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.120
all those are
single-syllable words.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.860
They're easy words
to understand.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.720
And we all think, well,
this has a common meaning.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.810
But in fact, it's not clear.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.470
And feedback very
often is very labely.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.227
Let's take a look at just some
of the things that we've heard.

00:20:00.227 --> 00:20:02.560
I don't like the way these
particular pants look on you.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.601
Oh, actually, in different
light, they look fine.

00:20:04.601 --> 00:20:06.530
So that's the most specific.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.420
Maybe these kinds of
pants, getting broader.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.820
So now it's more about you.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.430
You're not as fit anymore.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.710
You've never had
any taste, and I'm

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.280
trying to save
you from yourself.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.990
This next one, I'm humiliated
to be seen around you,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.020
and you don't seem to care.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.380
So it's about both of us,
but you being inconsiderate.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:32.910
And then the really sad one, it
could be easing into a divorce.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.950
So it could have a
range of meanings.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.850
And this is genuinely
representative of the way

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.580
we tend to give feedback
or the way we get it.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.420
It tends to come in
what Sheila and I call

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.840
labels, these very
general terms.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.157
And people are well
intentioned, but there may not

00:20:53.157 --> 00:20:54.240
be a common understanding.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.110
So for example, someone-- Yes?

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:01.670
AUDIENCE: Are these the range
in which we take feedback,

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.711
or that people give
feedback, or both?

00:21:04.711 --> 00:21:06.460
DOUGLAS STONE: So the
question is, is this

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.360
the range that we take
feedback when we're receiving

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.710
or that we give feedback
when we're giving?

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.066
Yeah, the answer
is both, that we

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.440
don't know what
the person means.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.040
The giver knows what
the giver means.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.470
And then the receiver
might come up

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.000
with a meaning that might
or might not match that.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.580
So the receiver
might walk around

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.430
all day and all
week and all year

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.590
thinking we've got this terrible
problem in our relationship.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:40.310
And the giver is thinking,
those aren't the best pants

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.770
for the party we're
about to go to.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.030
And so there's just
a vast mismatch.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.350
So in the workplace,
we get feedback

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.760
that is very labely as well.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.730
So someone says
be more assertive

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.797
or speak up in the meeting.

00:21:53.797 --> 00:21:55.130
Well, what do these things mean?

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.070
Sheila and I did a radio
interview the other day

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.970
where the guy was commenting on
a label that he'd been given.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.630
And his producer
said, you really

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.480
got to be more
edgy on the radio.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.320
You got to have
an edgier persona.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.600
And the host of the show
is walking around for weeks

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.140
thinking like how
can I be more edgy?

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.370
I got to pepper my
comments with swear words.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.940
And maybe I should
talk about sex.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.360
Or maybe I should
attack people and get

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.130
some real stuff going here.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.800
And he finally decided
that just not my persona.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.570
It's not who I am.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.840
So he's going to talk this
producer, and he's saying,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.830
it's really not who I am.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.530
And then he realized,
but I actually

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.050
don't understand exactly what
you mean when you say "edgy."

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.340
So he said, what did
you mean, by the way?

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.380
And the producer said,
well, by "edgier,"

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.340
you got to be more sort of
emotionally open and vulnerable

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:47.960
on your show.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.437
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:50.520
People like vulnerability.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.180
And so there was this
huge misunderstanding.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.790
And it's not that
there's a right or wrong.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.780
It's that one person has
an idea in their head.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.020
They're trying to help the
other person understand that.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.800
And it's not clear.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.660
So the advice-- the
question is, so how do you

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.070
dig under these labels
and understand them?

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.750
And we recommend two very
powerful, useful questions.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.040
Your feedback has a past, and
your feedback has a future.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.520
So we have the
label in the middle.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.080
Look back and say
to the person who's

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.300
giving you the
feedback, when you

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.240
say I should be more
assertive, looking back,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.960
what are you
referring to in terms

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.850
of my behavior or attitude?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.150
Describe to me what sort
of provoked the feedback.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.940
What do you see?

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.330
And then looking forward, how
would I do it differently?

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.829
What would be an example of how
I would do this differently?

00:23:43.829 --> 00:23:47.050
What is being assertive
look like to you

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.610
as you're giving
me this feedback?

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:56.040
So this truth trigger, the
goal of seeing the feedback,

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.510
is really a matter of
spotting these labels, digging

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.260
under them.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.130
Once you understand
the feedback,

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.667
it doesn't mean you
therefore always take it.

00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:06.250
But now that you
understand it, you're

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.070
in a really good
position to figure out

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.180
what does it mean
and should I take it,

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.520
or are there aspects of it
that I should take, or not.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.785
Let me turn it over Sheila.

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:15.660
SHEILA HEEN: So, so far
Doug has been talking

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.517
about truth triggers or
the challenge to see,

00:24:18.517 --> 00:24:20.100
the challenge to see
what in the world

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.970
is the giver talking
about, and what exactly

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.760
are they suggesting,
and to understand

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.480
that before you decide do
I think this is good advice

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.610
or not.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.950
And as Doug said, 90%
of it might be off,

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.497
but 10% might give you
something to think about.

00:24:34.497 --> 00:24:36.080
The other part of
the challenge to see

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.940
is the challenge
to see yourself.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.644
So we have a chapter
about blind spots.

00:24:40.644 --> 00:24:42.060
I don't actually
have blind spots,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.760
but I know that all
of you do, right?

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.050
And there's all this information
other people have about you

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.930
that you don't have
about yourself.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.530
And so that's another piece
of the challenge to see.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.740
I'm going to step over
into the challenge of "we,"

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.650
the who the giver is in our
relationship, which actually

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.130
taints the what of what
they're trying to tell me.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.924
By the way, when
you're writing a book,

00:25:04.924 --> 00:25:06.340
you're trying to
figure out, well,

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.130
in what order do
we tell this story?

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.170
"See, we, me" is the order
that we finally settled on.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.170
We considered "we,
see, me," which

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.380
had nice resonance for
feedback receiving.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.995
The only one we knew was
not going to work was "see,

00:25:19.995 --> 00:25:23.930
me, we," which really was
not going to be appealing.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.450
So I'm going to step into
"we," the challenge of we,

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.890
or the relationship.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.440
And I want to focus
specifically on situations

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.590
where the feedback is actually
coming from the relationship.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.760
And the other person feels like
something isn't working here.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.190
You're kind of driving me crazy.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.480
And it's probably mutual.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.540
And so to fix this, you're
the one who needs to change.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.070
Right?

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.220
So it's not I'm
going to help you

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.684
with your skills in
a foreign language.

00:25:51.684 --> 00:25:53.100
I'm going to get
better at tennis.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.750
It's actually, I'm going
to help you not annoy me

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.770
as much as you do, or
to change something

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.270
because it's
frustrating to me and I

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.020
think we could work
better together.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.970
The easiest way to
understand this, I think,

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.480
is just through an example.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.560
So a few years ago, I
got a call from a CEO.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.880
And he said, I've got these
eight senior vice presidents.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.070
They each run a function.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.960
As a team, they can't
stand each other.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.160
They drive each other crazy.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.451
They can't make good decisions.

00:26:20.451 --> 00:26:22.800
They all come to me to
complain about each other.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.520
So I need you to fix them.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.430
OK, so there's a whole other
set of conversations with him

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.930
that we need to
have, but let's talk

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.167
about the team for a moment.

00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:33.250
The first thing I do is I
do individual interviews

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.000
with each member of
the team to understand

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.480
from your perspective
what's going on.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.960
And what I find
here is something

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.990
that is common in teams that
are struggling to work together,

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.620
which is that you actually have
a couple of primary conflicts

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.080
between individuals that
everybody else is trying

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.380
to work around or manage, right?

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.850
Or line up around.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.780
And on this particular team,
one of the key conflicts

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.170
is between a guy I'm going
to call Sam and a guy I'll

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.365
call Pete to protect the guilty.

00:27:00.365 --> 00:27:01.540
Do we want this over here?

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:01.820
MICHAEL: Yeah.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.860
SHEILA HEEN: Where do
you want it, Michael?

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.720
That good?

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.255
All right.

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:07.090
A guy I'll call Sam and
a guy I'll call Pete.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.800
Now Sam, by the way, is one
of these no-filter people.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.420
Like whatever comes
into his head, he says.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.300
You know people like that?

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.150
Yeah, OK.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.870
So when I first talked to
Sam the first time, actually,

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.940
he answered the phone
not by saying hello, he

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.289
answered the phone by saying,
you're seven minutes late.

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:25.330
I said, nice to meet you.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.040
Let's use our last 23
minutes well, shall we?

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.450
And he said, well, look,
it's a waste of time, anyway.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.480
The CEO is making us come to
this two-day thing with you,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.150
but the real problem here
is that these other guys--

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.580
and especially Pete--
can't handle conflict.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.720
If I got a problem with
you, I'll just tell you.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.820
We'll debate it out.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.712
We'll figure it out.

00:27:42.712 --> 00:27:44.170
We'll go out for
a beer afterwards.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.760
But Sheila, you're not going
to change their personalities.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.460
And that's why this
is a waste of time.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.800
And he hung up.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.840
Eventually, I get
a hold of Pete.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.010
Now Pete tells me right off
the bat, I hate conflict.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.030
In fact, the CEO
is making us come

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.900
to this two-day thing with you.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.620
Frankly, I'm just
hoping to have my heart

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.490
attack in the first hour.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.126
Like, it is going to kill
me one way or another.

00:28:08.126 --> 00:28:09.750
The question is just
how much suffering

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:10.850
will be involved, right?

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:12.400
I'd hate to have it
in the last hour.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.350
So Sam is the head
of operations.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.790
Just to make this
more fun, operations

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.160
used to be Pete's job.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.030
Pete moved over and
took over international.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:26.540
Why?

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.039
Well, partly because
it's the growth

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:30.822
engine for the
organization, but also,

00:28:30.822 --> 00:28:33.030
he admits to me, so that he
can be out of the country

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.940
most of the time and
not deal with Sam.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.600
Now you tell me.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.120
There's a problem between
operations and international,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.380
oh, every few days.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.886
Who starts the conversation?

00:28:43.886 --> 00:28:44.620
AUDIENCE: Sam.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.828
SHEILA HEEN: Sam, you betcha.

00:28:45.828 --> 00:28:47.140
So Sam calls Pete.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.250
What does Pete do?

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.380
AUDIENCE: Not pick up.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.380
SHEILA HEEN: Yeah, he
does not answer the phone.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.550
From Pete's point
of view, caller ID

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.897
is the best invention ever, OK?

00:28:55.897 --> 00:28:57.230
So he let's it go to voice mail.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.147
What does Sam do next?

00:28:58.147 --> 00:28:58.980
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.700
AUDIENCE: Leaves a
nasty voice mail.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.280
SHEILA HEEN: He leaves a voice
mail, and then he emails him.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.510
Now Pete sees Sam's name
show up in is inbox, which

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.280
causes him instant
anxiety, right?

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.177
He's already triggered.

00:29:12.177 --> 00:29:14.010
And so he's in the
middle of something else.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.051
He doesn't have time to
deal with this right now.

00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:17.719
So he lets it sit.

00:29:17.719 --> 00:29:19.010
What's the next thing Sam does?

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.315
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:21.315 --> 00:29:25.180
SHEILA HEEN: Emails him
again, texts him, right?

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.780
Pete ignores it for now.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.700
Eventually, Sam calls
Pete's right-hand guy, who

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.920
texts Pete and says,
Sam's looking for you.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.630
Pete texts back, I know, right?

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.580
And then eventually Sam goes
above Pete to Pete's boss,

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.450
to the CEO.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:45.740
Now, by the way, about four
minutes has elapsed here.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.390
How many of you are
more sympathetic to Sam?

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.257
In other words, Pete
being this unresponsive

00:29:50.257 --> 00:29:51.215
is just unprofessional.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.314
More sympathetic to Pete?

00:29:58.314 --> 00:29:59.480
You have a Sam in your life.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.730
They drive you totally nuts.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.420
Yeah?

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.210
OK.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.420
Are they both contributing
to this problem?

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.200
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.970
SHEILA HEEN: Yeah.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.370
So by the way, on your team,
as you watch things like this,

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.000
you often will be more
sympathetic to one side

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.320
or the other just based
on your own profile.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.520
But this is what we call a
self-reinforcing relationship

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.370
system.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.770
And each of them has feedback
for the other about what's

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.580
wrong with you that makes you
impossible to work with, right?

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.560
And coaching.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.560
We call it a self-reinforcing
cycle, relationship cycle,

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.480
or system because their
emotional coping strategies

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.250
are actually making it worse.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.200
They're eliciting exactly
the behavior they don't like.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:44.160
In other words, the more Sam
pursues, the more Pete avoids.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.700
And the more Pete avoids,
the more aggressively Sam

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.370
pursues, which means
the more Pete flees.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.050
Pete actually admitted to me
that he was in Afghanistan once

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.360
on a satellite phone and
it didn't have caller ID.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.640
So he answered.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.772
Sam launches into, this
is what we have to do

00:30:59.772 --> 00:31:02.230
and you need to make a decision
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.280
And he was so
overwhelmed, he was like,

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.300
[STATIC NOISE] oh,
we're breaking up.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:05.600
Sorry.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.470
And hung up on him.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.750
Now can this change?

00:31:15.184 --> 00:31:17.100
We're not going to change
their personalities,

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.960
but I don't think, when we talk
about feedback and coaching,

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.000
you have to change
people's personalities.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
There are very
specific behaviors

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.920
that are actually
making it worse.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.450
Now the place where we finally
got some traction on this

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.730
was a moment where it was like
the afternoon of the first day

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:36.250
of this dreaded
two days together,

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.500
and we had kicked the CEO out.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.510
It was just the eight
senior vice presidents.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.900
And Sam turns to Pete
and says, Pete, I just

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.800
don't understand why, when I
tell you you're full of shit,

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.100
you think I'm attacking you.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.960
Excuse my language.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.280
Now of course, this is
exactly what Pete hates,

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.557
so Pete's like speechless.

00:31:54.557 --> 00:31:56.140
And it took another
member of the team

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.780
to say like, OK, Sam, I
know that that would not

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.130
feel like an attack to you.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.620
To you, that's a
healthy invitation

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.070
to a good conversation.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.400
That doesn't really feel that
way to Pete and, by the way,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.850
a couple of others of us.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.525
And they started
to map this cycle

00:32:12.525 --> 00:32:14.900
so that they could see the
ways in which actually they're

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.780
coping strategies were
inadvertently making it worse.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.780
And then what we
did, feedback-wise,

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.290
is we just reversed
these arrows.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.630
So we asked Pete, look,
give Sam some advice.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.160
If he needs a response from
you, what should he do?

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.740
Tell him one thing to do.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.330
And Pete said, oh, that's easy.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.370
First of all, don't call me.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.870
When you call me,
you already know

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.620
what the issue is and you've
got your arguments ready.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.600
And so I have to pick
up the phone cold

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.440
and get barraged with
this assault of arguments

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.280
about a problem I didn't even
know existed in many cases.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.690
Instead, send me an email.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.636
In the email, tell me
what's the problem.

00:32:54.636 --> 00:32:56.010
If you have a
preferred solution,

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:57.250
just tell me what it is.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:01.070
And especially tell me by when
do we have to figure this out,

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.900
because everything
is a crisis with you.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.772
And I've got a ton of
things on my plate.

00:33:04.772 --> 00:33:05.730
I've got to prioritize.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.160
So tell me, we've got this
out by tomorrow morning,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.650
or by Friday, whatever it is.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:14.080
Then I can prioritize
and take you seriously.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.450
Sam said, OK, I can do that.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.510
So then we asked Sam,
all right, what advice,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.250
what feedback or coaching
do you have for Pete

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:26.480
if he wants you to
just back off, right?

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.020
And So Sam said,
well, that's easy.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.740
Just tell me you got the email.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.960
Tell me, got it.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.460
Because some of my
anxiety is that I

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.180
can't tell if I'm
getting through to you.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.220
I'm an operations guy.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.830
I have a problem to solve.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.970
If you tell me I got
it and you tell me

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.120
when you're going to get
back to me, I can relax.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.280
I'll put it on my calendar.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.710
I know we're going to talk
tomorrow morning at 8:00.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:47.590
Then I can move on.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.470
All right.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.780
Did this help?

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.830
AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.580
SHEILA HEEN: Yeah.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.680
For a while, right?

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.850
Because, by the way, when
you talk about-- like

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:01.360
they were totally persuaded by
this coaching from the other.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.950
Putting into action, such
a critical next step,

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:08.330
and being consistent about that
action, is a real challenge.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.190
And they needed other
members of their team.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.800
They needed other members
of their team to nudge them.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.360
They also needed to give
each other some leeway.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.170
So if they forgot to--
rather than say, yeah, see?

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.560
This just proves
your impossible.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.699
To nudge, to say, hey, I can't
tell whether you got my email.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.993
Be sure to get back to me.

00:34:25.993 --> 00:34:27.409
Or I saw you left
me a voice mail.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.820
Can you just be sure to send
me an email to follow up,

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.620
and I'll let you know
when I can get to it.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:36.440
When you look at relationships
where you have friction,

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.469
one of the chapters in
the book talks about how

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.530
do you step back to
understand what's going on,

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.330
why you're driving each other
crazy, and what coaching

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.670
might help.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.969
And we really recommend
taking three steps back.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.340
So the first step just
looks at what we call you

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.590
plus me intersections, the
ways in which you and I are

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:58.440
different which are creating
the friction between us.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.820
This, by the way, is why some
of your most valuable feedback

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.020
or coaching can come from
people that you actually

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.990
have difficulty working with.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.640
If you only ask the people
you work with easily,

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.460
they sometimes don't
see your edges, right?

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.920
Because it's just an
easy complementariness.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.710
You have kind of the same
work style or email management

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.020
style, when we'll get back
to each other, et cetera.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.520
The people you find
difficult to work with?

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.820
They see your edges,
partly because they're

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.140
so good at provoking
them, right?

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.700
So they're actually, in some
ways, the most valuable player

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.680
to coach you on one
thing that would actually

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.950
help to make the relationship
easier with less transaction

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:37.620
cost.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.880
And it comes from that whatever
the difference is between you.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.210
The second step back
then looks at roles

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:46.530
because sometimes the role
we're in in the organization

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.290
is part of the friction, like I
have to pester you about this.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.450
But in your role, this
is not top priority

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.870
which is why it always slips
down the priority list.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.630
So some of it is just
the roles that we're

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.200
in that is creating
some of the friction.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.970
And then, of course, the bigger
picture, stepping back, saying,

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.820
well, are there other
players or processes

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.660
or physical environment that
are contributing to the problem

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.030
that we can or can't change?

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.350
I mean, one of the dilemmas
between Sam and Pete

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.140
is that Pete on the other side
of the world a lot of the time.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.475
So Sam is like, why aren't
you getting back to me?

00:36:19.475 --> 00:36:22.660
Well, because I'm sleeping, OK?

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.790
So factoring in and
stepping back to say,

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.930
OK, let me just remember that we
are constrained by some things,

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.310
so that we can sort of
monitor our expectations

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.570
or make changes if there are
changes that can be made.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.140
So this is part of
the challenge of "we."

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.450
And I think getting
feedback about the product

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:43.060
that you're working on is
easier than getting feedback

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.650
about the person that you
are or your management

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.080
style or your work style.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.700
And that's always going
to provoke more reaction

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.990
especially if the
relationship with the giver

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.840
is a little bit
troubled or frustrated.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.600
Let me just now spend
a couple minutes

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.630
in the challenge of being "me."

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.790
So one of the things that's
been really interesting as we've

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.630
been working on this
project looking at both

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:10.820
the social science and
the neuroscience out there

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.020
is, as Doug mentioned,
that each of us

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.720
is wired very differently
in terms of sensitivity

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.920
to feedback.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.950
And we took a look at
three key variables

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.060
that drive your reactivity
or sensitivity to feedback.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.610
The first is what's
called baseline.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.440
And in the literature, this is
sometimes called "set point."

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.100
The idea here is that you,
if it's a scale of one to 10,

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.400
each of us generally
gravitate back

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.280
to a particular
level of happiness

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.340
or satisfaction in life.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.820
So some people live
their life at nine.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.150
They're like incredibly
cheerful and happy

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.761
about everything,
like irrationally

00:37:45.761 --> 00:37:47.260
happy about that
great cup of coffee

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.610
that they had this morning.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.010
Other people live
their life at two.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.840
They're just always a little
chronically dissatisfied.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.252
Now why does this matter?

00:37:56.252 --> 00:37:57.710
By the way, this
comes from studies

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.574
of people who win the lottery.

00:37:59.574 --> 00:38:00.990
And a year later,
they're about as

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.860
happy or unhappy as
they were before.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.180
Also people who go to jail.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.710
A year later, they're about
as happy or unhappy as they

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.500
were before.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.250
OK, so this is sort
of where you gravitate

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.960
back for in the absence
of other events.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.800
One of the reasons
baseline is important is

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.945
that if you do have a relatively
low baseline, like you're

00:38:19.945 --> 00:38:23.560
a two or a three, positive
feedback can sometimes

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.220
be muffled for you.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:29.960
You won't hear positive
feedback as clearly.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.090
If you have a high baseline,
you will hear negative feedback.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.960
And that's partly because
positive information in life

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.870
and negative or threatening
information in life,

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.000
our system just is
wired differently.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.160
We have a threat alert system.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.040
So negative feedback
is more likely to have

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.324
a mainline to your soul.

00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:48.740
And positive
feedback doesn't have

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.600
that as direct a connection
emotionally, interestingly.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.410
The second factor is
what we call swing.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:58.410
So in the wake of positive
or negative feedback,

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.780
how far do you swing
negative or positive?

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.740
Your team gets the
same piece of feedback.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.130
I'm devastated.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.570
You're like, eh, no big deal.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.300
We'll fix it.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:09.800
Right?

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.341
Which prompts you, by the way,
to give me additional feedback

00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:13.900
that I'm overreacting, right?

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.950
I mean, I need to get a thicker
skin or not take it personally.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.750
So I'm swinging wide.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:22.070
And then the third factor
is, how long does it

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.390
take to either recover
from negative feedback?

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.140
Or how long do you
sustain positive feedback?

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.630
So let's imagine you get
an email from someone

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:34.196
with positive feedback like,
wow, that was fantastic.

00:39:34.196 --> 00:39:36.570
How many people would say you
have a pretty long sustain?

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.361
Like emotionally, that
would stick with you

00:39:38.361 --> 00:39:41.704
for at least the rest of the
day if not the rest of the week?

00:39:41.704 --> 00:39:43.370
How many people, it
would stick with you

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.880
like until you open
the next email?

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.510
OK.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.280
So this is really different.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.900
And, by the way, sustain
and recovery, as well as

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.830
your degree is swing,
positive and negative,

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:56.900
operate independently.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.920
So you can have long
sustain, but quick recovery,

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.410
for instance.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:06.220
Or you can have short sustain
and very long recovery.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.690
If you have short sustain
and pretty long recovery,

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.650
feedback is really threatening
because the positive stuff just

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:16.320
doesn't stick no matter how
genuine or important it is

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.930
and the negative stuff
really takes you a long time

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:21.100
to recover from.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.330
And vice versa, if
you have the opposite

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:26.390
actually feedback's pretty
great because the positive stuff

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.470
sticks and you don't
necessarily remember

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:29.900
a whole lot of the
negative stuff.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.640
By the way, Doug
mentioned, obviously

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.320
being very sensitive to
feedback is challenging,

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.290
but being insensitive
or even-keel

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:39.080
in the face of feedback
has its own challenges

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.402
because sometimes it just
won't stick with you.

00:40:41.402 --> 00:40:43.610
And so then you go back and
you have another meeting,

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.520
and the person you're
working with says, remember?

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.100
We talked about
this six months ago?

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.110
And you're like, oh, yeah,
we kind of did, didn't we?

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:55.240
Because the degree of emotion
you have in the experience

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.340
affects how you remember it and
how easily you can retrieve it.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.170
It puts like a big red tag on it
so you can retrieve it easily.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.670
And in retrieving it, if there's
emotion associated with it,

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.580
you can re-trigger that emotion.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.480
So you feel terrible or
anxious or whatever again

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.110
when you remember it.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.330
So if you don't
have a lot of swing,

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:15.720
it may not stick with you.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:21.610
OK, one more thing about why it
matters how sensitive you are.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:25.400
If you are in the depths
of a big negative swing,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.110
really upset by
feedback, it changes

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.232
your sense of the
feedback itself.

00:41:30.232 --> 00:41:32.190
So it changes both your
sense of the feedback--

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:36.760
it gets super-sized-- and
your sense of who you are.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.350
And one of the
things that happens

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:42.210
is what we have dubbed
the Google bias.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.150
Because it is as you get one
little piece of feedback.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.885
It's discrete.

00:41:45.885 --> 00:41:48.150
DOUGLAS STONE: Do people
know what Google is?

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:50.087
The search engine?

00:41:50.087 --> 00:41:52.420
SHEILA HEEN: And it's as if
mentally and emotionally you

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:57.310
actually Google everything
that is wrong with me.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:57.870
OK?

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.510
And you get 1.2 million hits.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:04.270
There are sponsored ads from
your father and your ex, OK?

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.730
And suddenly you can
do nothing right.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:14.030
Your sense of yourself as well
how important this is changes.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.330
And we call it a bias because,
of course, as you guys know,

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:21.040
what you get hinges
on your search term.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.790
So you are not searching things
I'm handling pretty well.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:28.090
If you did, you'd
get 5.2 million hits.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:32.190
And you would have a more
balanced sense of yourself.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.560
So one of the
chapters of the book

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.560
is how you dismantle these
distortions so that you

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.400
can actually see the
feedback at actual size

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.780
and use it to learn something
and not have it overwhelm you.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.400
Because when you're
overwhelmed, it

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.320
affects your sense of the past,
your sense of the present,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.080
and your sense of the future,
and can disable your ability

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.620
to learn from it, to
learn anything from it.

00:42:56.161 --> 00:42:57.410
I want to turn it over to you.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.540
Do you want to say a
couple words about that?

00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.150
And then we're going
to take questions.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.200
DOUGLAS STONE: Yeah.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.610
So just a final thought from me.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:06.680
So Sheila tends to be more
even-keeled on this spectrum.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.160
And I tend to be more sensitive.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.950
And in many ways that made for
a good team writing the book.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.090
We had sort of a representative
of different types working

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.450
on the book.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:20.620
But for me, it was a little bit
of a personal journey as well.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:25.550
Where before I wrote
the book, I experienced

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.960
feedback as very challenging,
obviously especially negative

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.480
feedback.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.570
And I would get upset or
disappointed and anxious.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:39.220
Now, having written the book and
thought about this stuff a lot,

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:43.680
when I get negative feedback,
I get disappointed, upset,

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.900
and anxious still.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.440
So what does this mean?

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.630
So one thing it means
is there's nothing

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.190
that turns bad news into good
news or negative feedback

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.680
into positive feedback.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.090
But there's a big
"however" to this.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.930
It would be nice if I
could report that now I'm

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:04.610
just this learning
machine, and I go and seek

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.400
feedback and nothing
ever throws me off.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.250
But I still do get
triggered by things.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.490
And I still do get
upset by things.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:15.160
But the good news is
also really important,

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.630
which is that I get
significantly less upset.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:20.950
And I get back on my feet.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.540
I find my balance
much more quickly.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.250
I feel like I have
specific tools that

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.330
enable me to do that.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:30.950
So the result of
that, the result

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:34.810
of now being somewhat
more resilient

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.715
in the face of
feedback, is that I'm

00:44:36.715 --> 00:44:39.710
able to seek it out more often.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.560
And both at work-- so at work,
when you seek out feedback,

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.550
you do improve and get
better-- and then also

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.770
in personal relationships.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:51.847
When you're somebody who sort
of puts up a wall to feedback,

00:44:51.847 --> 00:44:54.180
it limits sort of your own
learning in the relationship.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.726
But it has a particularly
high price tag

00:44:56.726 --> 00:44:58.350
for the person you're
in a relationship

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.710
with because they're
inevitably going

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:03.840
to have some challenges with you
that they need to talk about.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.480
And if you can't talk about
them, it makes it really tough.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.740
And you end up being isolated
within the relationship.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.580
So as I've gotten
better at feedback,

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.920
it also has the
amazingly useful benefit

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.830
of making you better, not
just at work, but also

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.090
in relationships.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:25.985
So let's pause here, and
let's take questions.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:31.140
Ah, yeah, so do we have a mic?

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.069
Do we need a mic?

00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.860
AUDIENCE: Right on.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.195
DOUGLAS STONE: Wow.

00:45:33.195 --> 00:45:34.028
SHEILA HEEN: Placed.

00:45:34.028 --> 00:45:36.021
DOUGLAS STONE: That was crazy.

00:45:36.021 --> 00:45:37.770
AUDIENCE: So thank you
so much for coming.

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.540
I really liked your talk
about different dimensions,

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.366
like the baseline, swings,
sustain, and recovery.

00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:45.490
It's really good to know
that people are different.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.370
And I'm different
from anyone else.

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:47.640
SHEILA HEEN: Yeah.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:47.930
DOUGLAS STONE: Yeah.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.429
AUDIENCE: But I will be very
curious to know whether there's

00:45:50.429 --> 00:45:52.200
like a questionnaire
or like a quiz

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.390
that I can know what like
quandrantile I fall into.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.510
Because it's good to know
this, but I don't know,

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:02.230
like, what is my own standard
compared to other people.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.230
SHEILA HEEN: Yeah,
so this research

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.860
is actually pulling from
several different researchers.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.380
So there isn't one
researcher that

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.860
has a questionnaire that
covers all the aspects of this.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.030
Richard Davidson has a
book called "The Emotional

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.510
Life of Your Brain"
that's really interesting

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.930
and is worth reading.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:21.932
And he looks at the fact
that positive feeling

00:46:21.932 --> 00:46:24.140
and negative feeling is
processed on different sides.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.830
And he has a couple
of questionnaires

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:30.130
that are more about life
than about work and feedback

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.960
specifically, how you respond
to events in life that

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.760
may be helpful.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.650
But he also says
check your answers

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.310
against people who know you, OK?

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:42.540
Because you may
think actually I'm

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.190
not still upset about that
guy who cut me off on the road

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:48.690
or what happened at the
meeting this morning.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.760
Other people around
you can tell it's still

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.060
affecting the way that you
are interacting with everybody

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:59.462
else, but you're not
necessarily self-aware of that.

00:46:59.462 --> 00:47:00.920
It's one of the
reasons why we need

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.620
other people to see ourselves.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.775
When you ask other
people for feedback--

00:47:05.775 --> 00:47:08.150
and I know that you guys have
been talking about not just

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:10.120
waiting for performance
management official

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.880
conversations, but actually
taking up responsibility

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.710
to drive and accelerate
your own learning-- one

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:20.550
way to do that is not to
go to people and say, hey,

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:22.620
do you have any feedback for me?

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.524
That's a terrible question.

00:47:24.524 --> 00:47:26.940
I mean, nobody knows how to
answer that question, I think.

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.490
And it's not clear how
honest you want them to be.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:33.430
Instead, what we suggest
is ask for one thing.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.720
So say, hey, what's one
thing I'm doing or maybe

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.022
failing to do that's
getting in my own way

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:39.730
or that's getting in
the way on the team?

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:41.460
Or ask, what's one
thing I could change

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.100
that would make the
biggest difference?

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:46.390
You'll get something that's
very specific and more concrete.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.840
And it's clear that you want
them to be honest with you.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.300
And that question can
help you in a bunch

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.540
of different
relationships and give you

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.097
one thing to work on a time.

00:47:56.097 --> 00:47:57.680
AUDIENCE: So I'm
still kind of hung up

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:03.220
on when I receive feedback
about what I tend to think

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.272
is a personality
trait of myself.

00:48:05.272 --> 00:48:05.980
SHEILA HEEN: Yes.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.646
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:48:06.646 --> 00:48:09.950
Like oh, maybe you
should think before you

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:14.407
speak, like that type of stuff.

00:48:14.407 --> 00:48:16.240
DOUGLAS STONE: [INAUDIBLE]
personality trait

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.676
of not thinking?

00:48:17.676 --> 00:48:18.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no, no, no.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.091
But like, you know what I mean?

00:48:20.091 --> 00:48:22.220
Like, oh, you need to be
a better listener and all

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.280
these things that I
think I can work on.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.770
But my personality
just kind of puts me

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.470
kind of on one
side of this scale.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:33.990
How do you take
feedback that you

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:37.040
think is just
personal to yourself?

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.554
Like I don't know how much
people can actually change.

00:48:39.554 --> 00:48:41.220
DOUGLAS STONE: Well,
so there's a limit.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.470
I mean, to take a really
obviously example, if someone

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:47.300
says you got to work
on how tall you.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.050
You're too tall.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.020
Or you're too short.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:49.422
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:49.422 --> 00:48:49.730
I'm sitting down.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:50.606
That's pretty impressive.

00:48:50.606 --> 00:48:51.814
DOUGLAS STONE: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:51.814 --> 00:48:53.740
So there are things we
literally can't change.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.073
Then there are things that
are easy, comparatively easy,

00:48:56.073 --> 00:48:59.020
to change like when you get to
work, or where you work from,

00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.707
or whatever.

00:48:59.707 --> 00:49:01.540
And then there are
things in the middle that

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.140
are kind of a mix of personality
tendencies and behaviors

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.440
and actions.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.450
One thing is just to
ask very specifically,

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.296
so how would I do that?

00:49:15.296 --> 00:49:16.670
Or, what does that
look and sound

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:19.150
like when you say I need
to be more this way?

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:20.430
What does that sound like?

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:25.020
But something you might try is
what we call small experiments.

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.910
So sometimes if
someone says, gee, you

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:31.260
need to be more outgoing
at work and friendlier.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.720
And you're thinking, oh, my god.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.910
I have to change my
whole personality.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:37.510
I'm going to be working at
Google for the next 40 years.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.740
And I've lived my
whole life this way.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.710
And now I have to be a
totally different way.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.220
It can feel overwhelming, right?

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.060
But if you just think about it.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:51.000
OK, tomorrow, what's one
thing I could try tomorrow?

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.770
And if I don't like
the way it feels,

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:55.500
then I don't have
to keep doing it.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.060
But if I like it, then
maybe I will keep doing it.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:02.500
So think of it as very specific,
segmented, just try it.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.180
If you get some
positive feedback,

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.140
you can keep doing it.

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.680
If you don't and it
doesn't feel comfortable,

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.980
you can find another way in.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.140
SHEILA HEEN: Yeah, modify it.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.450
One of the things, toward
the back of the book,

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.460
we have five ideas
to get started.

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.590
And there's also a whole
chapter on boundaries,

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.229
how to turn away feedback.

00:50:20.229 --> 00:50:22.020
Because being a good
feedback receiver also

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.353
means knowing how and when
you need to protect yourself.

00:50:24.353 --> 00:50:27.360
If it's a relentless criticism
that's undermining your sense

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.211
of self, how do you put
up some boundaries to say,

00:50:30.211 --> 00:50:32.460
you know what, I'm-- I don't
know if I could take that

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.840
feedback, but it's certainly not
something that I put that much

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.440
energy in right now.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.920
And then how do you talk
to the person about that

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.630
if they're an important
person in your life?

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:45.160
And then how do you also
mitigate the effect?

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.990
Because just saying, well, too
bad I'm not going to change

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:51.480
is OK in some cases,
but not in others.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.020
So then how do we
work around the fact

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.850
that I leave my purse and
wallet and credit cards

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:58.345
behind most of the time?

00:50:58.345 --> 00:50:59.970
It's a personality
trait I've worked on

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.270
for many, many,
many decades now.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:05.030
It's so far, no progress, right?

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.784
But I am doing small
experiments, right?

00:51:06.784 --> 00:51:07.950
Trying to be more organized.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.034
Stopping to check before
I walk out of a building.

00:51:10.034 --> 00:51:12.324
DOUGLAS STONE: Stapling your
credit card to your pants.

00:51:12.324 --> 00:51:14.890
SHEILA HEEN: Stapling my credit
card, yeah, to my sleeve.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:15.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.380
I guess it's a question about
that same sense of time.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.090
You said for Sam and Pete,
it worked for a while.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.837
So how do you have that
upkeep without saying

00:51:24.837 --> 00:51:26.420
that you don't have
faith that they're

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.500
keeping it up themselves?

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.492
SHEILA HEEN: I know.

00:51:28.492 --> 00:51:32.516
DOUGLAS STONE: Feedback,
in general, by the way,

00:51:32.516 --> 00:51:34.140
sometimes we think
of it as like, well,

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.348
that's the thing that happens
at the end of the year.

00:51:36.348 --> 00:51:37.880
And I get my evaluation.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.910
And that's my
feedback conversation.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:45.140
So if I have feedback for
someone, it might be March,

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.410
but I'll give it to them
in November or December

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:50.820
during feedback learning time.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.500
And there's a way in
which that makes sense.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.800
Our evaluations come at
a certain time of year.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.040
And that's useful.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.370
But other kinds of feedback,
the kind of feedback

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.960
that we would call coaching,
should happen in real time.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.550
If you're at a
stoplight and the person

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:14.220
in front of you is not going and
the light has now turned green,

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.920
you wouldn't say to yourself,
well, I'll wait till December

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.570
and I'll honk during
honking season.

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:22.127
You would honk now because
this is when it's happening.

00:52:22.127 --> 00:52:23.710
So when you have
feedback for someone,

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:27.680
or you'd like to learn
something or receive feedback,

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.670
if it's coaching,
just do it now.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:34.360
In contexts like this, it's
always an ongoing thing.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.920
It's not a, we had
the conversation once,

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.250
or we had to have a
reinforcement conversation.

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:40.960
It's going to be
an ever-shifting--

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.802
SHEILA HEEN: Yeah, and
it worked for a while

00:52:42.802 --> 00:52:44.510
where they were very
consistent about it.

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.770
And then they would fall
off the wagon, et cetera.

00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:50.630
So the improvement is more
like this than like this.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.450
And they needed to
expect that, expect

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:55.700
that we were going to have
to keep coaching each other

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:57.800
and keep working
pretty hard at it.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.800
We'll close, by the way, because
I'm getting the time signal.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.130
The hook is coming out.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.945
We'll close just with one last
piece of research information

00:53:05.945 --> 00:53:08.320
that may be useful to you,
which is that what the studies

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.854
show is that people who seek
out negative feedback at work--

00:53:11.854 --> 00:53:14.270
and in the literature, what
they mean by negative feedback

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.811
is that you're not just going
around fishing for compliments,

00:53:16.811 --> 00:53:20.330
you're actually asking what
could I improve-- those people

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.470
adapt more quickly to new roles.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:24.650
They report higher satisfaction.

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:27.060
And they get higher
performance reviews.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.920
And so it's not
just that you elicit

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.250
learning that accelerates
your own learning curve.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:36.830
It's also that asking for
coaching changes the way

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:39.040
other people see you.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.420
And so it can be a powerful
tool to have in your toolbox.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.920
And then you don't have to wait
around for the perfect giver

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.295
because mostly our lives are
populated by everybody else.

00:53:46.295 --> 00:53:49.180
So we got to learn
how to learn something

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:52.902
from all kinds of givers who
sometimes are off base, unfair.

00:53:52.902 --> 00:53:53.860
They deliver it poorly.

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.520
And yet we're going to find
something valuable in it.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:01.220
We're happy to stick around to
answer questions, et cetera.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.670
You guys have an amazing deal
over here to buy the book.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.794
We're asking, like, can we
buy some of those books?

00:54:05.794 --> 00:54:07.740
Like, that's a better
price than we get.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.430
Thank you so much for coming.

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:10.030
And good luck.

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:15.924
[APPLAUSE]
