&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: My name is Curtis Thompson. I
work with Best Buy. And the application that

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.750
we built is Giftag, which is a social wish
list gift registry application, something

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.860
that works anywhere.
&gt;&gt; And can you tell us about the decision

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.230
you made
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Sure, sure. We had developed

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.570
kind of a prototype of the application in
Drupal and we were hitting some point where

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.870
we were going to possibly be deployed out
on bestbuy.com or have some integration there,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.060
and we worried about the performance of it.
Plus, we were not really able to make the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:55.150
quick changes that we wanted to with Drupal,
so we kind of looked around and--it developed

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.360
in Python for quite a while and really liked
Python--and then Google App Engine came out,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.110
and it just seemed like a perfect fit for
what we wanted to do. So, we took a look at

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.389
it and decided that, yeah, let's do it, let's
write our application--rewrite our application

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:23.700
on App Engine.
&gt;&gt; And during your development of the application,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.380
what were some of the obstacles that you encountered?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So, you kind of have to think

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.880
differently about how you're building an application
with App Engine, especially BigTable. There

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.170
are some different ways to took at it. One
of our big problems is looking at App Engine

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.479
and BigTable as a relational database. I mean,
it's hard to take off those blinders and look

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.329
at BigTable in a different manner. That was
kind of an obstacle to us. We made some poor

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.689
design decisions up front based on that. It
didn't hurt in the long run. We were able

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.409
to go back and fix it, but things like the
list properties were really helpful for doing

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.599
things like tagging, and we didn't really
quite get that up front. Also, you have to

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.819
think a little more creatively I think with
App Engine because there are limitations with

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.599
it, so you have to think about "how am I going
to work around these limitations?" The fun

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.650
thing is as you work around these limitations,
the programming, which we like to do. It's

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.680
not trying to configure Apache or, you know,
trying to scale MySQL or whatever. It's kind

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.900
of the problems we want to solve anyway.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.650
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Right. I mean, that's the huge
thing. Deployment is so easy. It's the way

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.870
that deployment should be done. From a developer's
standpoint, it's awesome. And I can go back

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.200
and say for us rewriting this Drupal application
in App Engine, it took a few of us about 10

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.250
weeks to rewrite our application on App Engine
and migrate all of our data from a MySQL database

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.920
onto BigTable. So, it was quick. It was really
quick for us to do it. And a lot of it, too,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.780
was being able to do quick deployments. And
we didn't need to have anybody that had to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.290
fiddle with the infrastructure. That's huge.
That's stuff that I don't like doing and none

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.500
of us really likes to do. So, it was a big
win for us.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:42.989
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, I think probably just to

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.719
understand BigTable and to understand how
the indexing works, know how to model your

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:55.859
data was a big thing. The other thing I tell
people not really related to deployment, but

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.409
I like to think of, like, App Engine as your
web front-end. And it shouldn't be the hammer

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:09.409
in your solution. It should be one piece in
your toolbox. And as Google rolls out additional

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:16.780
services, you know, that hammer or that piece
of App Engine becomes more powerful and it

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.610
can do more things, but it shouldn't--it shouldn't
be the only piece in your puzzle. For some

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.860
applications like us, we didn't really need
to rely on anything external for it, but for

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.590
some applications, you may need to.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.640
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: No, I don't really think that
we are. Right now, I think where Python's

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:50.730
sweet spot is the ability to do a lot of like
web development stuff really quickly. It seems

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:58.980
like, at least from what I've seen, the Python
version of App Engine leads the Java. Obviously,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:07.290
it was released earlier. But, also, it seems
a lot simpler. And, for me, there's like less

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.530
plumbing that you need to do. And I think
for a lot of people, if they're willing to

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:18.900
take a dare-to to learn the Python APIs, learn
the language, they'd end up liking that better.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:27.130
We had on our team a guy that did Java development
and loved Java. He came on and learned Python.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.930
And after he got done with us, he is, like,
"I am never going back to Java to do any sort

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.680
of web development." It was a pretty powerful
statement because he was a huge Java advocate.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.350
But, for us, we're not saying, at least I'm
not saying that I'm not going to do any of

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.360
the Java stuff, but I don't see a big need
to. I think that the Python version of App

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:58.460
Engine is really well-suited for what modern
web applications are really good at.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:07.110
&gt;&gt; And, finally, are there any interesting
stories that you'd like to share?

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.660
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Any good or bad stories? Well,
I think for us it's just been a huge, huge

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.370
win for us. It's been really exciting. And
one of the things that I think is that App

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.610
Engine, once you start understanding what
it is, you'd understand that small is big

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.690
and that writing little applications that
do one little thing really well and can scale

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.640
up is kind of the future of the web, at least
in my opinion of it. It really opened up a

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.080
lot of possibilities to think about. Maybe
my application isn't one big application,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.300
maybe it's a whole bunch of small, little
applications and we can tie it together, we

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:55.150
can glue it together with App Engine being
the primary piece. Our think our testament

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.830
is that we are able to take an existing application,
rewrite it really quickly in 10 weeks and

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.330
have it scale up, and have it be really fun
to do in the whole process was really exciting

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:14.020
for us. It kind of meant that we stop looking
at a lot of other frameworks and deployment

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:20.480
options. We didn't--we didn't say that we're
not going to do it. It's just change our perspective

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.440
on things. So, I guess, that's our story on
it. It's been really helpful for us to be

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.810
able to roll out applications quickly. It
becomes a piece in almost everything now that

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.350
we're kind of looking at doing for our group.
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for your time.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.500
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; It's really great.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.360
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Thank you.
