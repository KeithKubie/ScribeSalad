00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.520
Nowadays we're pretty tough on people who have a certain kind of fear.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.060
People who are afraid of getting close.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.620
People who need to sit alone for quite a long time everyday.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.960
People who don't always find it easy to say what's on their minds.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.720
People who need theirs space.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.020
We say these sort of people have got a fear of intimacy.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.000
And thats' not a good thing to have.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.480
It can get you in trouble.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.000
But criticizing the fear of intimacy doesn't feel right or very productive at all.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.400
We'd be far better off with a different approach.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.120
For a start, if someone is scared of something

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.520
it's never a great idea just to say they're silly and that there's nothing to be worried about.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.460
It's a lot more effective to say: we're a bit scared too

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.260
and that it's actually normal to worry.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.580
Then it is a good idea to understand the fear.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.680
Where has it come from?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.040
There's almost always a history to someone who is afraid of intimacy.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.300
A history where getting close to other people got them hurt

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.400
so that close place has become a problem.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.580
We should also take on board just how much of life is about not being intimate.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.520
From an early age we're taught we need to be strong, indipendent and grave.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.280
We need to hide our emotions, not say how we're feeling.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.440
Bottle up what's going on inside.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.060
It is no wonder we sometimes find it hard to change gear, and become masters at the art of intimacy.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.940
It's not surprising if we should get a bit stuck and not quite know what to do with the request to say exactly how we feel.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.300
We've been out in the world too long.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.880
We're battle hardened and just not used to it.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.240
We might need a little time.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.520
Let's go easy on those with a fear of intimacy.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.820
They're not bad people.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.540
They just find a difficult thing tricky.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.680
And we should be on hand to help them with gentleness and understanding.
