00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.100
Let's do one more fairly
involved example of adding, or

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.970
in this case actually
subtracting rational

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.020
expressions.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.070
Let's say I have 4 over
9x squared minus 49.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.730
And from that I want to
subtract-- maybe I'll do this

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:28.170
in different color-- I want to
subtract 1 over 3x squared

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.190
plus 5x, minus 28.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.630
So just like we saw in the last
video, we want to find

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.550
the least common multiple of
these two expressions.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.660
And the way to figure out that
is to factor these two things.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.470
Now this first expression,
you might recognize, is a

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.190
difference of squares.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.710
This is 3x squared
minus 7 squared.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.100
So we can rewrite it as 4 over
3x-- well, let me write it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.660
this way-- 3x plus 7,
times 3x minus 7.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.300
3x squared is 9x squared.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.580
7 squared is 49.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.690
Difference of squares.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.330
And from that we're going to
subtract this thing over here.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.830
Let's see how we can
factor that out.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.700
Well, once again, this has a
non-1 coefficient here, so you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.390
can always use the Pythagorean
theorem, but that actually

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.050
gets messy if you actually just
want to factor as opposed

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.930
to getting roots.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.810
So the best thing here
is to do grouping.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.560
So let me factor it over here.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.460
I need to find two numbers.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.480
Let me just write
it over here.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.560
So we have 3x-- let
me write it.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.890
I want to write it someplace
where I can-- well, actually

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.420
I'll write it here.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.690
So I have 3x squared
plus 5x, minus 28.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.390
I need to find two numbers that
when I multiply them I

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.550
get 3 times negative 28.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.140
So it's negative 60 and negative
24, that's negative

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.910
84, if I multiply those
two numbers.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.930
And a plus b should
be equal to 5.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.420
So what numbers?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.680
Well, it's 7 and 12.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.419
Your times table.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.910
7 times 12 is 84.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.970
So if you make this a 12 and
you make this a negative 7,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.460
then it works.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.360
12 minus 7 is 5, 12 times
negative 7 is 84.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.650
So I can rewrite this
as 3x squared.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.200
I'll group the 12 with the 3,
because they have a common

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.520
factor of 3.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.090
So plus 12x minus
7x, minus 28.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.300
Once again, 7 and 28 have
a common factor, so

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.540
it's looking good.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.220
And just to reiterate, all I
did is I rewrote this 5x as

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.730
12x minus 7x.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.610
These are, obviously,
the same thing.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.390
12x minus 7x is 5x.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.090
But then we can group
them just like that.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.470
If we factor out a 3x here, this
first expression is the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.210
same thing as 3x
times x plus 4.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.020
And in the second expression
over here-- I'll do it in red,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.270
or in white I guess-- let's
factor out a negative 7.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.250
So minus 7 times x plus 4.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.930
And lucky for us, we have a
common factor is x plus 4, so

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.270
we can factor that out.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:31.200
So if you factor out the x plus
4, you get x plus 4 times

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.875
3x minus 7.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.490
So that's what this guy over
here will factor into.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.420
So I can rewrite
it right here.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.730
So this expression is the exact
same thing as 1 over--

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.490
well, I can write the 3x minus
7 first-- 3x minus 7

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.520
times x plus 4.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.400
This and this is the exact
same statement.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.840
So let's figure out what our
common denominator is here.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.710
So our common denominator-- I'll
write it like that-- it

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.170
needs to have all of the factors
of this guy right

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.790
here, so it needs to
have a 3x plus 7.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.680
It needs to have a 3x minus 7.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.060
And also it has to have all of
the factors of this guy.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.160
Well, it already has
a 3x minus 7, so

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.020
this is already done.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.270
But it doesn't have an
x plus 4 in it yet.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.940
So now I have to multiply
it by x plus 4.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.070
So clearly, if you look at
this, this is clearly

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.650
divisible by this guy, because
it has all of its factors.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.040
You could divide this out.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.510
And it's clearly divisible
by this guy.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.330
You have 3x minus 7
times x plus 4.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.340
3x minus 7 times x plus 4.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.820
So this is the least common
multiple of these two

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.970
expressions.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.020
Now, how do we get-- so what
do we have to multiply this

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.420
guy by to have this as
the denominator?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.280
Well, I just have to multiply
the numerator and the

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.460
denominator by x plus 4.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.540
So if I multiply this guy-- let
me scroll to the left a

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:11.250
little bit-- by x plus
4 over x plus 4, my

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.860
denominator will work out.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.390
And so my numerator will become
4 times x plus 4, which

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.670
is 4x plus 16.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.740
That's this first
term over here.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.290
And then what do I have to
multiply this guy by to have

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.870
the same denominator as this?

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.100
Well, I have a 3x minus
7 times x plus 4.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.290
3x minus 7 times x plus 4.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.420
I have to multiply
it by 3x plus 7.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.030
So I also have to multiply the
numerator by 3x plus 7.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:49.650
So this is 4x plus 16 minus 1
times 3x plus 7, or minus 3x

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.010
plus 7 is the same thing
as minus 3x minus 7.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.080
I'm just distributing
the negative sign.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.170
And then what is this going
to be equal to?

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:04.860
The numerator, we have a 4x
minus a 3x will just be an x.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.540
And then we have a 16 minus
a 7, which is a 9.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.630
And then the denominator, we,
of course, have all of this

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:19.490
stuff over here, which is 3x
plus 7, times 3x minus 7,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.600
times x plus 4.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.150
And we're done.
