Hey YouTube We Still Need your Help to win a Streamy award We Need you to go to twitter and tweet the hashtag

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:05.259
#TKORForStreamys

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.919
We Need your vote it's Very important Because your vote might be the one that tips us over and Helps us win huh?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.799
That is not the scenario i would have predicted to see?

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.879
Hey What's up Guys welcome back for another

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:16.690
epic day of

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.049
Experimenting i Brought You outside Today Where i've Got a 6 Gallon Gasoline Fuel can as Well as an Electric Hot Plate Kind of Seems

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:23.960
A little Bit Random but it'll make sense in Just a minute

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.320
Now the request for our experiment Today

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.900
came Out of The comments from mix monwa3at who got

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.460
235 Thumbs Ups for Asking The question What happens when you boil Gasoline

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.880
Now Let's start off This Project Today by taking Just a Second to talk about What

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.219
Gasoline Actually is Now you may Remember the story that back When i was 21 Years old i used to work on the oil rigs?

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.049
Drilling Holes into the Ground and extracting crude oil where it could Be shipped off and Refined into products Like Gasoline

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.180
Now iF you've ever pulled Up to the gas station You probably noticed different octane Ratings for the Fuel you got regular and you've Got

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.709
Premium and What Those Numbers are telling you is how much compression that Liquid can take before self-igniting

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.379
Now if you ever want to try storing Gasoline it's important that You use containers that Comply with the regulations of the EPA

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.219
Gasoline Is a Very volatile Liquid and Depending on The temperature and pressure

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.979
It may cause the container you have It stored into to erode or

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.379
Explode Even this six Gallon container that is compliant with the EPA you can See how much pressure is built Up inside

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.189
This Thing Is Bulging and Ready to burst There's a Lot of pressure sitting in there right Now

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.650
So the purpose of Today's Experiment is to see what will Happen if we Put Gasoline in an open container on a hot plate and

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.769
Let It Boil. Will The Gasoline Actually boil at All or Will it Just vaporize into the air? and if It Does Start Boiling Will Those

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.619
Bubbles Foam Up and Froth Over and spill Over in the hot plate itself and is IT possible for Gasoline to actually get hot enough

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.279
To self ignite we're answering Those three questions in this video today

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.559
All right so quick update These Nozzles are much more Trouble Than They're worth we're Just gonna scrap them and pour Directly from the container

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.250
That Should Be more Than enough

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.779
So here we are Guys Have Just Transferred the Gasoline from a Jerrycan into this Pyrex Glass

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.260
This can Hold about Two Cups Right Now i've Got Leveled about a cup and a Half

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.930
Now it's important to note That Right Now we're being Very Careful not to have any open flames Because obviously The vapor That's coming off

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.720
This Right Now is

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.199
Extremely Flammable and we Don't want This Thing to ignite prematurely Now we're using Pyrex for This first experiment as a Back-up Plan I'm gonna

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.820
Stick a Pot Down underneath It so that Way iF the Glass cracks we'll Be Able to contain the gasoline in the pot Without it

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.889
Spilling Over onto the Burner all right about to Turn it on the starting temperature right Now is surprisingly only about

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.839
13.7 Celsius When i look at The Actual hot plate itself some of The Edges we're showing 40 degrees Celsius There's a Dramatic difference i

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.300
Think That's from Keeping This in cold storage Yep That's definitely cold So Let's Turn the heat on let 'em rip and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Let'S see what happens

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.669
It has Been about 10 minutes i Just came back to check and you can Always see some white fumes are coming off i see

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.640
Little Bubbles coming From The bottom of the gasoline i don't see it boiling yet but When i measure the temperature it's showing about

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.100
58 Degrees

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.649
Celsius that has Warmed Up quite a Bit from where it Was 10 minutes Ago so we let this Thing Run another five to 10

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.500
Minutes and we'll Check in on them Dang That's increasing fast

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.780
so at 60 degrees Celsius i

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.760
Think of This Stuff Explodes in Our face accidentally we'll Just remember to stop drop and roll Should solve all our problems Right

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.280
Look At That if you look down here you can Actually see it's bubbling from the bottom

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.890
we did not even make it to 5 minutes Guys i Just Checked in on this and it's Actually bubbling if you look at the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.720
Surface You can See bubbles coming Up to the top and collecting Measuring the temperature

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.160
I'm showing we're at about 82 degrees Celsius so this is actually Boiling

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.340
Under the Boiling Point of Water so Gasoline Will boil and it will boil before Water Does That's interesting so now the question is how hot

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.769
Can We Actually Get This if We Leave This on the burner Plate how hot will that Liquid get before It either Burst into flames

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.430
or Boils off completely

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.450
Gasoline Is showing Over a Hundred and Forty five degrees Celsius

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.439
It's like Two Hundred and Eighty degrees Fahrenheit Now it's really Really hot look at all The vapor That's coming off it'S a Tremendous amount

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.120
At This point i'm Thinking That Whole Thing is gonna boil completely Dry Without Igniting at All

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.289
Which is Kind of surprising i Mean i thought maybe It would Get hot enough to light into flames but

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.480
Without an open source of Flames

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.559
Apparently i'd have to get quite a Bit hotter it almost Looks like The Gasoline itself is getting

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.200
Concentrated as well It's not quite as Clear as It used to be it's a lot more of a Darker Yellowish orange

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.630
So something in there is obviously getting concentrated Out That's amazing That's almost completely gone

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.279
It's very Very Hot Very hot to the touch Whew

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.209
Very hot to the touch I'm Just gonna Let this boil down

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.190
completely Because i want to see as it gets Toward The bottom is It going to accelerate and Actually Burst into flames at All

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.049
All right we're on the home stretch you can see all the vapor coming Out Now this is happening Very quickly i should Probably Get

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.990
a reading about a Hundred and Eighty degrees Celsius

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.759
370 degrees Fahrenheit That's Pretty Dang Hot Obviously That's about as hot as It can Get on its own so what if we Let This

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.759
 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.569
Will it just Boil or Will Burst into flames That is our next experiment

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.700
okay so look at That There's some Kind of interesting residue at The bottom there some Kind of a

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:18.059
Brownish motor Oily Looking Stuff See that This is Actually so hot Right Now i'm having trouble Hanging on to it

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.189
Co2 fire extinguisher i value my Skin so we're bringing out the big guns for Safety

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.159
That Should Be Good enough

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.649
for This One we're gonna Get Crazy and Try something Little Bit different i'm gonna pull the pot Out of the scenario and put the

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.429
pirates Directly Onto The Burner Itself Actually Give It a Little Bit more Heat

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.299
We're Just gonna give that a Few more Minutes to heat Up to maximum then we're gonna take a small

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.019
Cup of Gasoline and Pour it Directly in the Center Good idea Bad idea we're about. To find out oh my gosh?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.930
Now They took That pot off the

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.780
temperature's Going Up dramatically

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:59.699
640 Fahrenheit and the Glass we're already Up to 430 That's cool i

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.650
Wonder if This will Work after All

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.289
Putting the Glass Directly on the Burner is making a Dramatic difference to how much Heat is Actually going into the glass

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.149
I think the Pot Was acting as a Heat Sink and deflecting some of That off so we're gonna bring This Thing up till it's

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.400
about 250 degrees Celsius Which is

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.779
Extremely Hot i think we're gonna Throw The Gasoline in before i pour this Thing i'm gonna do one Final Check

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.740
so i'm showing Pretty close to 300 degrees Celsius Which is over

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.859
550 degrees Fahrenheit This is absolutely Ridiculous

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.489
This Setup Right Now is actually hotter Than The inside of your Oven

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.199
Can Actually Get so if this Does not ignite without a flame i'm gonna Actually Feel a lot Safer about Handling Gasoline

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.949
Moment of Truth Here we Go now i'm Just gonna Kind of stand off

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:44.549
To the side here in case something Goes Terribly wrong I'M gonna Dump It all in one Go in three two one. Oh?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and It Broke the Glass

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:56.259
That Was not Actually The Reaction i was Expecting i was Thinking maybe It Would Go up in flames maybe i Just sitting there boil

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.199
but It Actually

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:04.148
Cracked The Pyrex Spilled Out Over the Burner all Over the cement no sign of Flames Whatsoever Just a Lot of Broken Glass

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:08.169
Huh okay so here comes the liquid you can see It coming down from the top

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.699
Half of It Goes in container the other Half Kind of Splashes Out on the burner and all over the pavement

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.009
You can Actually See the Gasoline inside the container like erupting Shooting back Up out of the top and

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:20.528
There Goes the side of the Glass cracking

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:28.119
Obviously some Kind of an issue with Thermal shock the two extremes meeting cold Gasoline in a Very hot Glass container so if that didn't

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.219
Light Off i don't know What Would obviously at some point it is gonna be a surface hot enough to ignite the Gasoline but That's

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:39.039
Gonna Be extreme temperatures Beyond anything That we can Generate using in the Oven or an Electric Burner and That's Good news i do Feel

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.158
Like We Have to have some Kind of fire though so i'm going to take This Residual over here and light it off

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:51.269
Most of its evaporated i Guess There's a Little Bit of a flame There but it's hard to see in the Daylight

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.869
We'd Start off This Experiment Today to see Exactly What Would Happen if we Put Gasoline on a hot Burner and raise The temperature quickly

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.260
The first Thing We've Observed is the Gasoline warmed up and Began to boil

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.419
But The bubbles did Not Turn into a frothy foam and spill Over the edge Instead They Just Popped in vaporize into the air

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:22.509
After about 15 to 20 minutes we noticed most of The Gasoline had Vaporized off but The temperature never Actually rose high enough for those

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.140
Vapors To self ignite the reason is because all the Energy going to the Gasoline to vaporize

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.820
It Kept The Liquid at a Very constant temperature somewhere around 160 degrees Celsius

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.859
When all that gas Vaporized out of the container we decided to Try a Second experiment to see if we could Heat the container up

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.740
Even Hotter And pour the Gasoline into that The question being What a container that Was twice as hot as the boiling point of Gasoline

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.210
Get It to auto Ignite but in pouring the Gasoline into the container What we found was rather Than the gas

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.679
Igniting The Glass container Actually Broke Now of course Glass Isn't the best Material to use

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.469
But We Also Saw That as The Gasoline spilled Down over the Extremely hot Burner no reaction Happened nothing Lit on fire

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.599
It Just Spilled Out onto the ground and Began to vaporize in the atmosphere so we grabbed a blowtorch and tried to light off the

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.210
rest

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:07.780
Based on the results of This experiment I'm a Lot more Confident Working with Gasoline Now now obviously if you got a surface hot enough

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.679
You Could Get The Gasoline to ignite back When i was playing with My solar scorcher in concrete

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.440
I poured Gasoline onto the concrete and that Was hot enough to light the Gasoline Vapors off Just With Power of the sun so if

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.420
Concentrated Sunlight Will Do That I'M sure There's a temperature where we can Get Gasoline to flash into ignition However

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:28.150
Using The Kind of Equipment Like Ovens Stoves and Electric Burners That We Have Around the house it's not Likely to happen and That's Good

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.320
News
Well There you have it Guys We Have Successfully Answered the question What happens when you boil?

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:38.379
Gasoline and a Big thanks to you mix manhua 3ad for putting this Suggestion down in the comments and Go check your YouTube inbox Because

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.890
we're sending You 25 bucks

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.979
Now quick disclaimer This is not an experiment i want you to try at home Playing with Gasoline is Extremely Dangerous and if It gets

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.470
on your skin

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:51.310
you May Never look the same for the rest of Your life for This experiment we had Safety protocols in place a Giant Carbon dioxide

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.760
fire extinguisher we were using an Electric Burner and no open Sources of Ignition

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.749
replicating This Kind Of Experiment on top of an open flame like a fire pit for Example would Yield Much different Results That's not something

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.859
I recommend trying at home so thanks for Joining Us for this experiment Guys i'll be looking for you the next one talk to you

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.040
Then

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.820
