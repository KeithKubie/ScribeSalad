00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.040
Starting with mean and
standard deviation.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.450
We call the function mean and
std on our dataframe to get the values.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.380
Let's go ahead and check the mean and
the standard deviation for

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.140
the daily returns of SPY stock.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.930
So we get the mean and
the standard deviation.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.490
Happy with just knowing the mean and
standard deviation value?

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.720
But I am not.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.980
I want to see it on the plot,
just like Professor did.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.975
So let's learn how to add mean and
standard deviation line on plot.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:35.220
Matplotlib library has
a function axvline.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.310
Looking at the substring vline,
we can guess it will give vertical line.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.310
Let's check out its parameters.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.660
First we pass the mean value,
then just for beautification and so

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.640
that we can differentiate the mean line
from the rest histogram, we add a color,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.670
which is white, make it a dashed style
line and increase the linewidth to two.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.620
Now let's check our output.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.000
So this our mean and this is how
it is plotted on the histogram.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.950
Now let's go ahead and
plot standard deviation.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.710
To plot the standard deviation line,
it is similar to the mean.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.130
But as we want the standard deviation
line on both side of the mean,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.110
we plot it twice.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.456
One with the positive value and
one with the negative value,

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:25.460
to show standard deviation line
on either side of the mean.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.530
Ta dah, we have our standard
deviation lines on our graph.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.090
To give the standard
deviation a red color,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.940
I have just replaced the parameter
color of white, with red.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.030
Now I'm happy with the graph and
I hope you do are.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.560
Let's move ahead to kurtosis.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.430
We can expect that dataframe
would have a function for

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.110
calculating kurtosis as well.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.290
So that's it.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.080
This line will give you
kurtosis of the daily returns.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.860
We get a positive value for the SPY
stock, which means we have fat tails.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.818
Just for your information,

00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:06.610
you can also get bincounts
using numpy.histogram function.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.780
Check instructors notes for
more information.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.740
Over to you professor.
