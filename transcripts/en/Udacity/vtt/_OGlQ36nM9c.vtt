00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I'm actually going to move this picture out of the way.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's actually become distracting with the person and all this unnecessary information.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm just going to draw this diagram, which boils out the essential information.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
One thing I'd like to point out before we solve this problem—Δy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In reality, the ball starts at ground level, goes up to some maximum height

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then ends at ground level.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Since it starts and ends at the same altitude, well, Δy is really equal to 0.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, maybe I shouldn't call it Δy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Instead, let's solve for the maximum height the ball reaches.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Just like I did before, I'm going to approach this problem

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
by looking at the vertical component first.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, actually, this seems like it could be pretty difficult.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I've only got two pieces of information,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but that's not entirely true.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, let's exploit the one other fact we know about 1-dimensional motion.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We know that when an object reaches the absolute peak of its trajectory

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it's vertical velocity is 0—a.k.a. at this point vy = 0.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's also true that an object spends just as much time going up in its trajectory

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
as it does going down.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That's not something I'm going to prove for you here, but it's something you should definitely

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
talk about in the forums.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What's also true is that when a ball starts and ends from the same altitude, same height,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it takes the exact same amount of time to go up as it does to go down.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You could say t-up equals t-down.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Let's use this equation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well, I know at the highest point the balls vertical velocity is 0.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The total velocity isn't 0, because it's still moving towards the right,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but it's not moving at all vertically.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That equals the initial vertical velocity plus acceleration times time,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and this is where we have to be careful.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Acceleration here is -10.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Once I choose the initial velocity upwards of 40, acceleration is downwards has to be negative.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Times time. If I solve this I find that the time is equal to 4 seconds.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now, can you tell me what I should put here if this time represents

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the total travel time of the ball going up and then back down?

00:01:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I'll give you a hint. The answer is not 4.
