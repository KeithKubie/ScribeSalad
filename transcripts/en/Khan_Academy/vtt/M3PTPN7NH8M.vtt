00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.950
Mr. Theisen is honing his
deadly three-point precision

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.670
on the basketball court.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.190
For one of his shots,
the height of the ball

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:18.150
in feet as a function of
horizontal distance, in feet,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.760
y of x-- so here y
is a function of x.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.930
So the height must
be y because that's

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.460
the thing that is a
function of something else.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.930
So this right over
here is height.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.070
So our y-axis is going
to represent height.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.890
And it is a function of x.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.620
So x must represent
horizontal distance

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.780
because height is a function
of horizontal distance.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.520
So this right over here
is horizontal distance.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.610
Now, it's plotted below.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.180
Mr Theisen is standing
at x equals 0.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.790
So he's standing
right over here.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.850
This is Mr. Theisen, as I
draw my best attempt to draw

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.370
a little stick figure
version of Mr. Theisen.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.180
That's not even an acceptable
stick figure right over there.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.110
So this is Mr. Theisen, and
he's standing at x equals 0.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.990
And at x equals 0, he is
shooting a basketball.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.470
And you see from the
function right over here

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.680
that where the graph
intersects the y-axis,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.340
that tells us that's essentially
the height of the ball

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.814
when x is equal 0, where it's
where Mr. Theisen is standing.

00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:37.230
And if we look at
this, this looks

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.540
like it's 2, 4, 6 feet high.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.690
So that's really the
initial position of the ball

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.420
when Mr. Theisen is
about to let go of it.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.020
Then he lets go of
it, and the ball

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.960
goes in this
parabolic trajectory.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.590
It increases, increases,
increasing, increases.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.920
It looks like it hits a maximum
point right around there,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.720
roughly.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.560
That looks like it's
at about 16 feet.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.420
And then it starts to go down.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.970
And right over
here-- and this looks

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.910
like it's about,
let's see, 22, 24,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.160
26 feet out-- it looks
like it hit something.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.432
And considering that
something is 10 feet high,

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.640
it's reasonable to assume
that the thing that it hits

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.650
is the goal.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.940
And especially
because the question

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.990
states that he has deadly
three-point precision,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.110
we can assume it's not
crazy that he actually

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.822
makes the goal.

00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:26.530
And so that's where
it goes into the net.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.400
And then the net forces
the ball to go down

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.480
at a much steeper trajectory.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.600
And this is exactly, of
course, 10 feet high,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.240
the height of the goal.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.817
Now let's see which of
these interpretations

00:02:38.817 --> 00:02:40.400
are consistent with
the interpretation

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.060
that we just did.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.400
The ball is released
from Mr. Theisen's hand

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.030
at a height of 6 feet.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.380
Well, that looks exactly right.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.571
When x is equal to 0,
the ball is 6 feet.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.070
And not only is
that right, but that

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.290
is the significance of the
y-intercept of this function.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.050
The y-intercept
is the value of y,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.600
the height when x is equal to 0.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.140
So that is indeed
the significance

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.360
of the y-intercept.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.890
Let's look at
these other things.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.550
Mr. Theisen is shooting the
basketball from 26 feet away.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.100
Well, that's right.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.380
He's at x equals 0.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.550
The goal is at 26 feet away.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.836
But that's not the significance
of the y-intercept.

00:03:19.836 --> 00:03:21.460
That would be the
significance of where

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.210
we saw this little point here
where the ball dropped down

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.040
at a steeper angle.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.570
The rim of the basketball
hoop is 10 feet high.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.289
Once again, that's true.

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.080
You can look at it.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.413
You can see it right over there.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:36.100
But that's not the significance
of the y-intercept.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.350
The maximum height that the
ball reaches is 16 feet.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.470
Well, once again, that
is true, but that's

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.830
the significance of this
maximum point on the curve.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.650
That's not the significance
of the y-intercept.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.480
So we'll go with
this first choice.
