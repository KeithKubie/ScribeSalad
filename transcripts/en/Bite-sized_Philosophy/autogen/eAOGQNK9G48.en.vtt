00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.180
 We certainly choose each other according to self-awareness, awareness and intelligence. 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.300
 And I do not, you know ... if you choose a partner 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.000
 There is a race between humans when choosing the smartest partners 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.000
 This is specifically the issue of women in their relationships with men 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.800
 So the idea is that this is a choice, well this partly is why Eve makes Adam self conscious in the Garden of Eden 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 They offer him an apple. Is what makes him self-conscious, and I think that's true 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.000
 Because the evidence of evolutionary biologists is that the sexual selection of female human 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.100
 Was one of the factors that motivated us to change and differ from the shamanzi 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.500
 It is a large factor and the female Shambanese is not optional when entering into the eugenics, they reproduce with anything 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.200
 What happens is that the dominant males chase the male inferior, and therefore ends up leaving the descendants of Aktar !! 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 But it is not punishable by choice of females, in humans this is completely different 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.400
 Invasive ovulation and intense selection of pressure on women by men. 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.900
 You have twice the number of female ancestors of male ancestors. 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.500
 People find it difficult to work on it arithmetically, but it is not that difficult, 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.000
 You just think on average that every woman has one child, half men do not have, the other half has two. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 This is almost true if you are averaging across the history of the entire human race. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.500
 Male males in particular are subject to strong selection pressure by females, 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.000
 I also think that is partly why nature is represented symbolically as women among humans, 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 For in the end nature is chosen. There is no better definition of this nature
