00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.550
The number of values of theta
in the interval from negative pi

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.270
over 2 to pi over
2-- and it's not

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.150
including those because we have
curly parentheses around it

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.200
--such that theta does
not equal n pi over 5.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.870
So it's not a
multiple of pi over 5,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.880
for n equals 0 plus or
minus 1, plus or minus 2.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.330
And tangent of theta is equal
to cotangent of 5 theta,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.160
as well as sine of 2 theta is
equal to cosine of 4 theta is--

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.560
We have to find the
number of values of theta

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.176
that satisfy all
of these things.

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:34.550
So just from the
get-go, it seems

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.440
like we're going to
have to solve for thetas

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.800
and convert between sine and
cosine which is essentially

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.500
what you're doing between
tangent and cotangent.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.880
We'll do that in a little bit.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.280
And those of you who
know, if you're actually

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.920
taking an exam under
time pressure, I

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.530
don't recommend you reproving
your trig identities

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.570
from first principles.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.290
But for education purposes,
I always like to do it.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.030
Let me just draw a right
triangle right over here.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.020
If you're actually going
to take the IIT-JEE exam,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.210
I recommend having
most of the trig

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.160
identities at your fingertips.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.550
But let's say that's
a right triangle.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.259
And let's call that theta.

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.800
And then, this angle
right over, here

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.930
is going to be pi over 2 minus
theta, if we're in radians.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.220
90 degrees right
here is pi over 2.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.970
The whole triangle
right over here

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.500
is 180 degrees, which is pi.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.190
So this is pi over 2.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.990
And so these two guys
are going to have

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.380
to add up to the
other pi over 2.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.890
So this is pi over
2 minus theta.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.600
So let's think about
what cosine of theta is.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.220
Cosine of theta, "sou-cah-toa,"
cosine of theta is this side.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.530
Let's call this a, b, and c.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.390
It is going to be
the adjacent side.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.710
So cosine is adjacent.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.930
Let me write this
down, "sou-cah-toa."

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.890
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.325
So cosine of theta is b over
c, adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.590
is equal to b over c.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.182
But what's also
equal to b over c?

00:02:01.182 --> 00:02:02.640
If we look at this
angle over here,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.950
from this angle's point of
view, b is the opposite side.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.430
So it's opposite over hypotenuse
for this angle's point of view.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.760
So it's also equal to the
sine of pi over 2 minus theta.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.870
So we got our first
main identity here,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.660
that the cosine of theta
is equal to the sine of pi

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.659
over 2 minus theta.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.200
And we could go the
other way around,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.650
use the exact same logic to
get that the sine of theta

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.732
is equal to the cosine
of pi over 2 minus theta.

00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:38.190
So that'll be pretty
useful when we

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.424
try to solve this
equation right over here.

00:02:40.424 --> 00:02:42.340
And we can even use it
when we solve this one.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.750
Because if I were to write
down the cotangent of 5 theta--

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.890
let me write this down.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.070
So the cotangent of-- not
cosine-- the cotangent

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.050
of 5 theta, this is
the exact same thing.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.020
The cotangent of five theta
is the exact same thing

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.730
as the cosine of 5 theta
over the sine of 5 theta.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.030
It's just 1 over the tangent.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.320
And this is the same thing.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.020
I can convert the cosine into
sine using this identity up

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.520
here.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.190
This is the sine of pi
over 2 minus 5 theta

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:27.012
over the cosine of pi
over 2 minus 5 theta.

00:03:27.012 --> 00:03:29.220
And for here, I'm just using
this identity over here.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.210
And this is the exact
same thing as the tangent

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.507
of pi over 2 minus 5 theta.

00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:39.090
And since we're going
to actually have

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.374
to solve this
equation eventually,

00:03:41.374 --> 00:03:43.540
and we want to make sure
we get all of the solutions

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.092
to this equation.

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.800
One thing that you
might want to remember

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.620
is, when you take a
tangent of an angle--

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.080
and I'll just draw
the unit circle here--

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.480
so if I have some angle--
let me draw my axes.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.240
And let's say that this
right here is theta.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.380
You probably remember that
this theta is essentially

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.840
the slope of the line formed.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.250
It's opposite over adjacent.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.300
It's the slope of
the line formed,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.500
or by the radius
in the unit circle.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.240
So this theta is going to
have the exact same tangent

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.579
as if we add 180 degrees
or if we add pi to this.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.960
So if you add pi, you
get theta plus pi.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.300
So this whole angle right
over here is theta plus pi.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.340
And its tangent is going
to be the same thing.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.570
It's the slope of the radius
is going to be the same.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.090
So you can add multiples
of pi to a tangent value,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.330
and you're going to get
the exact same value.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.610
So let me put some
multiples of pi

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.450
over here, so that
we can make sure

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.480
that we get all
of the solutions.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.250
So with that said,
with this written,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.590
we can now solve this
first equation over here.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.550
And then, we can worry about
some of these other constraints

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.050
later.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.280
So tangent of theta is equal
to cotangent of 5 theta.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.475
Well, so we can write tangent
of theta is equal to--

00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:02.850
and instead of writing cotangent
of 5 theta, we can write

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.420
is equal to the tangent
of pi over 2 minus 5

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.679
theta plus integer
multiples of pi.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.970
And so the tangent of this
is equal to tangent of that.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.820
These things could be
equal to each other.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:26.850
So we get theta is equal to pi
over 2 minus 5 theta plus n pi.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.344
Or at minimum, this
could be equal,

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:29.760
when you take the
tangent of this,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.580
it's equal to the tangent
of either the same thing,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.410
or we could add
multiples of pi to it.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.270
You could view it as either way.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.770
But now, we just
have to solve this.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.610
We can add 5 pi to both
sides of this equation.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.749
We get, sorry, we
could add 5 theta

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:44.040
to both sides of this equation.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.820
We're adding this to both sides.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.200
So you get 6 theta is equal
to pi over 2 minus n pi,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.530
minus multiples of pi, or
sorry, plus multiples of pi.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.060
There's a plus right over there.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.760
Divide both sides by 6.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:07.300
I get theta is equal to pi
over 12 plus n times pi over 6.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.410
Or just to make the
fraction adding easier,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.279
this is the same thing
as pi over 12 plus 2.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.320
Let me write it this way.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.530
Plus 2 n pi over 12.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.660
This is the same
thing as n pi over 6.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.170
I just multiplied the
numerator and denominator by 2.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.300
And this is the
exact same thing.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.610
You could imagine a 1
coefficient out here.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:36.040
This is the same thing as
2n plus 1 times pi over 12.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:43.230
So that's all of the solutions
for this first equation

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.400
right over there.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.650
Now, let's do the same thing
for this second equation.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.327
And then, we'll see where
they overlap in this range.

00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:51.910
And we'll take out anything that
satisfies this criteria right

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.070
over here.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.550
So the second equation.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.690
Let me write it over here.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.277
We have sine of 2 theta.

00:06:58.277 --> 00:06:59.610
Let me write it over here first.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.680
Cosine of 4 theta.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.210
What does cosine of
4 theta is equal to?

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.480
Cosine of 4 theta, using
the same exact logic,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.960
is equal to sine of
pi over 2 minus theta.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.500
And of course, when we take
a sine or cosine or we take

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.474
really any trig identity or
any trig function of any angle,

00:07:18.474 --> 00:07:19.890
you're going to
get the same value

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.600
if you add multiples of 2 pi.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.510
So let me just add
multiples of 2 pi

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.270
here, just so we can
make sure that we

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.630
get all the possible solutions.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.280
So this is what cosine
of 4 theta is equal to.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.510
So let us-- oh,
let me be careful.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.870
Cosine of 4 theta is not equal
to pi over 2 minus theta.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.210
That would be cosine of theta.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.250
If it's cosine of 4 theta,
it's pi over 2 minus 4 theta

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.140
plus multiples of 2 pi.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.287
So plus 2 pi n.

00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:52.120
Because obviously you
add multiples of 2 pi,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.740
you're going to go back
to the same angles.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.310
So you go back up to
this equation up here.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:03.591
We get sine of 2 theta is
equal to cosine of 4 theta.

00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:05.340
Which is the same thing
as this over here,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:13.490
which is equal to sine of
pi over 2 minus 4 theta plus

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.200
2 pi n.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.890
And so these evaluate
to the same thing.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.750
Let's set them
equal to each other.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:29.560
2 theta is equal to pi over
2 minus 4 pi plus 2 pi n.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.900
Let's add 4 pi to both
sides of this equation.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.710
We get 6 theta.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.309
6 theta is equal to pi over 2.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:43.309
So this is canceled out.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.370
Plus 2 pi n.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.465
Let's divide both sides by 6.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:09:02.880
We get theta is equal to
pi over 12 plus pi over 3n.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.249
2 divided by 6 is pi n over 3.

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:10.290
Now, we can put it over
a common denominator just

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.000
to simplify things.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.110
So we have over 12.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.830
We have this pi.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:20.800
pi n over 3 is the same
thing as plus 4n pi over 12.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.150
Or we could write
this as being, this

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:33.230
is equal to 4n plus
1 times pi over 12.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.680
So now, we just
need to see where

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.287
there is overlap between this
solution and that solution.

00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:40.620
Remember, we just have to
count the number of solutions.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.510
We actually don't have
to find the solutions.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.010
And actually if you pretty savvy
and do things in your head,

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.650
just at this point, you could
think about how many of these

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.700
you're going to have
between negative pi over 2

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.360
and pi over 2.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.390
If you remember, that was the
range that we're working with.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.690
Between negative pi over 2
and pi over 2, not including

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.700
those two.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.620
And then you can figure out,
and actually every one of these

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.910
is also going to
be one of these.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.900
Because no matter what
you set n equal to,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.240
if you set n equal
to twice that,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.090
you're going to have
the equivalent thing.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.960
So any of these are
going to be any of these.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.760
Anything that
satisfies this equation

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.660
will also satisfy this
equation right here.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.400
So really, we can just count
how many are in this one.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.010
But just to make
it clear, I'm going

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.500
to find all of them that
satisfy this equation.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.375
And then we're going to
see how many of those

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:27.800
satisfy this equation as well.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.890
But the fast way
to do it, just find

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.010
the ones that satisfy this one.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.010
Or just count the ones
that satisfy this one.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.140
And you've done the problem.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.250
So let's just count.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.035
So let's just start
at n equals 0.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.870
If n is equal to 0-- and
I'm using this n up here.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.960
I won't even write that.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.350
If n is equal to 0, we
just have pi over 12.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.720
If n is 1, we get 3 pi over 12.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.870
If n is 2, we get 5 pi over 12.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.556
And we can't make n equal 3.

00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:03.930
Because if n was
equal to 3, this

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.410
would be 7 pi over 12 which
is greater than pi over 2.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.480
That's greater
than 6 pi over 12.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.660
So we can't have that.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.440
We could also go to negative n.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.940
We could also have negative n.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:20.195
If n is negative 1, then this
becomes negative pi over 12.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:30.390
If n is negative 2, this
becomes negative 3 pi over 12.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.890
And if n is negative
3, then this

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.970
becomes a negative 5 pi over 12.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.930
And once again, we can't go
to n is equal to negative 4,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.380
because then we
get negative 7 pi

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.920
over 12 which is
out of our range.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.800
So this satisfies
this equation up here.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.960
Now, which of these are
overlap with this over here?

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.480
So let's set n equal to 0.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.720
We get pi over 12.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.700
If n is equal to 1,
we get 5 pi over 12.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.760
We can't set n equal to
2, because then we'll

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.240
get out of our range,
we'll go above pi over 2.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.740
If n is equal to negative 1,
we get negative 3 pi over 12.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.450
If n is equal to negative
2, this is negative 8.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.400
Then, we get to
negative 7 pi over 12,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.850
which is smaller than
negative pi over 2.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.250
So that doesn't count.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.480
So there are three solutions.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.720
Or if we look over here,
we have three solutions.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.200
We have one, two,
three solutions.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.080
And none of them satisfy this.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.330
None of them are
multiples of n pi over 5.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.869
So the answer to
our problem is 3.

00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:39.410
And you really could have just
done the second equation right

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.910
over here.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.576
And realize that anything that's
a solution in this top equation

00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:44.660
would be a solution to
this bottom equation.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.660
And you would have just
counted these solutions.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.760
And you would have been done.
