00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:09.926
In 2010, $30 billion worth
of fruits and vegetables

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:12.806
were wasted by American retailers
and shoppers

00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:16.319
in part because of cosmetic problems
and perceived spoilage.

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:20.449
That's a poor use of about 30%
of the produce on the market,

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.699
not to mention the water and energy
required to grow and transport it,

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.849
and the landfill space getting used up
by rotting fruit.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.224
So what are those cosmetic problems?

00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:33.486
You've probably passed over
a spotty apple in the grocery store,

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:37.989
or accidentally sunk your thumb
into a mushy patch on a tomato.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.058
These blemishes can doom produce
to the trash can.

00:00:41.058 --> 00:00:42.529
But what are they anyway,

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:45.080
and are they actually bad for you?

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.000
Those spots are evidence of an epic battle
between plants and microbes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.289
Like humans, plants coexist with billions
of fungi and bacteria.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.421
Some of these microbes are beneficial
to the plant,

00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:59.590
suppressing disease and helping it
extract nutrients.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.460
Others are pathogens,
attacking the produce,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.553
still alive as it sits in a store display
or your refrigerator

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:09.851
and siphoning off molecules
they can use themselves.

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:12.561
The good news is 
they're almost never bad for you.

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.831
These fungi and bacteria have spent
millions of years

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.871
developing strategies to overcome
a plant's immune system.

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.691
But healthy human immune systems
are different enough

00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:24.401
that those strategies 
just don't work on us.

00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:28.201
So in a plant,
what does this process look like?

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.779
Microbes can reach plants 
in a number of ways,

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:35.112
like getting splashed onto it
during watering or fertilization.

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:36.781
Under the right conditions,

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.032
the microbes grow 
into large enough colonies

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.463
to attack the waxy outer layer 
of fruit or leaves.

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:46.300
Their target: the delicious sugars
and nutrients inside.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.613
This type of pathogen often makes
spots like this.

00:01:49.613 --> 00:01:53.531
A clump of bacteria drains the nutrients
and color from the fruit's cells

00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:55.593
making that yellow halo.

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:56.942
It then moves outward,

00:01:56.942 --> 00:01:59.993
leaving a black spot of dead cells
in its wake.

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:03.233
Each spot, which could contain
hundreds of thousands of microbes

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:06.753
is actually caused by a combination
of microbial attack

00:02:06.753 --> 00:02:08.693
and the host defending itself.

00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:13.672
For example, this is the bacterial
pathogen Pseudomonas syringae.

00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:16.354
Once on a tomato, 
it enters the fruit and leaves,

00:02:16.354 --> 00:02:19.073
multiplies in the space between the cells,

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:21.044
and produces toxins and proteins

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:24.323
that allow it to disrupt 
the plant's immune response.

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:28.308
One toxin coronatine makes plants'
stomata open up,

00:02:28.308 --> 00:02:31.133
allowing bacteria to enter 
more freely.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:35.244
Coronatine also activates pathways
leading to chlorophyll degradation,

00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:37.564
which you can see as yellow spots.

00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:39.914
As the bacteria continue to feed
and multiply,

00:02:39.914 --> 00:02:41.984
they start to kill off the plant cells.

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:45.853
That explains spots,
but what about mushy blemishes?

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:49.046
Those are usually caused when the fruit
is attacked by microbes

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:50.962
after it's detached from the plant.

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.955
If the plant is wounded during transport,

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:56.024
necrotic fungi can infiltrate 
through the wound,

00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:57.166
kill the cells,

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:58.426
absorb their nutrients,

00:02:58.426 --> 00:03:01.334
and leave your food 
looking mushy or brown.

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:03.894
Those spots in particular 
can taste pretty bad.

00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:06.425
You're eating dead 
and decomposing tissue, after all.

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:08.834
But you can usually salvage the rest
of the fruit.

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:13.165
The non-mushy spots, like the ones
you typically see on apples or tomatoes,

00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:16.566
are just on the surface 
and don't usually affect flavor.

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:20.536
Of course, microbes that do make us sick,
like E. coli and salmonella,

00:03:20.536 --> 00:03:23.126
can hitch a ride on vegetables, too.

00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:26.786
But because they're not plant pathogens,
they don't typically cause spots.

00:03:26.786 --> 00:03:29.637
They just hang out 
invisibly on the surface.

00:03:29.637 --> 00:03:32.756
So it's washing fruit and veggies,
not avoiding the spotty ones,

00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:35.156
that will help you avoid getting sick.

00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:37.345
So the next time 
you're at the grocery store,

00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:39.703
don't be afraid 
to pick up funky-looking fruit.

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:42.126
Some stores will even give you a discount.

00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:44.026
Wash them well and store them properly,

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:48.227
as some produce like apples and cabbages
will keep in the fridge for weeks.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:52.626
The spotty ones may not be eye candy,
but they're safe and just as delicious.
