00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.160
LEBRON JAMES: Newton's third law
tells us that to every action,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.780
there's always an equal
and opposite reaction.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.744
When I'm shooting the ball, I am
clearly applying a force to it.

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.410
Where's the equal and
opposite reaction?

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.757
 

00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:18.840
SALMAN KHAN: That's an
excellent question, LeBron.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.980
So as you mentioned, if
someone's shooting a ball,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.272
they're clearly applying
a force to that ball.

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:24.980
And let me see if I
can draw that for us.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.760
So let's say that this is
the force that your hand is

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.070
applying on the ball.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.830
And this force is what
accelerates the ball upwards

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.290
and towards the basket.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.150
So force is force
applied by hand,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.650
applied by hand on the ball.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.030
So where is this equal
and opposite force

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.740
that Newton's third
law tells us about?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.320
Well, that's going
to be the force

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.530
that the ball is
applying to your hand.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.350
And so I'll draw the
force right here.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.510
I could draw it
anywhere on the hand.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.350
But I'll draw it
here, just so you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.310
see it's going in the
exact opposite direction.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.500
 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.610
And it has an equal magnitude.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.580
So it's an equal
but opposite force.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.600
Opposite is the direction.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.900
So just like that.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:23.020
So that is the force applied
by the ball on your hand.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.004
 

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:27.420
But then you might
say, wait, this

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030
doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.330
The ball is clearly getting
accelerated in that direction.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.700
But my hand isn't
accelerating backwards

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.400
in kind of that
opposite direction.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.040
And the reason why your hand
isn't accelerating backwards,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.640
isn't just flopping backwards
because of this force

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.720
of the ball applying
to the hand,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.430
the reason is because
your hand or your fingers

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.750
have other forces acting on
it that counteract this force.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.590
So for example, the reason
why your fingers and your hand

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.700
don't flop backwards, don't
accelerate backwards because

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.400
of this force, is because you
have muscles in your forearm.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.700
You have muscles in your
forearm, roughly right

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.610
around there, that are
pulling on your fingers

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.199
and on your hand and are
counteracting this force.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.740
So they are
counteracting that force.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.040
So you say, OK, fair enough.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.900
I see why my fingers
aren't flopping back

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.440
and why my hand
isn't flopping back.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.070
It's because of these
muscles right over here.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.420
But why isn't my entire forearm
being pushed or accelerated

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.230
back by this force applied
by the ball on my hand?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.650
And the reason is that
you have other muscles

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.830
in the back of your upper arm,
in particular your triceps,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.510
that are keeping-- that are
tugging on your forearm.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.990
It's contracting.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.440
They're contracting-- that
more than offset any net force

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.100
on your forearm that would
want to make it go that way.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.540
It's pulling on your forearm.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.664
And in fact, that's what's
contracting and allowing

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:56.950
your forearm to go in
actually that direction.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.210
And we could keep going.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.510
I mean, the fun, or
the complicated thing,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.579
about Newton's third law
is if every force has

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.870
an equal and opposite force,
will every one of these we

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.453
have have an equal
and opposite force?

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:08.330
And we can keep going
on as, OK, there's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.100
an equal and opposite
force of the tricep tugging

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.132
on the forearm.

00:03:13.132 --> 00:03:15.090
Well, that's the forearm
tugging on the tricep.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.423
But why doesn't the tricep move?

00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:18.870
Well, the tricep is attached
to other parts of your body.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.140
And we could keep
going on and on and on.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.900
But just to focus
on the question,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.860
your hand is definitely
applying a force to the ball,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.470
but the equal and opposite
force is the force

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.870
that the ball is
applying to the hand.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.360
But we actually-- even though
we said that your hand isn't

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.740
flopping back because it's
being balanced-- you actually

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.680
can sense this force.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.690
And the reason why you do sense
this force is you actually do

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.950
have the ball compressing
against the palm of your hand.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.560
If it didn't do that, you
wouldn't even feel the ball.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.620
So that gives you at
least a sensory clue

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.200
of Newton's third law.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.197
If Newton's third
law wasn't true,

00:03:54.197 --> 00:03:55.530
you wouldn't even feel the ball.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.196
You wouldn't even
have the ball compress

00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:59.709
against the skin of your palm.

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:00.209
