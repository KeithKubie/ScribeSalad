00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.950
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Hello,
everyone, good evening.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.740
My name is Jane Sanchez and
I have the honor of serving

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.550
as the 25th Law Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.170
Welcome to The Library
of Congress.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.040
We are very pleased -- I'm
sorry, you can't hear me?

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.250
Okay. We're very pleased to
host you today in celebration

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
of The Heritage of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.190
a milestone document

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.880
which underpins all
international human rights law

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.190
and inspires us to
continue to work to ensure

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.350
that all people can gain
freedom, equality and dignity

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.290
and this year it turns 70.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.630
Human Rights Day is
observed each year

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.720
to commemorate the adoption

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.370
of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.840
The Declaration is defined as a
common standard of achievement

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.100
for all peoples and all nations

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.560
and it is considered the
first universal statement

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.140
that all human beings have
certain inherent rights

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.520
that are inalienable.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.630
It was drafted by
representatives

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.350
with different legal and
cultural backgrounds,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.460
from all the regions of the
world, and was proclaimed

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.840
by the United Nations
General Assembly in Paris

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.660
on December 10th, 1948.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.620
Our own Eleanor Roosevelt,
former UNA-USA Board Chairwoman

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.050
and trailblazer, chaired
the UDHR Drafting Committee

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.700
and was integral
to its adoption.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.450
The Declaration, itself, is
the most translated document

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.770
in the world, available in
more than 500 languages.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.950
We, at the Library of
Congress, have decided

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.190
to celebrate this
remarkable anniversary

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.680
by hosting an even this
evening that will engage

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.100
and educate all of us.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.540
Our topic tonight is
The NAGPRA, I don't know

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.790
if that's pronounced a different
way, NAGPRA -- okay, thank you.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.340
The Native-American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.180
This Act mandates the return
of specific kinds of objects

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.250
to Native-Americans, makes
illegal their trafficking

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.010
across state lines and is
specific about the process

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.860
and the procedures for
archaeological excavations.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.290
Tonight we are going to
hear more and learn more

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.580
about NAGPRA thanks to
our three Panelists.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.160
And now please allow
me to introduce

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.780
and welcome Sarah Glass, who is
the Notice and Grant Coordinator

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.320
at the National NAGPRA Program
at The National Park Service,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.370
Shannon Keller O'Loughlin,
the Executive Director

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.410
of the Association on American
Indian Affairs, and Emily Palus,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.750
the Deputy Division Chief

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.820
of Cultural Paleontological
Resources

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.890
and Tribal Consultation at
The Bureau of Land Management.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.530
Thank you for joining
us this evening.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.200
Shall we start?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.370
Sarah, would you please give
us a bit more information

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.190
and general overview

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.220
of the Native-American
Graves Protection

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.660
and Repatriation
Act, what is NAGPRA?

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.960
&gt;&gt; Sarah Glass: Great question.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.350
Thanks, Jane, and thank you
very much for having me.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.900
I'm so honored to be here
tonight with my fellow Panelists

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.910
and excited to talk a
bit about what it is I do

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.410
on a day-to-day basis,
so thanks.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.750
I hope everyone doesn't
mind, but I am going

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.720
to keep some notes, keep
checking on my notes here

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.300
because as we were planning
this we were all joking

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.710
about how each of us
individually could talk

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.810
about these things all
day for hours and hours,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.540
so just as a way of
keeping myself on track

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.700
and making sure we have plenty
of time for questions I'm going

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.220
to consult some written
stuff here.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.730
It looks like I'm
not the only one.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.340
So I wanted to start with
a quick story actually

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.130
to help me put NAGPRA in a
bit of historical context,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.950
and I'm going to describe
a scenario that I've taken

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.440
from real life but I'm going
to kind of paraphrase it

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.700
and not include quite as many
factual details as I would.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.050
But imagine that it's the
United States in the 1970s

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.880
and they're building a highway
across a state in the Midwest,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.060
so they're digging, laying
down the road, and they come

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.630
across a group of burials
that they had no idea.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.810
You know, they're digging
up land and, surprise,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.370
there were people on this
land before we showed up

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.660
and started building roads.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.910
And those burials that
they uncover they can tell

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.200
from contextual clues,
from items buried

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.400
with the individuals that 11
of these say 12 were those

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.550
of white settlers, Anglo
burials, while the 12th one

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.920
with some grave goods and
objects they could tell

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.850
that it was clearly the remains
of a Native-American woman.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.360
So what do they do when
they uncover these graves?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.780
They call in state
archaeologists,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.070
they call in the right people
who are supposed to respond

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.850
to these types of
situations, and they proceed

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.440
to very respectfully and very
carefully exhume those 11 white

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.870
settlers' graves and
immediately rebury them

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.630
in a nearby local cemetery.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.120
Now the 12th grave, the
Native-American woman,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.030
they put her bones in a box
and they shipped that box

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.090
to a University to be studied

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.790
because Native-American peoples
were not considered anything

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.560
more than specimens to
be collected and studied

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.540
until this Act, NAGPRA,
as passed in 1990.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.590
So I think it's important
to keep in mind

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.140
that these are human
beings, that these,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:09.100
NAGPRA has a very purposeful way

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:15.790
of addressing some very big
wrongs and historic, you know,

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.190
it's a healing process for a lot
of people with dealing with it.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.880
So I just tell that
story to kind

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.640
of contextualize what we're
all talking about today.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.640
So and this is not
a new problem,

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.540
ever since first contacts,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.330
Native-American peoples
have been fighting

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.010
to protect their rights
while being treated

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.270
like scientific specimens,
objects for study,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.850
instead of human beings.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.710
Archaeologists, anthropologists,
random people who felt

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.240
like going out and just digging

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.290
up amassed huge massive
collections that were then put

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.020
into museums or onto shelves
controlled by Federal agencies.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.540
And, unfortunately,
in some parts

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.630
of the world this is still
perpetuated today, this mindset

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.210
of collecting, storing,
I mean you can go

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.120
to the Natural History
Museum and that's

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.180
where Native-American
topics are often covered.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.150
It's certainly changing today,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:16.620
but I mean Archaeology 101 today
they tell you Indiana Jones was

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.130
a really, really
terrible archaeologist,

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.190
but that's the image that
everyone has in their mind of,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.130
oh, yes, this is
such a great field.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:32.020
So NAGPRA is inextricably linked
to kind of the racial history

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.050
within the United States and it
took a lot of fighting and a lot

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.830
of time, the Civil
Rights Movement,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.990
the American Indian
Movement through the 60s

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.950
and 70s were really a turning
point, a pivotal moment

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.510
to organize and make their
voices heard in a way

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.820
that they could get some
change enacted in Congress.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.180
So that led to the
passage of the NMAI Act,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.070
the National Museum of the
American Indian Act in 1989,

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.330
as well as the NAGPRA
right afterwards

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.950
in 1990, November 16th, 1990.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.800
And so I like to call it a
very small but mighty law

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.540
because it's pretty short,
it doesn't take you very long

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:22.450
to read the whole thing, but it
covers multiple areas of US law.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.870
So it's administrative
law, it's human rights law,

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.560
it's Indian law, and it's
property law, so there's a lot

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.450
of different pieces and elements
that are all kind of entwined

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.300
and overlapping and
makes people think

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.590
that it's very complicated
sometimes.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:46.050
But what it also is at its core
is a process, so it's a process

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.750
for determining the rights
of lineal descendants,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.490
Indian tribes and
Native-Hawaiian organizations

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:58.110
in the human remains and
certain cultural items,

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.870
including funerary objects,
sacred objects and objects

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.020
of cultural patrimony.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:10.410
It applies to Federal
or tribal land,

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.220
as well as to Federal agency
and museum collections,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.320
so there's a land element,
a collections element.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.710
And the term museum,
when I say museum,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.950
we actually under NAGPRA it's
defined a bit more broadly

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.610
than what most people think of.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:32.760
Museums under NAGPRA could
be, it's any institution

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.250
that has Native-American
artifacts or items

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.900
and has received
Federal funding.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.020
So a museum under NAGPRA
could be a museum as we think

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.590
of it today, but it could
also be a historical society,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.960
an anthropology department
of a University,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.550
a county coroner's office,
a police department,

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.830
or even a library that has
items, historic objects.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.540
So it's not just museum in the
sense that most of us think of

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.310
and it, I should
add, does not apply

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.630
to the Smithsonian Institution.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.900
Here we are in DC,
lovely Smithsonian,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.230
because the NMAI Act
that I mentioned earlier

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.230
that was passed actually
covers repatriation

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.660
for that institution,
so that's one

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.580
of the things that's not
covered under NAGPRA,

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.000
as well as foreign institutions.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.650
NAGPRA is US law, it's
domestic law, it does not apply

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.950
to the international field.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:34.340
So essentially what NAGPRA does
is it established timelines

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.600
for museums and Federal agencies
to inventory their collections,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.080
consult with Native-American
tribes

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.530
and Native-Hawaiian
organizations,

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.590
and then to notify everyone

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.830
of their determinations
regarding cultural affiliation

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.990
and repatriation through and
via the Federal Register.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.380
So this administrative
process is just one

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.610
of the major provisions
under NAGPRA,

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.300
there's actually four
others that we handle.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.910
First, it established the
NAGPRA Review Committee,

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.980
which is a Federal Advisory
Committee that hears disputes

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.400
and serves as a resolution
and advisory body.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.360
They don't have any legal,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.040
their determinations have no
legal bearing, but they are kind

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.230
of the highest level that one
can take before going to court,

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.390
one's issues to be
heard about NAGPRA.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.030
They also are, the
other provision,

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.350
another is that we
authorize grants to museums

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.630
and Indian tribes,
Native-Hawaiian organizations

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.160
to conduct their NAGPRA work.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:50.510
It authorized us to assess
civil penalties against museums

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.150
who fail to comply with the
law, and it also makes it,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.420
as Jane mentioned,
illegal to traffic

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.100
in Native-American human
remains and cultural items.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:08.340
So all of those kind of buckets
of responsibility are overseen

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.280
and enforced in part by the
National NAGPRA Program,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.830
of which I am one of
six staff members,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.620
so we are also small and mighty.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.700
And we've been delegated
the responsibility

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.680
of implementing these
provisions on behalf

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.520
of the Secretary
of the Interior.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.310
So we do things like we
maintain public databases

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.020
of the inventories and
summaries that museums

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.760
and Federal agencies
were required

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.230
to put together under this law.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.900
We publish the notices
in the Federal Register

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.230
when they make those
determinations.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.900
We award and manage grants.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.380
We support the Review Committee
and host public meetings.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.530
And then we also assist in
investigating allegations

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.290
of failure to comply
with the law and then

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.720
with assessing civil penalties

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.000
when those allegations
are deemed to be valid.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.140
So I don't want to take up too
much time, I want to leave lots

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.900
of time for questions, but
usually what I say when it comes

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.890
to NAGPRA is it's an
imperfect law because law is

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.770
by nature imperfect but
it's an important one.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.940
And its passage was a major
milestone in the ongoing,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.800
still today the ongoing fight
to right these historical wrongs

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.610
that were done to the indigenous
peoples of this country,

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.850
so it's one small step.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:39.150
And I like to always
mention a quote actually

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:45.230
from former US Representative
Morris K. Udall of Arizona,

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.870
who introduced the
NAGPRA Bill back in 1990,

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:54.430
and he said in the larger scope
of history this is a small thing

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.800
but in the smaller scope

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.900
of conscience it may be the
biggest thing we have ever done.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.870
So, with that.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.170
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Okay.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.090
Emily, how does your
Division and the Bureau

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.470
of Land Management
institutionally respond

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.480
to NAGPRA procedures
and requirements?

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.320
Can you tell us something about
the responsibilities, activities

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.450
and collaboration
opportunities perhaps?

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.750
&gt;&gt; Emily Palus: Sure.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.610
Thank you.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.620
So in representing the
Bureau of Land Management,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.030
which is an agency of the US
Department of the Interior,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.750
we are an implementor

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.500
of the Native-American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.620
So I'll just quickly
mention that the Bureau

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.300
of Land Management manages
about 256 million acres

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.610
of public lands largely out West

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.370
in the Western United
States and Alaska.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.940
We're a multiple use
Land Management Agency,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.690
meaning we strive to find
balance in multiple uses

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.480
of the land, so energy,
oil and gas development,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.690
renewable energy,
recreation, timber, grazing,

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.630
while also providing
conservation of wildlife habitat

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.290
and preservation of
archaeological sites.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.210
It's a complex mission.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.590
We interact with the
Native-American Graves

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.000
Protection and Repatriation Act
principally in three avenues,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.140
which Sarah touched on.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.760
And there is I'd say

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.530
in procedures there is
the bureaucratic process,

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.880
but I think it's important
to pause and reflect

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.030
on the humanizing part of it.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.160
So we interact with
NAGPRA in collections,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.800
so Native-American human
remains, objects, sacred objects

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.700
and objects of cultural
patrimony that were recovered

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.280
from agency lands, so
from public lands managed

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.370
by the Bureau of
Land Management,

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.330
or a predecessor agency,
the General Land Office.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.930
So collections made from
those lands between 1906

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.730
with enactment of
the Antiquities Act,

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.180
which we'll talk about in a
moment, and November 16th,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.730
1990 when NAGPRA was enacted.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:09.570
Those collections represent
thousands of artifacts

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:14.160
and many individuals, and I've
got some figures to provide.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.960
These collections were
largely made under permit,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.420
under the Antiquities Act.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.030
We also respond to
new discoveries,

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.100
which Sarah touched on,

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.420
discoveries of Native-American
human remains and cultural items

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.720
on the public lands today

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.510
and that generally falls
into two categories.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:41.600
Discovery is part of land
use or development and so

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.510
if we are authorizing
development,

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.160
earth moving activity and so
on in an area that is likely

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.740
to contain Native-American
human remains

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.040
and cultural items we need
to have a plan and we develop

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.960
that plan in consultation

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.330
with potentially
affiliated Indian tribes.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.210
We also have new discoveries
that are more haphazard

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.020
and not recreational users on
the public land, a hiker goes

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:11.350
out and finds some
human bone eroding out

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:16.880
and that can be somewhat common
depending on the landscape

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.300
and as we have an increasing
amount of recreation

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.580
in the public lands which has a
lot of benefits with the public

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.750
to use their public lands,
but with erosion and things

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:31.190
like that a hiker might
find remains eroding out.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.290
We also have and actually
that's one of those things

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.370
that I'll pause and
say we're going to talk

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.710
about what NAGPRA
requires Federal agencies

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.950
and museums to do.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:48.480
There's actually a provision
in NAGPRA that requires anyone,

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.120
including you, to act if
you have reason to believe

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.360
that you have found
Native-American human remains

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.380
or other cultural items on
Federal or tribal lands.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.360
We all have a responsibility.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.750
And so what do you do?

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.160
You contact the agency official.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.620
The third avenue that we
interact with NAGPRA is

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.280
through law enforcement.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.630
So I mentioned the
trafficking provision of NAGPRA,

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.000
illegal to traffic
Native-American human remains

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.360
and cultural items.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.100
We also have another law
that links into this,

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.050
which is the Archaeological
Resources Protection Act,

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:34.310
which was enacted in
1979 and has provisions

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.120
that prohibit unauthorized
excavation, damage,

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.970
destruction of archaeological
sites on Federal

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:44.210
and Indian lands, as
well as trafficking

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.810
in such archaeological items

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.010
and in some ways
this is challenging,

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.790
but the Native-American
Graves Protection

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.150
and Repatriation Act is a
little bit of a misnomer

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.490
in that the law doesn't
wholly protect a grave.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.300
So for new discoveries
it provides a process

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:09.730
by which agencies respond
if a grave is found,

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:14.110
the same with the
prohibited acts,

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:17.580
the law enforcement section of
NAGPRA is about trafficking,

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.850
not unauthorized disturbance

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.280
which is sometimes a
surprise for folks.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.150
I've worked with
law enforcement,

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.750
I've worked on all three
of these provisions,

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.560
and we might talk about
law enforcement later,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.610
but one example I just wanted
to share because I think

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.020
as a Federal agency
representative I can fall

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.490
into process and acronyms
and things like that

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.020
and the Native-American
Graves Protection

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.900
and Repatriation
Act is an authority

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.200
that just pulls me back

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.210
into realizing the human
impact of what I do.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.750
And one example is a
law enforcement action

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.170
where there was a seizure
and forfeiture of artifacts,

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:02.360
and we went through and we were
inventorying artifacts that were

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.300
in a bucket, like the kind
you get at Home Depot,

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.410
a plastic bucket and these were
called perishable material,

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.400
items made out of plant fibers.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.470
And there were sandals, sandals
and jeweler, seeing those

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.810
in the archaeological
record are very, you know,

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.240
these are personal adornment,
and so seeing these sandals

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.250
that had been taken from
the public lands by people

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.010
without authorization because
they thought it was fun

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.480
and interesting, but
these sandals came

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.870
down to be children's sandals.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.230
And so I was looking at
children's sandals and this is

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.960
so real to me, these
were on some child's feet

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.920
and they were now in a bucket,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.620
some prize for someone
who had been looting.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:56.050
Our responsibilities, NAGPRA as
Sarah shared was really pivotal

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.580
in 1990 and I just want to
give a little more history

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.690
because I've mentioned
the Antiquities Act

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.870
and I've mentioned the
Archaeological Resources

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.580
Protection Act.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.130
So 1906 Congress enacted
the law for the Preservation

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.560
of American Antiquities

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.730
and at the time it was
really this pivotal moment

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.960
where it establishes
Federal policy

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:22.490
that archaeological
sites were important

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.740
and should be preserved for
the benefit of all Americans,

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.300
they shouldn't be mined
as commercial resources.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.020
And it established among other
things a permitting process

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:40.990
by which only those that
were deemed reputable

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.580
to do the excavations,
and so this was designed

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.560
to protect sites, but over and
my agency or the Department

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.490
of Interior issued
permits, hundreds,

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:57.120
thousands of investigations
of which archaeological sites,

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.500
ruins, Native-American
ancestral homes,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.250
cemeteries were excavated.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.400
And this is Federal policy that
this was expanding the knowledge

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.450
and so human remains
among other items ended

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.400
up on shelves and
boxes in museums.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.030
And some were studied
and some were not.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:21.620
The Archaeological Resource
Protection Act also enacted

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:27.320
in 1979 to address actually some
failures of the Antiquities Act,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.980
which has a protection clause
too, but that reaffirmed some

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.150
of the permitting provisions and
again reaffirmed Federal policy

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.170
that archaeological
sites on Federal

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:43.580
and Indian land were important
resources to be preserved

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.940
and studied for the
benefit of all Americans,

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.210
again permitting excavation
work and the collections had

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.980
to go to a public museum.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.700
And so the idea in 1990 that
there are groups of people

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.740
that have a higher right than
the American public at large,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.090
and so the Native-American
Graves Protection

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.180
and Repatriation Act is a
real shift in US policy,

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.270
whereas before Interior

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.100
and other Federal agencies
would authorize the removal

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.530
in the interest of science and
education and public benefit,

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:15.970
this changes that and recognizes

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.980
that descendent communities
have their right

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.080
to control the disposition
of their ancestors

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.950
and cultural property
and the indigenous people

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.030
in the United States do, too.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.410
So that's some of the history,

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:33.930
so I wanted to give you a
few statistics for my agency,

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.560
Bureau of Land Management.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.730
On the collection side
we have inventory of more

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:43.330
than 2,100 sets of
Native-American human remains,

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:49.460
of those we determined 1,600
were culturally affiliated

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.460
with an Indian tribe,
and have repatriated just

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.530
about 1,200 of those
individuals.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.970
We have also had
countless discoveries

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.260
of Native-American human
remains on the public lands

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.390
and responded in about
50 different instances

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.040
where those individuals were
then turned over to tribes.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.820
I wanted to, you asked about
how our Division operates

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.140
and I wanted to share
a case study

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.640
which I think might
speak to that.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.470
So I'm in the Washington Office
or Washington D.C. Office

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.680
of my Bureau and there are
offices across the West,

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.930
and largely we have an
archaeologist in each

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:39.020
of our state offices who
is tasked with a variety

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.360
of roles including
NAGPRA responsibilities

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.860
for collections, and I have
the honor of working with them

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.870
and supporting them on
their day-to-day tasks.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.780
And there's a project
in particular

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:56.740
that really has affected
me in many ways,

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.350
it involves individuals and
collections from Alaska.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.980
And I'll begin with I studied
archaeology and I worked

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.540
as an archaeologist in the
private sector in the Southwest,

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.600
Arizona, New Mexico, Utah.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.900
But I learned a whole lot about
our Alaska, chasing collections

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.960
that were made by this
researcher who worked

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.430
between 1948 and 1980,
and he made 20 trips

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.420
to the Aleutian Islands.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.190
And over my 12 years working

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:34.740
on this project we have found
collections in Massachusetts,

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:41.860
Oregon, Wisconsin, Connecticut,
Michigan, Alaska, Finland.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.860
Some of those collections we
could find using a paper trail,

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.450
like permit records, others no.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:55.170
Some of the work was done
under permits, some was not.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:00.370
Most collections were made from
a singular village in a mound

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.540
that represents about
4,000 years of occupation.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.660
And I would say we published
notice of inventory completion

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:18.660
in 2008 for 222 ancestral
remains, and since then we have,

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.170
and those were the ones
that were found in Wisconsin

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.410
and Connecticut and since
then we have found many more.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.510
And we are in the process of
consolidating those collections

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.840
from multiple institutions at
the University of Alaska Museum

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.520
of the North in Fairbanks

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.560
because these collections
actually represent

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:43.030
or we might find some human
remains in one repository

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:47.120
and then looking at field notes
that we've located in archives

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.970
in another repository and marry
that up with funerary objects

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.490
that are in another repository.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:57.950
And so it really is a
puzzle to pull back together

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.170
and we've found that it's
important to go through all

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.750
of that process to make
these people whole,

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:10.340
these graves returned whole,
and it really is a long process

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.250
and I am sometimes amazed at
where we find information.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:21.490
Let's see, what else can
I tell you about this?

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:26.550
One aspect is I've read this
individual's dissertation

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:30.730
and there's a skull that's
presented in the dissertation,

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:35.300
which I thought I would find
in the University where he went

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.880
to University and
it wasn't there.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.020
So now I'm thinking
maybe he took it with him

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.970
to his first teaching post
and I'm trying to work

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.770
with that institution
to gain information

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.800
about the collections
that are there.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.690
You asked about partnerships,
and I would say that museums

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:57.130
and universities that hold
Federally controlled collections

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.440
can be wonderful
partners to collaborate

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.700
with through this
thoughtful process,

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.090
and sometimes they're not

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:10.210
and sometimes they're very
difficult to work with.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.570
And what's a challenge for
Federal agencies or mine

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:18.780
and at times is that we
don't have physical custody

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:24.700
of the collections, we may not
have much in the way of records,

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.760
all of that could be
in the institution

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.110
or in multiple institutions
and so we end

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:33.330
up relying upon museums
to share information.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.460
And yet it is our
Federal responsibility,

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:40.050
it is our responsibility
under NAGPRA to pursue

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:44.970
and complete the process
leading towards repatriation.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:52.560
I'd also say the sort of
thinking about family members,

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.490
this researcher has
since passed away

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.150
but his family members
have subsequently turned

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:03.640
in collections that he made,
and so this is really kind

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:09.970
of an incredible puzzle and I
think about this was all done

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.420
in the interest of science.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.770
And I look at how
much he published

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:20.950
and it really is hard sometimes
to reconcile the public,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:27.400
how you all have benefitted from
these 20 trips to the Aleutians

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.590
and I'm sure at some point
hundreds and hundreds

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.190
of individuals, and
what have we learned?

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.190
And a lot of these researchers
published and a lot didn't,

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.120
and so when it comes to one
of the challenges that we had

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.720
in archaeology when NAGPRA
was first enacted was, oh,

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.790
but these individuals
have so much information,

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.270
scientific information, we need

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.970
to study them before they're
returned and are lost forever.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:58.270
And when I've gone through
museums and I've seen boxes

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.790
that have been untouched

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.410
for 50 years sometimes
I frankly wonder, well,

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.900
you know, we had our chance.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:10.760
I think I might leave it
there and see where you go

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.420
with questions in
my agency's role.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.720
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Okay.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.020
Thank you.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.710
Shannon, is the Association

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.650
on American Indian
Affairs satisfied

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.870
with everything that
NAGPRA provides?

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.780
What would you like to see next?

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:32.180
That's kind of a
loaded question, sorry.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.600
&gt;&gt; Shannon Keller O'Loughlin:
What do you all think?

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.900
Thank you.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:43.400
And let me tell you a little
bit about the Association

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.310
on American Indian Affairs just
to kind of get me warmed up

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.070
and give me a chance to kind

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.640
of not be emotional
about that question.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.060
So the Association on American
Indian Affairs is the oldest

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.250
nonprofit serving
Indian country.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.420
We've been around since 1922.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.470
And I don't know how much
you know about the history

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.910
of the United States
and Indian tribes,

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:17.160
but in 1922 that was a time
when Federal policy was

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:23.640
to assimilate Indians and
assimilation took many forms.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.190
One form was boarding
schools, kidnapping children

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.700
and taking them far, far
away from their homes

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.530
and putting them
in boarding schools

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.570
where oftentimes they
suffered, they passed there,

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:43.800
they were buried in marked
graves, unmarked graves.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:49.960
Allotment was another
policy which was a process

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:55.920
by which the Federal Government
sectioned off pieces of land

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:02.280
and gave certain acreage to
individuals who were Indian

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.240
and took away communal
ownership from that tribe,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:11.240
from that particular tribe,
and that the allotment process

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.760
that went on all over the
United States took away

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.400
about nine million acres of
Indian lands at that time.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:25.040
There was also ceremonies,
language, dancing,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.270
practicing religions
and cultures,

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.530
all of these were outlawed.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.010
In those boarding schools you
couldn't speak your language,

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.650
you couldn't practice your
religions or ceremonies.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.300
And the Federal Government often
turned those boarding schools

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.600
over to religions,
Christian religions

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:50.520
to help the assimilation
process of Indian children.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.590
And during the time
in the late 1800s

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:57.840
and the early 1900s it
was very popular to loot

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:03.260
and steal our ancestors and
objects that were in the ground,

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.190
as well as our cultural
items that were part

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:15.000
of everyday practices, everyday
way of life for healing,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.920
for medicine, for identity.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:27.290
And the two reasons that
Congress studied why,

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:32.520
what were the biggest problems
with all of this came from, one,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.720
was the competition between
institutions and museums to see

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.200
who could get the most stuff

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.490
and so they would send
oftentimes archaeologists,

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:49.600
anthropologists and other people
to obtain items from tribes all

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.040
over the country and then, of
course, science and the study

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.740
of our ancestral
remains and other items

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.610
for the benefit of
the United States.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.120
And what happened was
all of these things wound

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.680
up in institutions
all over the world,

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.560
but there was also
a segment that ended

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.360
up creating the art market,
what's known as Market

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.800
of Tribal Antiquities.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.530
And one of the failings
of NAGPRA is

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.710
that it's very checkerboarded
in what it protects, it protects

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:33.410
and repatriates items that
are in Federal agencies

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:39.210
and within Federal hands, but
does not protect the same types

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.630
of items that are held

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.580
by private collections
all over the world.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.200
So some of the things
that the Association

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.300
on American Indian
Affairs is doing to kind

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:58.300
of change the direction of this
Federal policy is changing how

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.060
the public sees our
cultural items

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:06.340
and our cultural patrimony,
that these items are not

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.480
for commercial purposes,
they weren't made for sale

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.860
but are just part of the history
of looting and inequality

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.440
and the lack of human
rights, of why these items are

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.510
in private collections
and upon people's walls

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:27.190
and decorating their
homes or for sale

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.830
at auction houses
all over the country.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.490
We recently put out
a press release

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.160
with multiple national
organizations, both native

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.220
and non-native organizations,
tribes and firms

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:48.620
that do archaeological
work and universities

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:54.720
that basically tells the world
that these items are part

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.090
of our cultural practices,
they're sacred

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.730
and cultural patrimony,
they're not part

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.150
of the commercial market.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:06.290
And instead those people
that are interested

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.420
in native cultures should be
looking towards contemporary

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.380
Native-American artists
to invest in instead

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:18.840
of our cultural patrimony
and our cultural history.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.880
Now the Association was very
much involved in the passage

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:31.840
of NAGPRA and it started with
trying to move forward an agenda

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.310
about American Indian
religious freedom,

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.880
which wasn't very successful,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.910
but out of that came
the NMAI Act and NAGPRA,

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:44.320
which at that time was an
extremely successful piece

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.980
of legislation because
it was the first time

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:51.420
that Congress said that
corrective measures needed

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.120
to be taken based on the failure

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.120
to enact proper human
rights legislation,

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.170
proper civil rights legislation
to protect Native-Americans

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:07.250
and Native-Hawaiian
organizations.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:11.270
So this was the first
piece of legislation known

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.080
as human rights legislation

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.830
within the Federal
Indian Law framework.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:24.470
So at the time it was extremely
successful, and I think tribes

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:29.330
and indigenous peoples
what we thought was going

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:35.870
to happen were these wonderful
relationships with institutions

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:39.870
and working towards the
return of these items.

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.080
And that has happened with
some Federal agencies,

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.060
some Federal agencies
and some institutions,

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.070
but today it's been almost
30 years, are we on 27 now,

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:58.770
28 years after the passage of
NAGPRA and there's my fellows

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.030
at NAGPRA know the
data better than I do,

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.240
but 180,000 ancestors?

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:16.890
Under 190,000 ancestral remains
are still within institutions

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:21.670
and that's what we
know from institutions

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.100
who have actually
shared that information.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.870
There are still institutions
that are completely

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.150
out of compliance with NAGPRA.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:36.760
For example, recently there
was a city library in Maine,

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:42.700
Massachusetts -- Medford
Public Library, Massachusetts

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.120
that was getting rid of some
items and making a little money

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:51.450
for its own budget and took
its Native-American collection

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:56.880
that was gifted to them
back in the 1880s and put it

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.580
up for auction at
Skinner Auction in Boston.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.270
There was immediate uproar by
Native-American communities

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:12.350
and Medford Library and the
town of Medford quickly learned

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:15.280
about NAGPRA because that,

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.840
if the Skinner Auction would
have sold those items they could

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.220
have been held criminally
responsible

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.900
for violating NAGPRA.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:31.580
As it stands now Medford
remains potentially libel

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.650
under civil penalties for NAGPRA

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:38.550
because they have not fulfilled
their NAGPRA obligations

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:42.820
of inventorying or providing
summaries of their collections

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.070
and consulting with tribes
so that they could proceed

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.390
with repatriation efforts.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:57.210
I don't have any really nice
quote or ending piece for this,

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:05.300
but the work of the Association
is led by tribes, academics,

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.400
museums, lawyers working
together to try to push

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.410
and change the direction
of Federal policy

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.540
so that it's more protective of
our cultural heritage and part

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.910
of that is educating the
public about the importance

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:25.630
of our cultural heritage and
how it's still lacking the kind

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:31.560
of protection that is
seen in other countries.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:38.430
I'm fortunate enough to
still be an Obama appointee,

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:41.770
still fulfilling my term
in the State Department

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:44.230
in the Cultural Property
Advisory Committee,

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:47.120
which is a FACA Committee,

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.860
and this Committee oversees
the 1970 UNESCO Convention

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.750
that works with other
governments

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:02.310
to help protect their
cultural patrimony.

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:08.790
And so what the CPAC
does is help to recommend

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:15.440
to the State Department
whether the US should enter

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.000
into a memorandum of agreement

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.160
to help protect another
country's cultural patrimony

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.340
from being imported into the US.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.990
So if we see certain types
of cultural patrimony

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:33.930
from another country we let
it be known and give it back.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:37.800
But those same types of
protections aren't available

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.430
for Native-American cultural
patrimony and heritage,

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.810
and we are still working

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:50.570
on legislation called the
Safeguarding Tribal Objects

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:57.140
of Patrimony Act, it's
currently in Congress

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:06.350
and it's maybe not going to
be passed in this Congress

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.960
but we're hoping next
Congress it will.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:20.100
And what it does is it helps
remedy that one-sided mechanism

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.070
where the US is only protecting
other countries' cultural

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:28.140
patrimony, instead
it allows the US

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.830
to develop bilateral
agreements with other countries

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.610
who are market countries
for Native-American items,

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:40.480
such as Germany, France
and other parts of Europe,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.090
so that they will
protect our items

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:47.490
if they see them being
imported into their countries.

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:52.660
The Stop Act also has an
importation, I'm sorry,

00:43:52.660 --> 00:44:01.740
an exportation requirement
so when Homeland Security

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:05.910
or TSA sees certain types
of items that are going

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:09.780
to be shipped over to other
countries there would be a

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:15.070
process in place to help protect
Native-American cultural items.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:19.510
So there is movement to
expand current protections

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.850
for Native-American
cultural heritage,

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.900
but we still have a long way to
go and part of that has to do

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.850
with changing perceptions
of the antiquities market

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:35.200
and antiquities dealer who makes
a lot of money from these items.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:41.650
I was once involved in stopping
the sale of some wampum belts,

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:47.450
which many northeastern tribes
have used throughout their

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:52.220
history and are no
different than our Declaration

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.920
of Independence, it's that type
of national cultural patrimony.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.520
And some of these
wampum belts have gone

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.320
for Native-American100,000
or more, and so being able

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.000
to stop the sale of that

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.460
as you can imagine
would be quite difficult

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.340
because of the financial
interest

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:16.000
that that collector has
in a particular item.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.780
So but that's what AAIA
is doing is trying to work

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.950
with the public,
work with collectors,

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:27.910
work with auction houses to
try to find options of how

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:33.290
to return those types of
patrimony since NAGPRA

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.160
and other law may not apply.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.630
So, with that, I'll end.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:38.930
Thank you.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:40.230
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Okay.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.980
I have a couple more
prepared questions,

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:47.210
but I thought I'd go ahead
and open it up to all of you

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:53.020
to ask questions
yourselves, so anyone?

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.210
Oh, come on?

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:57.510
Back in the corner?

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:02.830
&gt;&gt; Hi, I actually
have two questions.

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:07.360
You said that you had found
some remains all the way back

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.700
in Finland, and I'm wondering
if it's harder sometimes

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.170
to get those from
other countries

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:17.370
because you have international
laws that you have to go

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.900
through as well and
they might not

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.850
since they're further removed
from the history they might,

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:25.800
I don't know if they can
grasp its importance as much?

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.220
And the my other
question is this is not

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.340
like really something that's
like new, like we have mummies

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.870
in display in museums that were
taken from the graves in Egypt

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:40.270
and other cultures who
have artifacts taken

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.740
from their burial sites
throughout the world,

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.770
is there something
that you guys do

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.810
because this is a very
self-selected group

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:51.160
to outreach the public to sort
of make that culture change

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.300
so that we can start
viewing these things

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.320
as like this is a
human, this is a body,

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.520
as opposed to like putting
it on display to study?

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.230
&gt;&gt; Emily Palus: I'll start
with the international.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.850
Thank you for picking
up on that.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:15.030
So the Finland trade is
something that I'm working on,

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:17.300
but I'll start with there's a
collection, another collection

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.040
from Alaska not associated with
the researcher I talked about,

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.320
another researcher that the
collection we discovered

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.790
in Switzerland.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:33.090
And the University or
professor took a call

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:37.400
from someone's child, adult
child, who said I'm cleaning

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:41.750
out my father's house, would
you be interested in coming over

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.810
and you can have any of
the archaeological stuff?

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:53.820
So he went over and, lo and
behold, 120 boxes of artifacts

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.820
that were actually recovered as
part of a permitted excavation,

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.260
actually I've gotten
a copy of the permit,

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.970
and were to be curated
in Fairbanks,

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:07.380
Alaska but were shipped
to Switzerland as part

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.020
of this researcher was going

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.940
to do analysis and
then return them.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.870
That must have slipped through
the cracks because that was

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:21.220
in the late 60s, early 1970s.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.640
So that collection we
learned this last year

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.050
when the professor who took
the fateful call, he went

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.530
and he salvaged the
material from this residence

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:35.790
and he has it in his lab and
is working with his students

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:41.150
to repackage it because it
was in no condition to ship,

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:45.700
and it has been a very, it's
been a wonderful collaboration.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.700
This is my first international
foray so I'm grateful

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:55.000
to have a good partner, and
we've met with State Department,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.010
Homeland Security, US
Fish and Wildlife Service,

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:04.590
and so I'm working through
those with a collaborative.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.830
We haven't fully
broached Finland yet,

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.800
the Finnish institution because
we're trying to get copies

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.950
of the loan documentation
from the museum that did.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.610
I keep calling it a loan,
it's not a loan that they did.

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:20.120
So but we get this one project

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.240
under our belts then
we'll go for the others.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.710
Now it can be complicated
because we are talking

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:29.880
about international lines, and
in some instances it's US policy

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.640
to send examples of our artwork
and historical items overseas

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.490
to spread information
about American culture.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:44.680
But for us what we will tie
back to is our domestic laws,

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.250
that these were collected
from public lands,

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:53.430
they remain Federal property
that cannot be conveyed except

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:55.520
under current law, repatriated

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.790
to culturally affiliated
Indian tribes, so.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.670
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: I think
the other question?

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.750
&gt;&gt; Shannon Keller O'Loughlin:
Well, I wanted to approach,

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:08.560
I wanted to respond to the
international question, too.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.380
Because one of the
difficulties that we have trying

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:18.750
to get collections back from
international institutions is

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:25.020
that those countries have their
own laws that often declares

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:30.600
that those things that they hold
are their national patrimony.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:35.060
So, for example, Spain
was a conquering country

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:41.500
of indigenous people and peoples
and took a lot of items back

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:47.470
to Spain, and there are items
in Spain that are now part

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:51.840
of their cultural patrimony,
even though they were looted

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.280
and stolen and taken from
the indigenous peoples here.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:01.680
So it becomes a different kind
of discussion that you have

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:07.020
with an international
government and you have to go

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.300
through their laws as well.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.040
And one thing that is
often not addressed,

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.780
even though these items
have a Federal tie,

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:22.480
they came from Federal lands,
they are part of what's kind

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.880
of considered Federal
property even though I don't

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.610
like to consider our
ancestral remains

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.370
and cultural items in that way.

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:39.900
And so they're inalienable
from the Federal Government,

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:45.820
but Native-Americans'
items which are inalienable

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:53.230
to us it is very difficult
for us to argue to collectors

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:57.080
and others that there are items
that are inalienable to us

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:03.500
and to our nations, that no one
has the authority to give away,

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.850
and the only reason why they're
in other people's hands is

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.900
through theft and
looting or some kind

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.070
of illegitimate taking.

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:20.480
So it's great that we have that
Federal tie-in with many items,

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.650
but there are still many
more where we don't have

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:28.780
that Federal tie-in and we don't
have any strong Federal law

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:30.850
that will support the argument

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:34.660
that these are our
unalienable items

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.770
that could not have been
taken except through theft.

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:43.820
But I totally missed
your second question.

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:49.840
&gt;&gt; I was just asking like
if you guys do education

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.850
or outreach programs to
sort of shift or create

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:55.600
that culture shift to where
people see these items

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.740
for what they are, like
funerary items or human remains,

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.100
and humanize them as opposed

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.860
to just looking at
them behind glass?

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:06.380
&gt;&gt; Sarah Glass: Yes, I mean we,

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:10.680
a big part of what the National
NAGPRA Program does is offer

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:16.300
training, resources, technical
assistance to museums,

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.780
but obviously since we're the
NAGPRA Program we are focused

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:24.310
on NAGPRA items, domestic
issues, but that doesn't mean

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:27.010
that we don't still try to
get involved in this kind

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:29.210
of broader culture shift

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:32.960
and this broader
application of this work.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.570
So, for example, my
boss, Melanie O'Brian,

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:38.040
who is the Manager of the
National NAGPRA Program,

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.160
actually traveled with
an interagency delegation

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.970
to France earlier this year, to
Paris to try to educate and meet

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:50.810
with government officials
there, our officials to talk

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:54.280
about why are these
Paris auctions

00:53:54.280 --> 00:54:00.470
of sacred Native-American items
such a big deal, why do we care?

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:04.280
Because there's just not
that recognition, right,

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.890
or even language,
even the translations.

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:10.890
When you say a sacred object and
that has a very specific meaning

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:15.720
under US law and to
different tribes over here,

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.620
when you say sacred in French

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.870
that doesn't necessarily
equate in the same way.

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:28.320
So, yes, we do try to do our
best to educate to the extent

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:34.300
under the law, for me at least
being restricted by that.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:39.060
When I do get calls about
people asking about mummies

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:43.280
or other kind of grave goods,
I remember being shocked

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:47.380
when I went through to Italy
and went through museums

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.330
and just saw body after body
after body from Vesuvius

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:54.390
and was kind of taken
aback by that,

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:59.410
but it's just a more normal
practice still I would say

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:01.750
in some parts of the world.

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:09.740
But here luckily with that
kind of shift in these fields,

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.350
in archaeology, I was an
archaeologist undergrad

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:18.870
and anthropologist and
museum studies, you know,

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.770
that's the new guard
I think moving

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:25.270
in to start shifting our
perceptions of that and not just

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.280
because NAGPRA says you have to,

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.140
but because this is what's
the right thing to do as well.

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:36.880
So I think that's the direction
that most people, not everyone,

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.870
but most people are
tending towards.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:42.590
Maybe I'm optimistic.

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:45.570
&gt;&gt; Emily Palus: If I could,
I want to touch on this, too,

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:48.410
because I think a lot of
it comes down to consent,

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.560
consent of the descendent
community

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.010
and what is a cultural norm.

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:58.400
And so what's so pivotal about
NAGPRA is that it describes

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.950
that while the Federal
Government actually had this

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:04.640
policy of excavating and
study and display was

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.650
in the public interest
and then reversed

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:09.830
that because recognizing
that Indian people,

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:13.020
Native-American people have the
right to control the disposition

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:19.780
of their ancestors and not
the 500 and plus tribes

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.610
in Native-Alaskan communities,

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:24.660
not everyone has the
exact same world view.

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:28.250
And there are some tribes
that will take remains

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.140
and rebury them on their
lands, there are some tribes

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.760
that will take remains
and rebury them as close

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.530
to the original interment as
possible, there are some tribes

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:37.670
that allow study,
there are some tribes

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:40.500
that allow intrusive
study, it's their consent

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.600
and I think what it
comes down to is consent.

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.850
But I agree that sometimes it's
sort of shocking when you walk

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.440
into a museum and see
human remains everywhere.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:54.220
I was doing a behind-the-scenes
tour, a repository review

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.640
of an institution that
held Federal collections,

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.000
and we walked into the
physical anthropology labs,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.250
physical anthropology
human remains.

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:08.050
And the curator opened
up these wardrobe doors

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:13.290
and there was just shelves
of skulls, and I fell back

00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:17.960
because I, well, one, I didn't
know that was coming and even

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.570
if I'm not a Native-American I
think a little heads-up would

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:25.410
have been, excuse me, a little
warning that that would have,

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:28.830
yes, that this was happening.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:35.500
And then there was a gasp,
one of my colleagues gasped.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.710
And she said, oh, no, no,
it's okay, they're from Peru,

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:44.560
they're not subject to
NAGPRA so it's okay.

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.990
And then also actually
the same institution,

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:52.580
and now the story I'm telling
is about from 15 years ago,

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.510
they've changed course
dramatically,

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:58.060
but there was a display of --

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:01.000
you push the button so it's
interactive, you push the button

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.460
and this woman on the
phone says, hello, hello,

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:05.600
I found something in my garage.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.790
And the story is that this
woman went into her garage

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:12.080
and there was a box and she
opened up the box and, well,

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.230
there was mummified, naturally
mummified human remains.

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:19.090
And the story was that her
husband or his friends had gone

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:21.640
over to Mexico and
brought them back.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:26.410
I'm not sure how they ended up
at this museum, but the story

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:29.650
and how it was presented was
this kind of, oh, my gosh,

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.830
this woman walked into her
garage and found this box

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:34.300
with mummified remains in it.

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:38.150
And, no, that kind of display,
that actually was sensational,

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:40.520
but that's just not appropriate.

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.600
And I think that that
story is changing.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.230
I guess the last thing I
would say is I'm grateful

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.970
for this opportunity to come
here and talk to this group

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:52.720
about this statute with
my esteemed colleagues.

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.020
&gt;&gt; Shannon Keller
O'Loughlin: Thanks.

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.100
And to talk a little bit
about public education

00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:00.550
and what opportunities there
are for you all, the Association

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:05.390
on American Indian Affairs
is a membership nonprofit

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:09.630
organization and
anyone can be a member

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:13.330
if you pay Native-American35,

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:16.170
which is actually very
powerful for the work we do.

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.790
We do a lot of national
public education and advocacy,

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:22.320
as well as grassroots
work on the ground

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.310
with tribes implementing
programs on the ground.

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:32.360
So having membership that's
representative of all of us

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.090
in the United States I think
really tells a strong story

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:38.900
about some of the
issues and the programs

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.800
and the education we're trying
to do, that we're backed

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:45.280
by a diverse community
of individuals,

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:50.430
not just indigenous
Americans but everyone.

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:53.580
So I encourage you to
participate in some

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.420
of the programs the
Association has.

00:59:55.420 --> 01:00:01.180
We just got done with a
Repatriation Conference

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.530
where there were
tribal practitioners,

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:09.580
spiritual leaders, museum
curators, foreign institutions,

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:16.300
lawyers and a variety of
people working together

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:21.640
to find ways towards more
success in repatriation efforts,

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.800
not just with NAGPRA but also
those things that fall outside

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.800
of NAGPRA or in foreign
institutions.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.060
So there are opportunities
to be educated

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.390
and I think there's a lot
in the media right now,

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:41.450
so if you search auctions,
Native-American cultural items,

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:44.930
if you look on the Association's
website you're going

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.460
to find a lot of
information available for you.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.580
&gt;&gt; Sarah Glass: Yes, it is
becoming more well known

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:56.030
for sure, these issues
are getting attention now

01:00:56.030 --> 01:01:00.970
like never before, so
that's a positive thing.

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:03.450
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: The sad
thing to me is that it wasn't

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:09.950
until 1990, wow,
yikes, that's terrible.

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.910
Anyone else?

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:15.690
Oh, come on?

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:26.270
&gt;&gt; So you said that the NAGPRA
Program is an imperfect law,

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:30.020
are there other countries
that are doing it right

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:34.080
or have it a little bit closer,
that you kind of hold as, oh,

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.890
this is how they're doing it,
like maybe we can take things

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:41.800
from them, or are we like doing
the best we can and we're kind

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:46.240
of at the end, you
know, beginning of it?

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.280
&gt;&gt; Sarah Glass: That's a good
question, it's a great question.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:54.340
Yes, it just, so it's
been almost 30 years

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.300
since NAGPRA was passed and
I think it's safe to say

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:01.670
that no one that was drafting
NAGPRA 30 years ago really

01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:06.900
thought that this work was
still going to be going on now

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.280
in the way that it has.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.560
And, as we've mentioned, the
statistics are still kind

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.400
of mindboggling about just
how much is still left to do.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.920
And there's gaps, as
we've pointed out.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.500
So there are other countries
that have laws in place

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.120
to address these
similar types of issues.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.280
Australia being one of
them, New Zealand, Canada.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:39.270
So other countries that
have these kind of histories

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:45.500
of indigenous populations,
imperialistic people moving in,

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:50.660
power imbalances that are
inherent in then the power,

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.510
the country that takes power.

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:56.680
I don't -- maybe
someone else can speak

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.940
to if they're doing any better
than what NAGPRA is doing,

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:07.970
but I know that often
this is used as an example

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:13.800
of how you can at least try
to shift that power imbalance

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:22.130
and try to start doing that
work of righting past wrongs.

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:26.950
I know another international
kind of outreach thing

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:30.500
that the National NAGPRA Program
did, we actually sent staff

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:37.550
to Japan because they have a
very strong centralized program

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:40.870
for acknowledging and
putting out a list

01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:42.750
of their national treasures,

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:48.750
things that they consider
national cultural treasures

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:53.850
from dance to art, to
all sorts of things.

01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:56.980
And so that was a kind

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:59.830
of cross-cultural
learning experience about,

01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:01.130
oh, how do you do it?

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.130
And it really just comes down
to every country is different,

01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:06.920
every situation is different.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.870
The United States has
such strong protections

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:16.320
of personal property and that
property law that can get

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.330
so gray sometimes
or so hard to fight

01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:23.470
when it's private property,

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:26.300
and I don't ever see the
United States saying, yes,

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.480
we're going to take
your private property

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.700
because it's the
right thing to do.

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.410
But, sorry, I rambled there.

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:40.440
&gt;&gt; Shannon Keller O'Loughlin:
Well, I'm looking for a day

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:44.730
that we will have
some kind of mechanism

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:49.000
to allow the taking
of stolen property.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.160
And, as I said earlier, most
of the cultural patrimony

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.550
and sacred patrimony
and funerary items

01:04:56.550 --> 01:05:00.300
and human remains were
taken illegitimately

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.800
because they could be
considered inalienable

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.380
from those nations,
from those tribes.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.750
NAGPRA really is I hate
to say the gold standard,

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:18.120
but it is really the best
out there for a process

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.120
by which indigenous peoples can
have the items repatriated back

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.500
to them.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.560
Other countries are much better

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.810
at protecting their
national heritage than we are

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:33.210
and don't checkerboard
the protections

01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:35.330
up like the United
States does because of

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:40.680
that private property
type of mentality

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.680
that we have here in the US.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.630
So in other countries
you see mechanisms

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:50.030
by which all land is
protected so no one can go in

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:54.500
and start digging and all of
a sudden declare ownership

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:58.160
of that human burial
or of those items

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.270
that they found in the ground.

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:05.350
And it's not like that here and
what's even more interesting is

01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:06.920
that we do have Federal law

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.540
in the United States
that's highly prohibitive

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:16.080
of the same type of private
property issue when it comes

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.210
to endangered species
and collecting

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:25.820
or selling endangered species,
such as the Golden Eagle

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.010
and Bald Eagle Protection Act.

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:34.950
So if I'm standing at my house
and a Bald Eagle dies and falls

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:40.330
in front of me I have absolutely
no rights to that animal

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:46.340
or parts of that animal, I have
to call someone to take it.

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:54.470
But if I find something in my
land, if I find amazing pottery

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:59.120
or even human remains
depending on what state I live

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.970
in there may be no other laws

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:08.170
that protect the affiliated
tribe's rights to those things

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:14.090
and I can start my own museum
in my garage with what I find

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:16.630
in my own, on my own
private property.

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:20.060
So there's a little bit
of disparate thinking,

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:23.410
unconnected thinking when
we're looking at protection

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:29.360
of Native-American cultural
heritage and it really goes back

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:38.170
into how our Federal laws
apply to indigenous peoples,

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:44.230
which is based on this kind of
schizophrenic notion that tribes

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:46.360
and Indian peoples are sovereign

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.850
but at the same time
they're inferior.

01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:50.430
And so depending on the whims

01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:55.870
of the current Administration
oftentimes our Federal policies

01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:59.790
protecting Native-Americans and
Native-American heritage kind

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:04.960
of wings one way or the other
because our Federal laws are

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.900
so schizophrenic when protecting
indigenous peoples here.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:19.820
&gt;&gt; Hi, I really don't have a
question, but I just wanted

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:24.860
to kind of piggyback a comment
in response to that question.

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:28.750
So I'm the Interim Director
of the National Association

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:31.120
of Tribal Historic
Preservation Officers.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.820
Prior to, I was the Tribal
Historic Preservation Officer

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:38.040
for my tribe in Lac du
Flambeau, Wisconsin.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.740
I started under a NAGPRA
grant, not knowing anything

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:47.430
about NAGPRA, never even knew
that my ancestor remains were

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.210
in museums and other
institutions,

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:51.880
so it's been an incredible
education

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.100
that I've had since
the year 2000.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:59.930
What I have seen in that
time thanks to NAGPRA a lot

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:01.640
of ancestors are returning home,

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.500
a lot of their belongings
are returning home,

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.530
and that's been phenomenal.

01:09:07.530 --> 01:09:11.660
What I've also seen in my own
community is we are beefing

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.760
up our travel codes
and ordinances

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.010
to protect our ancestral
remains and resting places,

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:20.400
but also the states,
I'm starting

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.900
to see more states take that on.

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:26.840
Wisconsin just passed a revised
Burial Sites Preservation Law

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.520
that protects burials,
categorized, or catalogued

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.750
or uncatalogued, and it actually
empowered our inter-tribal

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.210
repatriation community
in Wisconsin

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:44.860
when ancestral remains are
discovered during certain

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:47.390
projects, excavations,
whether it's on private land

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:50.640
or public land it is left

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.710
up to the inter-tribal
repatriation committee

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:56.680
to determine disposition
of those human remains,

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.580
where they're going to
be repatriated, buried,

01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:59.900
what happens with them.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.650
So on top of what we have
Federally we're starting

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:08.510
to see tribes and states take
a more proactive approach

01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:12.100
in beefing up their
laws to prohibit

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.200
and protect ancestral
burial remains.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.500
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Okay.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:28.490
I think it's time to
begin our closing.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.970
I'd like to thank
everyone involved

01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:33.090
in making this Panel possible.

01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:36.670
Shannon, Emily and
Sarah, thank you so much

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:38.280
for joining us this evening.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.840
Thank you, all, for
spending your evening with us

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.500
and celebrating the
70th Anniversary

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.800
of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.150
We've come a long way since the
adoption of the Declaration,

01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:55.010
but we must also acknowledge
that we have not lived

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:57.130
up to its full vision.

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:00.500
So as we celebrate
tonight we must also commit

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:05.450
to working harder to make the
Declaration's ideal a reality

01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:07.210
in people's lives.

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:10.870
We must support the work
of human rights defenders,

01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:15.880
nongovernmental organizations,
experts, policymakers,

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:22.040
journalists and all peoples of
conscience, and we must continue

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.540
until the timeless and
universal principles

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:29.650
in the Declaration become
not just an inspiration

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:33.560
or an aspiration but the
foundation of life for all

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.820
of the world's people.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.620
Thank you, once again, and
have a great evening, everyone.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:40.920
Thank you.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.000
[applause]
