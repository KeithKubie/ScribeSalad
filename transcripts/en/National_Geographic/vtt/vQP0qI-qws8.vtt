00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.867
While I was living
in India,

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:03.903
the biggest door of my
career opened.

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:07.139
 I pitched a story to
<i> National Geographic,</i>

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.276 line:0%
and it was to go and tell the
story about the last,

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:13.913 line:0%
hand-pulled rickshaw pullers.
Who were living in Calcutta.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.016
Word was that they were going
to ban the whole

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.751
mode of transportation there.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:23.189
So, they accepted my proposal.
Off I went.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.991
Get to Calcutta.

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.694
Great! I've got my first
big assignment.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:29.928
Guess what?

00:00:29.928 --> 00:00:31.331
All the rickshaw pullers said,

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.200
"No thank you. We don't want
our pictures taken."

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.903
And that's the truth, you know,
I think a lot of people think,

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:39.773
 Oh, if you work for
<i> National Geographic,</i>

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:41.741
the doors just come
flying open.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.676
Nope, not always the case.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.478
So I'm thinking,
"What do I do?"

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:47.914
I've got to get access,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.383
and that is the secret
of great photography,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.085
is just getting access.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.488
<i>So, I found the leader of the
 rickshaw union.</i>

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.891
His name was, Subir. I told him
why I wanted to tell this story.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.594
And he started introducing
me to people.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.231
<i>And I also would take portraits
 of these men,</i>

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:09.536
<i>and go to a one-hour photo
 place, get them printed,</i>

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.006
<i> and run around Calcutta,
 giving them pictures.</i>

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.575
And you know, to these men,
they've never had--

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.810
some of them didn't
even have shoes,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.080
and so to have a portrait was
really something

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.649
<i>for them to hang up in these
 small quarters,</i>

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.285
<i>was really meaningful to them.</i>

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:29.155
And it took time and patience,
and slowly,

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:33.259
they started opening up,
and sharing their lives with me.
