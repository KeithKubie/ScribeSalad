economic crisis. I think it's going to be

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.690
the emerging consumers, the emerging middle
class of China through greater economic equality

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.890
driven by greater access to financial services
that's going to create a stable growth environment

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.970
that indeed is going to a huge driver of growth
during the next years, pulling out of the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.599
crisis and then beyond that. At least that
is my sincere hope.
