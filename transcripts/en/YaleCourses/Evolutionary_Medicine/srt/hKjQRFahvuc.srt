1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,490
We now begin chapter two which asks
the question, what does a patient,

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,530
it's a very interesting question.

3
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:10,220
We're going to look for answers
from a number of different angles.

4
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:14,330
The first of which is the
ancient history of patients.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,050
We've all evolved events that happened
long ago continue to have consequences

6
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:23,570
for medicine.
Here are a few of them.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,880
Asymmetric division is something that
happened in bacterial cells more than 3

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,110
billion years ago and that created the
condition for the evolution of aging and

9
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:37,690
probably also for the
maintenance of the germline.

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:39,670
Yeah,

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,530
stem cells are a great idea.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,560
They evolve to repair a multicellular
organisms when multicellularity originated

13
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:51,070
sometime between one and 2
billion years ago. However,

14
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:53,230
they are pre adapted
to become cancer cells.

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,900
They contain some of our
vulnerability to cancer.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,100
Retro viruses inserted into a protal
immunoglobulin gene about half a billion

17
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:06,100
years ago,
500 million years ago,

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,600
and that started the evolution of
the Vertebra adaptive immune system.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Highly invasive placentas evolved in
the shared ancestor of Orangutans,

20
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,380
gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans
about 15 million years ago.

21
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,320
They are associated with Preeclampsia,

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,300
which is dangerously high maternal blood
pressure during pregnancy and with the

23
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,710
risk of metastatic cancer.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
So you can see that events occurring
between 3 billion years ago and 15 million

25
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,230
years ago continue to have
implications for medicine.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,110
So let's begin to unpack these.

27
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:46,680
We're going to return to
these events in more detail.

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,840
When we discuss aging cancer,

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,880
adaptive immunity and parent offspring
conflicts over parental investment.

30
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,730
So first asymmetric division. This is
the condition for the evolution of aging.

31
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,990
The idea is that if in division one cell
can be given the newer parts and the

32
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:10,120
other cell of the older parts,

33
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,830
the cell lineage with the older parts
will die out and the cell lineage with the

34
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,240
newer parts will persist.

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,950
This mechanism has been confirmed in a
bacterium eco lie that appears to divide

36
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:24,941
symmetrically.

37
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:29,560
It turns out it does not and it can
explain the survival of the germ lines is

38
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,670
the origin of life.

39
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:32,780
Yeah.

40
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,300
If division we're perfectly symmetrical,

41
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,740
then it would be impossible for selection
to distinguish between the mother and

42
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:41,570
the daughter cell.
They would both look identical.

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Both would be equally intact or equally
damaged and the reproductive payoff from

44
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,430
improving the maintenance of
both would be equal. However,

45
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:57,320
as soon as the reproductive payoff of
maintenance becomes smaller in the mother

46
00:02:57,321 --> 00:03:00,010
cell than in the daughter,
the mother reproduced,

47
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,810
the daughter has not yet reproduced.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,010
The mother has the older parts of the
daughter has the newer parts than aging

49
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,610
will evolve as a cost of
reproductive performance,

50
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,090
so selection will improve the cell
that has more payoff in terms of future

51
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,254
reproduction.

52
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,080
Yeah.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,820
Let's take a look at this in eco lie.

54
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:24,330
Here you can see the old
poles on the cell are in red.

55
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:28,140
The new polls are in blue as
it goes through cell division.

56
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,760
This becomes an old pole sell.
This becomes a new poll sell.

57
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,660
This sequence here leads to a new
poll sell for at least two divisions.

58
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,630
This one has been an old pool
sell for at least two divisions,

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,890
and if we follow this through, you can
see a sequence of divisions over here.

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,910
These are how long
those lineages survived.

61
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:54,720
You can see there's variation
building up on the x axis.

62
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:58,620
Here we have the consecutive number
of old or new poll cell divisions.

63
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,600
On the y axis we have the normalized
growth rate and you can see that the ones

64
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:08,601
with the new polls are growing faster
than the ones with the old poles and their

65
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,150
advantage is getting larger and larger.

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,180
The ones with the old Poles are
diverging and dying off faster.

67
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,430
The more old poles accumulate.

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,560
The second ancient vulnerability
in patients is stem cells.

69
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,860
Stem cells originated with
multicellularity there a great innovation,

70
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,130
but they have characteristics
that predispose them to cancer.

71
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,260
They retain the potential to
differentiate and move that adapts them,

72
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,630
pre adapts them to a cancerous lifestyle.

73
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,090
Yeah,

74
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,630
there are stem cells that are all over
the body that are positioned to replace

75
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:55,980
cells that were out in our discarded
it, particularly in bone marrow, lungs,

76
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:57,750
intestine and skin.

77
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,150
Those are the tissues in which
malignant cancer is most frequent.

78
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,390
The next ancient innovation that continues
to have medical consequences is the

79
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,260
evolution of the immune system.

80
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,990
Adaptive immunity was acquired
about 500 million years ago.

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Here is a portion of the tree of
life showing the vertebrates up here.

82
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,770
And this is the transition between
Cephalic chordates and ag Nathans.

83
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,310
So these would be lampreys
and hagfish and stuff.

84
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,330
Little coordinates are lancets
and fee oxys, things like that.

85
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,060
And at this point,

86
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,200
a virus inserted itself into

87
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,820
a protocol immunoglobulin gene and it
brought with it transpose on machinery and

88
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,610
that is what allows lymphocytes to
generate diverse antigen receptors to

89
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:03,050
recognize and to repel antigens.
So that didn't come fully formed.

90
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,760
It required subsequent evolution.

91
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,850
But it's interesting that we got part
of our ability to resist viruses from

92
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,160
essentially a virus and transpose them.

93
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:13,870
Okay.

94
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,730
So the adaptive immune system evolved
at that point with the invasion of a

95
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:23,470
transposable genetic element.
This is the transposable genetic element.

96
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,870
This is the immunoglobulin gene here,

97
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,420
the transpose ace gene inserted into
the middle of that immunoglobulin gene.

98
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,930
It can be recognized by the fact that we
can see this particular sequence in the

99
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:42,730
receptor gene and the transpose ace
jeans are now on separate chromosomes.

100
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:46,870
So they're called rag one and rag two
subsequent evolution has moved them to a

101
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:47,800
separate chromosome.

102
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,140
So that event built into the gene,

103
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:55,440
the machinery that's needed to carry
out the somatic recombination that

104
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,150
generates antibody diversity.

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,630
We will be going into that in some
detail when we come to our discussion of

106
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:01,464
defenses.

107
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,210
Okay.

108
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:09,210
The next ancient event about 15 million
years ago occurred when highly invasive

109
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:10,870
placentas evolved.

110
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:15,871
In the great apes here you
can see a phylogenetic tree
focusing just on the home

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,120
and humidity and it shows that we are
most closely related to chimpanzees and

112
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,800
gorillas and then next to
orangutans and the givens.

113
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,640
And we know that in the givens out
here they have shallow invasion of the

114
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,400
endometrium. So when the fetal
cells are forming the placenta,

115
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,110
they do not go as deep into
the endometrium and givens
as they do in the other

116
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:49,111
great apes and there's minimal remodeling
of the spiral arteries and givens and

117
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:53,110
there's extensive spiral artery
remodeling in the rest of the great apes.

118
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,280
So this deep extra villous trophoblast
invasion and the extensive spiral artery

119
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:04,831
remodeling that evolved there gives much
greater control over the maternal blood

120
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,570
supply by the fetus.

121
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,290
You can see here fetal tissue
invading into the endometrium.

122
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,860
There is a spiral arteries are coming
in here and they are being remodeled by

123
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,790
stem cells from the fetus that can
actually go in and control part of the

124
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:26,110
diameter of the spiral artery.

125
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,023
Yeah,

126
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,030
so when a field stem cell is invading the
intermediary and inserting itself into

127
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,140
a maternal spiral artery,

128
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,980
it is taking partial control of the pipe.

129
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,580
Who's diameter determines the
amount of food that the fetus gets?

130
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,040
Yeah,

131
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,310
that's a morphological example.
With parados spring conflict,

132
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,790
it gives the fetus and advantage early
in life that it pays for with increased

133
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,660
risk of metastatic cancer later in life.

134
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,683
Okay.

135
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,190
Here is the age of some of the
major features of human biology.

136
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:09,720
In the purpose of this slide is to show
you the different parts of our body

137
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,930
evolved at very different points in time.

138
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,740
We are a mosaic of features
of very different ages,

139
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,010
so metabolism is almost
4 billion years old.

140
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,020
Multicellularity about a billion or
vertebrate adaptive immune system,

141
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,250
about half a billion.

142
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,700
The placenta is about 190 million years
old by Pete Elysium is about 7 million

143
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:38,541
years old and are hairless
skin are dark skin color,

144
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:42,510
and our abundance sweat glands
are two to 3 million years old.

145
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,000
So the take home from this is that we
are a mosaic of parts with very different

146
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,834
ages.

147
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,490
Our own history contains quite a bit of
complexity since we split off from the

148
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:57,930
chimpanzees.

149
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,600
The early hominids included Sahel
anthropics probably already by peatal 7

150
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,433
million years ago.

151
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,750
Australopithecines they flourished between
about four and a half and two and a

152
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:13,410
half million years ago whereby
peatal they had smaller brains,

153
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,080
they probably were frugivorous ate fruit,

154
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,680
at least four species are known
Australopithecus gave rise to and then

155
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,980
overlapped with pair
Anthropicene. That was about, oh,

156
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:27,600
from three to 1 million years ago,

157
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:31,470
roughly several species of per
anthropics in homo coexisted.

158
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:35,850
So there were times in our recent
history when there were several hominids

159
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,210
living at the same time and interacting
with each other on the planet.

160
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,060
Homo habilis use tools two and a half
to one and a half million years ago,

161
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,150
and homo erectus migrated out of Africa.

162
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:52,290
So there was a hominid
species that migrated out of
Africa before homo sapiens.

163
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,100
It colonized Asia and Europe.
It used fire,

164
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,050
it cooked it haunted and scavenged.

165
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,740
It was also cannibalistic hand axes from
homo erectus have been found in Spain

166
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,570
from about 800,000 years ago.

167
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,380
Homo sapiens evolved in Africa,

168
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
emerged from Africa about a
hundred thousand years ago,

169
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,600
paused in the Middle East for 30 to 50,000
years and then spread out into Asia.

170
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,480
And Europe will go into
this in more detail

171
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,210
in Europe and Asia.

172
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:30,070
We hybridized with neanderthals and
Denisovans and we may have hybridized with

173
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:33,640
unknown hominids in Africa within
the last hundred thousand years.

174
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,240
So we can trace that in our genomes and
we can see that people who have been in

175
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:44,581
Europe have neanderthal genes and
people who remained in Africa do not.

176
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,823
Okay.

177
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,780
So to summarize,
every organism and tree has a history.

178
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,010
Treats have different ages of origin.

179
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,810
Organisms are mosaics of parts that have
existed for different amounts of time.

180
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,100
That has implications for their evolution.
The older the trade,

181
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,700
the harder it probably is to change it.
That's not an absolute,

182
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,490
but it is a tendency,
a trend,

183
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,060
things that can only evolve slowly,

184
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,120
do constrain things that
can evolve more rapidly.

185
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,250
So the old thing set up a framework that
constrains the further evolution of the

186
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,250
more recent, uh, parts of the body.

187
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,490
Some traits of medical significance
are millions or billions of years old.

188
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,320
And every part of the organism and its
history is interacting with many of the

189
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,384
other parts.

190
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,480
So you have to see us as a dynamic
organism existing with a framework of

191
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,760
constraints,
some of which are very ancient.
