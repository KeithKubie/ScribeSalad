00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.990
These days there can be so much happening
in a movie that it takes a few passes to soak

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.080
everything in.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.870
Often we notice something out of the corner
of our eye but before we can fully realize

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900
what it is, the scene changes.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.110
And in these moments, the pause button is
a real blessing.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.880
Other times though, the practice is used for
more, ahem, “educational” reasons.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.570
Before we hop into the list we wanted to thank
you for watching, and invite you to check

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:47.690
Here are 10 Paused Scenes That Take Movies
To Another Level.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.370
Fight Club
There are a few ‘blink and you’ll miss

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.780
it’ moments scattered throughout Fight Club,
so it’s best to keep your eyes peeled.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.500
Brad Pitt’s character Tyler is introduced,
among other things, as someone who splices

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.010
frames of porn into family movies.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.970
But he’s not the only one doing some crafty
editing.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.299
Director David Fincher made strategic edits
of his own, and those watching closely will

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.960
see a brief flash of Tyler in the background
of four scenes.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.020
It’s so subtle that each time it happens
you’ll wonder if you ever saw anything at

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.329
all.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.100
Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Admit it: you knew this was coming.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.340
If getting out of the pool was an Olympic
sport, Phoebe Cates would take gold every

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.039
time.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.409
Easily the most recognizable, Fast Times at
Ridgemont High gave the world a movie cliché

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.889
that’s been used countless times since.

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:38.740
Cates and the infamous red bikini have been
turning heads since the movies release in

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.740
1982.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.689
The scene featured heavily in the trailer,
and it doesn’t take a marketing degree to

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.219
understand why.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.639
Even though the sequence ends rather traumatically
for one of the characters, the audience can’t

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:51.319
look away.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.829
Scanners
David Cronenberg’s 1981 psychic thriller

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.270
Scanners takes a look at what could happen
if telepathists waged war on each other.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.729
Not only can these groups read minds, they
can control them too.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.659
With an ability known as “scanning,” the
characters could make someone’s head explode

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.659
if they wanted to.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.649
And luckily for the audience, that’s exactly
what happens.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.209
The FX department filled a hollow gelatin
replica of the actor’s head with fake blood,

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.269
chunks, and the food scraps from the day’s
lunch.

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.939
For the iconic take, the team used a shotgun
and blasted the replica from below to create

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.180
the messy, bloody explosion the movie is so
famous for.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.470
Basic Instinct
After the release of Basic Instinct, Sharon

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.250
Stone became a household name.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.990
Her masterful portrayal of crime novelist
slash murderer, Catherine, stood out for lots

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.990
of reasons.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.690
Chief among them is one of the sexiest moments
in Silver Screen history: the leg cross.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.840
During an interrogation, Stone seems to flash
her goods at the committee.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.290
Several actresses passed on the role before
she was cast- and this scene might have had

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.519
something to do with it.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.250
But, as per usual, Stone made it her own,
and has been cast in countless sexy roles

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.250
since.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.629
Including a 2006 sequel cleverly named Basic
Instinct 2.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.019
Iron Man
When the MCU was just a baby, nobody could

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.709
have predicted it would grow up to be a herculean
cinematic institution.

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.230
Despite a loyal comic book fanbase, critics
were skeptical about wether or not audiences

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.480
would get behind versions of Marvel characters
on the big screen.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.319
And then Iron Man happened.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.120
The silver-tongued Stark slithered his way
into our hearts, and made room for a new team

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.120
of heroes.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.719
Eagle-eyed viewers got a glimpse into the
future when they noticed part of what looks

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.800
like Captain America’s shield in the background
of a scene.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.900
Sometimes paying attention is worth it.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.610
Total Recall
For many people, the only thing better than

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.510
two boobs, is three boobs.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.790
And if that sounds like it might be your jam,
check out the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger classic

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.409
Total Recall.

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.129
The triple-breasted mutant Mary was played
by actress Lycia Naff, who spent eight hours

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.389
in the makeup chair every single morning.

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.920
The prosthetic extended from neck to hips
and gave the actress an otherworldly appearance

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.859
that still sends viewers scrambling for the
remote.

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.930
Others argue the character’s depiction is
just another classic case of Hollywood setting

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.109
unrealistic body standards for young women.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.310
Boogie Nights
Boogie Nights is famous for one scene and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.740
one scene only.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.360
And you’ll know it when you see it.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.680
When Mark Wahlberg signed on for the movie,
he knew there would be some degree of nudity

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680
involved.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.810
After all, it’s a movie about porn.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.450
But the actor wanted to keep some things private.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.880
That wasn’t a problem since there are entire
departments devoted to protecting a performer’s

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.880
dignity.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.350
Tricky camera angles, body doubles, and prosthetics
are all ways to maintain the illusion of nudity

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.350
on a shoot.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.480
Wahlberg was so impressed with his particular
prop that he stole it once shooting wrapped.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.690
The Lion King
When it comes to Disney, tales of devious

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.010
animators permeate almost every conspiracy
theory.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.890
Accusations of subliminal messaging and brainwashed
youth, however far flung, have made even the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.700
most casual bystanders raise an eyebrow.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.730
One scene in 1994’s The Lion King added
fuel to the fire.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.220
As Simba lays down on the edge of a cliff,
he kicks up some dust that dissolves in the

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.220
air.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.470
At least, that’s what it looks like to most
people.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.140
Others argue that the animators intentionally
wrote a naughty word in the sky.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.450
But we’ll let you be the judge on this one.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.920
The Wolf of Wall Street
Before she became a member of the Suicide

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.130
Squad, Margot Robbie was mixing it up with
a different breed of criminal: The Wolf of

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.130
Wall Street.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.720
As Naomi, the actress works opposite Leonardo
DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort and wreaks her

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.780
own kind of havoc on his life.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.180
When the man who has everything encounters
Naomi, she refuses to let herself get wrapped

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.530
around his little finger.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.290
The character is insanely sexy, has no qualms
about letting her appearance do the talking.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.830
And as a result, there are a couple of scenes
that are far more likely to get put on pause

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.470
than others.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.410
Wild Things
After its release in 1998, Wild Things made

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.770
a big splash with audiences.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.970
And in a roundabout way, you could say it’s
because of the character… development.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.110
Some critics say that if it weren’t for
all the boobies, the movie would have been

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.110
a total flop.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.100
And in reality, there are a lot of things
you can say that about.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.330
While the sexy interactions may seem tame
by today’s standards, the film caused lot

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.150
of controversy at the time.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.600
Constant rewinding and pausing can take its
toll on a VHS tape, and we’re willing to

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.090
bet that there are more than a few broken
copies of this flick laying around.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.610
How many of these scenes are you guilty of
obsessing over?
