00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.010
Remember that double rainbow guy?

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:10.320
Can you imagine his reaction if he’d seen
A HUNDRED MORE RAINBOWS???

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.480
Hello visionaries, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.789
Your senses are an illusion; they’re all
just ways your brain interprets your environment

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.949
and they leave a lot out.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.000
Like radio waves are basically the same thing
as visible light, they’re just so stretched

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.539
out you can’t see them.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.189
But you can tune in to a radio station and
know they’re there.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.279
But what about invisible information in between
what you can see?

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.270
Could there be more to sense hiding in plain
sight?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.270
Absolutely.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.090
Most people can see about a million colors.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.900
This is because inside of the typical human
eye there are three types of cones that are

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.160
sensitive to red, green, and blue wavelengths
of light.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.810
And each can differentiate about 100 shades.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.100
Which can be mixed and matched.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.550
So 1003 means there are a million possibilities.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.690
This is why tv and computer screens use mosaics
of red, green and blue lights to display images.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.570
Digital cameras detect varying levels of red,
green, and blue light when you take a picture.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.080
It’s technology designed around our biology.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.400
Well, Most people’s biology, not all.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.750
Some people have a genetic mutation which
renders one cone inoperative, making them

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.780
dichromatic instead of trichromatic, or what
we would call colorblind.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.970
Usually these people are men, because the
genes for cones are carried on the x chromosome,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.930
so colorblind men would need just one mutated
x chromosome while colorblind women would

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.360
need to get two.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.870
So if it’s possible to effectively have
two functioning cones and only see 10,000

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.770
colors, is it also possible to have four different
cones and be able to see 100 million?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.510
That’s what Newcastle University neuroscientist
Gabriele Jordan had been searching for for

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.780
decades, and in 2010 she finally found one.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.070
Jordan was testing women who have colorblind
sons, the rationale being the sons must have

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.950
inherited a mutated x chromosome from their
mothers.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.180
So the women must have two different x chromosomes
and therefore four cones in their eyes.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.280
The women looked at three colored circles
that to most people would look identical,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.740
but one had just a little red or green mixed
in that would only be visible to someone with

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.220
four active cones.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.360
And out of the 24 women who took the test,
only one got every single question right.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.360
So it’s rare.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.479
It’s estimated only about 1% of people have
a fourth cone, and even then many don’t

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.540
seem to use it.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.740
And even when they do, how can they communicate
what they see to us three-coned non-superhumans?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.920
It’s the classic “what if my red is different
than your red but we can’t tell?”

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.670
question all over again.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.510
So why are tetrachromats who can actually
use their powers so rare?

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.160
The precise reason is still a mystery.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.370
According to Jameson it may come down to learning
to use that extra cone, informally called

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.550
the Yellow cone.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.300
It could be that even though some people have
four cones, their brains are adapted for the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.870
usual three, and taking advantage of those
extra hues comes with repetition that makes

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.810
the brain rewire itself.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.660
Or maybe they just don’t notice the extra
colors because no one else is mentioning them.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.520
Jameson also notes that the difference between
a tetrachromat’s vision and a trichromat’s

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.569
is not as dramatic as the difference between
a trichromat’s and a dichromat’s.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.880
If you are a dichromat, don’t feel left
out.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.540
Tons of animals are right there with you.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.330
Dogs are dichromats too and it’s a myth
that they see black and white.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.770
For more cool info on how your eye sees colors,
Julia’s got some deets on that right here.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:24.280
Special thanks 
to the folks at Fig. 1 for providing the animations,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:34.130
be sure to check them out here.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.080
Do you think you have a superhuman sense?

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.661
Tell us what it is and why down in the comments.
