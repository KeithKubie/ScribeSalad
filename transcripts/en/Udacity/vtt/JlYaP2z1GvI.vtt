Here I've written a significantly more complicated fragment of HTML,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I would like you, gentle student, to help me interpret it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In this multiple-multiple choice quiz, check each box

00:00:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that corresponds to a word that will be displayed on the screen by the web browser.
