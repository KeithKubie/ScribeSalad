00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.320
Art has a very high status in modern societies:

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.320
People flock to museums

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320
and art works fetch record prices.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.620
But our age is also oddly reluctant to say in clear terms what art might actually be for.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.540
An odd mystique surrounds it, epitomized by the puzzlement many of us feel

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.880
as we look at yet another odd looking, modern work of art in a contemporary museum.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.600
We're often left quietly and politely wondering what is it all meant to be about.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.220
For most of history, this kind of question didn't arise, because it was abundantly clear what art was for.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.080
The question mark over the purpose of art is really a modern one, so let's go back in time

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.260
and find out about a wider range of options that we might be able to draw on fruitfully today.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.200
Rome, 290 AD

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.100
Deep below the imperial Roman city, the faithful secretly gather in catacombs,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.640
or burial chambers, to celebrate new religious figure, Jesus Christ.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.020
Christianity, though still in its infancy and ruthlessly persecuted by the Roman authorities, is rapidly gaining ground.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.420
Like so many religions before it and since, Christianity has become involved with the making of art.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.620
Here, an unnamed and not especially talented artists represents Jesus healing of a bleeding woman,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.340
an incident recorded in the New Testament.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.680
Like all religions, Christianity is using art for a clear and understandable purpose:

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.140
to make its message more resonant, emotionally attractive, and popularly appealing.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.600
Art is like a kind of advertising for
its ideas.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.940
Soon Christian artists are going to dominate
Europe.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.560
For almost a thousand years almost all art produced in Europe will
simply be Christian art.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.759
From humble beginnings in a subterranean prayer room,

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.259
Christian art will go on to produce
extraordinary cathedrals, paintings

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.080
sculptures and celebrating and enhancing
the prestige of its messages.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.740
Thailand, 15th century

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.680
An unknown
craftsman finishes a statue of the Buddha.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.760
One of many hundreds of thousands
of such statues produced over the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.950
centuries in Southeast Asia.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.760
The purpose of such art is extremely
clear:

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.460
You're meant to look at the Buddha and take inspiration, becoming a little
more as he is.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.980
The sculpture is an invitation to calm
and contemplation.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.800
In the East as in the West arts function is evident:

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.960
to support the truths set down by religions,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.400
to make ideas more easily
digestible.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.740
Paris, January 1801

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.200
The French artist Jacques-Louis David finishes "Napoleon crossing the Alps".

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.380
It commemorates a moment when a couple of years before, Napoleon still in his

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.140
twenties launched a lightning raid on
the North Italian states, winning a series of astonishing victories.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.780
In the picture, Napoleon masters a white warhorse

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.860
though he
actually cross the mountains on a more serviceable mule.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.340
Here, art is doing something it has done
throughout history as well:

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.950
acting as propaganda for a political
cause.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.270
Napoleon is looking back to the example
of Louis XIV of France who

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.700
did a lot of propagandizing with art.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.200
It was a habit he got into throughout his rule.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.900
Paris, 1833

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.540
The poet, novelist and critique Théophile Gautier publishes an essay about art,

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.420
which argues that art must free itself from the poisonous agendas of religions and governments.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.180
The point of good art is always to be just for its own sake

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.800
as he put it in French, "l'art pour l'art", art for art's sake.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.660
This doctrine of art for art's sake
becomes the motto of the new generation of romantic artists

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.500
who set themselves
against the old ideal that art should serve religion or powerful rulers or
nations.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.440
Nonsense, says  Gautier,  true art must serve nothing at all.

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.890
it is an end in itself and doesn't try
to change or do or speak about anything.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.380
Artists set themselves apart from the
bourgeois commercial society growing up all around,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.380
which is always trying to sell
people things.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.840
Art should try to inhabit a loftier, more abstract realm.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.920
New York, 1917

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.240
The artist Marcel Duchamp
prepares to exhibit his latest work at a show by the Society of Independent
Artists.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.580
It is surprisingly a urinal titled
simply Fountain.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.480
Duchamp is a rebellion against many notions of what
art is,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.260
that it should be easy to understand, that it should make sense,
that it should promote something.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.970
The true artist, argues Duchamp must
defend himself against any confusion

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.700
with advertising, mass media, government
propaganda or religious indoctrination,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.940
that true purpose of the artist is to
stand outside the mainstream and create

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.200
works that are enigmatic, mysteriously
provocative and rather silent.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.440
New York, 1949

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.300
A russian émigré artist, Marcus Ravkovic who has renamed himself Mark Rothko to escape anti-semitism

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.760
exhibits a new range of works at the
Betty Parsons gallery in Manhattan.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.440
They are a revelation,  in that they seem not to be about anything.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.560
They are about pure color fields and are as abstract as music.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.200
For some, they are the greatest works of the 20th century and soon fetch
enormous prices.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.360
The Museum of Modern Art acquires a
major set of Rothko's as do other national museums around the world.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.100
Rothko becomes representative of the
more obscure direction of 20th century art,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.120
highly appealing to an elite who
will often pay enormous incomprehensible prices for works

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.400
but puzzling for the
wider public.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.720
Venice, June 2005

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.080
The world's most prestigious
art fair, The Venice Biennale opens at the newly restored spaces of the Arsenale.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.840
It has been curated for the first time
by two women,  María de Corral and Rosa Martinez.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.100
41 artist's are shown from
all over the world.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.220
The nearby Marco Polo airport is filled
with the private jets of the world's billionaires,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.360
many of whom profess to
love art.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.480
Elaborate cocktail parties are held late into the night.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.840
Art has become a playground for the
super rich

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.000
as well as an obligatory tourist destination for weary travelers.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.000
Art is both hugely revered and yet
somehow still in question.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.100
For most of its history art has been saddled with a mission:

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.480
to glorify religion or to speak well of the state.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.320
Modern art was the result of a swerve
away from these agendas for extremely understandable reasons.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.479
Yet if art is to regain its true centerality

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.000
it should overcome it hesitation about
stating what it's really for and is trying to do.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.940
It is really and has always
been a sophisticated tool,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.780
a tool that can help us to cope with things like loneliness,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.700
that can fill us with hope,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.540
that can help us to communicate our inner world,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.100
that questions power and aims to improve political systems.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.180
It is never an insult to ask art to do
things for us,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.880
to be a practical part of our daily lives.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.820
We honor art most when
we give it the highest task of all:

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.220
to help us to lead better lives.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.960
