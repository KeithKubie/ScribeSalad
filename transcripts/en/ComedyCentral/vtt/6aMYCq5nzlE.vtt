00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
- I was in L.A. last week and I'll say, cause I'm not an L.A. hater,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.000
people have asked me, why
don't you move to L.A.,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.940
over the years I've just never gone.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.350
And I was there last week, and
I had this realization where,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.430
and it's nothing against
the city or the industry,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.730
but just me personally,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.480
I showed up there, I was
there for four or five days,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.260
and I was like, oh, when I am here,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.737
I want to be dead.
- Yes, yes.

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:23.740
- I want to be dead when I'm in this city.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.920
Something about this city
makes me want to be dead.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.310
- But what is it?
- I don't know.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.710
- Like, what is it--

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.130
- 'Cause it's a fine
place full of nice people

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.570
and warm weather, and all
my friends are happy there.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.360
And I'm not trying to
come down on the city,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.440
'cause that's a little cliche

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.837
and it's not what I'm going for,

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.360
it's just on a personal level,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.230
within 36 hours of arriving
in Los Angeles, California,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.000
I will find myself praying for death.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.088
- [Carmen] Yeah?

00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:51.380
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.120
- Welcome back to the show.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.970
In studio joining us right
now is Chris Gethard,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.020
he has a new book out called Lose Well.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.210
Chris, when did this come out,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.914
I don't have any
information in front of me.

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:04.130
- [Chris] It came out Tuesday.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.320
- Tuesday.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.870
Is this your, this is your second book.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.253
- Third book.
- Third book?

00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:09.700
- I never slow down.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.860
- Why, how do you still have
something to write about?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.630
What are we writing about in this one now?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.340
- This one is, it's a bunch
of funny stories and stuff,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.960
but it all kind of ties into the idea

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.600
that the older I get, the more I think

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.310
failure is actually a really good thing.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.440
- We were just talking about this.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.540
- It's served me really well in my life.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.950
- Tell me how, and when did you come

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.090
to this conclusion?

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.480
- A lot of it happened in 2010.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.280
'Cause as you guys know, as comedians,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.810
and I try to write this in a broad way

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.700
where it will not just appeal
to comedians or artists,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.390
but you know you spend so much time

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.060
thinking about your success
relative to other people's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.830
and I was coming up in a scene at UCB

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.300
where everyone was
getting super successful,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.133
and I was not.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.780
And I had all this feelings of like,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.680
why is it not happening for me,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.610
all this stress and then
I finally got a sitcom,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.100
and then the sitcom
bombed, and I didn't care.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.370
And I was like, why don't I care?

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.190
And then I was like, oh,
I don't like sitcoms,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.040
why did I view it as success to be on one?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.690
That was very much driven
by pettiness and ego,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.990
this feeling that I wanted things

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.140
that other people had, who cares?

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.210
And that's when I went to public access TV

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.150
and kind of built my
career and it became--

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.870
- [Nikki] With The Chris Gethard Show?

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.880
- Yeah, and it became this thing

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.690
people were like really passionate about

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.860
and knew me for, and by anyone's,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.070
I think by anyone's standard
definition of success

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.090
a public access show is not successful

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.830
compared to a sitcom lead.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.480
I was a lead!

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.090
But for me, it felt
very much like success.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.810
- And, I completely relate to that

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.060
because you get these
oppurtunities and you go, yes!

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.670
And you just say yes because that's--

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.616
- It's a thing.

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:39.478
- That's what people get when I see

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:41.470
them talk about it on Twitter

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.790
and everyone makes a big deal,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.680
and that's when you've made it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.130
but then I'm like, I don't wanna do that

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.580
every day with my.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.252
- Yeah.
- Do I really want that?

00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:52.140
- Yeah, we don't ask that enough.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.820
- We don't ask that enough,
and so you weren't bummed out

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.680
when your show was canceled.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.513
I mean, you were--
- Yeah.

00:02:57.513 --> 00:02:58.346
- It felt like a--
- It stung.

00:02:58.346 --> 00:02:59.179
- It stung, yes.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.300
- It was humiliating to
get really bad reviews

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.623
on my acting ability.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.870
But I was sitting there and I was like,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.990
yeah, but I also don't care.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.333
And I'm someone who's so
prone to depression and stuff

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:10.900
that I thought it was going to kill me,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.150
and I was like, oh hey,
I largely don't care.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.910
And I just realized it's all ego,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.290
get the ego out of the way.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.150
- Yeah, that is a scary thing,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.520
is that you just said you
thought it would kill you

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.960
because when you put yourself out there

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.490
and you set yourself up to have
a disappointment like that,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.910
you're like, oh this could,
what if this kills me?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.340
- Right, why do I keep
doing this to myself?

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.173
- Yeah.

00:03:31.173 --> 00:03:32.240
- What is it that I
actually love about it,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.300
let me go focus on that.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.133
That's what I've learned.

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:36.320
It's like, I keep putting myself

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.710
in these situations 'cause I have to.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.580
And if I have to, I
better just get out there

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.480
and do it, and own it.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.710
And if it doesn't work out
I gotta be okay with that.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.960
- Yeah, that's the tough part.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.313
I did Dancing with the
Stars and I was so scared

00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:50.270
that--

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.220
- Now how'd you like it?

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.770
I don't think I've seen
you since you did it.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.584
- I loved it.

00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:55.974
- That's awesome.
- I wish I was still on,

00:03:55.974 --> 00:03:58.730
I loved it more than I thought I would.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.670
It was one of the greatest
experiences of my life.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.790
I'm dying to get back on,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.470
I'm gonna pitch to them
that they do a losers season

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.670
with everyone who's been eliminated first.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.700
- That's a great idea.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.533
- Because--
- That ties right into

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:10.366
what I'm talking about.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:12.577
- I just, I loved it, and
I didn't expect to love it.

00:04:12.577 --> 00:04:15.070
And I did it just because I was like,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.240
oh, you get asked to do it.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.730
I kind of wanted a break
from my life to be honest,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.880
because when you do Dancing with the Stars

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.300
you can't do anything
else, so you're just like,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.500
I couldn't do stand-up at night,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.333
I couldn't do--
(Chris cackles)

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:25.910
I honestly took it as a vacation

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.243
and I say that and people think I'm,

00:04:27.243 --> 00:04:28.950
but it really--
- Are you a dancer?

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.870
Are you, do you--
- No!

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.430
I've never danced in my life.
- Really?

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.680
- Ever. Not once.
- Can I tell you,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.260
I am quietly a very good dancer.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.093
- You are?

00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:36.926
- Yeah.

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:38.898
- Literally if they ever
ask you to do it, do it.

00:04:38.898 --> 00:04:39.990
It's the greatest thing

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.260
I've ever done.
- I'll jump at the chance.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.940
- It was so fun.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.844
I think that we do have to
often ask ourselves that

00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:48.570
because we just get it in
our head what success is.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.240
I think we all, don't
we all relate to that?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.073
Of like, you get to the thing--

00:04:52.073 --> 00:04:53.409
- Well it's that whole

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:54.242
compare and despair thing.
- And go, I don't

00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:55.744
even like this.

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:58.716
Comparing yourself, how do
we stop doing it, Chris?

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:00.873
Have you stopped comparing yourself?

00:05:00.873 --> 00:05:02.710
- By and large, yeah.
- Can you stop?

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.543
How?

00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:08.543
- By doing stuff that very
few people care about,

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.190
but the ones who do care about it

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.010
are very passionate about it, you know?

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.720
I don't have the most
fans, but I think I have

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.310
some of the best fans.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.020
And I've just constantly doubled down

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.130
on doing stuff that I
think is a little smaller

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.090
and a little bit more
reflective of who I am

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.080
and a lot of times I
found that when you get to

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.160
platforms that are very big,
that represent a big success,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.220
it also means that your stuff
gets taken away from you,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.450
taken away from your voice.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.030
And I think I've just
been very, very willing

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.640
to get up and walk away from
the table in those situations.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.630
And that helps me not
compare myself, you know?

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.070
- What do you do to get out of that?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.650
Have you had the moments like that?

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.783
- Oh yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

00:05:41.783 --> 00:05:43.970
- [Nikki] And you just
don't have them anymore?

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.700
- Well, no, not as much.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.180
- Do you find yourself ever going down

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.920
that spiral of seeing someone kill,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.140
or hearing that someone killed,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.141
or hearing someone get something
that you would've wanted.

00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:55.520
- There's certainly times, I
will say this, like we all do.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.040
There are certainly times where,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.310
how do you say it delicately?

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.180
I mean, you don't.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.130
There's certainly times
where you see people

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.840
where you're like, that
person's not that good.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.240
And that's a different thing to me,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.810
'cause you're like, this is,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.080
they're hoodwinking the audience,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.330
it's snake oil and
that's bad for all of us.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.730
They go and see some show where it's like,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.860
oh they went in on the hype
and the person's not that good,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.490
that means they don't
buy tickets for comedy.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.812
- Yeah.

00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:18.880
- I don't like that.
- Yeah, that is scary.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.650
- The dangerous part is when it's someone

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.240
who I don't have anything against,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.510
or it's even a friend of mine.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.980
That's when it gets really insidious,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.290
you know when it's like,
oh this is a person

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.187
I'll sit down, ask them how they're doing,

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:31.340
mean it, care about their answers,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.180
I know that when they
ask me they mean it too,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.970
and then when they go and do well,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.243
I'm gonna be like, screw
them, you know what I mean,

00:06:37.243 --> 00:06:39.720
like that's when it
becomes really insidious.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.430
And I have managed to avoid that,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.910
and I think a lot of it just because

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.670
I can say so honestly that
most of the situations

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.410
in my life that were traditional success

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.370
did nothing but add stress or unhappiness.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.330
And there's been a lot of situations

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.520
where I've landed in circumstances that,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.300
very much by other people's definitions,

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.360
were failure, and they made me happy.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.260
So I've just kind of
learned to say who cares.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.520
I think, like you said, I think for you,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.070
you have to deal with the
patriarchy-driven version of it,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.330
but for me, I think even in a broad sense

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.470
for a lot of us it's sort of like,

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.520
I think culture and
society just trains you

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.810
to want to like, feel like you have to

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.600
stay in your lane, you know?

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.490
Kind of stay in your fucking cubicle.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.350
Am I allowed to curse?

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.397
Sorry about that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

00:07:22.397 --> 00:07:24.760
- But it is, it's like stay
in your fucking cubicle.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.180
I always felt like somewhere
people were like, you know,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.890
you're meant to be seen and not heard,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.050
like I don't come from a family of artists

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.100
or a neighborhood of artists,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.490
I constantly felt like it was like,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.380
oh you think think you're better than us,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.560
wanting to go do that,
that was always the vibe.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.590
I just don't buy it. I just don't buy it.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.580
And I feel like I've done a lot of things

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.380
that are sort of like
smaller, for very few people,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.870
and they make me immensely happy,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.150
and then I've been in big movies

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.560
or performed in front
of thousands of people

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.610
where I'm like, that was
totally fine, who cares.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.660
Or it just makes me a little glum.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.540
So, I think a lot of how I manage to avoid

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.110
worrying about other people's stuff

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.910
is remembering that it has
literally no effect on mine.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.884
It just doesn't.

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:06.110
- It doesn't.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.910
And when I see other people
get jealous of other people,

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.960
I get mad at them, but it's really me

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.163
getting mad at myself about being jealous.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.860
I've never gotten anything
from being jealous.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.693
- Not one time.

00:08:20.693 --> 00:08:22.400
- I don't think it's made me work harder,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.670
I don't think it's made me work better,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.380
it has only made me,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.010
it's like, what I was
talking about last week,

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.996
I lost my purse and I just had it.

00:08:31.996 --> 00:08:33.874
I was just kind of like,
oh, well, that sucks.

00:08:33.874 --> 00:08:35.660
I'll either find it or I won't,

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.380
but there's nothing I can do right now.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.320
As opposed to, you idiot,
why'd you lose your purse,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.140
like you're such a stupid bitch.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.530
Which is what I would usually do,

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.000
which has never helped
anyone find anything,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.830
is calling themselves a stupid bitch.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.260
But that's what I feel like I do

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.823
when I get jealous of people.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.415
Social media, too, I mean,
do you avoid that now?

00:08:54.415 --> 00:08:55.248
- It's the worst.

00:08:55.248 --> 00:08:56.730
It's a nightmare, it's
a complete nightmare.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.080
- It's a nightmare.
- It went from a thing

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.210
that connects us all,
that was really beautiful

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.326
and exciting, to a thing
that only brings out

00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:04.730
the most inhuman sides of people.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.690
- Yeah. I think it's,
we've obviously been saying

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.530
this for years now about
how we all gotta get off it,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.820
and it makes us compare ourselves,

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.684
but it is reached a point where

00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:17.270
it makes me depressed.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.517
- Oh, for sure.

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:19.790
You see a post where you're like,

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.560
oh that just ruined my
day, and I don't even care.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.500
Like, the world is the exact same

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.960
whether I see this post or not,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.260
but because I like looked at it

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.210
and like, ate those feelings,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.150
now I'm just gonna be thinking about that.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.983
Yeah, I hate it.

00:09:31.983 --> 00:09:34.430
- Well I posted that video
of my dad and mom singing

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.875
last night and Mark Norman said,

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:40.080
his comment was like,
I look at your parents

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.140
and wish I had that
relationship with mine.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.415
And I was like, you only see what I post.

00:09:44.415 --> 00:09:45.720
You don't see the bad.
- That's the thing,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.980
I love when people that do those posts

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.348
where they're like, it's only fair

00:09:49.348 --> 00:09:51.640
because I post the good things,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.940
here's something I failed at.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.897
Somebody did that the other day

00:09:53.897 --> 00:09:54.790
and I was like, I love that.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.120
I wish more people did that.
- And it's just like a girl

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.810
where she has a tear
streaming down her face

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.206
but she looks hot.
(laughing)

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:01.034
She's like, there are bad nights too.

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:03.784
You know you look pretty in this.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.814
But I wrote that and then
my dad wrote underneath it,

00:10:07.814 --> 00:10:10.300
he wrote like, wow.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.599
Like he was like mad and I was like,

00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:13.837
it's true, I don't.

00:10:13.837 --> 00:10:15.140
- That's so funny.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.820
- I don't ever post a
video of me being like,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.010
fuck you mom!

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.893
And slamming a door, but
that happens, you know?

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.716
And that's, I do appreciate you so much,

00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:28.680
Chris Gethard, because you are just,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.280
you're just so honest.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.100
- I try to be, although I do feel bad

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.900
that I came in here and this instantly got

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.930
like way too philosophical and depressing.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.379
- I love hearing this.
- That's your brand.

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:40.118
- That's a little too on brand for me.

00:10:40.118 --> 00:10:42.284
- Lose Well is the book.
- Over talky and depressing,

00:10:42.284 --> 00:10:43.185
that's my brand.

00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:44.830
- Is this like a self-help book?

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.080
Is this your version of self-help?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.630
- It is my version of it, yeah.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.760
HarperOne, one of the
editors, saw my HBO special,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.264
which as you know focused
on a lot of very dark stuff

00:10:54.264 --> 00:10:55.950
with my mental health,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.590
and they asked me to write
a book version of it.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.770
I said, I don't want to be
the depression guy forever.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.900
And they said, well we
really want to work with you.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.810
And I found it an interesting challenge

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.580
to be contracted to write a
book by a self-help company.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.530
And I'd like to think
that it's not snake oil

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.360
or bullshit, it's basically just stuff

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.960
where I'm like, I've been
doing this for 18 years

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.800
and here's a bunch of stuff
I learned that worked for me,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.160
good luck to you.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.280
It's a weirdly pessimistic self-help book,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.500
which I'm kind of proud of.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.390
Over and over again, I'm like,

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.150
it's probably not gonna work,
don't convince yourself it is.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.470
99% chance that you don't get
where you're trying to go.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.110
But I just don't think
that that's a bad thing,

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.650
so I felt comfortable writing it.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.384
I don't anybody's gonna be convinced

00:11:31.384 --> 00:11:34.010
by me going, here's the
way to get to your dreams,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.060
but I think they'll be
convinced by me going,

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.140
hey, I'm a guy with weird instincts

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.100
who has a giant forehead, who often thinks

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.910
that he looks like a fucking monster man

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.150
who has somehow still
managed to work for 18 years

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.860
and survive at the thing he wanted to do.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.570
Even though I'm admittedly never

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.130
the funniest comedian in the room,

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.510
it's like, well how did I do that?

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.440
That's the stuff that might
actually help regular people.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.550
- That's what I want to read.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.100
That's what I would've
been eager to consume.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.660
If you or anyone in your
life feels that way,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.720
where they're like, you
know you have a talent,

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.560
but you might not have the confidence

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.140
or you might think how am I gonna make it,

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.640
this is the book to get that
person or to get yourself.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.210
Lose Well is Chris Gethard's book

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.413
and he is someone that,

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.653
you figured out a way to,

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.940
you have a strong, your brand is strong.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.044
- Thank you.

00:12:28.044 --> 00:12:30.303
My brand game is on point.

00:12:30.303 --> 00:12:33.140
- Do you remember, I
think we all started out

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.140
in this business trying
to be someone else.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.660
Who were you trying to be
before you became Chris Gethard?

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.680
- Well I was at UCB in 2000, you know,

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.010
and whatever people think of it today,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.193
some people have issues with the place.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.410
I was there when no one
had ever heard of it

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.310
and it exploded and it was
this like, punk rock thing.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.490
So I was seeing like, very,
very good friends of mine

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.100
wind up on SNL, wind up on sitcoms,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.790
and I was like, I want that.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.360
Meanwhile I was doing all
these shows in New York that,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.260
I was doing shows where
comedians were like,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.090
if you weren't funny
enough, you'd get shot

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.570
with a paintball gun on stage,

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.900
or a show where like a bunch
of us boxed each other,

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.400
or a show--
- They're still doing

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.810
some of these.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.810
- From time to time, and it's like,

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.990
you know, a show where I rented a bus

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.250
and took people around New Jersey

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.650
and told them stories from my life

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.210
and the locations and everybody was like,

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.340
oh you do all the weird stuff.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.656
And I would just kind of
like constantly apologize

00:13:24.656 --> 00:13:27.040
for that, apologize, apologize, apologize,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.090
and be like, no, no,
no, that's not all I do.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.150
'Cause in my mind, I'm
like, no I'm gonna go get

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.990
an SNL or a sitcom job, just
like everybody else from UCB.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.940
It hit a certain point
where, I write about it

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.970
in the book, a good
friend of mine sat me down

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.784
and was like, when are you gonna realize

00:13:40.784 --> 00:13:44.530
that you're the one who
does all the weird stuff,

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.500
and you're the best one at it.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.760
And just own that, like, why do you want

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.120
to go get a job just like the jobs

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.953
everyone else are getting?

00:13:50.953 --> 00:13:52.427
Go do the paintball thing.

00:13:52.427 --> 00:13:55.340
And you know I spent four
years on public access

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.550
with a TV show that was
aimed at trying to do that,

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.560
and it wasn't always easy
to be on public access

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.610
but then it eventually
had 47 episodes on cable,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.390
like that's nothing to sneeze at.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.510
And so much of it was just by saying like,

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.920
yeah, I'm not destined
for those other things,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.370
let other people have those things.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.380
- I do that a lot with like, you know,

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.440
I remember the first time this struck me

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.540
was either watching a Chappelle special

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.270
or a Bill Burr special that
I just really was like, wow.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:27.110
That was tight and there
was something about it

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.830
that made me think, I don't know that I'll

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.200
ever get to that level of just brilliance.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.663
And kind of being like,
you know what though,

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.530
they probably don't have
as good of friends as I do.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.270
Like, I'm really good at
picking people as friends,

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.163
so I'm kind of like the
Chappelle of like, friendship.

00:14:45.665 --> 00:14:49.520
Like, my point is, finding
what you are good at.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.484
Like you're good at the weird stuff.

00:14:51.484 --> 00:14:52.800
- Yeah, and the sad stuff.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.070
- You're the best at it.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:58.650
And finding that yeah,
but when you do comedy

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.360
you just look at like the comedy greats

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.360
and you're like, well if I don't

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.543
write the best one-liners.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.840
If you compare yourself to Mitch Hedberg

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.070
or Dave Chappelle.
- It's never gonna end well.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.640
- It's never gonna end well,
but what are you the best at,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.240
and I'm not saying that
like having friends is like,

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:17.020
is a comedic achievement,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.410
but I was like, what am I really good at.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.500
What if I could say that
I am like the best at?

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.860
And I'm like, oh I think
picking people to be,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.110
like I just have the greatest friends,

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.560
and so for a while I was like,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.680
whenever I'd get down I'd be like,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.230
well just remember that
your talent is that.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.160
And then there's other
things that I'm good at too

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.530
that I've discovered along the way.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.570
But I think that that
might be kind of a trick

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.290
if you're listening and you're like,

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.590
you compare yourself and you go,

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.270
I'll never look like
that, I'll never be that,

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.550
well it could be like a weird thing,

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.830
but you're better at
something than they are.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.160
- Making videos, no I'm kidding.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.560
- Yeah, making videos,
making shitty mermaid videos,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.563
Carmen Lynch.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.160
No, Carmen Lynch, you're
definitely someone

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.120
I look at that I'm like,
well I could never do,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.293
I could never be,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.180
that funny.
- But you can, and you will

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.893
be a mermaid too.
- I will.

00:16:05.893 --> 00:16:09.426
I will never, I'll never
have a 10 year old stepson

00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:11.393
type person to teach me.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.480
But do you, Carmen do you relate to this,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.121
like how do you deal with

00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:18.459
competition? Carmen Lynch.
- Yeah, it's weird sometimes

00:16:18.459 --> 00:16:20.930
'cause I want, I have
to check in with myself

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.440
and be like, what do you really want.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.920
And I love traveling more than anything.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.593
Like I want to see the world,

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.230
but I also love stand-up comedy.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.820
So if I get an email that says,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.770
do you wanna do a packet
for such-and-such show,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.330
it feels very strange to be like, I don't.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.510
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.940
- You know? And it's weird to say that

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.730
to like your agent or something.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.270
And there are some packets that I will do

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.720
but some of them I'm like,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.490
no because if I do this
show, then I can't go to,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.450
you know, wherever at the last minute.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.227
- Right. But whereas if
someone said to you like,

00:16:54.227 --> 00:16:56.200
do you wanna come do a show in Kazakhstan

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.920
and we can only pay you $800.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.790
- Totally, like I went
to Pakistan last year,

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.470
I'm going to Greenland next month,

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.303
like I like--

00:17:02.303 --> 00:17:03.136
- You're doing shows in Greenland?

00:17:03.136 --> 00:17:04.760
- Yeah, and it doesn't even pay that much

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.910
but I'm like, I wanna
see what that's like.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.540
- How do you even find those gigs?

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.730
- Well that one's for the troops.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.003
That's a military thing.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.800
But you know, it's like if I'm on a show

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.150
that I don't really want to write for

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.930
but it's, you know, I
should write for a show

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.630
because that's what you do in this career.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:20.750
- And then you get to tell people

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.700
you're writing for that show,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.700
and then you get to have it
as part of your Twitter bio.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.553
- Right?

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.020
- Here's another thing I'll
say on this whole topic.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.570
And this is not a reference to any names

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.330
that have come up thus far.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.390
But I think we can all agree that

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.150
kind of being in the trenches,

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.650
and being around people,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.360
not always, but often enough,

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.511
some of the most
successful people I've seen

00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:47.077
who from the outside people are like,

00:17:47.077 --> 00:17:49.180
those are the superstars,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.700
from my perspective, seem
to be intensely lonely.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.650
- Yeah.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.940
- Intensely lonely and not
thrilled with how they live.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.530
- That's like exactly what I,

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.020
I said this a few weeks ago but I,

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.860
I believe like, sometimes if
you are jealous of someone,

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.390
you go, would I trade
lives with them though?

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.560
And I almost never would.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.393
- That's a really good question.

00:18:09.393 --> 00:18:10.226
- So many people I'm like,

00:18:10.226 --> 00:18:11.370
I wouldn't want to walk around like that,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.570
with that voice and hair or whatever.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.560
- [Chris] And everyone's scalping you.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.370
- Yes, because, and I think Tom,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.810
you're more in this part of your career

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.840
than any of us, because
we've been around longer,

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.711
but you're getting opportunities now

00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:25.230
placed in front of you that it's like,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.483
auditions for shows, or writing packets,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.470
and they come across you and you go,

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.600
oh my god, like, I can't not throw my hat

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.040
in the ring for this, this is like,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.873
you were like just saying.

00:18:36.873 --> 00:18:41.873
And you gotta, I am so glad I didn't get

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.680
some of the jobs that I went out for.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.350
I am so glad because, and
my therapist taught me this

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.300
a million times, when
you say no to something,

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.193
you're saying yes to everything else.

00:18:53.735 --> 00:18:54.870
That means everything.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:59.580
So, saying no can be very powerful.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.280
I didn't say no a lot
but I wish I would've.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.670
Because if I would've
gotten any of those jobs,

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.430
I wouldn't have this.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.860
And who's to say if I
would've said no to this

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.530
I could be somewhere even
better, but I don't--

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.531
- Oh shit, that's a good point.

00:19:11.531 --> 00:19:12.414
- [Nikki] I gotta go.

00:19:12.414 --> 00:19:13.830
- You gotta say no to everything.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.500
- But it really is, it's
hard to turn down things,

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.270
especially when you're a comic

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.280
and you just have to say
yes to everything upfront.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.960
But man, there were some things

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.540
that I cried over not getting.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.630
And I look back and I'm like,
that would've been miserable.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.910
And all I really wanted was
the line in my Twitter bio.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.743
- That's it.

00:19:33.743 --> 00:19:34.620
- Or the announcement.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.868
- For sure, when I first moved here,

00:19:35.868 --> 00:19:37.530
there was writing jobs where I was like,

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.280
devastated that I didn't get,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.936
and then I watched the
show after, I was like,

00:19:40.936 --> 00:19:42.513
I don't even like this.

00:19:42.513 --> 00:19:43.810
I don't even like this show,

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.169
why would I want to do this.
- Yes, and you would not be

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:46.670
able to do stand-up at night.
- Yeah, that's the thing.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.470
- Or you would and you would be sleepless

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.653
like you were in college working two gigs.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.530
Some of the things you look back on

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.330
that you didn't get, it's
usually a good thing.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.160
- I was a guest writer at SNL in 2007

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.090
for two weeks.
- What?

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:00.923
- For two weeks

00:20:00.923 --> 00:20:02.230
they brought me in.
- Oh my god, dream job.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.350
- Dream job.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.270
And I realized I was so, so devastated

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.530
to not get hired afterwards,

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.400
I got a sketch to dress
rehearsal, I was like,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.770
oh I'm on this inside
track, didn't get hired.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.760
Devastated, but I look
back at who I was in 2007

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.669
and I look at what that
job demands of people

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:21.480
and I realized, I would be dead.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.156
I would've started drinking again,

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:25.370
I would've become addicted to drugs,

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.470
I know myself, I know where I was at,

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.500
I know that pace, I know
I would not have been able

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.420
to handle that at the age of 26, 27.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.580
I would be dead.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.464
If I wasn't dead, I would be
a vastly different person.

00:20:38.464 --> 00:20:40.020
- I agree with you.
- It would have chewed me up

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.433
and spat me out, thank
god I didn't get it.

00:20:41.433 --> 00:20:45.222
And it was the dream job
at the time and I cried.

00:20:45.222 --> 00:20:47.490
I've submitted I think
for three or four years

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.360
after that, being like,
how did I drop the ball.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.730
And it was like this great white whale

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.160
that was eating me up, I failed at this.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.820
No, if I had gotten this I would've become

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.050
like a coke head, I know I would've.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.393
I know I would've.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.310
- I agree with you.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.710
If I would've gotten some of the things

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.470
that were big opportunities early on,

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.540
I wouldn't have been able to get sober

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.790
and I'd probably be dead.

00:21:10.254 --> 00:21:11.380
And not saying that everyone needs

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.677
to find sobriety and that's
what the solution is,

00:21:13.677 --> 00:21:16.940
but for me, for our case,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.500
for my mental stability,

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.150
I needed to not be successful
until I was ready for it.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.350
And thank god I wasn't.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.640
- Oh yeah.
- Because it would've been,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.910
you know, well you see
it happen all the time,

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.310
people get too successful,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.240
get these opportunities too
young and squander them.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.310
- I mean in 2012, it was five years later

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.030
and I tried Adderall once and it led to

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.573
a real bad summer, you know?
- Oh, really?

00:21:38.573 --> 00:21:41.720
- Like in 2007 I would've
been even less equipped.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.978
Oh, yeah.

00:21:42.978 --> 00:21:44.940
- Adderall.
- I lost, oh.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.773
- Dangerous.

00:21:45.773 --> 00:21:48.760
- Yeah, I started eating
like 60 milligrams a day.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.120
- Whoa.
- I went nuts.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.810
I lost a ton of weight,
I stayed up all night.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:53.650
It was crazy.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.860
- Yeah, you might lose weight on Adderall,

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.870
but the thing that has
kept me from doing it

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.720
is that it ages you.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.680
'Cause your eyes are like (groans)

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.340
and so you get crow's feet faster.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.620
So ladies.
- Wanna hear a real gross one?

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.790
- What?
- I had crazy side effects.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.283
- What?
- I pooped blood.

00:22:08.283 --> 00:22:09.297
- What!
- It made me poop

00:22:09.297 --> 00:22:11.221
a lot of blood.
- Oh my god.

00:22:11.221 --> 00:22:13.470
- And you were just like, well.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.927
- Yeah, I didn't go to a doctor

00:22:14.927 --> 00:22:16.600
for a frightfully long time.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.433
What's that?

00:22:17.433 --> 00:22:18.351
- Is that bad? Should I be concerned?

00:22:18.351 --> 00:22:19.790
(laughing)

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.060
- I was just staying up all night

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.190
and acting like a crazy person,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.150
so I just went with it.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.620
- At that point, pooping blood,

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.030
you're just like, whatever.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.884
- Yeah, there were bigger fish to fry.

00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:31.170
- You're like, maybe
I ate a bunch of beets

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.003
a couple days ago.

00:22:32.003 --> 00:22:33.453
You start like rationalizing.

00:22:35.165 --> 00:22:38.165
(upbeat rock music)
