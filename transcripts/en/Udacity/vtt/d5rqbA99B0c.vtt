00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.440
There is an equation that tells us how
much money Calvin makes every month.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.043
It is total pay equals
0.15 times his total

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:13.800
sales plus his base pay, which is $1000.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.468
This is a linear equation.

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:21.780
Let's use desmos.com,
which is an online graphing calculator.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.050
If this is Calvin's take home pay and
this is his money in sales,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.930
we can see that as total sales increase,
his take home pay increases.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.260
If sales decrease, so
does his take home pay.
