00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:15.594
Imagine with me this scene.

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:21.687
It's a scene that played out
in nearly all of our families.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:26.029
It's a scene in which a young person,

00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:29.014
somewhere in our family tree,

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:31.490
somewhere in our lineage

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:34.047
had a heartbreaking decision to make.

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:39.666
It was a decision to leave all
that they had known.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.998
And all of the people that they had loved

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:48.014
and to set out for a place far, far away

00:00:48.038 --> 00:00:50.133
that they had never seen

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:52.490
in hopes that life might be better.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:58.503
Migration is usually
a young person's endeavor.

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:02.815
It's the kind of thing that you do
when you're on the cusp of life.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:07.380
And so, there is, in all of our families,

00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:10.539
this young person
somewhere in our background.

00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:14.871
That person is standing at a dock,

00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:16.744
about to board a ship

00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:20.168
that will cross the Atlantic
or the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:24.125
That person is loading up a truck

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.149
that will cross the Rio Grande.

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:30.069
Or that person is standing

00:01:30.093 --> 00:01:32.395
at a railroad platform

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:38.403
about to board a train
that will cross rivers and mountains

00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:40.617
out of the Jim Crow South

00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:44.066
to what they hope
will be freedom in the North.

00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:48.601
And there, with this young person

00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:53.998
as they are about to board that ship,

00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:55.442
that boat,

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:58.728
that truck, that train,

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.164
are the people who raised them.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:04.850
Their mother, their father,

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:08.723
their aunt, their uncle,
their grandparents,

00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:12.524
whoever it might have been
who had gotten them to this point.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.628
Those older people

00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:18.072
were not going to be able
to make the crossing with them.

00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:24.537
And as they looked into the eyes
of the people who had raised them,

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.871
there was no guarantee

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:30.116
that they would ever see them alive again.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.879
Remember, there was no Skype,

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:38.418
no e-mail, no cell phones

00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:41.410
not even reliable long-distance
telephone service.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.885
And even if there had been,

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.196
many of the people that they were leaving
did not even have telephones.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.323
This was going to be a complete break

00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:54.418
from all that they knew

00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:57.156
and all of the people that they loved.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.204
And the very next time

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:04.609
that they might hear anything
about the people who had raised them

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:09.663
might be a telegram saying,
"Your father has passed away."

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:14.331
Or, "Your mother is very, very ill.

00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:20.291
You must return home quickly
if you are to see her alive again."

00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:25.551
That is the magnitude of the sacrifice

00:03:25.575 --> 00:03:30.019
that had to have happened
in nearly all of our families

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.576
just for us to be here.

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:37.819
A single decision
that changed the course of families

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:41.922
and lineages and countries and history

00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:43.213
to the current day.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.895
One of these migration streams

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.760
stands out in ways
that we may not realize.

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:54.130
It was called the Great Migration.

00:03:54.839 --> 00:04:00.394
It was the outpouring
of six million African Americans

00:04:00.418 --> 00:04:02.505
from the Jim Crow South

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.283
to the cities of the North and West,

00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:08.918
from the time of World War I
until the 1970s.

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:16.791
It stands out because this
was the first time in American history

00:04:16.815 --> 00:04:23.032
that American citizens
had to flee the land of their birth

00:04:23.056 --> 00:04:27.176
just to be recognized as the citizens
that they had always been.

00:04:28.022 --> 00:04:30.276
No other group of Americans

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.378
has had to act like immigrants

00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:36.894
in order to be recognized as citizens.

00:04:37.864 --> 00:04:41.807
So this great migration was not a move.

00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:47.188
It was actually a seeking
of political asylum

00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:49.879
within the borders of one's own country.

00:04:51.704 --> 00:04:56.068
They were defecting a caste system
known as Jim Crow.

00:04:57.545 --> 00:04:59.442
It was an artificial hierarchy

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:03.466
in which everything
that you could and could not do

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.890
was based upon what you looked like.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.093
This caste system was so arcane
that it was actually against the law

00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:15.283
for a black person and a white person

00:05:15.307 --> 00:05:19.085
to merely play checkers
together in Birmingham.

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:20.966
You could go to jail

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.640
if you were caught playing checkers
with a person of a different race.

00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:30.006
Someone must have seen
a black person and a white person

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.633
playing checkers with someone
in some town square.

00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:37.101
And maybe the wrong person was winning

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:39.617
or they were having too good of a time,

00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:42.364
but whatever it was that this person saw,

00:05:42.388 --> 00:05:45.331
with this black person
and this white person playing checkers,

00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:50.037
they felt the entire foundation
of Southern civilization was in peril.

00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:52.768
And decided that it was worth
taking the time

00:05:52.792 --> 00:05:54.934
to write this down as a law.

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.824
This caste system was so arcane

00:05:58.848 --> 00:06:04.720
that in courtrooms throughout the South
there was actually a black Bible

00:06:04.744 --> 00:06:07.975
and an altogether separate white Bible

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:10.756
to swear to tell the truth on in court.

00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:15.133
The very word of God was segregated

00:06:15.157 --> 00:06:18.188
in the caste system of the Jim Crow South.

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.506
The same sacred object

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.823
could not be touched
by hands of different races.

00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:30.923
This artificial hierarchy,

00:06:31.981 --> 00:06:36.252
because it goes against
human desires to be free,

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:41.978
required a tremendous amount
of violence to maintain.

00:06:42.557 --> 00:06:47.006
Such that every four days,
somewhere in the American South,

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.236
every four days
an African American was lynched

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.807
for some perceived breach of protocol
in this caste system

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:59.031
in the decades leading up
to the start of the Great Migration.

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:04.878
This caste system had been put in place
for many, many reasons.

00:07:05.252 --> 00:07:09.828
But one of them was to maintain
the economic order of the South,

00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:14.426
which required not just
a supply of cheap labor

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.212
but an oversupply of cheap labor
to work at the will of the land.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.214
This Great Migration began
when the North had a labor problem.

00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:28.184
The North had a labor problem

00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:31.514
because it had been relying
on cheap labor from Europe --

00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:32.839
immigrants from Europe --

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:36.322
to work the factories and the foundries
and the steel mills.

00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:38.839
But during World War I,

00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:42.156
migration from Europe
came to a virtual halt.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.697
And so the North had a labor problem.

00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:50.506
And so the North decided to go
and find the cheapest labor in the land

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.410
which meant African Americans
in the South,

00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:57.133
many of whom were not even being paid
for their hard work.

00:07:57.157 --> 00:07:58.506
Many of them were working

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.902
for the right to live on the land
that they were farming.

00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:04.553
They were sharecroppers
and not even being paid.

00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:06.844
So they were ripe for recruitment.

00:08:07.482 --> 00:08:09.379
But it turned out

00:08:09.403 --> 00:08:14.211
that the South did not take kindly
to this poaching of its cheap labor.

00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:19.036
The South actually did everything it could
to keep the people from leaving.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.847
They would arrest people
from the railroad platforms.

00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:26.307
Remember, putatively free
American citizens.

00:08:26.895 --> 00:08:29.283
They would arrest them
from their train seats.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:32.387
And when there were too many
people to arrest,

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.696
they would wave the train on through

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.014
so that people who had been hoping

00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:38.276
and saving

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.537
and praying for the chance
to get to freedom

00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:44.926
had to figure out:
How now will we get out?

00:08:46.211 --> 00:08:49.568
And as they made their way
out of the South,

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:52.068
away from Jim Crow,

00:08:52.092 --> 00:08:55.501
they followed three
beautifully predictable streams

00:08:55.525 --> 00:09:00.084
as is the case in any migration
throughout human history.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.685
In this particular case,
there were three streams.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:08.578
One was the migration along the East Coast

00:09:08.602 --> 00:09:12.822
from Florida, Georgia,
the Carolinas and Virginia

00:09:12.846 --> 00:09:15.704
to Washington DC, to Philadelphia,

00:09:15.728 --> 00:09:19.196
New Jersey, New York
and on up the East coast.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.831
There was the Midwest stream,

00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:24.744
which carried people
from Mississippi, Alabama,

00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:26.982
Tennessee and Arkansas

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:31.661
to Chicago, to Detroit,
to Cleveland and the entire Midwest.

00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:34.152
And then there was the West Coast stream,

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:38.149
which carried people
from Louisiana and Texas

00:09:38.173 --> 00:09:39.601
out to California.

00:09:39.966 --> 00:09:42.410
And when they really wanted to get away,

00:09:42.434 --> 00:09:44.061
they went to Seattle.

00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:47.927
And when they really, really
wanted to get away,

00:09:47.951 --> 00:09:49.676
they went to Alaska,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.957
the farthest possible point
within the borders of the United States

00:09:53.981 --> 00:09:55.544
from Jim Crow South.

00:09:57.941 --> 00:10:00.370
Before the Great Migration began,

00:10:00.394 --> 00:10:04.807
90 percent of all African Americans
were living in the South.

00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:07.664
Nearly held captive in the South.

00:10:08.276 --> 00:10:11.466
But by the time
this Great Migration was over,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.942
nearly half were living
all over the rest of the country.

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:18.544
So this ended up being
nearly a complete redistribution

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:20.783
of part of an entire people.

00:10:23.037 --> 00:10:28.203
This Great Migration was the first time
in American history

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:31.153
that the lowest caste people

00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:35.087
signaled that they had options
and were willing to take them.

00:10:36.227 --> 00:10:40.676
That had not happened
in the three centuries

00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:45.870
in which African Americans
had been on that soil at that time.

00:10:46.707 --> 00:10:51.124
It had not happened
in 12 generations of enslavement

00:10:51.148 --> 00:10:54.198
that preceded
nearly a century of Jim Crow.

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:57.949
How many "greats"

00:10:57.973 --> 00:11:01.203
do you have to add
to the word "grandparent"

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:07.324
to begin to imagine how long
enslavement lasted in the United States?

00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:14.977
Secondly, this Great Migration
was the first time in American history

00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:17.862
that the lowest caste people

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:22.871
actually had a chance
to choose for themselves

00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:26.227
what they would do
with their God-given talents

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:28.171
and where they would pursue them.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.625
Think about those cotton fields

00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:34.776
and those rice plantations

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.816
and those tobacco fields

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.707
and those sugar plantations.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.664
On those sugar plantations,

00:11:41.688 --> 00:11:44.045
and on those tobacco fields,

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:46.402
and on those rice plantations,

00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:48.568
and on those cotton fields

00:11:48.592 --> 00:11:50.679
were opera singers,

00:11:50.703 --> 00:11:52.735
jazz musicians,

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:54.534
playwrights,

00:11:54.558 --> 00:11:56.216
novelists,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.907
surgeons,

00:11:57.931 --> 00:11:59.629
attorneys,

00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:01.240
accountants,

00:12:01.264 --> 00:12:02.978
professors,

00:12:03.002 --> 00:12:04.152
journalists.

00:12:04.653 --> 00:12:06.043
And how do we know that?

00:12:06.533 --> 00:12:11.378
We know that because that is
what they and their children

00:12:11.402 --> 00:12:15.285
and now their grandchildren
and even great-grandchildren

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:17.505
have often chosen to become

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:21.735
once they had the chance
to choose for themselves

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:24.425
what they would do
with their God-given talents.

00:12:25.402 --> 00:12:27.841
Without the Great Migration,

00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:32.523
there might not have been
a Toni Morrison as we now know her to be.

00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:36.650
Her parents were from Alabama
and from Georgia.

00:12:36.674 --> 00:12:38.675
They migrated to Ohio,

00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:40.870
where their daughter
would get to do something

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:43.735
that we all take for granted
at this point,

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:48.298
but which was against the law
and against protocol for African Americans

00:12:48.322 --> 00:12:51.196
at the time that she would have been
growing up in the South,

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.402
had they stayed.

00:12:52.426 --> 00:12:55.037
And that is just to walk into a library

00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:57.156
and take out a library book.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.156
Merely by making
the single decision to leave,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.219
her parents assured that their daughter
would get access to books.

00:13:05.727 --> 00:13:08.465
And if you're going to become
a Nobel laureate,

00:13:08.489 --> 00:13:10.433
it helps to get a book now and then.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:11.724
You know, it helps.

00:13:13.505 --> 00:13:17.896
Music as we know it was reshaped
by the Great Migration.

00:13:19.434 --> 00:13:21.925
As they came North,
they brought with them,

00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:24.656
on their hearts and in their memories,

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.774
the music that had sustained
the ancestors --

00:13:27.798 --> 00:13:31.695
the blues music, the spirituals
and the gospel music

00:13:31.719 --> 00:13:34.163
that had sustained them
through the generations.

00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:39.021
And they converted this music
into whole new genres of music.

00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:42.053
And got the chance to record this music,

00:13:42.077 --> 00:13:44.156
this new music that they were creating,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.322
and to spread it throughout the world.

00:13:47.807 --> 00:13:51.195
Without the Great Migration,
"Motown" would not have existed.

00:13:51.843 --> 00:13:54.819
The founder, Berry Gordy,
his parents were from Georgia.

00:13:54.843 --> 00:13:56.446
They migrated to Detroit.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.164
And when he got to be a grown man,
he decided he wanted to go into music.

00:14:00.188 --> 00:14:03.560
But he didn't have the wherewithal
to go all over the country

00:14:03.584 --> 00:14:05.164
looking for the best talent,

00:14:05.188 --> 00:14:07.453
and it turned out he didn't have to.

00:14:07.477 --> 00:14:09.386
It turned out that there he was,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.433
surrounded by children
of the Great Migration

00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:15.861
whose parents had brought this music up
with them during the journey.

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:20.275
And among those children
were these three girls,

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:22.185
there was Mary Wilson,

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:24.618
Florence Ballard

00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:26.812
and there was a third one:

00:14:27.478 --> 00:14:28.628
Diana Ross.

00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:33.900
We might not know Diana Ross' name
had there been no Great Migration.

00:14:33.925 --> 00:14:37.590
Because like a lot of Americans
and a lot of human beings in general,

00:14:37.614 --> 00:14:40.466
she might not have existed
because her parents might not have met.

00:14:40.769 --> 00:14:42.975
Her mother was from Alabama,

00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:44.745
father from West Virginia,

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:48.172
they migrated to Detroit, different years,

00:14:48.196 --> 00:14:51.363
met, married, had her and her siblings,

00:14:51.387 --> 00:14:53.736
and thus a legend was born.

00:14:54.705 --> 00:14:58.483
Jazz was a creation
of the Great Migration.

00:14:58.507 --> 00:15:02.173
And one of the greatest gifts
of the Great Migration.

00:15:02.197 --> 00:15:05.826
Starting with Louis Armstrong,
who was born in Louisiana

00:15:06.243 --> 00:15:10.259
and migrated on the Illinois
Central Railroad to Chicago,

00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:13.686
where he got the chance
to build on the talent

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.710
that was within him all along.

00:15:16.267 --> 00:15:17.521
Miles Davis.

00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:19.600
His parents were from Arkansas.

00:15:19.624 --> 00:15:22.441
They migrated to southern Illinois,

00:15:22.465 --> 00:15:25.336
where he would get the chance
to build on the talents

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.671
that were within him all along

00:15:27.695 --> 00:15:32.089
but which could have gone fallow
in the cotton country of Arkansas.

00:15:34.124 --> 00:15:35.298
John Coltrane.

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:38.870
He migrated at the age of 16

00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:42.283
from North Carolina to Philadelphia,

00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:46.893
where, upon arrival in Philadelphia,
he got his first alto sax.

00:15:47.362 --> 00:15:50.830
And there are lovers of jazz
who cannot imagine a world

00:15:50.854 --> 00:15:54.330
without John Coltrane
having gotten a hold of a saxophone.

00:15:56.027 --> 00:15:57.177
Thelonious Monk.

00:15:58.345 --> 00:15:59.495
Michael Jackson.

00:16:00.138 --> 00:16:01.288
Jesse Owens.

00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:03.090
Prince.

00:16:03.114 --> 00:16:04.264
August Wilson.

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:05.941
Richard Wright.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.115
Ralph Ellison.

00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:08.981
Michelle Obama.

00:16:09.941 --> 00:16:14.989
These are all a few
of the millions of people

00:16:15.013 --> 00:16:18.925
who were products
of the single decision to migrate.

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:22.761
The people of the Great Migration

00:16:22.785 --> 00:16:25.292
met with tremendous
resistance in the North.

00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:30.364
And they were not able to defeat
all social injustice.

00:16:31.275 --> 00:16:33.100
But one person

00:16:33.124 --> 00:16:35.219
added to another person,

00:16:35.243 --> 00:16:36.886
added to another person,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.965
multiplied by millions,

00:16:39.989 --> 00:16:44.915
were able to become the advance guard
of the civil rights movement.

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:48.352
One person added to another person,

00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:49.987
added to another person,

00:16:50.011 --> 00:16:51.169
multiplied by millions,

00:16:51.193 --> 00:16:53.542
acting on a single decision,

00:16:53.566 --> 00:16:58.301
were able to change the region
that they had been forced to flee.

00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:03.079
They had more power in leaving

00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:04.526
than by staying.

00:17:06.703 --> 00:17:08.107
By their actions,

00:17:08.131 --> 00:17:11.965
these people who had absolutely nothing

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:15.943
were able to do what a president
of the United States,

00:17:15.967 --> 00:17:18.616
Abraham Lincoln, was not able to do.

00:17:19.586 --> 00:17:22.657
These people, by their actions,

00:17:22.681 --> 00:17:23.850
were able to do

00:17:23.874 --> 00:17:27.141
what the Emancipation
Proclamation could not do.

00:17:28.411 --> 00:17:31.784
These people, by their actions,

00:17:31.808 --> 00:17:35.207
were able to do what the powers that be,

00:17:35.231 --> 00:17:37.556
North and South,

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.357
could not or would not do.

00:17:41.618 --> 00:17:43.109
They freed themselves.

00:17:43.991 --> 00:17:45.165
Thank you.

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:51.223
(Applause)

00:17:51.247 --> 00:17:52.398
Thank you.

00:17:52.422 --> 00:17:54.357
(Applause)
