00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.430
Finally, I want to emphasize again that a key requirement

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.880
in mobile web development is optimizing for battery usage. Battery

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.690
life in your user's mobile device is an incredibly precious

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.180
resource. So I want to call this out as an explicit

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.970
goal, even though it's hard to directly measure. The best

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.450
way to optimize battery life is, well, to only do work

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.420
when you need to. This may seem pretty obvious, but

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.470
all the things we've talked about in this lesson are applicable

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.990
to this. In fact, network usage, computation, and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.970
rendering are all heavy indicators of battery usage.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.100
But the other APIs we'll talk about later

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.610
can also affect this. For example, using the GPS

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.910
changes battery usage, as does the camera. One

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.430
final comment, there are several tools out there

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.310
that will analyze your page for you and

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.840
make some suggestions on how to improve your performance.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.080
My personal favorite, of course, is PageSpeed Insights

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.750
which is a Google tool that you can

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.850
point at any website and it will give

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.510
you feedback on your performance. With that, and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930
the tools you've acquired in this lesson, you're

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.780
on your way to designing performant web apps.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.170
In the problem set, we're going to be

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.914
going over testing the conference app, with PageSpeed.
