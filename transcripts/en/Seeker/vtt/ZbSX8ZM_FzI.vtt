00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.650
We like to think of precious works of art
as timeless. That da Vinci’s Mona Lisa will

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.130
smile for centuries to come, but what happens
when the march of time wears on and the colors

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.130
fade?

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.859
Well that’s when science steps in.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.410
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.850
We like to think of art as a way to make ourselves
immortal. We’ll remember da Vinci’s name

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.119
because of the Last Supper, we’ll remember
Van Gogh in the bright yellow of his sunflowers.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.000
But time is a cruel mistress, and so is moisture,
soot, and light. The effects of which dull

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.239
and damage priceless works of art.

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.450
So art restoration is as old as art itself.
As soon as the paint on Da Vinci’s The Last

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.730
Supper was dry it started to crack. And so
over the course of a few centuries, it’s

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.219
been repainted, glazed over, and touched up
numerous times. Many others famous works of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.140
art, including “The View of Delft” by
Johannes Vermeer, have been retouched dozens

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.539
of times over the years. Sometimes the change
is a restoration, to preserve or fix a damaged

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.431
piece, other times a change is made to reflect
the changing times. So the art you seen in

00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:04.540
a museum may have be touched by more than
a few hands.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.750
But that’s part of the problem, art restorations
that seemed like a good idea at the time,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.290
turned out to be disasters when new information
is revealed years later. According to Yale

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.430
Scientific “Old conservation manuals suggested
covering the entire painting in wood-ash and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.540
then wiping it off with water, a process that
caused an extremely alkaline substance harmful

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.140
to the painting to form.”

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.960
So the standby of restoration nowadays is
to “ ‘ensure that you do no harm to the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.060
work, and that wherever possible anything
you do could be reversed by a later generation’.”

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.380
In some cases the passage of time means the
accumulation of dirt and grime, as seen with

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.500
the Sistine Chapel which underwent a massive
restoration that began in the late 1980s.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.479
The solvent, called AB-57, is made of bicarbonate
of sodium and ammonium and carefully applied

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.720
by brush. After sitting for a few minutes,
it would be wiped away along with any grime

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.820
and layer of glue. That layer of glue is a
matter of some controversy.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.860
Some historians claim it was Michelangelo's
doing, other’s claim it was a disastrous

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.810
restoration made years later. It’s hard
to tell what Michelangelo’s original intent

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.860
was. It’s not like there were photographs
back then, conservationists had to rely on

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.319
what people were writing about when the frescoes
were first displayed.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.590
And that’s one of the hard things to know
about art that’s been around for awhile.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.810
Is it grime or varnish or pigments put there
by the painter?

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.020
Luckily with modern science, conservationists
can figure out some of the answers without

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.069
destroying priceless works of art.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.830
Great art should always see the light of day,
but sometimes the light is the cause of the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.750
art’s demise in a process called photodegradation.
Basically the energy from light, especially

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.470
UV light causes the chemical bonds in dyes
to break. This essentially makes the colors

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.580
fade.
Which is one of the reasons you’re not allowed

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.879
to use flash photography in a museum.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.160
But light can be a solution too. Many restoration
attempts start with an x-ray or infrared imaging.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.709
Infrared imaging works by detecting all of
the wavelengths of light that the painting

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.050
absorbs and reflects, which is more than the
human eye can see. Some of these infrared

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.489
wavelengths penetrate deeper than visible
light. By getting past the paint, these infrared

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.260
wavelengths can see other layers of the work,
revealing underdrawings and previous versions

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.629
of the work. Which can help tell restorers
about the artist's original intent.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.530
Like one recent analysis by Engineer Pascal
Cotte revealed that da Vinci changed in his

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.920
mind. A lot. One painting, Lady with an Ermine
went through three different versions before

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.540
he decided on the iconic white ermine we know
today. The painting was analyzed by a new

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.140
technique called Layer Amplification Method
(LAM) pioneered by Cotte himself. The technique

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.690
uses intense pulses of light to see between
the layers of paint.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.209
Cotte told the BBC that with this technique
"We've discovered that Leonardo is always

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.980
changing his mind, "This is someone who hesitates
- he erases things, he adds things, he changes

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.790
his mind again and again."

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.680
Just as light can damage and even reveal art,
light can even breathe life into old work.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.939
Until the late 1970s, Harvard University had
murals by famous painter Mark Rothko hanging

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.670
in their cafeteria. Not surprisingly after
years of damage from light and college kids,

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.269
the paintings went into storage. When they
reemerged in 2014, the paintings were badly

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.709
faded. Rather than turn to traditional restoration
methods, Harvard turned toward technology.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.519
After finding the original colors from old
photographs and other paintings, a computational

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.799
photographer from MIT Ramesh Raskar, designed
an algorithm to match the old colors. Then

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.880
those colors were beamed at the paintings
from wall mounted projectors. It produced

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.389
the illusion that the murals were as bright
as the day they were painted.

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.520
As for da Vinci's most iconic piece, the Last
Supper thanks to centuries of wear, bombing,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.770
and poor fresco experimentation, it will never
again return to its former glory. But maybe

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.240
technology can bring it back to life in a
way. In 2012, a group scientists from Leonardo3,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.910
a Milan based museum, digitally restored the
painting. Without laying a finger on the fragile

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.080
fresco they reconstructed it through high
definition photographs. Painstakingly reimagined

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.030
in pixels rather than pigments, the new digital
version revealed details like a salt shaker

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.639
that appears to have been knocked over by
Judas and maybe even a shadow of the artist

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.639
himself.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.940
Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance man. In
his time there were no clear boundaries between

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.039
the arts and the sciences, it was all within
the pursuit of knowledge. He might have found

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.370
math as eloquent and beautiful as any of his
masterpieces. Mathematician Tara Long discusses

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.850
a study that shows how math can be perceived
as a beautiful piece of art in the brain in

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.350
this video right here.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:35.630
So what do you think?

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.479
Should art be restored if it’s damaged?

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.180
Or should the passing of time be included
in how we see a piece?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.669
