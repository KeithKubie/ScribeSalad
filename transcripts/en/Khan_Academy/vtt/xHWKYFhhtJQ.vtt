00:00:00.377 --> 00:00:03.034
- I now want to show you
that the standard algorithm

00:00:03.034 --> 00:00:06.016
for multiplying numbers can also be used,

00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:07.824
it's not just limited to base 10,

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:10.035
it can also be used, frankly
it can be used in any base,

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:11.264
but we're going to do it in base two.

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:13.033
And base two is especially fun,

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.889
because you essentially have only to know

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.531
your multiplication tables through one.

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:21.177
So you just have to know
that zero times zero is zero,

00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:22.764
one times zero is zero,

00:00:22.764 --> 00:00:24.562
and that one times one is one.

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:25.534
And then you're ready to go,

00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:27.772
you're ready to multiply in base two.

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:29.056
So let's do that.

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:31.605
So let's say we have...

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:35.517
Let's say we take nine,

00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:39.193
so let's see, nine is
going to be one eight

00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:44.193
zero fours, zero twos and one.

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:49.753
So this is nine, right over
here, represented in base two.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.043
And let's say we were to multiply that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.001
times seven, so we should, obviously,

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.081
if we know our multiplication tables

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.025
we should get 63.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:03.256
So seven is one; actually
I'm going to put a zero,

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:04.601
seven would be one one one,

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:05.881
but that's a little bit boring

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.169
so let's instead do

00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:12.009
nine times five, which
we know should be 45.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.392
So this is one four, no twos, and one one.

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.881
So four plus one is going to be five.

00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:20.893
So this is nine times five

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:24.257
and we're doing it in base two.

00:01:24.747 --> 00:01:26.837
So once again, same algorithm.

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:28.138
And actually, before I do it,

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:29.336
I encourage you to just pause the video,

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:31.406
and try to use the same algorithm

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:34.133
that you've used for
base ten multiplication,

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.092
use the same algorithm here

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:37.633
and let's see if we actually do get

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:41.157
that nine times five is 45.

00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:42.791
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it,

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:44.516
let's work through it together.

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:46.451
So let's start right over here

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:48.086
in the ones place.

00:01:48.086 --> 00:01:50.073
So we multiply, one times one is one,

00:01:50.073 --> 00:01:54.099
one times zero is zero,
one times zero is zero,

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.063
one times one is one.

00:01:57.063 --> 00:01:59.364
Then, we can go

00:01:59.364 --> 00:02:01.272
to the twos place

00:02:01.272 --> 00:02:04.047
and since we're multiplying
all of this times

00:02:04.047 --> 00:02:07.636
the twos place, we can throw
a zero right over here.

00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:09.246
But, of course, zero times each of these

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.933
is just going to be a bunch of zeros,

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.029
you know, zero times one is zero,

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:15.065
zero times zero is zero,
zero times zero is zero,

00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:16.884
zero times one is zero.

00:02:16.884 --> 00:02:18.452
So I really didn't have to write that,

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:20.138
but I'm just doing it so that you see

00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:22.380
that I'm using the standard algorithm.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.237
And then, we go to the fours place.

00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:28.644
And since we're in the fours place,

00:02:28.644 --> 00:02:30.308
let's put some zeros here.

00:02:30.308 --> 00:02:32.702
So zero, zero.

00:02:33.394 --> 00:02:34.918
We're essentially talking about

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:36.234
a certain number of fours,

00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:38.043
not a certain number of ones.

00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:40.053
So one times that is just going to be

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:44.245
one, zero, zero, one.

00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:46.215
And now we're ready to add.

00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:49.379
Now we are ready to add.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.244
So one plus a bunch of zeros is one,

00:02:52.244 --> 00:02:53.859
a bunch of zeros,

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.668
that's going to be one,

00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:57.827
one plus a bunch of zeros is one,

00:02:57.827 --> 00:03:00.202
zeros, and one.

00:03:00.202 --> 00:03:01.466
And we're done.

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:04.026
And obviously if we had more than one one

00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:06.073
in any of these places right over here,

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:08.291
then we might have had to carry a one.

00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:12.884
But we saw that, when we
added numbers in binary.

00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:14.012
Well, let's actually verify

00:03:14.012 --> 00:03:16.059
that this is the number that
we would expect it to be.

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:17.875
Remember, this right over
here is the ones place-

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:19.948
so let's see, this is ones,

00:03:19.948 --> 00:03:21.347
fours, let me write it down,

00:03:21.347 --> 00:03:26.347
this is ones, twos, fours,
eights, 16s and 32s.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.119
So we have one 32,

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.196
so it's going to be 32,

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:39.987
plus one eight,

00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:41.859
and once again, we only have
to do this for ourselves

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.593
because we're so used
to thinking in base 10.

00:03:43.593 --> 00:03:44.953
If we were thinking in base two,

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:46.548
you'd say, "Oh, I know
what this number is,"

00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:48.228
and you would have some name for it,

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.909
probably different than 45,

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.100
because 45, the name
essentially is kind of

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.268
a base 10 name and we'd
probably have better names

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.310
in terms of base two.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.286
Somebody should actually do that,

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:03.427
that would be a fun project.

00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:05.147
So let's see, we have 32,

00:04:05.147 --> 00:04:07.364
plus eight,

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:11.652
plus four, plus four,

00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:15.174
plus one, plus one.

00:04:15.174 --> 00:04:18.948
Which is indeed equal to 45.
