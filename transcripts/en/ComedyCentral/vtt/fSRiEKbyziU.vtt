- Sorry if this book report's
not very good.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.541 align:start position:0%
I've been up late
working hard on it,

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.076 align:start position:0%
but then also "School Ties"
came on,

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.711 align:start position:0%
and that's one of
my favorite movies,

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.312 align:end size:66% position:66%
which is surprising,
'cause I don't like

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:16.082 size:88% position:44%
anything school-related, but
I love Jewish-themed movies.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.483 align:start size:56% position:44%
- No, that's okay.

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.751 align:start position:0%
- Why are you interrupting
the book report?

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.620
- Oh, I didn't realize you...

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.655 align:end position:100%
Are you reading that
off the page?

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.457
- Yes!
- Oh. Sorry.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.292 align:end position:100%
It was so conversational,
I thought we were just talking.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.694 align:start position:0%
- Okay, well now I lost
my frickin' spot.

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:30.730
- I'm sorry.
- Just let me...

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
All flustered now.
[clears throat]

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.369 align:start position:0%
I did my book report on

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.072 align:start position:0%
"Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas."

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.675 align:start position:0%
I liked it slash it was
confusing as [bleep].

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.710 align:start position:0%
The book starts
with Raoul Duke

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:46.412 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel
of a convertible.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.714
<i> [eagle screeches]</i>

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:52.085
<i> He realizes the drugs he took
 earlier are kicking in.</i>

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:52.718
- They're kicking in,
the drugs, yes?

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.487
- [garbled mumbling]

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.190
<i> - Next to him sits
 his 300-pound attorney,</i>

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:01.794
<i> Dr. Gonzo,
 aka The Fat Samoan.</i>

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.496
- [mumbles]

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:05.398
<i> - They were headed
 to Vegas from L.A.</i>

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.833
- Let's go to Vegas.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.768
<i> - And there were bats
 and stuff.</i>

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.371
- I see two more.
- I see bats.

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:17.243
- It's real. It's real.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.711
<i> - They're on their way
 to Vegas,</i>

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:20.246
<i> but they got derailed</i>

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.115
<i> because Lenny is like,</i>

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.117
<i> "Curley, what's up
 with your hand?"</i>

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.585 align:start position:0%
- I like to keep my hand
nice and soft

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.754
so I can touch my girlfriend.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.723 align:start position:0%
Aw, that feels gross.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
Wait, who's Lennie?

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.794 align:end position:100%
- Me--sometimes, uh,
Raoul Duke

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:36.395 align:start size:66% position:34%
calls himself Lennie.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:37.730 align:start position:0%
- Got it.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:38.798
<i> - So they took off.</i>

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.234 align:start size:81% position:19%
- This plane's going fast.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.137 align:start position:0%
- I don't think planes
were invented yet.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.838
<i>- They continued their journey.</i>

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.908 align:start size:66% position:34%
- Cow, cow, cow, cow.

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.177 align:start position:0%
- That's not a cow.
That's a tire.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.146
<i> - It was much easier
 for them to get to Vegas</i>

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.149
by taking the good<i> ol'
 Mississippi River.</i>

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.783 align:start position:0%
- We gotta catch that
riverboat.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.785 align:start size:59% position:41%
- I agree with you.

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:01.554 align:start position:0%
- You catch anything?

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:03.289 align:start size:59% position:41%
- Just this minnow.

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.724 align:start size:19% position:81%
Uh-oh.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:05.758 align:start size:38% position:63%
You want it?

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.727 align:start position:0%
- Nice minnow!

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.231
<i> - And by that time, Dr. Gonzo
 was a free man.</i>

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:13.466 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Gene.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
- Whoosh.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.302
- Gene!
- Sup?

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:18.404 align:end position:100%
- Okay.
Gimme that.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:20.606
- Okay.
- And get off my desk.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.476 align:start position:0%
- Jeez. Demanding.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:24.844 align:start position:0%
Any questions?

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
You with the stupid glasses
in the front?

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:29.248 align:end position:100%
- How many of the books
that I gave you did you read?

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:31.217 align:end position:100%
'Cause it feels like you read
parts of all of them

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.652 align:end position:100%
without noticing
they were different,

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.420
and wove them into one story.

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:36.822 align:start position:0%
- Okay, CSI Miami,
if you say so.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.357 align:start position:0%
Or--any of the CSI's
would work.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.394 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Didn't you notice that
the names kept changing?

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.895 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, but I thought
they were, like, nicknames.

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:45.565 align:start position:0%
Like, how some people call me
"Genie" or "Goosetits."

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.333 align:start position:0%
Really wish that one
would go away.

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:48.868 align:end position:100%
- How is that
even possible?

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.838 align:start position:0%
- Oh, guys said that my tits
looked like goose beaks.
