00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.860
We need to modify the service worker
to intercept requests to the API.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.050
And store responses in the cache so
that we can easily access them later.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.800
It's good practice to
keep the resources for

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.250
your app shell separate
from the application data.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.270
That way you can update one
without disturbing the other.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.081
In the service-worker,

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:28.560
I've added a data cache name
variable to the service-worker.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.590
Next, I need to modify
the fetch event handler

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.690
to handle requests to the data
API separate from other requests.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.710
The fetch event handler first
checks the requested URL

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.030
to see if it starts with
the address of the weather API.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.890
If it does,
it makes a network request for the data.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.290
Once the response is returned
the code opens the data cache,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.558
clones the response,
stores it in the cache.

00:00:57.558 --> 00:01:02.155
And finally returns the response
to the original requester.
