then you zoom in again a divorce you

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140
then you zoom in again a divorce you
 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.320
then you zoom in again a divorce you
know you zoom into that tumbler that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330
know you zoom into that tumbler that
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.630
know you zoom into that tumbler that
have 1% and you see the same sort of

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
have 1% and you see the same sort of
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.170
have 1% and you see the same sort of
distribution it sort of reading scribed

as and even within the top 0.1% they

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870
as and even within the top 0.1% they
 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.920
as and even within the top 0.1% they
still feel this way they never become

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
still feel this way they never become

still feel this way they never become
secure in there they always you know now

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769
secure in there they always you know now

secure in there they always you know now
one of my sort of big picture views of

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920
one of my sort of big picture views of
 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.729
one of my sort of big picture views of
the world has always been that well what

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739
the world has always been that well what
 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.599
the world has always been that well what
we're seeing is increasing inequality

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609
we're seeing is increasing inequality
 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.430
we're seeing is increasing inequality
within countries especially if you look

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
within countries especially if you look
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.599
within countries especially if you look
at the number of billionaires who are

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609
at the number of billionaires who are
 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.940
at the number of billionaires who are
being created like Mexico China India

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950
being created like Mexico China India
 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.309
being created like Mexico China India
increasing anybody really has you put

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319
increasing anybody really has you put
 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.520
increasing anybody really has you put
decreasing and quality between country

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
decreasing and quality between country
 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.129
decreasing and quality between country
yeah so the difference between the US

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139
yeah so the difference between the US
 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.960
yeah so the difference between the US
and China has never been smaller that's

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970
and China has never been smaller that's
 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.510
and China has never been smaller that's
why I mean on since about

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520
 
 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.290
 
so so is there somewhere in this

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300
so so is there somewhere in this
 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.550
so so is there somewhere in this
exponential graph is is the fact that

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560
exponential graph is is the fact that
 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.590
exponential graph is is the fact that
the countries of the world are coming

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600
the countries of the world are coming
 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.680
the countries of the world are coming
together maybe the sort of silver lining

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690
together maybe the sort of silver lining
 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.380
together maybe the sort of silver lining
of this and even though we're seeing

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390
of this and even though we're seeing
 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.650
of this and even though we're seeing
this global international

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660
this global international
 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.630
this global international
photographically it's somehow because

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640
photographically it's somehow because
 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.010
photographically it's somehow because
rural countries like that and they're

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020
rural countries like that and they're
 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.690
rural countries like that and they're
all in the same boat that somehow that's

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700
all in the same boat that somehow that's
 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.570
all in the same boat that somehow that's
going to help improve muscle disease

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580
going to help improve muscle disease
 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.950
going to help improve muscle disease
international so they're ready of the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960
international so they're ready of the
 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.480
international so they're ready of the
working man I have no that would be

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490
working man I have no that would be
 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:23.330
working man I have no that would be
great but I mean I think from my

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340
great but I mean I think from my
 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.410
great but I mean I think from my
perspective sustainable just and so and

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420
perspective sustainable just and so and
 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.610
perspective sustainable just and so and
so the question is whether that is I

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620
so the question is whether that is I
 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:47.090
so the question is whether that is I
think distinct from the question of what

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100
think distinct from the question of what
 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.240
think distinct from the question of what
kind of social welfare state and they

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250
kind of social welfare state and they
 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.710
kind of social welfare state and they
make noises about increasing land

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720
make noises about increasing land
 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.310
make noises about increasing land
there's small things but I really want

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320
there's small things but I really want
 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.810
there's small things but I really want
to hope that the increased prosperity

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820
to hope that the increased prosperity
 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.150
to hope that the increased prosperity
that we see poverty as it has continued

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160
that we see poverty as it has continued
 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.850
that we see poverty as it has continued
to do but that's combined with some real
