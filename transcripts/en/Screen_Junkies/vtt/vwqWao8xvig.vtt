00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.090
The following trailer is written S for spoilers

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.400
The world hangs in the balance

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.780
Tom Cruise will hang in balance

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.140
in the franchise that keeps pushing him to top the last one

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.600
until he dies making one of these and we examine our own

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700
role in this deadly game of stunt chicken

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.300
But until then...

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.620
you jump off that roof, you jumped, good boy, whoa

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.760
Mission Impossible:

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.940
Fallout

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.460
Rejoin the impossible mission force...

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.460
on their most dangerous mission yet ,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.220
getting their hands on some balls.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.540
As Ethan Hunt loses his balls,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.840
tracks the balls down,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.520
and has his best friends and ex-wife work together to stop those balls from exploding

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.080
I don't have enough hands.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.540
Tom, buddy. We know you still got it.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.820
You want to ram it down our throats with the metaphors?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.140
Hmm, you've seen every mi yet.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.980
So of course you were thrilled when Solomon Lane returned

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.360
No? You don't remember him?

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.140
Well, you do remember the badass M.I.6 agent, Elsa.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.120
No, that's his wife remarried in M.I 3

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.820
That's just some random cop.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.460
That's Katie Holmes.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.520
Okay, that's her.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.140
And you remember the evil syndicate, right?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.500
That's Hydra. That's Spectre. Fine.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.160
Forget everything you never remembered in the first place...

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.640
because our heroes are up against the apostles,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.480
and they've got a plan to wipe out 1/3 of the global population.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.460
That's Thanos. I said 1/3 not 1/2.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.240
They're gonna stop 1/3 of the world's population.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.120
Look newbie,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.760
I'm here to watch Tom hang from stuff...

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.860
where six missions in and I still call the ving rhymes character bing rhymes

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.220
Even the people in the films he lost this time.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.120
It's complicated.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.580
What the hell is he doing?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.440
What the hell is he doing?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.540
What the hell are you doing?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.720
I don't understand what I'm involved in?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.440
What am I involved in?

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.620
Why did you have to make this so fxxking complicated?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.620
Joining the gang,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.920
or if you saw the trailer,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.860
betraying the gang,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.960
is a secret agent August Walker,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.720
a role that cements Henry Cavill as the new king of men's room scenes

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.120
He's a spy that could go undercover...

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.520
as anyone from an NFL linebacker...

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520
to Hagar from final fight

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.540
Complete with arms that require reload

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.480
and a moustache so powerful

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.300
It could cripple the DCEU, so, you know

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.340
It's gonna go down when he finally faces off against its most brutal foe yet

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.720
Alec Baldwin?

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.620
Alec, he went out of the franchise just disappear like Jeremy Renner did,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.660
or Paula Patton

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.900
or Tandy Newton

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.080
or Jonathan Rhys Meyers

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.340
or Laurence Fishburne

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.020
or Anthony Hopkins,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.380
Why did these people go?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.160
Are they "the apostles"?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.760
So, if you like the same potent mix of intrigue,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.960
and cardio as the last five of these things,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.240
and don't mind that they still lean on mask trick pretty hard

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.560
Or use the same halo jump sequence as two other bad robot productions,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.400
or have a weirdly similar ending to return of the King

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.580
Enjoy one of the best action movies of the year...

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.700
because the next one might be his last

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.620
Ohhhh...

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.680
Tom, you've given us enough, stop.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.770
STARRING

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.770
the man from swole

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.340
Thetan hunt

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.620
I'm the hat man.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.420
Keep up a fight up up

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.060
Benji man's buttons, you know, cuz he's Manning the buttons.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.500
Ilsa Me, Rebecca Ferguson

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.340
Hannibal Lectures

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.840
Scarlett Johansson

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.280
Scarlett Johansson?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.280
Wow. What a chameleon.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.600
Jack Tryin'

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600
, and fake news

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.700
Stuntman V Superman: Tom of Justice

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.100
Have a seat.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.380
The Nubra River Valley

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.060
Is an ending rangs contract that he never has to stand up?

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.060
Well, good.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.380
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea Josh Peck gives me goosebumps

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.900
They did surgery on a grape

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.279
 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
You sit on a throne of lies

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.700
We are young. Life is fun

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Tonest trailer
