00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.220
One of DNews' camerapeeps is going to the
Caribbean, even though she KNOWS a hurricane

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.279
is bearing down right now!

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.340
How do we know storms are going to hit so
far in advance?

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.480
Hope it doesn't ruin your vacay, Liz!

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.749
From a scientific perspective, hurricanes
are amazing to behold.

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.539
They're raw, powerful nature in all its destructive
glory.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.060
But humanity's constructions and alterations
to our environment don't hold up well to hundred-mile-per-hour

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.270
winds or the sea's violent encroachment onto
the shore.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.340
Hurricanes form when warm, moist tropical
air rises, letting cooler air fall into the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.220
now-low pressure area below.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.710
As that heats, it rises too, letting more
cool air move in...

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.510
Over time, this causes a cycling, swirling
mass of air, pressure and wind that speeds

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.120
up before being thrown away from the tropics,
sometimes in the direction of land.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.580
Category 5 hurricanes, the most powerful storm
on Earth, can create 155 mph (250kph) winds

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.489
and 19 plus foot (5.8M) surges of water called
storm surge.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.869
Needless to say, it helps to know they're
coming so we can hightail it out of the way.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.619
In 1937, a surprise hurricane hit New England
and killed 600 people.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.469
Before we could predict them, we had to learn
how they formed and how to track them.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.200
In the earliest days of hurricane prediction,
the best we could do was fly out and meet

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.200
it.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.390
Pilots literally flew toward a storm to learn
more about them!

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.389
We've been flying INTO HURRICANES since 1943,
when members of the Army Air Corps flew into

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:35.259
a hurricane off the coast of Texas sporting
132 mph winds (212kph).

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.719
These brave men learned about how hurricane
air temperature changes from the edge of the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.049
storm moving to the interior; and were able
to track the storm on a path, laying a foundation

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.639
for the first hurricane warning predictions.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:51.500
A year later, in 1944, pilots were able to
get warning to New England and only 50 were

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.459
killed when a hurricane struck.

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.249
Hurricane prediction can save hundreds of
lives!

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:01.740
Now in the 21st century… with all this technology
around us… we're still flying into storms.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.689
IT'S STILL ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO LEARN ABOUT
THEM!

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.019
The Hurricane Hunters are part of the 53rd
Weather Reconnaissance Squadron/403rd Wing

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.640
and they are the "only operational unit in
the world flying weather reconnaissance on

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.819
a routine basis."

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.650
They provide surveillance of tropical storms
and hurricanes all over the world and deliver

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.640
that information to the World Meteorological
Association's Miami Regional Specialized Meteorological

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.510
Center or RSMC.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.459
Today, the planes are equipped with more than
just thermometers… they have data-gathering

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.530
tools to map winds and formations, and planes
deploy "Dropwindsondes" throughout the storms…

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.040
Dropwindsondes are expendable parachuted cylinders
that measure "temperature, pressure, winds,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.069
and humidity every half-second."

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.060
That information is supported by satellites
from NASA, ocean buoys from NOAA and ground

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.810
stations and monitoring platforms spread across
the Earth's continents, island and oceans.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.950
All the data is relayed to the RSMCs in Miami,
Honolulu, New Delhi, Tokyo, Nadi in the Pacific

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.450
and La Réunion (off the coast of Madagascar).

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.799
RSMCs are the front line for informing the
public about any coming storms, but first,

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.569
we have to know what we're dealing with.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.159
Once they have the data, scientists plug it
into constantly revised and updated computer

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.239
models.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.489
NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration has two supercomputers that

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.909
only run simulations of storms.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.890
These computer models churn through all the
new data and all past data to render the storms

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.709
in 3D and predict where they'll go and how
strong they'll be.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.020
Like with any science, as more data is gathered,
the predictions get more accurate.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.690
But even still, hurricane prediction is not
an exact science.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.510
Since 2003, predictions on hurricanes in the
U.S. have been delivered 120 hours before

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.870
landfall, 96 hours before, 72, 48, 24, and
12.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.550
At 120 hours before landfall (or five days
out), the margin of error for where the storm

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.140
will actually hit can be 350 MILES (563km)
off!

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.190
350 mile margin of error means they could
evacuate New Orleans, only to have the hurricane

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.630
smack into Pensacola, Florida or East Texas!

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.489
That's a big difference.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.579
By the last 24 hours, they've got it down
to 100 mile error margin (160km) or less.

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.631
Predictions get more accurate as the hurricane
gets closer, and more data is collected, but

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:20.329
bad predictions severely affect residents
being forced to evacuate, and can cost lives,

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.329
and money.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.430
The reason it's so hard, is because data can
be flawed or incomplete, the flights couldn't

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.020
get to where the meteorologists needed, ocean
monitoring buoys could be damaged, or a ground

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.020
station might be!

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.440
And still, sometimes, the satellites aren't
good enough, or the computer models just aren't

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.520
accurate enough.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.150
It's a constant battle to make prediction
better, and to add to the arsenal NASA is

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.020
launching eight microsatellites to track global
hurricanes and forecast their movements.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.330
CYGNSS or the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite
System will work together, and with GPS satellites,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.800
to measure winds and waves on the ocean surface,
as well as surface and cloud temperatures,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.280
heat radiation, ocean roughness and hurricane
intensity, and also how temperatures move

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.120
WITHIN storms (called convective dynamics)
-- just like those 1940s pilots.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.310
CYGNSS will be ready before the 2017 hurricane
season, which is good, because Earth's hurricanes

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.870
seem to be intensifying and becoming more
common; so every little bit helps.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.490
Thanks to this vast network of collaborating
applied sciences, we know a hurricane is coming

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.050
many days in advance!

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.970
Which is a huge leap in only 70 years.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.060
Thanks to these systems, scientists can monitor
and inform the public about every tropical

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:54.880
cyclone, hurricane, and typhoon anywhere in
the world.
