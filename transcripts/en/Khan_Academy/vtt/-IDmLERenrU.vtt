00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.530
You've probably heard the term
short sale, and have at least

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.390
a general-- oh, what
did I do with that?

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.440
Oh there it is, I scrolled
down-- you probably have a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.800
general idea that it means, to
some degree, making a bet that

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.060
a stock will fall.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.800
And there's been a lot of news
lately that maybe short

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.480
sellers are to blame for a lot
of the stock market crashes,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.580
or what's happening
with banks.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.620
So I thought it would be
worthwhile to at least explain

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.040
what a short sale is.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.210
And then we could talk a little
bit about whether

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.030
they're positive or negative,
or they could be both.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.650
So you are right if you think
that a short sale is some type

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.600
of a bet that a stock
can go down.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.920
But how does it work?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.280
So let's say that, I don't know,
IBM-- and I don't know

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.200
where IBM is trading right now--
but let's say IBM is

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.760
right now-- the last
trade was at $100.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.680
And I'm convinced.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.790
I've done my research, I've done
my analysis, and I'm just

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.190
convinced that the stock price
of IBM is going to fall.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.620
I think IBM is going to have a
horrible quarter next quarter.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.670
That some other competitor
is going to take

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.570
their business, whatever.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.690
I'm convinced it's going
to fall to $50.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.750
This is what I think.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.390
I think it's going to fall
to $50, based on

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.070
my deep stock analysis.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.450
And so, the general idea is that
I should-- well I won't

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.270
make any value judgment right
now-- but I want to know if

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.650
there's a way that I can make
money off of my deep analysis.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.480
And the way I do that is I go
to my brokerage-- so let me

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.510
draw some diagrams. So this is
my brokerage, this is my

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.320
broker, and this is
me right here.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.530
This is me.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.310
I have a top hat.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.990
Anyway, so I go to the broker
and I say broker, I would like

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.840
to short IBM.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.500
I would like-- let's just say
for simplicity I want to short

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.950
one share of IBM.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.400
So what I do is I go to the
broker, and I say broker, can

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.220
I borrow a share of IBM?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.140
And this is a little unintuitive
the first time

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.850
people learn about it.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.100
It was a little unintuitive
for me the first time I

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.490
learned about the notion
of borrowing a share.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.480
But you can also view it
as renting a share.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.539
And you might say well,
where's the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.800
broker getting it from?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.790
Well this broker's got
a ton of clients.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.900
Let me draw some of them.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.270
His eyes were strange.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.120
OK, so this broker has
a ton of clients,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.450
many of whom own IBM.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.590
And they keep their shares
of IBM with the broker.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.500
So the broker always has-- let's
say each of these is a

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.750
share of IBM.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.280
And these guys are all
owners of IBM.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.960
And if ever, one day, this guy
wanted to sell his share of

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.930
IBM, the broker would go out
there, sell it in the market,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.800
or maybe this guy
would sell it,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.030
depending on how it's done.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.360
And then this would be replaced
with the money, and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.010
this would then become
$100, right?

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.890
And then if IBM issues a
dividend, if it says OK, all

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.580
of our shareholders will get
$5.00 from a company.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.180
And then each of these
guys would get $5.00.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.650
So they're all just shareholders
in the company.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.980
And also, just so you know, as
opposed to being short the

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.080
company, they're long.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.070
When you go long [? on a ?]

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.970
security, you're buying
the security.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.320
When you go short, as you'll
see, you're borrowing the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.300
security and selling it.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.340
So let's see how that works.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.890
So once again I go to my broker
and I say broker, I

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.040
want to borrow a share of IBM.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.160
And the broker says OK, well
I've got all these share

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.000
sitting around here.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.010
And they're really not
doing anything.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.000
I'll lend you this share
right there.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.050
And stick it in my account.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.170
And I'm going to have to pay
rent to borrow that share.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.580
You can kind of view it as
either interest on borrowing

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.690
the share, or you can
view it as rent.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.110
Rent is sometimes
more intuitive.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.050
Because whenever we talk about
when you rent someone's

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.390
apartment, you're really kind of
borrowing their apartment.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.130
Then you can kind of view
the rent as the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.600
interest on the apartment.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.840
Or the other way to view it,
when you borrow money, the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.250
interest is kind of
rent on the money.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.690
Anyway, I think you
get the idea.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.660
But I'll borrow this.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.730
And you'll say hey wait, Sal,
that doesn't make sense.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.430
How can you just borrow
this guy's stock?

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.710
I mean, this guy might want
to sell it the next day.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.980
And that's a good question.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.470
If this guy wants to-- let's say
I borrow his stock, it's

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.220
not sitting there anymore.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.370
If this guy wants to sell his
stock the second after I

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.760
borrow it, the broker is just
going to take-- he's just

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.360
going to shuffle around the
stocks a little bit.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.019
I mean, you know stocks are--
they call it fungible, you can

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.770
replace one stock certificate
with the other.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.860
They're no different.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.540
So then he'll say OK,
I'll just give this

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.150
stock to this guy.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.310
Whoops.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.710
I just messed up with my pen.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.600
I'll just give this stock to the
guy who wants to sell it,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.610
and then you would
have essentially

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.870
borrowed from this guy.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.940
And you could keep rearranging
the securities so that none of

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.740
these guys ever know that
their stock is borrowed.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.550
Although you have to give
permission, especially if

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.300
these guys own the
stock outright.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.870
They have to give permission to
let the stock be borrowed,

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.910
and they benefit, because they
get some cut, hopefully, they

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.960
get some cut of the rent, or the
interest that I'm paying.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.640
So it's beneficial to them.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.940
And the broker can never, well
it should never, really, lend

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.300
out all of the shares here.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.290
Just so that it can keep
shuffling around.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.750
And we'll talk about what
happens if you actually try to

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.360
do this with a share that
you've never borrowed.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.620
We'll do that in
a future thing.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.960
But the general idea is, you
borrow one of these shares out

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.570
here, and then the broker can
kind of keep shuffling around

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.780
these shares, if any of these
guys really want to get rid of

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.460
their share.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.410
And let's say I've borrowed
this guy's.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.930
Let's say I originally borrowed
this guy's share.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.360
This guy wanted to
sell his share.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.480
So what the broker does is, he
takes this share, gives it to

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.430
him, and now I have officially
borrowed this guy's share.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.170
Right?

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.770
This is the share I'm borrowing
now because this

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.490
one's been sold.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.070
Now, what happens if IBM
issues a dividend?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.190
It says every one of our
shareholders should get $5.00.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.240
Well this guy's expecting
a $5.00 check.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.130
Or he expects $5.00
to be deposited in

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.600
his brokerage account.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.760
For that to happen, I
essentially have to write this

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.160
guy the $5.00 check.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.770
So I have to make it look, or
at least the broker is going

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.700
to force me to make it
look like this guy

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.460
still owns the share.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.320
So anything that this guy gets
by being a shareholder of this

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.240
stock, I have to provide
for him.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.740
Anyway, so I've borrowed
the stock.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.530
Now what do I do with it?

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.805
My whole thesis here is that IBM
is going to $50, so how do

00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:17.420
I make money off of that?

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.980
So I [? set ?]

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.060
[? this ?]

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.570
trading right now at $100.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.810
I've borrowed this share.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.610
So I sell it.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.590
So let's see, the first thing is
I borrow one share, as I've

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.390
done there.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.790
And now I sell it
on the market.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.760
And we said it's selling
for $100.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.160
I sell it for $100.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.010
So I sell it to the market.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.580
Let's say the market is
out here to the left.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.980
So I sell to the market,
and I get $100.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.700
So let's see what's happening
right now.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.420
What's my current state
of affairs?

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.900
Let's say assets-- and I'll talk
about margin requirements

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.660
later-- liabilities.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.070
What do I have, what do I owe?

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.650
So now I have $100.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.820
And what do I owe?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.920
I owe one share of IBM.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.850
Let's say my analysis ends
up being correct,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.100
often times it won't.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.210
And we'll talk a little bit more
about why short selling

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.310
can be extremely risky.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.030
But let's say my analysis is
correct, and a couple of days

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.270
later IBM starts
trading at $50.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.790
What I can do now is unwind my
trade, or cover my short.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.460
And the way I do this, is
I have $100, right?

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.120
What I can do is, I can then
just go out there and buy my

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.340
shares of IBM back, right?

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.180
So I buy one share of IBM.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.060
And how much do I have to pay?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.330
Do I have to pay $100?

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.265
Well no, the share of
IBM stock price

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:51.190
has dropped to $50.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.850
So actually, let me do that.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:08:00.100
I'm not paying $100 out, I'm
going to pay $50 out.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.760
And I'm going to get back
a share of IBM.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.810
I'm going to get back a share of
IBM, and that's what I owe.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.510
So I'll give it back
to my brokerage.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:18.370
So I will go out, spend $50,
get back a share, and then

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.420
give that share back to
the brokerage, give it

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.560
back to that guy.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.760
These guys never knew that
anything happened.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.070
And in the process,
what happened?

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.660
I sold the shares for
$100, and I bought

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.030
them back for $50.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.470
So after unwinding this whole
thing-- I used $50 of this

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.450
$100 to buy the shares back.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.450
So how much do I have left?

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.390
I have $50 left.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.210
And I returned the shares of
IBM, so I owe no one anything.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.920
So I made $50 off
of this trade.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.160
So traditionally in the stock
market, on the long side you

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.085
want to buy low, sell
high, right?

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.450
When you're short selling,
you're doing the same thing,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.440
but you're doing
it in reverse.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:09.050
You want to sell high
and buy low.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.260
Anyway, hopefully that gives
you the general idea of the

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.790
mechanics of short selling.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.600
In the next video I'll talk a
little bit more about what--

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.780
this was a very good scenario,
where what I wanted to happen

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.260
did happen.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.690
But in the next video we'll talk
about the risks of short

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.935
selling, and maybe a little bit
of a discussion of whether

00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:28.240
it really is good or bad
for the markets, or for

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.380
society as a whole.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.220
See you in the next video.
