LIV: Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.720
I'm Liv. I'm a cook here.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.870
And I'm just honored today to be
here with John Jeavons and

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.710
to introduce him to you.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
If you care anything about what
your food tastes like, if

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.720
you've dug a fork into food, you
really care about digging

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.730
a fork into the Earth.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.570
And that's my whole connection
to all of this.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.670
You care about not just the
quality of food, but whether

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.570
food is going to feed everybody
on this planet,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.930
which is one of the main
questions we have to answer

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.790
these days--

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.870
enough food, enough nutritious
food for everybody.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.970
When I was assigned to China as
a reporter a few years ago,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.930
for me, the most heartbreaking
thing I saw was in the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.034
countryside to see these dense
concentrations of farmers who

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:08.250
were asked to leave the land
that they had farmed for

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.930
generations and put in densely
populated living conditions no

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.250
longer close to their
land because

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.310
land was that precious.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.940
And the government wanted
to develop it.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.460
And here, I saw people who
knew the art of farming--

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.100
and it is indeed an
art, growing food

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.990
and growing it well--

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.550
who had been through chemical
industrial farming who were

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.400
told that some of the land that
they farm was now too

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.200
toxic, over-fertilized, and
over-chemicalized for them to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.660
do any more, but who still in
their genes and just one

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.500
generation back knew how to
grow food in mainly a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.730
sustainable way.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.570
And to me, I brought
that home with me.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.580
And to me, it's the overriding
question for this age

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.270
and for all of us.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.890
So from the time I was an
immigrant that arrived in this

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.220
country, I'd heard about
double digging.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.670
I'd heard about biointensive.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.680
And today, for me to meet John
and realize that he is this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.170
complete visionary who isn't
just a farmer, but is thinking

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.980
about food for all of us and for
the future of this planet

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.480
is indeed an honor.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.604
So please welcome John.

00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:41.566
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:49.630
JOHN JEAVONS: Thank
you, Liv. Take the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.440
lights down on the screen.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.690
They got me lit.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.880
Before we begin, I'd
like to make one

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.490
reflection to set the tone.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.620
What Liz said about China in
some way reminded me of it.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.960
In 1995, we had an intern come
and train with us in Northern

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.640
California for six months.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.860
And he shared with me that the
cost of farmable soil in

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.020
Monterey, Mexico,
was $4 a pound.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.100
Do you realize that gasoline
only costs $50 a pound

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.570
currently at the pump?

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.190
$50.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.060
Oh, there we go again.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.420
We're going to have
to redo this one.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.110
Do you realize that in Monterey,
Mexico, that

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.440
farmable soil, if you go to
purchase it, costs $4 a pound,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.630
where gasoline at the pumps
today costs $0.50 a pound.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.750
So they have their
priorities right.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.630
They realize the preciousness
of the soil.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.890
And they realize that the soil
is worth eight times gasoline.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.980
Wow.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.510
That's really hard to wrap our
minds around, I think.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.960
Even for me, it is, and
I've been working

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.815
with this for 41 years.

00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:10.620
So now let's go and look at our
presentation for today,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.115
Food for the Future Now.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.220
To know, challenge, and hope.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.730
To feel, relieved
and empowered.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.365
And to do, act where you are.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.340
Creating a new and
better world.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.020
Creating a new and
better world.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.260
This is going to be the only
thing we need to focus on.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.450
The joy of the process, it's
really a lot of fun.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.520
You can see the happiness
in my daughter's face.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.890
And even manual food-raising,
which is really

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.040
skill-intensive, not

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.730
work-intensive, is a lot of fun.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.640
The Earth needs our help now.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.710
You probably know
that already.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.650
But this is literally the Earth
that's underneath our

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.310
feet needs our help right now.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.760
Let's grow soil.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.430
It's not about farming it.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.240
It's about growing it.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.250
Every time we eat a pound of
food grown with regular

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.560
food-raising practices, an
average of 6 pounds in the

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.400
United States, 12 pounds in
developing countries, where

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.960
90% of the world's people live,
and 18 pounds in China,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.590
where 20% of the world's people
live, and 24 pounds of

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.620
farmable soil in California are
lost due to wind and water

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.530
erosion because of the types
of practices being used.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.710
In contrast, over here on
the right, you can see

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.260
Biointensive Sustainable
Mini-Farming has the capacity

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.200
to build, to grow, to create
up to 20 pounds of farmable

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.090
soil per pound of food eaten--

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.770
not deplete 6 to 24 pounds per
pound of food eaten, but to

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.390
build up to 20 pounds of
farmable soil, soil we need to

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.680
feed people.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.180
I don't think anyone realizes
the number of people that are

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.810
born each day, really.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.030
It's 216,000 people net.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.610
That's births less deaths.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.370
It's like Motel 6, and the
light's on all the time.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.310
This is enough to
repopulate San

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.040
Francisco every three days.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.740
Wow.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.030
Costa Rica every 17.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.780
Mexico City, the second largest
city in the world, 3.5

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.400
times a year.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.360
And Beijing, China,
8.6 times a year.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.990
What does this mean?

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.950
It means--

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.790
and this is even more
important than those

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.860
population statistics--

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.950
it means that 34,000 additional
acres of farmable

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:12.830
soil need to be found or built
daily to feed these people.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.020
It's not happening.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.710
It's probable that organic
farming indirectly results in

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.780
the loss of three to five and
a quarter pounds of farmable

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.750
soil per pound of food eaten
because of the needs of inputs

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.940
in the form of compost, manure,
and organic fertilizer

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.400
which are taken from
other soils.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.440
So we may have our perfect
organic farm.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.080
But we're depleting a
soil somewhere else

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.780
in order to do it.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.170
We don't need to.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.860
But the pattern we're
using now does.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.110
Organic farming is
a good start.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.630
It's a great start.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.780
It's a major positive step
towards more sustainable

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.440
agriculture.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.800
Yet, we need to take
at least three

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.760
more major steps forward.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.345
We need to go beyond organic.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.830
The planet is becoming
increasingly urbanized.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.310
Something that's incredible is
India's already 91% urban,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.320
China 90% urban.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.090
That's 40% of the world's

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.400
population virtually urbanized.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.060
One of the results of this
urbanization is that we're

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.940
losing our farming literacy.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.730
We don't really know
how to farm.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.240
As a result of all these
factors, agriculture, as it

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.260
is, population growth, the
loss of our farming skill

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.180
base, most of the world's
soils have become

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:52.360
significantly demineralized,
compacted, and contain little

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.880
organic matter unless all these

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.130
elements have been imported.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.020
This isn't a pretty picture.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.990
Though, I think the art
here is very pretty.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.110
You can make a case that the
entire planet may be

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:18.830
desertified in as little
as 69 years.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.590
I'm 70 years old.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.280
That's in less time than I've
been here on the planet.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.850
| don't know how long
you've been here.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.020
But that's a short time.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.670
What to do?

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.960
We need to make farming truly
sustainable on as much of a

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.440
closed system basis
as possible.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.480
It is possible.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.210
We need to grow our own organic
matter inputs on the

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.470
soil we cultivate and recycle
all the nutrients--

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.790
all the nutrients--

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.850
contained in the crops we
grow back into the soil.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.230
The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization has

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.730
noted that 13 years from
now, in the year 2025--

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.340
that's soon--

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.620
about 2/3 of the world's people,
5 billion people, will

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.540
probably not have sufficient
water available for food

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.680
growing to live a life
with reasonable

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.100
nutrition if at all.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.690
We don't have to wait for
2025 for that to happen.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.820
We're going to see that
happening in just three years,

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.190
the effect of this.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.510
This means a situation of peak
water and peak food.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.580
70% to 80% of all the water used
by people in the world is

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.055
utilized in food production.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.090
There is some hope.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.180
We'll get to that soon.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.630
You can also make a case that
as little as 49 years of

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.600
farmable soil remains
on the Earth.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.010
This is partly because as the
soil quality is depleted, the

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.170
rate of depletion increases
more rapidly.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.020
So we have a situation of
peak farmable soil.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.270
And it's here now.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.130
There's also a major different
kind of peak energy crisis.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.840
The peak energy crisis really
is between these two points

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.650
and these two points--

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.710
our will, the will to face
these things and make a

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.730
positive difference.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.300
And I wouldn't tell you these
things if we couldn't make a

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.550
positive difference.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.630
Feed your dreams and your
fears will starve.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.850
So in the future, as you begin
to be overwhelmed by

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.420
challenges, and there's a good
chance that we will all have

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.440
that feeling some of the time,
feed your dreams. And you'll

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.950
find that the dream that you're
envisioning will begin

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:09.030
to manifest.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.940
And the reason that we can dream
these dreams is because

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.996
there are realistic solutions.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.670
We need to utilize our
skillful will.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.720
There are psychologists who
have studied the different

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.740
forms of will that we have. And
the most important one is

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.900
skillful will, the ability to
make and fulfill our choices

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.360
with the greatest efficiency
and least effort necessary.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.740
I think Google is dedicated
to this concept.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.180
What we need is a
transformational paradigm

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.270
throughout many areas, including
food-raising.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.020
Growing food was actually
the original green.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.315
And it can be again.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.930
In fact, 10,000 years ago--

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.430
this is unbelievable if
you really sink into

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.210
this and feel it.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.630
This next thing is just totally

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.650
unbelievable and wonderful.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.460
10,000 years ago, early Stone
Age farmers raised 100% of

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.020
their calories per person with
just 20 hours of labor

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.460
annually, growing the
first spelt wheat.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.410
These people were farming
literate.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:37.520
I often give participants in
our workshop a handicap, a

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.480
fivefold handicap.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.430
And I challenge them to learn
how to grow all their food in

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.730
100 hours a year during the
following three years.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.650
We really can do it.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.420
We don't believe we can, but
that's where the problem is,

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.845
here and here.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:05.030
In 1911, China grew complete
diets on 3,600 square feet.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.410
And China, Japan, and Korea used
biologically-intensive

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:15.980
farming successfully for four
millennia until the 1950s when

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.500
current practices began
to be adopted.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.670
The Chinese used to call their
farmers living libraries.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.880
And if you want to read about
this type of farming, there's

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.720
a book out by F.H. King called
Farmers of Forty Centuries.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.770
I recommend you read it.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.490
It's published by Dover Press,
and it's not expensive.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.580
In the Philippines, the
illiterate Hanunoo Stone Age

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.460
culture have a 200-crop,
5-year rotation with 40

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.550
varieties of rice
grown annually.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:54.350
So no matter what the climate,
hot, cold, wet, or dry, they

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.630
achieve a sufficient quantity
of calories.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.290
They are living libraries too.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.810
There are no agricultural
universities that I know of in

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.080
the world that have any kind of
rotation system that's as

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.310
sophisticated, or as complex,
and uses so many varieties as

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.340
this one does.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.090
And these people don't
know how to read

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.840
and don't use computers.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.360
Oh my god.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.040
And it's even worse because they
spend 80% of their table

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.720
conversation at meals talking
about farming.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.130
And their children, if they were
in inner city schools,

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.570
you'd have to disassociate
yourself from them because

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.820
they play farmer.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.870
When other cultures around them
were fading, the Mayan

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.800
culture thrived with
neighborhood--

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.900
there's documentation
on this--

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.860
neighborhood
biologically-intensive

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.950
food-raising.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.970
Why did the Mayan culture
eventually dissipate?

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:00.750
No one knows.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.880
There's maybe five or
six possibilities.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.850
But one of them no
one has listed.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:11.500
They may not have been farming
with biological intensivity in

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.700
a sustainable way.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.250
You can deplete your soil really
fast if you don't do it

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.620
sustainably.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.230
Biosphere II, where they locked
six people up in a

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:27.180
two-acre greenhouse for two
years, grew complete diets on

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.530
about 3,300 square feet with

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.520
biologically-intensive practices.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:38.450
In fact, one of our interns
trained the basis for that

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.740
food-raising.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.560
Ecology Action, Grow
Biointensive, registered

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.500
trademark, Sustainable
Mini-Farming, feeding the

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.670
world one garden at the time.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.720
We began relearning, teaching,
and researching--

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.650
relearning, see, because we
didn't know anything, and

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.840
we're still learning.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.090
We began relearning, teaching,
and researching

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.720
biologically-intensive
food-raising in the Stanford

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:09.089
University Industrial Park over
40 years ago in 1972.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.319
We developed a systems
approach.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.319
Because I'm really interested
in patterns.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.050
You can learn more faster
with patterns.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.970
And the systems approach
enables people to learn

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.960
faster, teach more effectively,
and take more

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.849
efficient action.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.280
One intern from Latin America
told us that after his first

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.860
four weeks in our six-month
intern program that he'd

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.140
learned more than he'd learned
in six years in the university

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.790
in his country.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.370
He didn't learn more
information.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.540
He learned more of a pattern and
a system which enabled him

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.100
to put the data bits and the
information into the most

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.480
effective places.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.480
Grow Biointensive is now used
in over 143 countries in

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.690
virtually all climates and soils
where food is grown.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:06.040
It's taught at tours, classes,
three-day and five-day

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.380
domestic and international
workshops, two- and six-month

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.960
internships, and three-year
apprenticeships.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.550
This year, we have
a new program.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.870
Our two-month internship is
especially for college

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.940
students that during their
summers can come and get a

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.730
taste of farming and decide if
they want to get into it.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.130
It's exciting.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.620
We've had three times the number
of applicants than we

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.570
have positions for.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.720
And it's not just limited
to college students.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.000
We have one person who is
from Uzbekistan who

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.210
will be taking it.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.210
And she'll be going back and
teaching people in all the

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.760
-istans in the former
Soviet Union.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.270
This information is learned
also from over 250 how-to

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:59.100
books, booklets, and information
sheets, and even

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.610
videos on topics such as how to
grow complete nutrition and

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.540
soil fertility in the
smallest area.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.260
This is what's motivated
me for over 40 years.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.930
In the 1970s, I wanted to know
what's the smallest area that

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.300
you could grow all your food,
all your clothing, all your

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:22.570
money, and all your other
agricultural products from in

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.340
an environmentally sound way
and an equitable way.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.350
So that if everyone in the world
used that technique or a

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:33.530
similarly effective technique,
that everyone could live well.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.670
We now know that you can grow
all your seed for next year in

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.600
3% additional area.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.920
And we have a booklet out called
"Growing the Seed" that

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.250
shows you how to grow all your
seed in the smallest area

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.140
while preserving genetic
diversity.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.710
It used to be that in order to
design a diet, you needed to

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:55.770
read our booklet number 31,
"Designing a Complete Grow

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.640
Biointensive Sustainable
Mini-Farm." And there's just

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.260
lots of pages and
charts in there.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.360
And the result is growing
all your food in

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.100
4,000 square feet.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.830
In the United States, it takes
30,000 square feet.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:16.010
It's not the same food, but all
the nutrients are there.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.650
Well, it takes a lot of time
to fill out these forms and

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.400
understand them.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.240
But now we can teach you from
your heart how to make choices

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.260
in five minutes, so you can
design your own diet and one

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.330
that will produce all the
composts for the diet of the

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.190
microbes in the soils in
less than an hour.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.330
So this is the kind of
simplicity that grows out of

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.220
the systems approach.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.180
How to Grow More Vegetables Than
You Ever Thought Possible

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.000
on Less Land Than You Can
Imagine has increased to and

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.700
Fruits, Nuts, Berries, Grains,
and Other Crops.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.780
The title just got longer.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.870
Imagine.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.430
It's in eight languages,
including Braille, and now

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.040
going into four more
languages.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.970
The fully revised, updated, and
expanded eighth edition

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.220
has just been published.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.830
We're teaching in the field
and on the web.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.450
There are five training sites
in the US, four of them in

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.140
California.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.370
Next year, there'll be one in
North Carolina in addition to

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.690
the one that's in
Ohio this year.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.980
We have international partner
training sites in Latin

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.870
America, Africa, and Asia.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.140
Ecology Action's website has a
self-teaching section where

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.590
you can download a 12-page How
to Grow More Vegetables

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.850
equivalent for free.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.600
It has eight training videos
that you can download from

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.580
YouTube and use for free.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.680
We also sell the DVD.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.030
So you can have all
of it right there.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.770
Our international mail order
service can be found at

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.020
bountifulgardens.org.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:57.990
Our website is
growbiointensive.org.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.110
Our garden supply and education
center can be

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.810
located right here in the San
Francisco mid-peninsula Bay

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.070
Area in Palo Alto, California.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:14.100
And you can go online to
commongroundinpaloalto.org.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.720
There's some cards at the back
that you can get more

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.980
information about all of
these initiatives.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.720
My site, johnjeavons.info,
includes a special section

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.280
that I really encourage you to
look at called "The World of

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.080
Hope." It has eight
segments to it.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.010
And I recommend that you read
one a day and absorb the hope

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.970
that's contained in it.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.620
Onward, to help meet the world's
challenges, Ecology

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.600
Action has developed a proposal
to train a half

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.700
million African farmers in six
countries in four and a

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.520
quarter years at a cost
of only $9 a person.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.090
In a world that has economic
challenges, this is a great

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.060
opportunity to make
a difference.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.280
I don't know if you know, but
there are a billion people in

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.530
Africa, and 1/3 of them are
on starvation track.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.700
We want to meet that
challenge.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.220
We're also developing a similar
proposal to train

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.310
500,000 Latin American farmers
in all 22 countries.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.770
It's exciting.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.460
We can't wait.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.080
We're working with the US
Department of Agriculture

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.150
currently to catalyze four Grow
Biointensive teaching

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.240
mini-ag centers and soil test
stations to monitor how the

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.810
soil quality improves, stays the
same, or whatever in the

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.200
Sudan, where 4 to 7 million
people are at risk for

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.060
malnutrition and/or
starvation.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.810
Our international partners,
Samuel Nderitu from G-BIACK in

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:56.360
Kenya, who helps us in so many
ways, will be doing the

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.615
initial trainings
there next week.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.070
We've discovered that this
method, Grow Biointensive

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.120
Sustainable Mini-Farming, has
the capacity to produce higher

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.320
yields and increased income per
unit of area and use as

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.820
little as 33% to
12% the water.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.930
We've been down as low
as 3% the water.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:24.000
Use as little as 50% to 100%
less purchased nutrient and

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.910
organic fertilizer form.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:34.000
And use as little as 6% to 1%
the energy in all forms,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.710
compared with practices normally
used per pound of

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.960
food produced.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.490
Grow Biointensive builds soil.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.020
According to a master's thesis
from the University of

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.620
California at Berkeley in the
soil science department there,

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.290
Grow Biointensive has the
capacity to build soil up to

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.860
60 times more rapidly
than in nature.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.110
What does this mean?

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.270
Up to six inches of farmable
soil can be built in as little

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.730
as 50 years.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.520
Remember earlier I noted that
in as little as 49 years,

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.600
there might be no farmable
soil left.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.180
So we might as well begin
now and avoid the rush.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.420
We could be in time.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.980
On the average around the
world and in the US, it

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.010
doesn't take 50 years to build
up 6 inches of farmable soil,

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.150
the depth of soil you need
in order to grow food.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.250
It takes 3,000 years
to do this.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.700
And in California, because
of the natural geologic

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.330
formation, the climate, and
other factors, it takes 12,000

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.910
years to build up 6 inches
of farmable soil.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.390
Do you realize that the 3,000
years of farmable soil that

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:57.120
we've built up in the United
States, that we've depleted

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.320
75% of it in the
last 250 years?

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.580
We depleted 2,250 years'
worth in 250 years.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:12.390
And the rate at which it's being
depleted is increasing.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.780
We don't have to do that.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.430
With Grow Biointensive higher
yields plus a better

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:22.420
understanding of nutrition from
a farming point of view,

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.410
it's possible to grow diets plus
all the compost materials

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.540
needed for sustainable soil
fertility on as little as

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:39.170
4,000, 2,500, 1,800, or even
1,000 square feet or less

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.420
depending on the diet.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.050
You could even do it
in the yard on your

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.530
suburban home lot.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:55.810
Frightening, the responsibility
is.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.950
It's true that the foods
eaten are different.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.720
But all nourishment for world
standards is met in all of

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.430
these small diets.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.790
How does Grow Biointensive
do this?

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.780
Deep soil structure
creation for

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.880
quadruple nutrient cycling.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.270
Compost for microbe nutrition.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:19.960
Soil, water retention, and soil
antibiotic development.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.330
Plants don't get sick if you
have enough microbes in the

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.450
soil because they have their own
pharmaceutical thing going

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.940
on down there to keep
the plants healthy.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:32.130
And if the plants are healthy,
insects don't come because the

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:37.050
amino acid mix in the plant
tissue is such that the

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.590
insects are not interested.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.370
But a sick plant, the amino
acid mix changes.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:47.290
And the signal goes out to the
insects, and they come for

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.310
their feast.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.730
Close plant spacing for improved
plant environment and

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.820
water conservation.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.880
Companion planting, putting
plants together that like each

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.770
other and stimulate
each other--

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:04.210
like the people you choose for
your parties or your dinners--

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:08.640
for crop enhancement and
pest minimization.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.900
60% growing area in compost and
calorie crops that produce

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.490
large amount of compost
materials, plus a significant

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.780
quantity of calories,
such as wheat,

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.370
oats, corn, and amaranth.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.220
But there are many others.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.610
30% of our growing area in
special root crops-- and in a

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.410
moment, you'll see how important
that is, it's very

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:31.840
important--

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:40.930
such as potatoes, garlic, and
leeks that can produce 5 to 20

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.960
times the calories per unit
of area per unit of time.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.590
Using easily available seeds.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.100
And using the whole system.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.780
It doesn't work well if only
some of its elements are used.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.870
If you prepare the soil
shallowly and put all the

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.370
plants close together,
you stress the soil.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.610
And the system may even
become unsustainable.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:12.090
The solution to sustainable
agriculture isn't the system.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:16.170
It's you, and me, and
how we use it.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.230
Taking into account all the
preceding, scarcity can be

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.770
transformed into abundance.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.250
The transformation of the
situations of peak water, peak

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.590
farming energy, and peak
farmable soil into situations

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.710
of more than enough.

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.110
We don't need to be facing
the scarcity that

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.380
we're looking at globally.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.290
We can be looking at
abundance instead.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.560
In a way, it's not all
that challenging.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.140
You may feel overwhelmed
right now.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.640
But let's go to a quote from
Voltaire in his book Candide,

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.910
on the last page.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:30:01.420
Candide says, "The whole world
is a garden, and what a

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.720
wonderful place it would be if
each one of us just took care

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.070
of our part of the Earth,
our garden."

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.620
It's not complicated.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.730
It's simple.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.900
It's not someone else who
needs to take the

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.940
responsibility.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:16.560
We can.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.150
And it's a pleasurable
responsibility.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:25.140
Gandhi, "To forget how to dig
the Earth and tend the soil is

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:31.620
to forget oneself." Grow
Biointensive is

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.220
skill-intensive, rather
than labor-intensive.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.960
As you can see here, there's as
many lettuces in the upper

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.650
area as in the lower area.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.190
The amount of work, if you
know how to Aikido double

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.990
dig-- which actually, you
don't do the work.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.340
Gravity does the work.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:53.140
The amount of energy it takes
to double dig that in a very

00:30:53.140 --> 00:31:03.010
quiet, simple, easy way is the
same amount of energy that it

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:07.940
is to single dig two
of those row areas.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.100
So it's less work.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.050
It's less water.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.080
It's less weeding.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:16.230
It's less compost. It's less
nutrients in organic

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.480
fertilizer form.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.850
It's skill-intensive.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.240
Don't work harder.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.490
Think smarter.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:23.730
Small is bountiful.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.510
And there truly are economies
of small scale.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:30.300
Remember how much less water
and nutrient we use?

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.500
Those are economies
of small scale.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.870
And we need to become
farming literate.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.240
So what does this mean for
us in our own backyards?

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.060
And what does this mean
for our communities?

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.820
Assuming intermediate Grow
Biointensive yields, one

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.070
mature apple tree can produce
one pound of apples for each

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.760
day in the year for three
and a quarter people.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.910
In addition, you can graft 9
additional varieties on the

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.240
tree for a total of 10
producing varieties.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.480
Luther Burbank had 30 varieties
of plums grafted on

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.710
one plum tree in Santa
Rosa, California.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.730
You can go still see the tree.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:14.420
It only has 10 varieties on it
now because they didn't want

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.040
to keep up with that
complexity.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.690
But wouldn't it be wonderful
to go have that kind of a

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.060
choice right at home?

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.270
Also assuming intermediate Grow
Biointensive yields, you

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.950
can grow one 1-pound loaf of
bread for each week in the

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:35.510
year in just 300 square feet of
wheat, two good-sized bowls

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:39.090
of oatmeal per week in another
300 square feet

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.380
using hulless oats.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.970
You can experience that
primordial waves of grain

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:49.140
feeling right where you are.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.850
Now all crops are not equal.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.040
This is really important.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.240
And if you get the new edition
of How to Grow More

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.260
Vegetables, the last three
pages also of the compost

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.200
chapter describe how all
compost is not equal.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.210
Here, what we're going to see
is we have wheat, which is a

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:11.330
winter grain crop.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:17.430
And the calories produced per
month set our index of one

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.630
unit of productivity.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:25.260
If instead we use flour corn,
which is a summer seed crop,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.630
we have five times the
productivity and

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.920
calories per month.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.780
And if instead we use potatoes,
a 65-day maturing

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.100
variety, we get nineteen times
the calories per month per

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.380
unit of area.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.630
Powerful.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.640
If you read the material on
compost, you'll find that

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.270
instead of just having a bucket
of compost that you

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:53.110
dump into an area where you're
growing, that bucket of

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:57.320
compost can be one unit of
compost power, two units of

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:02.940
compost power, and up to eight
units of compost power.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:08.000
This is what 41 years of
research, teaching, and, most

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.360
important, learning by Ecology
Action is making possible for

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.969
everyone in the world
on a simple basis.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:20.710
But the final question really
is, what kind of future do you

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.770
want to create?

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.280
Because it's really
up to each of us.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.600
There's applications here for
localization of food growing,

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.440
including public toolbraries
of small-scale food-raising

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.440
and cleaning tools.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.310
You could thresh your grain
right at your local library.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.850
Seed exchanges with growing
collection and

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.929
preservation classes.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:49.030
Demonstration orchards with a
wide spectrum of heritage

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.090
fruit and nut trees.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.550
There's hundreds of varieties
to choose from.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.160
Mini-ag centers for learning,
training, and growing food.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.390
More local farms for foods,
including green belts and

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.630
business parklands.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.300
Smaller, more income productive
microforms growing

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.680
specialty crops.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.700
Do you realize that the average
income for the average

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:18.120
US farmer is about $6,700 for
a half million dollars of

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.350
capital investment?

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.210
It's about a 2% return
on investment.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:28.520
And the farmer has to work, he
or she has to work, to get the

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.740
other $33,300 a year needed to
live on at an off the farm,

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.340
non-farm job.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.970
With small-scale, sustainable,
biologically-intensive

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:45.950
farming, you can make up to
$50,000 and more on a quarter

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.430
of an acre net.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.940
There was a man who did this in

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.280
Berkeley, California already.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.150
And there are other people
beginning to do it.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.560
One of the exciting things is
more and more women are

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.810
getting into farming.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:07.010
Another thing that we can
include in our localization

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.880
possibilities are two-acre,
complete diet,

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.740
community-supported agriculture
mini-farms. This

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:19.370
is where a family farm could
grow enough food for complete

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:26.330
diets for 20 people and
make $40,000 a year.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:30.050
Most important, grow a
community attitude.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:34.970
We must be the change that we
wish to see in the world.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.300
And last but not least,
we can grow new

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.510
kinds of living contexts.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.640
A land trust sustainable
mini-farming community is

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.720
where you have three 33-family
neighborhoods

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.900
in a 130-acre area.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.080
And each family has a half-acre
farm in which they

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.220
can grow all the food for their
three- to four-person

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:02.760
family and grow $40,000
a year or more.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:12.100
Now this quote from Abraham
Lincoln was given in 1857.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.730
And how did this man know?

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:19.570
He was busy and occupied with
a few other topics.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.570
"Before long, the most valuable
of all arts will be

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:27.000
that of deriving a comfortable
subsistence from the smallest

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.030
area of land." It's going to be
the only game in town for

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.620
most of the world's people and
already is for many of them.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.960
Working together, we can
build a better future.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:49.330
To keep it simple, what's one
tiny thing that each of us can

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:53.120
do today to create
a better world?

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:59.670
It truly only takes a smile
exchanged with another person

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.440
to cause a ripple effect that
will change the world.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.240
And we can begin today.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.490
We don't have to wait.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.285
Thank you.

00:38:12.285 --> 00:38:18.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.220
LIV: Thank you so much.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.220
JOHN JEAVONS: You're welcome.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.160
LIV: So I'm feeling guilty for
the bags of compost that I

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.340
bought and the irrigation
system that I have.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.205
JOHN JEAVONS: We all have
to start somewhere.

00:38:30.205 --> 00:38:31.850
LIV: We do.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:36.130
So let's go straight
to what you said.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.770
What should Google do?

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:44.920
We just feed people all
three meals every day.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.750
JOHN JEAVONS: I think it would
be wonderful if Google could

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:49.850
be one of the pace setters
for the world.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:55.130
I think they could have a green
belt farm right out in

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.480
this area, somewhere
not too far away.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.700
They could support the new
type of farmer who's more

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.920
efficient, using fewer
resources, and produce all the

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.730
food that you need to feed
everyone here, the 15,000 to

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:14.500
20,000 people that you feed
daily, which is incredible.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.640
But think of the kind of
jobs that you can make.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.020
And a lot of these can be really
small farms that are

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:26.160
supporting the re-education of
our population in farming.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.770
Most of the world's really
illiterate in farming.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.330
And it's pretty scary.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:37.600
If this whole room were a
football field, and there were

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.610
625 people in it, and one person
in the middle had a

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.400
green cap on, and a green hat,
and green pants, that's the

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.040
token farmer.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.010
That's the person who is raising
the food for himself

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:55.630
and the other 624 people.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.890
And that person generally knows
how to grow a few crops.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.160
And the soil that he's growing
it from, or she's growing it

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.200
from, is being depleted
really rapidly.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.960
But we need to not discount
these farmers.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.320
They really love farming,
and they care about us.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.500
And they want to feed us.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.050
And they're going bankrupt.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:17.460
Can you imagine?

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.240
Just to feed us.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.930
And so we need to give
them some help

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.690
with some new patterns.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:28.100
And I think Google is uniquely
in a position to consider, in

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.862
a small way, having
a pilot for that.

00:40:30.862 --> 00:40:33.730
LIV: So tell me, let's
get in depth.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:34.930
What does that look like?

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.330
How big should the
green belt be?

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:42.470
Where do we gather the literate
farmers that we want?

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:45.700
And how big is each unit
for each farm family?

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.030
JOHN JEAVONS: Well, that's
a good question.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.730
First of all, we have to
not only grow soil.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.560
We're going to have
to grow farmers.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:58.440
And that takes some time, and
everybody isn't going to be

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.537
perfect the first time out.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.490
Many people in the world get
out of farming because it

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:06.800
depends on weather.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.310
It depends on soil and the
fluctuation of markets.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:15.010
But if you were to grow
enough farmers

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.700
to feed all of Google--

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.730
we're talking about thousands
of farmers--

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.810
how about starting
with 5 or 10?

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:25.750
LIV: OK, all right.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:26.090
Let's do that.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.340
JOHN JEAVONS: And then if the
pattern works, and the farmers

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.380
are happy, and they're making
more money than they've been

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.190
making otherwise, I don't think
you're going to have to

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.530
do a whole lot to get
it to spread.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.390
LIV: OK, so five farm families,
two acres each?

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.150
Is that what I was getting?

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.060
JOHN JEAVONS: It depends
on which of the

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.140
patterns you choose.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.220
You can choose one that's
growing complete diets.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.850
You can choose one that's
growing mainly high-end

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:54.270
vegetables, which we all
in California like

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.110
to eat a lot of.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.300
You can have others that
are growing seeds.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:02.052
And if you grow seeds and those
farmers become their own

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:06.110
seed company, you can make a
lot of money with seeds.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:10.420
So I would suggest at least
those three types of

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.105
approaches, the ones that are
complete diet, the ones that

00:42:14.105 --> 00:42:17.910
are mainly high-end vegetables,
and another that's

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.580
growing seeds.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.280
LIV: And the soil growing, we
can get the first generation

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.310
going in six months?

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.090
JOHN JEAVONS: Well, when we
began at the Stanford

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.730
University Industrial Park,
all the top soil had been

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:38.800
scraped off of the area that
was donated to us.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.290
And all of the subsoil had
been scraped off in the

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.660
construction process.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:48.300
So we were growing our crops
in a mollisol clay that

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.090
normally takes at least 500
years in nature to make one

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.910
inch of farmable soil out of.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.730
And we got fairly good results
to begin with.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:59.740
But you get better results
over time.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.820
One thing that I want everyone
to understand is to build up a

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.670
soil in a temperate zone and to
have a good soil, you need

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:13.320
4% to 6% organic matter
in the soil.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.950
Most of the world's soils are
only 1% organic matter.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:22.080
And you can only, in a stable
way, build up a soil in

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.010
organic matter 1/20
of 1% a year.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:31.820
So to build up from 1% organic
matter soil to 4%, the minimum

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.260
to have a really good
soil, it's going

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.610
to take us 60 years.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:43.570
So it involves a responsibility,
a commitment,

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.610
and a relationship.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:47.110
We know how difficult
relationships are.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:51.360
But this one's with the soil
and with the planet.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.890
And to be a farmer of the
future, what we're going to

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:56.130
have to do-- this is going
to be really hard because

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.040
nobody's going to
want to do it.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.480
I promise you.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:04.270
You have to leave half of your
farmable soil in wild because

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.160
what we're growing is we're
growing a planet.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.430
We're not growing food.

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.270
We're growing soil.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.590
And we're not growing
just soil.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.240
We need to grow ecosystems.
And if we take all the

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.110
farmable soil and we grow food
with it, the natural cycles of

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:21.960
plants and animals are
just going to tank.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.260
LIV: Is there a way for me to
tell my gophers to stay on the

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.512
wild side and not come
into my garden?

00:44:26.512 --> 00:44:29.100
JOHN JEAVONS: There are, but we
can't talk about that here.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.350
LIV: OK.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.960
Yes, please, questions?

00:44:37.334 --> 00:44:40.710
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:43.510
Could you speak to whether--

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.260
there's a lot of other
systems out there.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.740
There's no-till.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:51.350
There's food forest. There's
the biodynamics people,

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:55.740
biochart enthusiasts, the
permaculture folks, the soil

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.720
food web, creating natural
farming, IMOs.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.240
There's all these alternative
agriculture systems out there.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.590
Could you speak to your

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.440
organization's relation to them?

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440
Do you think you're
an alternative?

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.630
Or you incorporate ideas
from them all?

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.640
Or how does that work?

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.630
JOHN JEAVONS: OK, I think the
first thing I'd like to

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:15.910
describe is that the bottom
line is the soil.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:21.200
And I have evaluated what's
happening to soils in other

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.660
systems. And generally,
the soil's being

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.460
depleted fairly rapidly.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.680
So I don't need to specify
which systems. I'd

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.460
just as soon not.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:36.090
Because the goal here isn't
for how so much that we're

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.260
different, or whether
we're better or

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.810
less good, or whatever.

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:44.700
The real goal here is how
do we build the soil.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.620
And so if each one of
us, whether we're

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:52.210
permaculturalists, whether
we're biodynamic, whether

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:55.980
we're Fukuoka culture, which
there's a tremendous amount to

00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.330
be said for, the important
thing is what is it

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.560
doing to the soil?

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:06.680
So our teaching units, which are
a minimum of 4,000 square

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.990
feet of plantable surface,
because you can easily do a

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:16.570
complete diet for yourself and
for the microbes, they're not

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.150
only called mini-ag centers.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.710
They're also called soil
test stations.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.330
And they're not going to test
your soil or my soil.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:27.320
They're going to monitor their
own soil so that we can see.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.300
Is it getting better?

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.220
Is it getting worse?

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.120
Is it staying the same?

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.680
And we have a new program
that we're

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.320
developing that's actually--

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.190
already, we have a very,
very small grant--

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:41.810
in Africa, in Kenya, where
we're doing it.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:45.280
But we're going to begin to
list key points around the

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.240
world where the soil's
been tested.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.550
And we're going to say the
altitude, the longitude, the

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:58.140
soil type, and the climate for
each one of these nodes.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:04.270
And then we're going to show
online these 24 soil

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:08.110
nutrients, and relationships,
and aspects, how they were

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.880
tested out, what they were
missing, what was done to

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.000
improve them.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.890
And then we're going to
show yield levels for

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.120
five years or more.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:21.800
So that you won't need, I won't
need Ecology Action.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.490
What you do is you go online,
and you'll educate yourself

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:27.990
about what someone in a
similar situation did.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:32.320
So it becomes a big chat room in
a way even though it won't

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.470
have that capacity.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:35.980
Does that answer
your question?

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.390
AUDIENCE: Pretty much.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.800
Thank you.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.050
JOHN JEAVONS: OK.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.080
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.600
Can you talk a little bit about
sustainable ways to

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.210
harvest and utilize water?

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:50.340
JOHN JEAVONS: OK, sustainable
water use?

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:50.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.970
JOHN JEAVONS: Sure,
I'd be glad to.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.750
First of all, if you want to
reduce your water consumption

00:47:55.750 --> 00:48:00.870
per unit of calorie produced,
a really good

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.720
crop to grow is potatoes.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.440
It produces a lot of calories
per unit of

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.240
water per unit of time.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.360
Another crop that's fairly
efficient is carrots.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.290
I was surprised.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.740
I thought, carrots
are succulent.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.750
They're crunchy.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.290
But they're really
water efficient.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.520
There are a number of crops in
the world in the grain seed

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.100
area that are called C4 crops.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.510
They have a special
genetic pathway.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:31.620
And this enables them to produce
more calories and more

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.110
carbon with less water.

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:38.530
But I'll give you an idea of
what this method that we're

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.900
using and learning about does.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.340
In the Stanford Industrial Park,
when we began in 1972 in

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.440
Santa Clara County, where you
are right now, they were using

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.570
20 gallons of water for 100
square feet per day in

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.300
agriculture.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.270
When we began, we were too.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:04.260
After five years, we were down
to 10 gallons of water per 100

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.400
square feet per day.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:10.550
And after six, we were down
to 8 gallons of water.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:14.110
But the yields that we
were getting were two

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.100
to five times higher.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.650
So really, we would end up
using, to make a long story

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:24.180
short, 1/8 the water per pound
of vegetable produced.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.360
Now how do we do this?

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.350
And that's what you're asking.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:28.930
First of all, we have
a new booklet out.

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:36.335
It's called booklet 35.

00:49:36.335 --> 00:49:40.510
It's name is "Growing More Food
with Less Water." So I'll

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.800
tell you the three ways that
this method enables you to use

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.230
so much less water.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:49.690
What it means is that those
people, the 5 billion people

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:53.410
who don't have enough water very
soon to grow their food,

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.730
could have enough water
to grow their food.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:00.900
The first way is that if you
build up the organic matter in

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.100
your soil, you can reduce the
amount of water you need to

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:09.110
grow food by as much as 75%.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.580
That's huge.

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:14.340
Secondly, if you put all the
plants close together that the

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.460
deep soil preparation allows
you to do, you get a

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.700
mini-climate.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.260
And it shades the ground.

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.180
And you can reduce the amount
of water you need by an

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.770
additional up to 50% less.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:30.780
Now we were already
from 75% down.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.770
So we're at 25% of the water
being used because of the

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.570
organic matter.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.980
So now we can get it down to
12 and 1/2% the water being

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:43.200
used by the shading of the
ground with the mini-climate.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.880
And last, but not least--

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.930
and this one is just a
mind blower to me--

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:52.850
but I always thought plants
drank water in order to stand

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:58.430
up and get water
turgor, right?

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:00.420
Well, that's not untrue.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:05.220
But the main reason they drink
water is to get food.

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:11.880
And if there's enough nutrients
in your soil, when

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.240
they drink the water, one gulp,
and they get enough food

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.220
for a long time.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.960
And they don't have to drink
more water right away.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:25.130
So you can then reduce by as
much as an additional 75% the

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.240
amount of water you need.

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.290
So you can take it down.

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.320
We were at 12 and 1/2%.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.750
You can take it down to as
little as 3% of the water.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:36.690
And we reached that in the
Stanford Industrial Park with

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:39.005
a crop that you'll laugh
at, zucchini.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.880
So that's how we do it.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.900
LIV: So you're actually
answering one of the questions

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.770
I wanted to ask you most, which
is what does this food

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:54.130
taste like.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.850
And when you're telling me it's
nutrient dense, I know it

00:51:56.850 --> 00:52:00.130
tastes great and it's
really good for you.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:01.550
The two are the same.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.730
JOHN JEAVONS: Yeah, we grow tree
collards in our garden.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:10.580
They are indigenous to Africa
and/or the Gurney Islands just

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:13.296
off of England.

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:16.080
And they're green milk.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.480
And not only do they taste good,
but one of the exciting

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.330
things you may not realize is if
this room were all growing

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:26.680
alfalfa, and we fed it to a
cow, and you drank all the

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:31.420
milk from that, the alfalfa that
went through the cow, you

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:35.470
drank the milk that it produced,
and instead, you had

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:40.260
tree collards planted in this
same area, you'd get four

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.210
times the protein and eight
times the calcium from the

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:44.670
tree collards.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:47.880
And it's been tested with
Mexican schoolchildren.

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.800
And it's been found to work as
well as milk or even a little

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.310
bit better.

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:55.010
So there's marvelous
possibilities.

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:58.210
The one that I like the best in
nutrition that just makes

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:02.560
me smile is parsley.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.640
Now in India, there's 200
million children who have

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.360
brain damage and eye sight
damage because they didn't get

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.790
enough Vitamin A and iron during
their early life, the

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:17.860
first six years.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:24.210
In 25 square feet, a five by
five square foot plot, they

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:29.720
can grow with parsley all the
missing Vitamin A and iron

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.960
that they didn't get.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.040
And so they could take care
of their own issue, which

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.920
shouldn't be their issue.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.320
But they could intervene.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.240
And one of the things we found
in Mexico is that often, the

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.530
adults won't do manual
food-raising.

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:47.400
So the kids do it.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.670
And the kids eventually
teach the parents

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:52.150
how to get into it.

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:54.020
It's a mind blower.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.000
This happened in the first
project in Mexico at Vicente

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.090
Guerrero, 200 miles southeast
of Mexico City.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:08.090
Two Quakers from Palo Alto, Eric
and Kaki, went in for two

00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:11.220
years to teach biointensive.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.350
And no one would do it.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.370
So the kids did.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:17.630
And I have photographs of
them with pick axes

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.380
prepping the beds.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.350
And it worked.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:25.860
So after the first year, the
families had family councils.

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.980
And they all said, it works.

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.990
And the father said, mamasita,
you do it.

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:35.700
So the next year, the children
and the mothers did it.

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.460
And they continued
to be successful.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:41.500
And Kaki and Eric were supposed
to leave at the end

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.230
of the second year.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:44.850
But they realized it
wouldn't continue.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.950
There wasn't enough
momentum yet.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.540
So they stayed a third year.

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:53.190
And they picked out
the best mothers.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.780
And they taught them to be
managers of the program.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.300
And it continued.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.960
So you'd be surprised
about kid power.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.950
And people tell us in Africa
that people with AIDS won't do

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:08.900
this because it's manual, and
they don't have enough energy.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.390
Well, let me tell
you, they do it.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:13.020
They love doing it.

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:17.070
It gets them more food, and it
stabilizes, in many cases,

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:17.575
their AIDS.

00:55:17.575 --> 00:55:22.210
It doesn't cure them, but
it alleviates it.

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:26.180
And so it's more like we, from
developed countries, can't

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.850
imagine somebody doing manual
gardening, especially if

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.600
you've got AIDS.

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.820
And we have a photo of
a blind person in

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.100
India double digging.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.910
Can you imagine?

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.100
You can't get people with sight
to double dig sometimes.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:47.630
So it gets more and more fun
as you learn more and more.

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:49.675
AUDIENCE: I've just been
beginning to brainstorm as to

00:55:49.675 --> 00:55:51.964
how to maybe pull this off.

00:55:51.964 --> 00:55:54.444
If you have a customer like
Google that needs 20,000

00:55:54.444 --> 00:55:57.916
people a day fed, you've got all
these people like us that

00:55:57.916 --> 00:55:58.412
have backyards.

00:55:58.412 --> 00:56:00.396
There's even a book
you mentioned,

00:56:00.396 --> 00:56:02.380
The Apartment Farmer.

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.348
There's people here from the
permaculture group, Chris

00:56:06.348 --> 00:56:09.820
Burley, Hayes Valley Farm.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.300
All these folks could be growing
this kind of stuff.

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.284
Maybe we could take a boot camp
course in biointensive,

00:56:14.284 --> 00:56:16.640
so we could get up to speed
real quick and get the

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.244
hundreds of farmers
that we'd need.

00:56:19.244 --> 00:56:20.766
So now you have people
that could have

00:56:20.766 --> 00:56:22.062
all this spare income.

00:56:22.062 --> 00:56:24.762
You could maybe get it down to
a few hours, like you say, a

00:56:24.762 --> 00:56:26.481
day or a month in terms
of tending the farm.

00:56:26.481 --> 00:56:28.936
So you do something before
you go to work.

00:56:28.936 --> 00:56:30.900
Come back, put a little
more water on it.

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.337
Then on the weekends, you go
down to the farmer's market.

00:56:34.337 --> 00:56:37.283
And Liv is there picking up
stuff for the Google kitchens

00:56:37.283 --> 00:56:39.630
or something like that.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.162
The pieces are there if
we can just figure out

00:56:41.162 --> 00:56:43.160
how to put it together.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.000
JOHN JEAVONS: And Cliff, I don't
know because the mic

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.010
didn't seem to be picking
it up fully.

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:50.060
So I'll try to paraphrase.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.750
And you can correct me
if I miss something.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:58.190
Cliff is suggesting that maybe
having a boot camp for Grow

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:01.200
Biointensive Sustainable
Mini-Farming for people

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:07.300
connected with Google could
enable them in window boxes

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.640
using the techniques in the two
editions of The Apartment

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:15.340
Farmer by Duane Newcomb and
other techniques in other good

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.630
books to do it in window
boxes, or barrels, and

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:20.250
containers.

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:25.990
Also, he indicated, as he and
I have talked about, it's

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:28.720
possible to grow all the
vegetables for one person for

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:33.480
all year in this kind
of climate in 200

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.210
square feet or less.

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:38.140
And it actually would probably
take you something like 30

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:38.920
minutes a day.

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.340
And maybe people could
do it before work.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:46.380
Actually, it's an invigorating
thing after work.

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:50.460
But I'll have to let people
experience that themselves.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.630
It's a big mental
jump to make.

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:58.110
I feel more invigorated after
double digging than before.

00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:01.280
And if I don't double dig
every three days, I feel

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.390
withdrawal.

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:07.040
So that may not be
true for you.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:14.590
Then Cliff suggested that the
food from these 100 square

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:17.470
foot, 200 square foot gardens,
window box, and barrel

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:21.630
gardens, some of it could be
then given to the food bank,

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:28.100
or the farmer's market, or even
the restaurants of the

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.340
wonderful cafes here
at Google.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:34.510
It really is, in the future,
going to take all of us to

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.040
make the difference
in the world.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.520
That's why we have
the self-teaching

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.500
section of our website.

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.620
And even if there weren't the
global challenges that there

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:47.010
are-- and there really are--

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:48.840
it's not just a story.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.190
It's there.

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:52.510
But even if those things weren't
there, we'd be doing

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.190
it because it's a lot of fun.

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:56.590
And it's good exercise.

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:58.590
Your food's going
to be fresher.

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.010
It's not going to have
pesticides in it.

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:03.280
And you're going to
be building soil.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.180
Can you imagine?

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:08.325
It's going to be as if you
have geological power.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.790
Why not?

00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:13.560
LIV: Thank you so much.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.460
JOHN JEAVONS: You're welcome.

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:19.688
[APPLAUSE]
