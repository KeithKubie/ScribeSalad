Here's a fairly direct quiz to test your knowledge of

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
environment lookups when we have nested, or chained, environments.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So we have a global environment that maps a to 1,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
b to 2, c to 3, and three other environments.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You are in the last one.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And down here I have five questions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I want to know the value of a, b, c, d, and e

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
as we would have computed it in our JavaScript interpreter.

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Fill in the blanks. Tell me what each one is.
