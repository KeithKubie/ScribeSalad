00:00:12.193 --> 00:00:14.308
Thousands of years in the making,

00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:18.324
what began as part of a religious festival
honoring the Greek god Zeus

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:21.184
in the rural Greek town of Olympia

00:00:21.184 --> 00:00:26.361
has today become the greatest show
of sporting excellence on Earth.

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:29.315
The inception date in 776 BC

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:32.461
became the basis 
for the Greek's earliest calendar,

00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:37.437
where time was marked 
in four-year increments called olympiads.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.781
What could it be?

00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:41.355
Why, it's the Olympic games, of course.

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:46.011
Competition fosters excellence,
or so thought the Ancient Greeks.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.626
In addition to sporting events,

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:51.791
contests were held for music, 
singing, and poetry.

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:55.807
You can read about them all yourself
in classical literary works,

00:00:55.807 --> 00:00:58.830
like Homer's "Iliad" 
and Virgil's "Aeneid."

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.784
Even mythical heroes appreciate 
a good contest every now and then,

00:01:02.784 --> 00:01:04.452
wouldn't you say?

00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:06.118
For the first thirteen games,

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:11.613
the Ancient Greek Olympics featured
just one event, the two hundred yard dash.

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.221
But over time, new exciting contests,

00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.884
like boxing,

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:18.233
chariot and mule racing,

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:22.343
and even a footrace where the competitors
wore a full suit of armor

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:27.285
enticed many hopeful champions
into the Olympic stadium.

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:28.534
The combined running,

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:29.788
jumping,

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.199
wrestling,

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:32.395
javelin throwing,

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.122
and hurling the discus events

00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:38.883
known as the pentathlon
inspired world-class competition,

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:40.135
and the pankration,

00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:45.010
a no holds barred fight where only
biting and eye-gouging were prohibited,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.576
ensured the toughest men were victorious.

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:50.862
And victorious they were.

00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:53.369
Nobody tops the local baker Coroebus,

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.184
who 776 BC became the very first
Olympic champion.

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:02.599
And we'll never forget Orsippus of Megara,

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:09.237
the 720 BC Olympic victor tore away
his loincloth so he could race unimpeded,

00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:13.639
inaugurating the Ancient Greek tradition
of competing in the nude.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.924
Now there's a winning streak,
if ever we've seen one.

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:19.505
But all good things must end.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:25.940
In 391 AD, the Christian Roman Emperor
Theodosius banned pagan practices,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.083
so the world soon bid a fond farewell
to the Olympic games.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.999
But just like those early 
pankration athletes,

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.438
you can't keep a good one down,

00:02:36.438 --> 00:02:40.099
and 1500 years later in 1896,

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.105
the modern Olympic games
kicked off in Athens, Greece.

00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:47.488
Today, the Summer and Winter Olympics

00:02:47.488 --> 00:02:53.141
bring international world-class
athletes together by the thousands,

00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:59.120
uniting fans by the billions for 
the world's foremost sporting competition.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.003
Citius, Altius, Fortius.

00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:03.869
Three cheers for the Olympics.
