Hi, Charles.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.530
&gt;&gt; Hey, Michael.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.140
How's it going?

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; Good, do you want to learn about
temporal difference learning today?

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.300
&gt;&gt; You know what I'd like to do?

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.160
I'd like to learn about temporal
difference learning today.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.770
&gt;&gt; Perfect, because that is the plan.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.610
And in fact, I need you to actually take
a little bit of a break and read Sutton.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.970
&gt;&gt; What you mean the entire thing?

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's just a paper.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.890
There's the Barto and Sutton book,
and Sutton and Barto book, but

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.560
this is actually the paper where he
introduces temporal difference learning.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.340
&gt;&gt; Okay so
you want me to go read that now.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I can wait, you can just pause me.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.830
&gt;&gt; How about I pretend I read it and

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.390
then you take me on
a odyssey of discovery.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.890
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
