&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:22.600
[silence]

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.050
&gt;&gt; JOAN WEEKS: So, good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.720
On behalf of all my colleagues,
in particular, Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.040
Chief of the African and
Middle East Division,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.120
I would like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.250
I'm Joan Weeks, head of
the Near East Section

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.060
and the sponsor of today's program.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.680
We were very pleased to
present this program to you

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.170
on Islamic Architecture and its
relevance to daily human needs.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.360
But, before we start
today's program,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.960
I'd like to give you
just a brief overview

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.760
of our reading room
and our division.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.310
This is a custodial division and
it's comprised of three sections

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.720 position:56%
that build and serve our collections

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.970
to researchers from
around the world.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.910
We cover over 78 countries and
more than two dozen languages.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.400
The Africa section includes all

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.700
of the countries of
South Saharan Africa.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.210
The Hebraic section covers
all of Hebraica worldwide

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.510 position:56%
and the Near East section covers all

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.750
of the Arabic countries
including North Africa, Turkey,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.810
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,
Afghanistan and the Muslims

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.300
of Western China, Russia, and the
Balkans, and both of the Caucuses.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.540
You can see how expansive
our coverage is.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.050
After the program, we'd
like to invite you to fill

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.010
in the little evaluation forms
we've left in your chairs.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.490
This gives us an opportunity
to see how you

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.230
like the program and evaluate them.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.140
Also, we left little flyers in
your seats about our 4 Corners blog

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.370
and if you sign up for the blog and
our Facebook page, you get to hear

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.970
about our future programs and also
see some very interesting posts

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.290
by our curators.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.730 position:56%
We would also let you know that this
program is being videotaped so that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.710
if you ask a question at the end,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.040
you're implicitly giving our
permission to be videotaped.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.430
And after the program, we
have a lovely surprise.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.010
We'd like to invite
you to a reception

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.150

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.650
And we want to thank the
Egyptian Embassy for providing all

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.760

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.770
So, now I'd like to
call upon my colleague,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.480
Fawzi Tadros to introduce
our speaker.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.510
Thank you.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.950
[pause]

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.980
&gt;&gt;FAWZI TADROS: Ladies
and Gentlemen,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.040
Dr. Heba Abdelnabi received
her PhD through the University

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.640
of Alexandria Egypt in 2004.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.280
She received the Fulbright
Foundation's scholarship

to conduct research and
teach at Marymount College,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.640
Virginia in 2007 and 2008.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.770
There, she taught Islamic
art and architecture.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.670
Currently, she is teaching
Islamic architecture

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.140
at University of Alexandria, Egypt.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.290
Dr. Abdelnabi has published
a number of research papers

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.410
in numerous national and
international journals.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.960
She has published a number of
books on topics related to art,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.040
architecture and social
life during the Islamic era.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.590
She held a number of administrative
positions- an executive manager

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.600
of quality assurance unit and
she is currently vice dean

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.730
for graduate students and research
at the faculty of Alexandria.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.890
Dr. Abdelnabi will be speaking
today on the various structure

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.040
in Islamic architecture
including religious, military,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.520
residential, and commercial.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.620
Dr. Abdelnabi is a member
of the Islamic art historian

Middle East Association

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.350
and the Arab Historian Association.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Abdelnabi.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.500
[applause]

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.800
&gt;&gt;HEBA: I'm really honored

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.430
to be invited today by
the Congress Library.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.930
Together, I mean the African
and Middle Eastern division,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.430
in collaboration with the Egyptian
Cultural, and the Egyptian Bureau

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.080
to give a lecture about
Islamic architecture.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.930
So I'm very thankful to Dr.
Fawzi Tadros, Dr. Maidi,

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.290
Dr. Muhammad-Hamsa,
and Dr. Megged Said.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.580
Today the lecture will be
about Islamic architecture.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.740
Actually it will be like an
overview about Islamic architecture

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.880
from the 7th till the 18th century.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.270
The aim of the lecture is to
answer two main questions.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.940
The first question is:
were the buildings designed

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.600
to meet the daily life
needs of the people,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.020 position:56%
the Islamic architectural buildings?

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.300
Were the buildings also designed to
meet the needs of the environment?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.060
Those are the two main
questions I intend to answer,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.900
or to try to answer today
during this lecture.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.720
I thought it would be helpful to
start with the chronology of Egypt,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.640
the chronology of the
Islamic era in general.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.360
First, to show you where we
can see Islamic architecture,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.670
and so when can see Islamic
architecture in various countries

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:11.470 position:56%
in the Middle East, and in Asia too,
like India, and China, and Pakistan.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.360
But actually I will be
focusing on Egypt in particular,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.160
because most of the examples I will
be presenting are about monuments

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.470
or buildings, Islamic
architectural buildings from Egypt.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.890
So, I thought it would
be useful to start

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.830
with telling you the
chronology of the Islamic era

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.640
in Egypt, which was Egypt was ...

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.940
can't hear me?

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.310
... Egypt was opened by
the Arabs, by the Muslims,

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.220
during the Rightly
Guided Caliphs era.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.720
And then it was ruled by the
Umayyad, and then the Abbasids,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.510
and during that era it was
ruled by the Tulanid era

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.550
or the Tulanid Dynasty, and then
it was followed by the Fatimid Era,

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.740
the Ayyubids, and the
Mamluk and the Ottoman.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:08.750
So, I will be presenting
examples from those various eras.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:14.910
Each image that will be presented
has a caption indicating the name

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.870 position:56%
of the place and the era it dates to

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.260
and the place of building,
of course.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.940
To start with, I should mention

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.890
that Islamic architecture
has many types of buildings.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.360
And those buildings could be
classified into 4 main groups:

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.340
religious buildings,
residential buildings,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.230
military buildings,
and service buildings.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.830
And the service buildings,
as we will discuss later,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:48.380 position:56%
could include two types of services:
free services, and paid services.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.070
That's why we included
the commercial buildings

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.210
in that category too.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.280
To start with the religious
buildings,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.390
I will start with the mosque,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.050
which is the most important
building in Islamic architecture.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.080
The earliest mosque in Islamic
architecture was the mosque

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.630
of the Prophet Muhammad
Et El Medina.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.700
But of course, I can't
present an image of the mosque

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.020 position:56%
of the Prophet Muhammad Et El Medina
now, because it does not represent

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.440
at all the original
shape of the mosque.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:25.070
It was pulled down,
rebuilt, renovated, enlarged,

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.580
several times through ages.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.490
So there is a drawing about the
mosque of the Prophet Muhammad.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.010
It shows how simple
the building was.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.730
It was like rectangular area,

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.610
surrounded with a wall
built of mud brick.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:46.700
And it had in its southern part a
roofed area which was called Sulfa.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.050
This roofed area consisted of palm
trunks covered with palm branches.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.710
This is the area which was
devoted for the Muslims to pray in.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.230
And when the number of
the Muslims increased,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.490
they added another roofed
area in the Northern part.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.680
So they had two places for prayer.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.810
The rest of the mosque
was like an open space.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.090 position:56%
Actually this mosque was the nucleus

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.010
of the Muslim community
at that time.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.060
It was not only a religious place

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.890
where you could perform
the 5 daily prayers,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.560
or where you can perform
the Friday prayer.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.120
It was also the administrative
center

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.950
of the newly established
Muslim community.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.340
So, there you could see the
Prophet Muhammad dealing

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.330
with the daily issues
of the Muslim community.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.640
It was also a social place.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.490
A place for social gatherings.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:50.200
They could held weddings, social
meetings, and so on in that mosque.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.860
It was also even used
in during times of war.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.700
They could have like a tent,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.800
in which they could heal the
wounded warriors inside the mosque.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.050
So, it fulfilled many
functions at that time.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.170
And during the reign of
the Rightly Guided Caliphs,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.770
similar simple mosques
were established

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.340
in each of the Islamic capitals.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.120
And they were very much similar to
the mosque of the Prophet Muhammad.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.720
And of course they
functioned exactly

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.310
as the mosque of the
Prophet Muhammad.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:30.200
By the increase in number
of the Muslim Community,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.440 position:56%
that simple building was no longer
sufficient for the Muslim Community.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.660
So by the beginning
of the Umayyad Era,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.520
the Umayyad's had a different plan.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.880
The Umayyad Caliphs had a very
promising building program.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.700
They wanted to have large mosques,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.000
which can be representing the
newly established Muslim empire,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.620
and they can compete
with the other buildings

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.530
of the older civilizations.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.100
So they started to
establish huge mosques.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.700
This is an example of
those early mosques,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.120
which is the great
mosque of the mosques.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.430
You can notice how
huge the mosque is.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.410
It is different from the drawing of
the mosque of the Prophet Muhammad.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:24.160 position:56%
It was paved with marble; it was
richly decorated, as you can notice.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.570
So it is very much different

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.980
from the very simple
mosques in the beginning.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.310
For them it was like the media,

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.510
which will be presenting the
Islamic empire at that time,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.500 position:56%
or the Umayyad Dynasty at that time.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.760
At that time, the plan of the
mosque was very well established.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.950
They decided that the traditional
plan or that plan, or what we need

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.850
in the plan of the mosque, is to
be consisting of open court ...

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.290
if I use the mouse ...

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:05.380
it consists of an open court
surrounded with 4 roofed areas.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.490
Only the roofed areas
were used for prayer.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.020
Okay? But the open court
is not used for prayer.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.080
So this is the plan that we
will see almost everywhere

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:26.190
in the Islamic countries,
and almost in all the eras.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.740
This is, for example, the
mosque of Ahmed ibn Tulun,

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:35.670
which is the main mosque which
was built in the Tulanid's capital

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:41.030
in Egypt, al-Qata'i,
during the Abbasid Era.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.190
We should understand
how it functioned,

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.020
or how the mosque was used.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:51.160
For the Muslims, they have
to perform the Friday prayer.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.950
And according to the
religion at that time,

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.860
they had like strict rules saying

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.620
that the Friday prayer
should be held

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.940
in only one mosque in each city.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.710
So according to that, that
mosque should be, number 1,

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:11.230
be huge in order to inhabit all
the Muslim community or populace.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.500
Number two, it should be
placed, or should be located,

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.750
in the center of the capital,
so it could be accessible

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.750
from all quarters of the city.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:27.760
Number 3, it should have many doors
in order to avoid crowdedness,

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.910
and to be accessible for
as many people as possible

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.320
who will be praying
inside the mosque.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.660
All of that we can see here in
the mosque of Ahmed ibn Tulun,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.490
and all the mosques that
were built at the same time.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.140
You can notice how
huge this mosque was.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.570
It was more than 6,000
square meters.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:58.130 position:56%
And it has 21 doors in all the 3
sides, except for a couple of sides.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.730
And even when they noticed
that it is not large enough

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:09.450 position:56%
to inhabit all the Muslim community,
they added an exterior wall,

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.730
which added an extra
place, which was known

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.850
as "Zierd" or " the addition".

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.090
We will see that here in the plan.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.890
So we see that the plan of the
mosque became like the open court,

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.840
the roofed areas, which we
call at that time "rewalks".

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.130
Those are the places where
the Muslims can pray.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:36.360
Those openings are the doors,
and this is the exterior wall,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.390
which was even added, to add
an extra place for prayer,

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.560 position:56%
which is the zierd, or the addition.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.550
We notice also that inside
each one of the 4 rewalks,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.680
there are rows of columns.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.920
Those rectangular things
are the columns,

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.450
which were built inside the mosque.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.240
And they carry the arches,
in order to carry the roof.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.920
This is the first function.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.140
And it also facilitate
organizing the Muslims

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.720
into rows when they pray.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.500
What else do we need
inside the mosque?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.850
What should be inside the mosque?

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.450
The first thing that should be
inside the mosque is the prayer

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.250
niche or the kabla direction.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:26.150
A place to indicate
the kabla direction.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.120
According to the Islamic religion,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.070
all Muslims have to
face Mecca in prayer.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:38.460
And of course the direction of
kabla, or the direction of prayer,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:44.380
would vary from country to another
according to its relation to Mecca.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.740
For example, in Egypt, the Kabla
direction is towards south east.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.820
In Iraq it is towards south west.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.500
In the United States, for example,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.200
it would be towards
east, or south east.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.900
Okay? So it varies from
place to another according

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.330
to its location in
relation to Mecca.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:09.750
So, each mosque has to have
an indicator of the kabla,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.020
in order to help the
people who will pray to know

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.770
where to stand and what to face.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:21.380
The kabla direction was in the
beginning, just a mark on the wall,

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.900
which was simple and flat.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.560
But later, the Muslims started to
make the prayer niche in that form,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.210
which is a concave prayer niche.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.510
Why concave?

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.790 position:56%
Because the imam would be facing the
prayer niche, and the concave shape

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:42.950
of the prayer niche would
resonate the sound of the imam.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.290
Another thing, which is very
important inside the mosque,

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.040
or specifically inside the jama.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.340
The jama is the congregation
in mosque,

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.180
where the Friday prayer is held.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.740
So it is the large one
that we mentioned before.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.210
The jama should have
a member, or pulpit.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:06.690
The pulpit is the place where the
imam can preach the worshippers,

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.160
before starting the prayer
and it is an essential part

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.950
of the Friday prayer.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:18.050
So they added another furniture,
or we can call it another element,

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.700
inside the mosque,
which is the pulpit.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.420
The pulpit as you can notice, is
a raised place, or a raised seat

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.780
for the imam, ascended
by a flight of steps.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:37.340
And on top of that place, there is
a dome, also to resonate the sound.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:43.500
Not that only, but they even added
another huge dome above the area

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.760
of the prayer niche, and the
pulpit together, above the square

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.160
which occupies the prayer
niche and the pulpit,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.730
because the pulpit is usually to
the right of the prayer niche.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.140
So they added a dome
above that square in order

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.690
to resonate and magnify the sound.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:06.360
But still, could you imagine
in a mosque as the mosque

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:12.270
of Ahmed ibn Tulun, which I
showed you the picture of.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:16.560
Do you imagine that the people who
are praying in the back rewalk,

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.290
at the end of the mosque,
would listen to the imam?

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.040
Would hear the imam?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.190
Probably not, because
it is very huge.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.950
So they probably would
not hear the imam.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.520
That's why they added another
element inside the mosque

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.150
which was called Dikket Imobiluh.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:37.670
Dikket al-mubaligh is a platform,
either made of wood or made

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.870
of marble carried on
a group of columns,

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.420
and ascended by a flight of steps.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.290
And on top of that place,
there used to be a man

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:52.030 position:56%
who will scold al-mubaligh, who
repeats whatever the imam is saying.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.390
Here is the prayer niche,
and next to it is the pulpit.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.640
So the imam would be standing here,
and the man, or the al-mubaligh,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.280
on top of the dikket,
would be seeing the imam

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.320
and would repeat whatever
the imam was saying.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.810
So the people at the back

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.090
of the mosque would hear
him, or at least see him.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.690
How they would see him, this
dikket was located at the end

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.820
of the kabla rewalk,
overlooking the open court.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.220
So they would see him
through the open courts.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.910
What else do we need
inside the mosque?

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.900
We also need a fountain, which
was usually located in the center

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.370
of the open court, in order
to perform a volution,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:39.110 position:56%
and to provide drinking water during
summertime, which are very hot,

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.960
of course, in the Middle East.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.680
We also need the minaret.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.640
The minaret is a very high
tower, which was built on top

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.260
of the building, on top of
the mosque, on its ceiling.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:57.590
It was used by the Mu'asin, who was
responsible to call for the prayer.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.860
And by that mean, all the
people from all quarters

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.940
of the city would hear the
call of prayer, and would come

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.050
to the mosque for prayer.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.870
Now we come to the second
building or the second type

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.120
of religious buildings,
which is the madrasa.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.440
I mentioned that the mosque
was functioning as the nucleus

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.920
of the Muslim community, and
actually it fulfilled all the needs

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.080
of the newly established community.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.280
Elementary education was
even held inside the mosque.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.890
You would see things like that.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:40.130
The sheik, or the imam, would be
sitting next to one of the pillars,

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.660
and the students would be
gathering around him in a circle.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.340
That's why they call that system
of education the Halakah education.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.180
Halakah is the equivalent
word to circle in Arabic.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.690
Okay? So they call it
the Halakah education.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:01.410
So those could be young
children, and could be also adults

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:06.500
who are listening to highly
educated sheik or imam.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.480
This system of education was called
Halakah, was called also rewalk,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.260
referring to the place where
the education was held,

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.670
or the teaching was held.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:23.560
It was also called Zoiah,
because they could take a corner

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.670
of the rewalk in order
to have their listen.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:36.630 position:56%
Some of the most, actually, only the
large mosques had a similar Halakah,

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.110
but for adults.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.440
And that was a sort of
informal higher education,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.140
or informal type of
higher education.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.290
It was free of charge,
but yet it was depending

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.900
on that sheik or the imam.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.780
It depends on his time,
his availability.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.300
So it was not established as
a formal system of education.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.720 position:56%
By the 10th century, the Muslims
realized they needed a formal system

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.790
of education for higher
education in particular.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:15.110
That's when they separated
the education from the mosque.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.260
Or they took the education
outside of the mosque.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.250
They started what we
call the madrasa.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.040
The Suljuks, or the Suljuk Sultans,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.760
are those who started the
building of the madrasa.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.510
The earliest madrasa
was built in Baghdad,

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.240
which was called El
Muston Cerea madrasa.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.140
And after that, the Ayyubids
followed the same traditions

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.700
of the Suljuks and
they brought the idea

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.510
of buildings the madrasas
into Egypt.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.590
So they started- the madrasas
started during the Ayyubid Era.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.340
Salah ad-Din Ayubb
was alone responsible

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.070
for building 10 madrasas
in his reign.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.450
And his successors followed
him in the same tradition.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:01.190
And it became a very popular
building during the Mamluk period

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.490
in particular.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:07.560
The plan of the madrasa
was different from the plan

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.330
of the mosque in order to fulfill
the function of the madrasa,

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.420
which is different from
the function of the mosque.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.680
What was the function
of the madrasa?

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.640
The madrasa, according
to the suljuks,

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:28.070
was intended to provide formal
system of higher education,

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:33.720 position:56%
and it was also intended to be a way

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.120
to stop the Shiite spread
in the Muslim countries.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.650
So the Suljuks intended to teach
the Sunni laws inside the madrasa.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:48.510
And in the Sunni law, we have 4
schools of thought, which are:

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.620
the Shafi'i, Hanafi,
Hanbali, and Maliki.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.830
That's why when they started
erecting the madrasas,

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.160
most of them were following
that plan

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.000
which we call the cruciform
plan, which consists

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.040
of an open court surrounded
with 4 ewinds.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.500
It's not rewalk this time,
those are called ewind.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.840
What is the ewind?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.630
The ewind is like a huge room,
overlooking the open court,

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.330
and it opens to the open
court as you can see.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:23.270
So it could be like a classroom
for a group of students.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:27.560
By the way, this is the largest
ewind in Islamic architecture

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.550
in Cairo, which is the Kabla Ewind
of the Madrasa of Sultan Hasan.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:37.920
This was visited by
Barack Obama by the way.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.960
It was intended to be the largest
in Islamic architecture in order

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.210
to compete with Ikistra Ewind,
which had the reputation

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.080
of being the largest
Ewind in architecture.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:56.700
The madrasa was functioning
as a boarding school.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:02.200
So, both the teachers and the
students' lives inside the madrasa.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.330
In order to accommodate with that,

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.560
the madrasa should
have residential rooms

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.850
for both the teachers
and the students.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.290
The madrasa should also
have a kitchen, bathrooms,

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:18.000
stables for the donkeys
or the animals

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.350
of the teachers and the students.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:25.090
Okay? Sometimes even in large
madrasas they had a small hospital,

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.230
in order to serve the students

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.200
and the teacher living
inside the madrasa.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.640
So it has all the services
they might need.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.280
Actually, I should
mention one thing also.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.710
It was free.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:45.270
It was a system of education
that is free of charge.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.010
Moreover, it was funded
by the patron.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.520
By the way the patron, or the
person who built the madrasa,

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.370
they were usually sultans, amirs,
high officials, wealthy merchants,

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:01.530
or judges, things like that

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:05.310
who would have initiation
to build a madrasa.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.100
And they fund everything.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.780
They set the rules for
choosing the students.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.920
They set their administration
regulations inside the madrasa.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:20.280
They set how the fund will be
distributed inside the madrasa.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.580
And both the teachers and the
students will get stipends

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.820
for being in the madrasa.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.630
They would receive 3 daily
meals, 3 hot meals per day.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.400
They would receive clothes in
the beginning in the beginning

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.100
of summertime, and the
beginning of winter time.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:44.840
All that was more like
incentives to learn at that time.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.410
It was very successful,
especially in the Mamluk period.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.480
How about elementary education?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.900
This was the form of
education for adults.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.560
How about elementary education?

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.790
Elementary education was separated
from the mosque at the same time

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.490
as the madrasa, and it functioned
inside another institution

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:10.030
which was called al kuttab.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:15.460
It could be private kuttab, it
could be government funded kuttab,

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.600
and it was like a very simple
room, where students gathered

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.030
to learn Quran- the
reading, recitation,

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.100
and memorization of Quran.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:34.180
In addition to basics of
grammar, and basics of math.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:41.270
This is the kuttab from outside,
and the other kuttab from inside.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:47.850
By the way, my master's
degree was about the katatib

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.300
in the Mamluk Era in Egypt.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.200
Of course you notice that
their education was more

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.010
like religious education.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.630
Okay? Either in the
kuttab, or in the madrasa.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:05.000
But some of the large madrasa
provided classes for chemistry,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.610
physics, medicine, but those were
limited and according to the will

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:13.930
of the patron, as I mentioned.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:19.490
Another religious building is the
monastic mosque, or the khanqah.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:24.550
The khanqah was built
in response to sophism,

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:28.570
which started to be
witnessed in the 4th century

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.750
of Islam or the 10th century.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.730
Again, the building of the
khanqah was created or started

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:42.380
by the Suljuks, and from
them, Ayyubids took the idea

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.490
and presented into Egypt.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:50.260
Sufism is some way or
another close to monastism.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.450
It is a way of thinking
where you abandon life

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.610
and just devote your
life for worship.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.130
So the people who are living
inside the khanqah are not working,

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.170
so they should have been
funded by the government.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.520 position:56%
This is a place where they can live,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.890
and they can receive
their education.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.540
And at the same time
they are self-sufficient.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.070
So they would do all the
required work inside the khanqah

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.780
without needing anything
else from outside.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.550
The khanqah was following
either the plan of the madrasa

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.240
or the plan of the mosque.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.590
But the most essential part inside
the khanqah was the halaweit.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.690
The halaweit are the small rooms

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:38.080
where the Sufis can alienate
themselves in order to worship.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.750
So they were very small rooms, and
it was also just like the madrasa

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:46.170
in terms of regulations
and the functioning system.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.240
So they also have their
own kitchen, bathroom,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.190
everything they might
need of services.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.520
Another religious building is the
mausoleum, or the burial place.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.540
In Arabic, we call it
maktfin, or torbah.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.730
Okay? In the beginning of Islam,
the mausoleum was a separate place

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.330
which was usually outside
of the city.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:12.000 position:56%
But by the end of the Ayyubid Era,
they started to attach the mausoleum

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.300
to a religious building,
either a madrasa or a khanqah.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.730
What is the reason behind that?

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:23.790
Number one, to commemorate the name
of the deceased person in the city

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.340
between the people so he could
be remembered by the people,

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.930
not in a remote place outside
of the city, that's number one.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.950
And number two, to benefit
from the prayers of the people

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.010
who are benefiting from the
free services offered to those

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.460
who are using the building.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.390
As I mentioned, the
madrasa was free.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:46.670
So all the services are
provided by the patron.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.840
So the people, or the students,
would always be praying

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.440
for the patron who provided
them all of those free services.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.670
So, in Egypt it would
be very regular scene

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:03.350
to see each mosque attached
with a mausoleum like this one.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:08.870
And this huge building contains
the burial place of the founder.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:14.930
They use the place for reciting
the Quran 24-7, all day long.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.790
And the people passing by
the place would be listening

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.330
to the Quran being
recited all the time,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:26.910
and of course that also brings
blessings to the deceased person.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:33.840
Those are normal scenes
from Islamic architecture

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.390
that we can see in Egypt.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.940
Each mosque, each madrasa, attached

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.400
with a mausoleum especially
in the Mamluk periods.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:49.250
Now we come to the second type
of Islamic architecture building

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.530
which is military buildings.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:56.330 position:56%
Military buildings were witnessed in
Egypt as early as the Fatimid Era.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.670
Only the Fatimids felt that
they need military architecture.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:06.190
Why? They built the 4th Islamic
capital in Egypt, which is Ohara.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.490
After Al-Fustat, Al-Askar,
and Al-Qata'i.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.990
So this was the 4th capital, and
this capital was the residence

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.940
of the caliph, the high
officials, and the army.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.550
So, they felt it should
be protected.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:30.110
As a result they surrounded the
city with walls built of mud brick

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.690
in the beginning, and then
renovated to be built of stone.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:39.170 position:56%
And those walls were penetrated with
8 doors that were closed at night

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:45.390
in order to protect the people
inhabiting the city Those walls

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:50.110 position:56%
and gates were like fortified gates,
so they would look like castles,

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:53.020 position:56%
or they would like towers like that.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.030
And they were named with the names

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.910
that could bring good
luck, or good fortune.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:02.380
For example, this is the
gate of victory, Belbanash.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.960
And this is Belbatua,
or gate of opening.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.870 position:56%
So all are names to bring good luck,

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:13.250
of course for the sultan
or the caliph.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:20.270
During the Ayyubid Era, it was,
that particular era was the epic,

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:26.390 position:56%
or the apex of building
architecture because of the struggle

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.490
against crusades at that time.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:35.600
So Salah Al Din Ayubb built the
castle of Salah Al Din Ayubb,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.750
which was built on top
of the Moqattam Hill,

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.150
in the center of the capital.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:47.940
And this citadel was actually
divided into two parts:

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:53.180
the northern enclosure wall,
which was built during the era

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.510
of Salah Al Din himself,
and it was totally military

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.520
in spirit and in function.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.440
But then after the death of Salah
Al Din, some of his successors

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.870
like the sultan Al-Kamil, decided
to have the citadel as the seeds

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:14.820
of rulership, the place where
he can rule the country from.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.730
So they added the further enclosure
wall, and they added palaces,

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:24.030
administrative centers, gardens
and whatever they might need.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:29.810
And it continued to be used as
the seat of the governor of Egypt

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:35.700
since the reign of Al-Kamil
till the building of Adim Palace

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.190
in the modern time in Egypt.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:41.800
Now we come to the
third type of buildings,

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.310 position:56%
which are the residential buildings.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.760
There were three types of
buildings, of course according

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.500
to the economic status of people.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.370
On top of those, were the palaces.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:57.190
Only the elites and
the wealthy people

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.910
of the country could
afford to live in a palace.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:05.160
And then the house, only wealthy
people could afford to live

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.330
in a house, but the house
could inhabit a huge family,

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.440
up to 400 persons in some cases.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.340
And for the common people,
or the middle class,

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.250
they would live in
a place call Rabah.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:25.670
Rabah is like a large building
with rooms that could be rented,

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:30.410 position:56%
and in each floor there is a
bathroom, and all the people renting

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:34.090
on that floor would be
sharing the bathroom together.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.250
Okay? This is the residential
building,

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.330
or this is the residential
accommodation

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.700
for the military class.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:49.940
The house was very much
similar to the palace,

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.910
but it was smaller in size.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:55.170
So, all the components
of the house were similar

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.470
to the components of the palace.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.520 position:56%
What are those components in
relation to the needs of the people?

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.330
We should have an open court.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.970
I think you've noticed that the
open court is very essential

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.330
in Islamic architecture.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.480
It is the nucleus of each building.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.780
Most of the buildings
have the open court,

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.650
and we will see later
why it is important.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:22.320
So, the center of the building, or
the house, would be the open court,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.580 position:56%
and all the parts of the house would
be surrounding that open court.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.760
We need a reception
hall for the guests.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.480
That's what we need
inside the house.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.810
We need a reception
hall for the guests.

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.330
We need a sitting place
for the people,

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.910
the house owner and
his family, okay?

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.550
So this would be call Makhad.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.160
Makhad is the sitting
place in Arabic,

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.460 position:56%
and it is overlooking the open court
so that the owner of the house,

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:58.450
or the family, or the parents,
would be supervising the children

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.550
who might be playing
in the open court.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.470
In addition to many other
rooms used as bedrooms,

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.830
and they were very simple
in terms of decoration,

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.780
except for the ceiling which was
usually wooden ceiling richly

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.340
decorated with floral
decorations and inscriptions.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.620
Of course, we need a
kitchen inside the house.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.250
We also need bathrooms
inside the house.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.240
Those are the components of
the residential building.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.590
Now we come to the
fourth type of buildings

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:39.380
which is the service buildings,
and the commercial buildings too.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.040
Here we will be differentiating
between two types of buildings.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:49.490
Buildings providing free
service, and other buildings

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.660
which are providing paid services.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.780
Let's start with the bathroom.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.180
As I mentioned, only the
wealthy people can afford

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.440
to live in a palace or a house.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.100
And only those who have their own
bathroom, but the common people,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.300
or the middle class would be
sharing a bathroom with others.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:14.800
So having a public bathroom was
very important at that time.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.010
And those public bathrooms
were used for all people.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.670
Even the wealthy ones.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.540
They would use the public bathroom.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.200
And they go to the bathroom
at least once a week,

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.940
and there they can have
bathing, massage, cleaning,

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.690
all the services you could
imagine in the bathroom.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.990
And by the way you can still see
the bathroom functioning in some

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:44.360
of the Islamic countries such
as in Turkey, and in Morocco.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.420
They are still existing and they
are still functioning actually.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:53.040
The bathroom would be divided
into three main sections.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.860
The first section, which
is called the cold room,

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.050
where you can take off your clothes

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:03.460
and take a shower with
the cold water.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:10.370
And then the second room where
you can find places for massaging.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:14.770
And then the third room
where you can find a bath tub

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:19.250
with very hot water and you
can have your bathing there.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:24.350
Of course this is not
a free service.

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:27.290
That was a paid service.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:32.060
Another service, which
is free this time.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.870
It's the sabil.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.610
The sabil is a place
that provides water free

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.160
of charge to any passerby.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.680
This was very essential in
hot countries like in Egypt.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:48.220
For example, imagine the
temperature during summertime,

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:52.570
and going from place to
another in the hot days,

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.500
of course you would need a drink.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:02.020
So that place would provide you a
cup with cold water free of charge.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.320
What is the sabil?

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.070
It's a very simple building.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.370
It consists of one room.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:10.910
This is the room above
the ground level,

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:16.350
but there is a system below
it which is under the ground.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.040
And the system was
filled with water,

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.410
of they can provide their
daily needs by Al Saka,

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:28.800
or the one who carries water
and brings to the sabil.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:35.080
Inside the sabil, a man used to
work who's known as Misamilati.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:43.770
His duty was to clean the
sabil, and fill the basin

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.750
in front of each of the windows.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.870
Of course the sabil should have
as many windows as possible

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.470
in order to help so many people.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:57.740
So in front of each window
there would be a basin.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.500
The duty of the Mismimilati is
to fill that basin with water,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:08.900
and to hand water in cups
through the window to the people.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:12.430
That's the basin, okay?

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:16.520
Another service, which
was offered at that time,

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.400
and the architecture was
responding to that need

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.710
of the society, was the wikala.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:24.010
This is another service.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:27.230
It is like a hotel, but for
merchants in particular.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:31.660
The wikala could be
seen inside the city.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:36.660
Again, it consists of an open
court, and it has storage room

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.290
in the lower level,
or the ground level,

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.380
where merchants can
save their merchandise.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.470
And then in the upper levels there
are rented rooms that could be used

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.500
by those travelers
or those merchants.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.980
Similar to this building
was the khan,

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.940
but the khan was built outside
the city on the travel routes.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.060
But it has the same plan.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.770
And also similar to
that, is the market.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:08.900
But instead of renting a room,
they would rent a shop instead.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:14.890
So that's the market from inside.

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:19.230
Then we come to the
last service building,

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:22.370
which is the hospital,
or the bimarstan.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.410
It is actually a unique building,

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.910
because it offered
free medical service.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:35.940
And the place is open to everyone,
regardless their nationality,

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:42.130
their economic status, their social
status, their religion, their sex.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:46.310
It was open to all the people,
and it provided everything.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:50.430
It provided them food, it
provided them the medicine.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:55.820
Even if a poor patient died inside
the hospital, they would take care

00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:01.930
of his burial, and do all the
necessary things to be done.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:06.620
The bimarstan was following
the same plan of the madrasa,

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.610
which is an open court
surrounded by 4 ewinids,

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.050
in order to facilitate
the segregation

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:18.320
of patients according
to the deceased.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.480
I think by now we can to a
conclusion that those buildings,

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.960
each and every one of those
buildings was fulfilling a need

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.590
for the society, or fulfilling
a need for the people.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.870
But how about understanding
the needs of the environment?

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:39.680
Was that also witnessed in
Islamic architecture or not?

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.330
Let's see.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:44.590
We noticed that the open
in the mosque for example.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:47.340
Let's start by the mosque.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.190
Let's start by the mosque.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:55.210
We should have an open court in
addition to the roofed areas.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:58.020
And the open court was
very necessary in order

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:04.210
to provide lighting and ventilation
for the other roofed areas.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.750
Moreover, the roofed areas
usually have high ceiling

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:13.380 position:56%
for the same reasons- for
providing lightning and ventilation.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.220
Water was very essential
inside the mosque,

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.410
in order to provide drinking water,

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.190
and to moisture the
air inside the place.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.510
In the madrasa, the same applies.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:28.310
Water was very essential
inside the madrasa.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:32.530
So each madrasa would have
either a well, a water well,

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.760
or a sabil inside the madrasa.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.870
They had their own
standards for the rooms

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.800
of the teachers and the students.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.800
Each room should have
at least one window,

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.140
either overlooking the open
court, or overlooking the street

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:52.480
like this case, in order
to be very well ventilated.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.830
And as for the kitchens, bathrooms,
and stables, they should be located

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.050
on the south of the madrasa.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.350
Why on the southern
side of the madrasa?

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:05.790
Because most of the wind in Egypt
is north or northeastern wind,

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.280
so the wind will take
the bad smells away

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.290
from the madrasa, not
into the madrasa.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:15.370
As for the kuttab, which
inhabited a large number

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:19.250
of children all the time,
it should be an open place

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.590
with so many openings.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.410
But at the same time, its ceiling
would be protecting the children

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:31.410
from the sun during their study.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.710
Another unique thing is the
standards they followed inside

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.010
the house.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:41.950
The entrance of the house for
example should be a bent entrance,

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:46.400
which means if you are standing in
front of the entrance of the house,

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.260
you wouldn't be able to see
anything in the interior.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.490
You wouldn't be able to see
the people inside the house.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:58.270
Why? To provide the privacy for
the people, and at the same time,

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:03.110
to protect the interior of the
house from the dust in the street.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:08.780
And of course having the
open court would be essential

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.840
to provide lighting and ventilation
to all the parts of the house.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:19.870
I'll have just two minutes.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:23.710
Another thing which
is very unique also

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.480
in the house was the
use of Mushrabaya.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.700
The Mushrabaya is to
cover the windows,

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.220
and it is made of turnid wood.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.870
So it is like pierced wood, that
can purify the air which is coming

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.790
into the room and at the
same time providing privacy

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:45.680
for the women behind the
windows so no one can see them.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.770
The use of high ceilings,
also to provide cooling

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:55.090
for the reception hall,
which is the hall for guests.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:56.880
The use of marble.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.280
Some of the reception halls
had a fountain in them.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.110
And the fountain, of
course, was made of marble

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:09.820
and was having running
water in summertime,

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.570
also to provide moisturing
for the air in the summertime.

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:20.290
The open logia, or the open place,
the sitting place for the family,

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.100
was built in the northern
side of the house in order

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:28.240
to be facing the north or the
northeastern wind, as we mentioned

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.710
which was the common wind in Egypt.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:33.290
Of course, also to be
the perfect location

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:38.070
for sitting during
summer nights and days.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:43.200
The sabil- they also have their
own standards for the health,

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.520 position:56%
and for the health of the mosomalati
who works inside the sabil.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.950
They had very strict regulations
in terms of the clean linens,

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:54.220
the cistern, the cups, the basin,

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:58.000
and how they provide the
water for the people.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.130
So, all of that to keep the
healthy condition of the place.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:08.080
They even have a unique thing

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.030
which is a small basin below
each one of the windows.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.010
So if you have some
remaining water in your cup,

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.240
you wouldn't throw them
or get rid of them.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.670
You would pour them in the basin,

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:26.140
which would be used for
drinking of animals.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:31.160
The same regulations that applied
in the house would be applied also

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:36.310
in the wikela, and the khan,
which were like residential places

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.100
but for merchants or travelers.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.740
And last but not least,
is the hospital.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:48.050
As I mentioned, the segregation was
very important to reduce infection.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.940
So they would segregate
between the patients according

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.670
to the disease they have.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:57.990
And also they have very strict
regulations in terms of preparing

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.610
and preserving food,
drinks, and medicine in order

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.870
to avoid contamination
of food and medicine,

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:09.020
and to reduce the infection.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:11.260
So actually we can conclude

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:15.290
that they understood very well
the needs of the environment.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:19.450 position:56%
They understood very well the needs
of the society, the daily life needs

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:24.540
of the people, and one of
the architects in Egypt known

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:31.230
as Hassan Fatri, actually was
inspired by Islamic architecture

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:36.680
to create modern houses and modern
places, who would be functioning

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.270
in today, and fulfilling the
needs of the people exactly

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.610
as the Islamic architecture
fulfilled the needs of the people.

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:46.890
I hope I didn't take too much time,

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.690
and thank you very
much for listening.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.510
[applause]

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.140
:

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:59.000
&gt;&gt;FAWZI: Anybody have questions?

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.090
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:38.330
&gt;&gt;HEBA: I think it was
easier for them to build

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:40.810
in rectangular square buildings.

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:45.940
It was easier to handle the
available space inside but this is

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:47.600
in terms of the building.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.770
As for the city, the
normal thing for cities

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:55.990
in Islamic architecture was to
build the round shape cities.

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:58.720
So, the cities would be circular
while the buildings would be

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.860
rectangular or square...

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.980
Yes, please.

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:16.430
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.110
&gt;&gt;HEBA: Yes, sure.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:44.830
As for prayers- during the time
of the Rightly Guided Khalifs,

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:47.210
women used to pray behind men,

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.150
but they were not separated
from the men.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.130
So, just behind them.

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:58.440
But, after that, during the
Ummayid era, we have no record

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.180
that they were also
separated from men.

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:04.540
So, probably they would have
been praying behind the men

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:09.840 position:56%
and it happened like that all the
time probably until the Ottoman time

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.050
when we started to see
a sort of a separation

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:17.080
by providing a specific
place for women to pray in-

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:20.450
separated from the place for men.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:21.840
This is for prayer.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:28.060
As for education, we have
records of historians telling us

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:32.460
that families were
sending their children,

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.380
I mean female children, the girls.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:39.820
They would send them to private
katatib to receive education.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:44.140
Okay? So, children, I mean
the girls were also taught,

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.890
but probably they were taught
only the elementary education,

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:51.620
so they received only the
elementary education and the

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:56.540
of course those are the wealthy
family only, but the common people

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.870
who are in the middle class,
it would be hard for them

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:05.630
to send their girls for- to
receive education in the kattab.

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:09.470
But, during the Mamluk period
I told you that my thesis was

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:13.790
about the katatib in
the Mamluk period.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:19.350
I realize that during the Mamluk
period, there were some katatibs

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:25.440
for girls only and some other
katatibs for boys and some

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:32.190
of the elite of the society would
continue to send their girls

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:40.460 position:56%
to a specific sheik or teacher in
order to give them higher education.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:44.090
So we have records about women
who were reciting the Quran

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:48.750
or telling hadis after the
prophet Mohammed or a famous woman

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:53.220
who were historians so that
appeared but only in medieval times

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.180
in Eesef Egypt which
I can tell about.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.480
Thank you.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.780
Yes?

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:09.030
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.800
&gt;&gt;HEBA: Yes, sure.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.900
They are preserved actually the
ministry of tourism together

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:29.680
with the Ministry of Archaeology
are paying or doing so much effort

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.850
to preserve those buildings,
especially in Cairo.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:36.580
We have more than 500
Islamic buildings in Cairo.

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:40.340
You know that Cairo was known
as the City of Southern Minarets

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:43.120
because it chose to have more
than a thousand buildings

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:48.260
of Islamic architecture,
but the number was reduced.

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:52.620
But, they are doing so much
effort to preserve those buildings

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.630
and paying so much to
maintain them and some

00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:01.090
of them are offering guiding
tours or guided tours also.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:06.730
But, the problem about Islamic
architecture is that it is mingling

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:09.240
with the community- it is,

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.860
if you want to see the
Islamic architecture,

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:15.920
you would go to the narrowest
streets of Cairo and you would go

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.360
to inhabited districts
or neighborhoods.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:25.040
So, it is not in a separate tourism
area, but it is within the city.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.340
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:44.570
&gt;&gt;HEBA: No, actually
they moved away.

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:49.500
The effort of Hassan Fatri,
the architect that I mentioned.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:54.930
To my knowledge, the only effort
to revive the Islamic architecture.

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:58.290
It happened in a specific period
during the Ottoman period.

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:03.580
There was a revival to the Mamluk
architecture in particular.

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.000
That's what they called
newmamlakstein which appeared

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.740 position:56%
by the end of the Ottoman period but
in the modern times, they abandoned

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.440
that type of architecture
and they prefer

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.410
of course the modern architecture.

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:21.400
To my knowledge, as I mentioned, it
was only the effort of Hassan Fatri

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.970
who was trying to revive it again.

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:33.090
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:13.040
&gt;&gt;HEBA: Yeah, we actually have a
problem in Islamic architecture

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:17.870
in Egypt that most of the time,
the architect was anonymous person.

00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:19.170
We don't know him.

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:20.470
He did not record his name.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:25.060
He did not mention anything
to help us identify him.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.450
So, most of the time,
he was anonymous.

00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:31.030
Unless we found, for example in
the madrasa of the Sultan Hasan,

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.420
we found the name of the
architect and the decorator.

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:39.320
On the minaret of the madrassa on
- on the minaret of iron chaif,

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.040
we found also the name
of the architect.

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:47.040
But, those were just a few examples
of names that we managed to find.

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.420
Other than this, they
remained anonymous.

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:53.210
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:54.510
&gt;&gt;HEBA: Probably yes.

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:57.030
Probably they were
considered as craftsmen,

00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:00.470
not like the elite of that society.

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:02.380
So they were not recognized.

00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:04.150
Even Sunan.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.910
Sunan the elder and Sunan the
younger had their own architecture

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:11.660
in Egypt- had their own
fingerprints in Egypt.

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:15.610
Maybe by the Ottoman period,
that they paid attention

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:21.100
to mention the name of the
architect and to commemorate him

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:25.520
in history and in architecture too.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.020
&gt;&gt;Fawzi: Thank you very much.

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:32.510
There is a reception right now.

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:37.550
[applause]

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:41.190
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
