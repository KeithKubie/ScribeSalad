00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.961
It's easy in 3JS to hook up the mouse, keyboard, and other devices as

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:07.660
interactive controls for objects in a scene. We've been doing this all along

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.292
with demos such as the robot arm. There's much JavaScript code to draw upon for

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:15.630
getting inputs connected to programs, such as the dat.gui library for sliders.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.204
However, up to this point we've had little direct interaction with our virtual

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:22.192
worlds. By direct interaction I mean using the mouse to click on the world

00:00:22.192 --> 00:00:25.940
itself and change its appearance. The main direct interaction so far has been

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.614
using the mouse to move the camera. As an example of another direct interaction

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:32.890
in this demo by Max Ogden and James Halliday I'm clicking to remove blocks or

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.520
add them. Programs can be seen limiting without these sorts of direct

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.634
interactions with what the user sees. Even when moving around the scene with

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:44.280
the mouse, in many demos it says if we're a ghost, we can walk through walls or

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.374
drop through the floor, there's nothing stopping us. By instead performing

00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:51.318
what's called collision detection between objects, and having the program

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:55.473
respond to those collisions, we can create a more believable world. We can also

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:58.434
use physics to determine how our actions and the movements of other objects

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:02.413
change what we see. If you've played any computer game, you know how various

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:07.230
button pushes and so on are tightly tied to what you see on the screen. How the

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.550
world reacts to inputs such as these is often shown through animation

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.272
techniques of one sort of another. Up to this point, we've mostly been ignoring

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:17.141
this fourth dimension, time. Once we start changing elements in our scene over

00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:20.683
time, we're performing animation. Animations can also be run in their own

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:24.822
right. Streams flow down a hillside. People walk past you in a marketplace. The

00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:28.575
sun sets over ocean waves. Animation, such as shown in this demo by Daniel

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:31.365
Heat, gives a scene life and a sense of engagement even when there's little

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:35.670
interaction. What I'm going to cover in this unit is a sampling of interaction

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.850
and animation techniques. So let's get going.
