00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
OK.
Good morning.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.875
In the last lecture I did a
little demonstration for you

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:29.000
where I showed you a pair of
inverters.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.818
And showed you that the output
of the first inverter looked

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:40.436
weird, certainly not like
anything we have seen thus far.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:45.352
It looked like a slow rising
transition like this.

00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:50.770
And using that motivation we
have begun our study of RC

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.783
circuits.
And in particular for today the

00:00:54.783 --> 00:01:00.000
lecture is titled "Digital
Circuit Speed".

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.846
We are going to look at the
fundamentals of digital circuit

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:07.855
speed.
And it all boils down to an RC

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:10.529
delay.
By the end of the lecture,

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:15.208
I am going to show you two
numbers that you can look at a

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:19.470
circuit and obtain by
observation, multiply them out

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.401
and you will get a good idea of
the speed at which a circuit

00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:26.908
will run.
It is pretty amazing.

00:01:26.908 --> 00:01:33.702
So as a quick review --
The relevant section for this

00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:37.276
is Chapter 10.4.
As a review,

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:44.936
we said to understand things
like this we need to develop the

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:52.212
foundations for RC circuits.
And the example I covered was

00:01:52.212 --> 00:02:00.000
that of a very simple circuit
that looked like this --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.043
An RC circuit of this form.
And I also showed you that for

00:02:09.043 --> 00:02:16.975
an input of the form,
input that steps from zero to

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:26.177
VI at time T equal to zero.
And assuming that the capacitor

00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:33.000
state at time T equals zero was
zero.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.481
What this means is that the
capacitor starts from rest,

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:41.729
so at time T=0,
oops, this is VI,

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:45.890
I'm sorry.
So we assume that the capacitor

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.661
starts from rest.
At time T=0 I apply a VI step,

00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:54.823
capital VI.
And then I want to look at how

00:02:54.823 --> 00:03:00.000
the voltage across the capacitor
behaves.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.060
And we did a bunch of analysis.
And at the end of the day,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.853
in the final demo in the
lecture last time I showed you

00:03:09.853 --> 00:03:13.493
that the capacitor would behave
like this.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.890
It would start off at,
oops.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.198
I am sorry.
This should be,

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.305
let's assume that started off
at VO.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:24.501
We get a different equation for
zero.

00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:28.407
So let's say the capacitor
started off at VO,

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:34.000
in which case VC at time T=0 is
VO as expected.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.811
And we showed that the output
would look something like this.

00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:52.805
After a long period of time
this would come up to VI and

00:03:52.805 --> 00:04:00.000
this rise had a time constant of
tau=RC.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.616
So we wrote the equation for
this waveform.

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:07.663
And this is the case when VI is
greater than VO.

00:04:07.663 --> 00:04:12.830
I would like you to stare at
the circuit and this result here

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.361
to get more intuition on what is
going on.

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:20.063
At time T=0,
VC starts off at VO as expected

00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:24.972
because I am telling you that is
the case, that is initial

00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:27.555
condition.
It starts off at VO.

00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:33.208
Then this one steps to VI.
There is no infinite transition

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:36.343
anywhere here,
and so the capacitor holds its

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:38.196
voltage at VO,
at time T=0.

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:41.474
And then the VI here,
which is greater than VO,

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:45.464
begins to charge the capacitor
up, charge it through this

00:04:45.464 --> 00:04:48.243
resistor.
And so therefore the capacitor

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:51.022
charges up.
After a long period of time,

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:55.083
from the basic foundations of
capacitors, we know that the

00:04:55.083 --> 00:05:00.000
capacitor appears like a
long-term open circuit to DC.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.693
This is a DC voltage VI.
So it appears like an open

00:05:03.693 --> 00:05:06.501
circuit.
So after a long period of time

00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:10.416
VI appears at the end.
And from here to here I have an

00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:14.406
exponential rise that is
typified by an equation of the

00:05:14.406 --> 00:05:17.287
form -t/RC.
This kind of waveform rising

00:05:17.287 --> 00:05:21.498
from a smaller value to a higher
value is typified by this

00:05:21.498 --> 00:05:24.453
expression.
We saw the expression when we

00:05:24.453 --> 00:05:28.000
developed the equations last
time.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.744
On the other hand,
if the input was such that VI

00:05:32.744 --> 00:05:37.488
was smaller than VO,
so let's say VI was smaller

00:05:37.488 --> 00:05:43.949
than VO then what will happen is
that the capacitor voltage would

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.492
start off at VO,
because I am telling you that

00:05:48.492 --> 00:05:53.842
is the initial condition,
and would then decay in this

00:05:53.842 --> 00:06:00.000
manner to the final value of VI
which is the input.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.983
Instead of going up this way it
decays down to the final value

00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:11.280
applied to the circuit.
Again, the time constant is RC.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.068
But this is typified by a form,
this is exponential rise and

00:06:17.068 --> 00:06:20.991
this guy e^-t/RC is an
exponential decay.

00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:26.681
The key thing to remember is
that when you have RC circuits

00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:30.899
of this form,
the waveforms that you get are

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:36.000
either each of the e^-t/RC or
1-e^-t/RC.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.130
So you can now begin to see how
waveforms such as that come

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.226
about.
We will do an example and sit

00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:47.323
down and compute the inverter
delay.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:51.923
And notice that this waveform
here is very typical or

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:55.903
corresponds to this waveform
that we see here.

00:06:55.903 --> 00:07:02.679
Here I am starting at VO.
And assuming this axis starts

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:09.656
off at zero, this one starts
very close to zero and then

00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:16.761
rises up to some final value.
So far I have reviewed some

00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:22.470
material for you that I covered
the last time.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:28.559
As a second step,
I would like to give you a much

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:35.312
more intuitive approach --
-- that doesn't involve solving

00:07:35.312 --> 00:07:39.339
any differential equations.
And the reason I do this is

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:43.665
that most experienced circuit
designers do not sit down and

00:07:43.665 --> 00:07:47.544
write differential equations
each time they see an RC

00:07:47.544 --> 00:07:50.303
circuit.
When you are starting out and

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.958
you see an RC circuit,
you say node method and you

00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.657
write the differential equation,
but experienced people don't do

00:07:58.657 --> 00:08:01.647
that.
They look at it and they can

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.823
sketch the waveform out by
inspection.

00:08:03.823 --> 00:08:05.823
And I will show you how to do
that.

00:08:05.823 --> 00:08:09.411
It is indeed incredibly simple
once I give you some intuition.

00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:12.705
Throughout the rest of this
course, I will be showing you

00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:15.470
many such examples where
initially I develop the

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.941
foundations of stuff and then
show you an intuitive approach

00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:22.235
that very quickly lets you
either get the final answer or

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:25.352
at least sanity check the answer
that you have gotten.

00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:28.529
And this is how experienced
circuit designers deal with

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:32.031
stuff.
How many people here have seen

00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:35.823
this movie Bend it Like Beckham?
So you know this Beckham

00:08:35.823 --> 00:08:39.683
character doesn't think about
how he is going to curve the

00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:42.121
ball.
He just does it and it happens.

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:45.981
He doesn't sit down writing
differential equations to find

00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:49.435
out the projectile trajectory
and all of that stuff.

00:08:49.435 --> 00:08:53.092
You just kind of do it.
These series of intuitions I am

00:08:53.092 --> 00:08:57.223
going to give you is going to be
in line with the Bend it Like

00:08:57.223 --> 00:09:02.755
Beckham kind of intuition.
And this one in particular I

00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:08.954
would like to do in honor of one
of your recitation instructions

00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:14.465
Professor David Perreault.
And so this piece of intuition

00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:19.385
is going to be termed "Practice
it Like Perreault".

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:22.928
Watch what I do with the other
names.

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:28.045
Professor David Perreault is
really a world expert in

00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:33.063
designing really incredible
power supplies for very,

00:09:33.063 --> 00:09:39.643
very small chips and so on.
He doesn't start writing

00:09:39.643 --> 00:09:43.938
differential equations to do
this stuff.

00:09:43.938 --> 00:09:47.682
He looks at it and sketches it
out.

00:09:47.682 --> 00:09:51.647
Let me show you how he would do
this.

00:09:51.647 --> 00:09:57.154
Suppose I have my circuit like
before, VI, R and C,

00:09:57.154 --> 00:10:02.000
and I am telling you that
VC(0)=VO.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.666
And my input VI is a step that
looks like this.

00:10:09.666 --> 00:10:16.666
VI is a step.
How would Professor Perreault

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:22.166
do this?
Let's do it completely by

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:26.000
intuition.
No math here.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.345
All right.
We know that I have told you

00:10:31.345 --> 00:10:35.785
that this guy starts off at VO.
I am telling you that.

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:38.717
You know it is going to start
at VO.

00:10:38.717 --> 00:10:42.989
And there is no impulse or huge
infinite transition,

00:10:42.989 --> 00:10:46.089
and so the capacitor starts off
at VO.

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:50.612
We also know from basic
capacitor properties that after

00:10:50.612 --> 00:10:54.130
a long period of time,
in the steady state,

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.654
this is but a DC voltage.
If you apply a DC and here is

00:10:58.654 --> 00:11:02.627
my capacitor.
After a long period of time

00:11:02.627 --> 00:11:05.401
this guy is going to look like
an open circuit.

00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:08.898
It is going to charge up to
some value and then is going to

00:11:08.898 --> 00:11:11.731
look like an open circuit.
Because if it didn't,

00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:14.866
you would keep charging it and
its voltage would keep

00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:16.735
increasing.
That doesn't happen,

00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:19.991
it looks like an open circuit.
So it looks like an open

00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:23.187
circuit in the long run.
The voltage across it must be

00:11:23.187 --> 00:11:25.719
capital VI.
If I don't have current flowing

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:30.000
in the circuit then the only way
that can happen is --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.159
This open circuit.
Capital VI appears across the

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:37.522
capacitor.
Well, after a long period of

00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:41.681
time I know that the output must
look like this.

00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:45.309
In this case,
I have assumed VI is greater

00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:48.672
than VO.
So you have two points of your

00:11:48.672 --> 00:11:52.566
curve, VO and VI after a long
period of time.

00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:57.345
And, as I told you earlier,
with capacitors you get two

00:11:57.345 --> 00:12:01.111
kinds of curves.
Two things.

00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:04.747
What you do is go zoop.
There you go.

00:12:04.747 --> 00:12:08.686
You're done.
And this has an exponential

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:11.313
rise.
This is with the form

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:15.454
1-e^-t/RC.
So we can write an equation for

00:12:15.454 --> 00:12:20.101
that as follows.
VC we know has something to do

00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:23.838
with minus t/RC.
This is of that form,

00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:30.000
so there has to be that term in
there somewhere.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.693
And I start off with VO.
At time T=0 this is one and

00:12:34.693 --> 00:12:38.374
this is one, so this term
becomes a zero.

00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:42.791
At time T=0 that becomes a zero
so I get VO here.

00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:48.036
I am going to make sure this
stuff stays zero at time T=0,

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:52.546
so I start off with VO.
Now, as time wears on what

00:12:52.546 --> 00:12:55.398
happens here?
This voltage here,

00:12:55.398 --> 00:13:00.000
VI-VO, if you look at this
difference.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.055
That is exponentially decaying
over time.

00:13:04.055 --> 00:13:09.430
And so therefore all I have to
do here is write VI-VO.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:14.398
There is the answer.
I know the form of the curve.

00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:19.671
I am just fitting an expression
that meets this form.

00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:24.437
This starts off at VO.
When time T=0 this second

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:29.000
expression is zero and so it is
VO.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.973
And this difference here decays
down to zero.

00:13:32.973 --> 00:13:37.668
And this difference here,
VI-VO is multiplied by this

00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:40.558
term here and that is what I
get.

00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:45.073
And you can confirm this.
At time T=0 this is zero.

00:13:45.073 --> 00:13:50.672
At time T infinity this goes to
zero, this goes to zero leaving

00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:56.000
a one, and VO and minus VO
cancel and I get a VI.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.451
Virtually any such simple
voltage source,

00:13:59.451 --> 00:14:02.472
current source,
resistor, capacitor,

00:14:02.472 --> 00:14:07.563
circuit for most inputs like
steps and so on can be analyzed

00:14:07.563 --> 00:14:10.065
in this manner.
Initial value,

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:12.137
final value,
it's simple.

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:17.314
And just to show you that this
is simple, I am going to label

00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:21.888
this expression this way.
It is of the form 1-e^-t/RC.

00:14:21.888 --> 00:14:25.512
Just remember that.
Now, by the same token,

00:14:25.512 --> 00:14:30.000
what if VI had been smaller
than VO?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.300
Then that is simple,
too.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.463
I would have had my VI being
here.

00:14:35.463 --> 00:14:40.063
VI would have been here.
And that is of the form.

00:14:40.063 --> 00:14:44.185
In this particular situation,
here is my VI,

00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:47.156
my starting value and I do
this.

00:14:47.156 --> 00:14:51.948
And just to label that,
let me label that this way.

00:14:51.948 --> 00:14:57.507
I just told you that for RC
circuits you go this way or you

00:14:57.507 --> 00:15:02.138
go this way.
So it is down here.

00:15:02.138 --> 00:15:06.527
I get some kind of an
exponential decay.

00:15:06.527 --> 00:15:10.466
And, like before,
think of this one.

00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:14.517
This one has VI as a base value
here.

00:15:14.517 --> 00:15:20.032
And the difference between the
two is VO minus VI.

00:15:20.032 --> 00:15:25.771
And that difference decays.
So I have a VI out here,

00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:32.411
and this difference decays so I
get VO-VI and that decays in

00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:37.384
this form.
So I get an exponential decay

00:15:37.384 --> 00:15:41.661
of this difference here.
Just stare at it for a while

00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:44.621
longer.
You should be able to just go

00:15:44.621 --> 00:15:49.226
and knock it off like this,
just like Professor Perreault

00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:51.858
would.
No differential equations.

00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:55.312
Just write it down by looking
at the curve.

00:15:55.312 --> 00:16:00.000
Let's keep these two in mind,
OK, these forms?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.197
One is the 1-e^-t/RC form and
the e^-t/RC.

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:12.676
Both have a time constant RC.
Let me just make this a dashed

00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:18.000
line just to be on the safe side
here.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.862
That is our first piece of
intuition.

00:16:32.862 --> 00:16:37.633
And, as I pointed out before,
in problems you face in life or

00:16:37.633 --> 00:16:42.007
in ones that we give you,
feel free to use the intuitive

00:16:42.007 --> 00:16:45.028
method.
Or what you can do is apply the

00:16:45.028 --> 00:16:49.720
mathematical method and then
check your answer by using your

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.980
intuition.
What I would like to do next is

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.672
apply what you have learned so
far to figure out what we set

00:16:57.672 --> 00:17:01.012
out to figure out,
which is the delay of my

00:17:01.012 --> 00:17:05.142
inverter.
I had promised you that by the

00:17:05.142 --> 00:17:09.642
end of this lecture I was going
to close the loop on that little

00:17:09.642 --> 00:17:12.071
demo.
I was going to close the loop

00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:15.785
for you on this little circuit
that we had looked at,

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:18.428
one inverter driving another
inverter.

00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:22.357
This was A, this was inverter
X, and this was my node B.

00:17:22.357 --> 00:17:26.214
The green curve you see out
there, the middle one has a

00:17:26.214 --> 00:17:31.553
transition shown up there.
And what I am going to do next

00:17:31.553 --> 00:17:35.978
is use the results we have
gotten so far to compute a

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:39.212
number.
We are going to compute a delay

00:17:39.212 --> 00:17:42.191
number both for a rising
transition.

00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:46.276
We will call that delay DR for
rising transition.

00:17:46.276 --> 00:17:51.127
And we will compute a delay for
the falling transition DF.

00:17:51.127 --> 00:17:55.893
Remember, that this is the
input that falls down sharply.

00:17:55.893 --> 00:18:01.000
The intermediate node B rises
much more slowly.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.434
And because this rises much
more slowly this guy here falls

00:18:05.434 --> 00:18:10.021
a little after this transition
here, and so there is a delay.

00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:14.608
And I am going to apply what we
have learned so far and do an

00:18:14.608 --> 00:18:18.354
example for you and figure out
what that delay is.

00:18:18.354 --> 00:18:22.253
This is an absolute
foundational calculation done in

00:18:22.253 --> 00:18:26.000
building digital circuits all
the time.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.897
It is remarkable that something
so simple is used in designing

00:18:29.897 --> 00:18:33.284
even the most complex of
circuits to obtain very quick

00:18:33.284 --> 00:18:37.373
ideas of what my delay will look
like when I have some subcircuit

00:18:37.373 --> 00:18:39.801
driving some other piece of
subcircuit.

00:18:39.801 --> 00:18:42.996
Let me just draw a few
equivalent circuits for you.

00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:46.000
The internal circuit looks like
this.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.202
This is my inverter X,
A, my node B.

00:18:57.202 --> 00:19:05.000
And notice that I have this
capacitor CGS.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.395
Since I am interested in this
node, let me show you that,

00:19:09.395 --> 00:19:13.870
this capacitor explicitly,
it is because of this capacitor

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:18.894
here that arises because of this
MOSFET here between the gate and

00:19:18.894 --> 00:19:22.034
the source.
And that capacitor gives rise

00:19:22.034 --> 00:19:24.781
to this RC thing that we are
seeing.

00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:28.000
This is RL, this is RL,
VS, VS.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.310
And let's say,
just as up there,

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:40.513
at time T=0 I get a transition
like so, a falling transition

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:46.213
from say 5 volts to 0 volts at
the node A.

00:19:46.213 --> 00:19:51.636
This is VA here.
That is shown up there.

00:19:51.636 --> 00:19:54.000
And VB --

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.366
We had expected that VB would
look like this.

00:20:07.366 --> 00:20:12.328
We expected VB to be
instantaneous and looking like

00:20:12.328 --> 00:20:18.381
that, but instead because of the
capacitor VB looks like this.

00:20:18.381 --> 00:20:22.251
And remember,
again, this is of the form

00:20:22.251 --> 00:20:25.824
1-e^-t/RC.
And we will write down the

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:31.995
answers by inspection.
From this let me draw the

00:20:31.995 --> 00:20:39.425
connection to circuit delay by
showing you another little graph

00:20:39.425 --> 00:20:44.698
here t, VB, zero.
And what I am going to show

00:20:44.698 --> 00:20:50.450
you, this is 5 volts.
And so the output goes like

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:54.524
this from close to zero to 5
volts.

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:59.805
It is close to zero.
Because, at least with the

00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:03.000
inverters we have been seeing in
lab and so on,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.888
the RON for the inverter is
very, very small compared RL.

00:21:06.888 --> 00:21:09.180
So it is virtually zero down
here.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.652
And so what is the delay?
I mentioned there are two

00:21:12.652 --> 00:21:15.638
delays of interest.
One is the rising delay.

00:21:15.638 --> 00:21:19.805
That is the logical value at
the end, if I wait a long enough

00:21:19.805 --> 00:21:23.000
period of time,
is a logical one.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.623
Delay is simply defined as
starting from here how long does

00:21:28.623 --> 00:21:32.307
this output take to get to a
valid one?

00:21:32.307 --> 00:21:38.318
At what voltage here can I say
that this transition corresponds

00:21:38.318 --> 00:21:42.875
to a logical one?
At what voltage here can I say

00:21:42.875 --> 00:21:45.977
that that represents a valid
one?

00:21:45.977 --> 00:21:47.335
Any ideas?
Yes.

00:21:47.335 --> 00:21:50.728
It depends on the discipline,
bingo.

00:21:50.728 --> 00:21:53.734
So it depends on the
discipline.

00:21:53.734 --> 00:22:00.461
Now let's get more specific.
Since it depends on the

00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:06.991
discipline, at what value based
on something in the discipline

00:22:06.991 --> 00:22:10.952
can I say this thing is a
logical one?

00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:15.019
This is an output remember.
VOH, bingo.

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:20.907
There is some VOH somewhere.
And it takes some amount of

00:22:20.907 --> 00:22:27.329
time to get to a valid logical
one output, ergo there is your

00:22:27.329 --> 00:22:29.149
delay.
This is tR.

00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:36.000
And I call this the rising
delay of the inverter X.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.886
It is interesting that the
rising delay of inverter X,

00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:45.219
based on our model,
depends on the parameters of

00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:50.567
this inverter and the parameters
of whatever it is driving.

00:22:50.567 --> 00:22:55.453
So remember that the delay is
not necessarily just the

00:22:55.453 --> 00:23:02.000
property of the inverter itself,
but it depends on the context.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.553
If I stick my inverter before
another inverter like this,

00:23:05.553 --> 00:23:09.424
it is the capacitance on that
inverter by our model that tells

00:23:09.424 --> 00:23:13.295
me what the delay is going to
look like, of course in addition

00:23:13.295 --> 00:23:15.452
to RL.
And we will do the math in a

00:23:15.452 --> 00:23:17.356
few seconds.
By the same token,

00:23:17.356 --> 00:23:21.227
if I had this wire connecting
not to one inverter but going to

00:23:21.227 --> 00:23:24.400
ten other inverters,
I expect to have a capacitance

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.573
equal to ten times CGS.
And so therefore this thing

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:31.000
should rise even more slowly,
correct?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.007
The more capacitance on here
the slower it rises up.

00:23:35.007 --> 00:23:37.914
Simple.
If I put more and more load on

00:23:37.914 --> 00:23:42.235
this line by putting more and
more MOSFETs on that line,

00:23:42.235 --> 00:23:45.771
more and more inverters this
will rise slower.

00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:50.485
In our example I just have one,
so let's go ahead and compute

00:23:50.485 --> 00:23:53.707
the delay.
This is called the rising delay

00:23:53.707 --> 00:23:56.299
of X.
That says that for this node

00:23:56.299 --> 00:23:59.992
here to go from its output value
to a valid one,

00:23:59.992 --> 00:24:04.000
which is VOH how long does it
take?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.110
Notice that if this capacitor
was zero then you would have

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.979
seen an instantaneous
transition.

00:24:11.979 --> 00:24:17.268
If you have an instantaneous
transition then notice that the

00:24:17.268 --> 00:24:21.482
rising delay was zero.
That was the model we had

00:24:21.482 --> 00:24:25.427
looked at up until learning
about capacitors.

00:24:25.427 --> 00:24:30.000
So let's go ahead and compute
the number.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.659
I can draw an equivalent
circuit for computing a rising

00:24:34.659 --> 00:24:37.766
delay.
The equivalent circuit for the

00:24:37.766 --> 00:24:40.959
rising delay looks like the
following.

00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:44.928
The VS voltage source,
with a resistor RL and a

00:24:44.928 --> 00:24:48.553
capacitor CGS,
because when I turn this guy

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:53.472
off, this guy has gone off,
and so as far as the rise time

00:24:53.472 --> 00:24:57.959
of this node is concerned I can
look at this circuit,

00:24:57.959 --> 00:25:04.000
ground through CGS through RL
through VS back to ground.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.873
And just for simplicity,
let me draw this in a form that

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:09.000
we understand.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.878
CGS.
Let me use this as my ground

00:25:16.878 --> 00:25:20.757
node.
And this is the voltage VB.

00:25:20.757 --> 00:25:25.969
And this is RL.
And V is simply VS once that

00:25:25.969 --> 00:25:31.482
transition happens.
My other equations here,

00:25:31.482 --> 00:25:33.965
VI=VS.
And what is VB(0)?

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:38.827
VB(0) is at what value does
this node start out?

00:25:38.827 --> 00:25:44.103
Notice that for simplicity here
if this RON is much,

00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:49.172
much smaller than RL,
then this node would be very

00:25:49.172 --> 00:25:54.034
close to ground.
So I will just go ahead and say

00:25:54.034 --> 00:25:59.000
that VB at T=0 is approximately
zero.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.194
And then what I want to find
out is what does the value look

00:26:04.194 --> 00:26:09.037
like for time starting from zero
and then going forward?

00:26:09.037 --> 00:26:13.000
Well, we have become experts at
this now.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.798
Let's do the intuition here.
Start off with zero.

00:26:21.798 --> 00:26:24.884
That's good.
Because my initial value is

00:26:24.884 --> 00:26:29.000
zero, I start off here.
What is the final value?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.788
After a long time,
since this is a DC voltage,

00:26:34.788 --> 00:26:40.834
what would be the value at VB
after a long time?

00:26:40.834 --> 00:26:42.120
Pardon?
VS.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:48.551
If I wait long enough then it
is going to be at VS.

00:26:48.551 --> 00:26:53.439
This is greater than the
initial value,

00:26:53.439 --> 00:27:00.000
so we're done.
That is my 1-e^-t/RC form.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.923
It took me three seconds there.
It's pretty cool.

00:27:05.923 --> 00:27:10.365
We could add the expression for
this.

00:27:10.365 --> 00:27:16.165
And the expression was I take
my starting value,

00:27:16.165 --> 00:27:20.608
which is zero,
and I add to that this

00:27:20.608 --> 00:27:26.285
difference VS and I multiply
that by this form.

00:27:26.285 --> 00:27:31.627
There we go.
And remember I get this from

00:27:31.627 --> 00:27:35.756
that rising form up here.
V0=0, this is zero,

00:27:35.756 --> 00:27:39.510
so it is simply VI times that,
and VI=VS.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.733
I really would like you to get
this intuition.

00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:48.519
If I had two choices,
one is that you understand the

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:54.149
intuition and are able to sketch
that versus in your sleep be

00:27:54.149 --> 00:28:01.000
able to solve the differential
equation and get to the answer.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.500
I would much rather you get the
intuition, if it is one or the

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.057
other.
It is very simple.

00:28:10.057 --> 00:28:14.213
Start off at zero,
I go chuck, and boom,

00:28:14.213 --> 00:28:18.581
I get to VS and this is my
1-e^-t/RC form.

00:28:18.581 --> 00:28:23.803
I need to compute tR.
And tR is the time that this

00:28:23.803 --> 00:28:27.000
takes to get to VOH.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:53.424
For what value of time,
for what T, does VB reach VOH?

00:28:53.424 --> 00:29:01.123
I want to find tR.
What's tR?

00:29:01.123 --> 00:29:05.955
From that equation,
that simply tells me the

00:29:05.955 --> 00:29:10.224
trajectory of VB as a function
of time.

00:29:10.224 --> 00:29:16.404
And so I need to find out what
is T for which VB is VOH?

00:29:16.404 --> 00:29:22.808
I write VOH=VS (1-e^-t/RC).
So after a rise time my output

00:29:22.808 --> 00:29:28.426
is going to be VOH.
And so let me go ahead and find

00:29:28.426 --> 00:29:31.119
tR.
Let's see.

00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:37.388
I bring this to this left-hand
side and divide VOH by VS,

00:29:37.388 --> 00:29:43.768
and then I move things around
and what I end up getting is

00:29:43.768 --> 00:29:49.029
-tR/RC and on the other side I
get ln(1-VOH/VS).

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:52.388
Divide VOH by VS,
that is this,

00:29:52.388 --> 00:30:00.000
move this to the other side,
and move e^-t/RC to this side.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.076
And take logarithms on both
sides.

00:30:05.076 --> 00:30:11.384
This is what I get.
tR is therefore -RLCGS

00:30:11.384 --> 00:30:16.615
ln(1-VOH/VS).
That is my rise time.

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:21.846
You can just do this by
inspection.

00:30:21.846 --> 00:30:30.923
It is just so awfully simple.
Just to give to some intuition

00:30:30.923 --> 00:30:38.178
with numbers and so on.
Let's say that RL=1K,

00:30:38.178 --> 00:30:41.809
VS=5 volts, VOH=4 volts,
CGS=0.1 pF.

00:30:41.809 --> 00:30:47.514
This happens so often that we
often time call it "puff".

00:30:47.514 --> 00:30:51.248
0.1 puff.
It is pF, it's called puff.

00:30:51.248 --> 00:30:55.398
If it is nF,
I don't know why they didn't

00:30:55.398 --> 00:31:01.000
call it "nuff".
They just call it nanofarads.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.468
TR for these numbers gets to be
one times ten to the three times

00:31:08.468 --> 00:31:14.869
point one times ten to the minus
twelve for pico-farads

00:31:14.869 --> 00:31:19.610
ln(1-4/5).
And if you do the math you get

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:26.367
this down to 0.16 nanoseconds.
This means that if I had an

00:31:26.367 --> 00:31:33.124
inverter like that droving
another inverter then my output

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:40.000
transition would be delayed by
0.16 nanoseconds.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.412
Trust me, when Intel builds
microprocessors or when Broadcom

00:31:45.412 --> 00:31:50.917
builds its cable modem chips,
they have to do this one way or

00:31:50.917 --> 00:31:56.513
the other using a computer tool
or by hand for virtually every

00:31:56.513 --> 00:32:03.153
little subcircuit in their chip.
That is how you get the delays

00:32:03.153 --> 00:32:09.459
or some approximation thereof.
What I want you also to do is,

00:32:09.459 --> 00:32:15.345
for no particular reason,
I will just compute for you the

00:32:15.345 --> 00:32:20.600
following quantity RLCGS.
The time constant of that

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.696
circuit for no reason at all.
I am just going to compute it

00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:31.426
and stick it here.
And RLCGS 1 K times 1 pF is

00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:37.578
simply 0.1 nanoseconds.
I am just writing it and

00:32:37.578 --> 00:32:42.090
sticking it there for no
particular reason.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:46.388
The next step let's do the
falling delay,

00:32:46.388 --> 00:32:49.396
DF.
That is the rising delay.

00:32:49.396 --> 00:32:54.876
And, although I didn't show
this to you in the demo,

00:32:54.876 --> 00:33:01.000
there is a corresponding delay
of the fall time.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.461
It doesn't fall instantly,
but rather it falls rather

00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:08.207
slowly.
Let's draw the equivalent

00:33:08.207 --> 00:33:11.038
circuit for when the node X
falls.

00:33:11.038 --> 00:33:16.100
Notice that in my inverters
here, this node starts off being

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.730
at VS.
This is high.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.934
And this is going to fall
because when I turn this

00:33:21.934 --> 00:33:26.911
transistor on it is going to
pull this node to ground or it

00:33:26.911 --> 00:33:32.142
is going to fall down.
And what is the equivalent

00:33:32.142 --> 00:33:35.272
circuit?
The equivalent circuit is that

00:33:35.272 --> 00:33:38.321
ground through capacitor to this
node.

00:33:38.321 --> 00:33:42.769
At this node I have RON
connecting to ground and I have

00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:45.571
RL connecting to ground through
VS.

00:33:45.571 --> 00:33:48.784
Let me draw that little circuit
for you.

00:33:48.784 --> 00:33:52.821
Remember life begins and ends
on storage elements,

00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:56.857
so I will draw them first.
My storage element CGS.

00:33:56.857 --> 00:34:01.328
That is VB.
And, as I said,

00:34:01.328 --> 00:34:07.849
this is node X,
it goes from RON to ground,

00:34:07.849 --> 00:34:15.301
and it also goes through RL
through VS to ground.

00:34:15.301 --> 00:34:23.063
And in this particular
situation VB of zero for the

00:34:23.063 --> 00:34:29.894
following delay,
VB starts off at VS so VB of

00:34:29.894 --> 00:34:35.910
zero is VS.
And the final output I am not

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:39.823
sure yet.
What is the final value of the

00:34:39.823 --> 00:34:44.138
voltage at this node?
I don't know that yet.

00:34:44.138 --> 00:34:49.356
I need to compute that.
So what I will do is whenever

00:34:49.356 --> 00:34:54.674
you see something like this,
a capacitor connecting to

00:34:54.674 --> 00:34:58.186
linear stuff,
or a nonlinear element

00:34:58.186 --> 00:35:03.750
connecting to linear stuff.
For no apparent reason you

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.903
should at least think about
what?

00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:07.451
Think Thevenin,
exactly.

00:35:07.451 --> 00:35:11.692
And then see if you can use the
Thevenin method to simplify your

00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:13.846
life.
Capacitor, a bunch of stuff

00:35:13.846 --> 00:35:16.673
here, I need to find out the
initial value.

00:35:16.673 --> 00:35:18.490
Oh, I know that.
That is VS.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.846
Done.
I need to find the final value

00:35:20.846 --> 00:35:23.942
using my intuitive method.
For the final value,

00:35:23.942 --> 00:35:27.913
I could do it just by looking
at this, but I wanted to throw

00:35:27.913 --> 00:35:32.695
in Thevenin.
Hey, let me try to the Thevenin

00:35:32.695 --> 00:35:37.130
equivalent and see if that makes
my life any easier.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.000
VTH.
The Thevenin method says that

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.130
you can replace this circuit
here with a Thevenin equivalent

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:50.521
of the sort for the purpose of
determining what happens at this

00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:54.000
node given that that is linear.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.569
So I need to find out that for
the purpose of determining what

00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:14.276
happens at the node X.
I have to replace this with its

00:36:14.276 --> 00:36:19.661
Thevenin equivalent.
And I now need to find out RTH

00:36:19.661 --> 00:36:23.323
and VTH.
So I get RTH by looking in

00:36:23.323 --> 00:36:30.000
here, shorting this guy and
looking at the resistance.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.840
So I look in like this,
then I short this guy here and

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.826
I get RL in parallel with RON
because this one shorts to

00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:40.579
ground.
So RTH is simply RL in parallel

00:36:40.579 --> 00:36:43.333
with RON.
This is a convenient notation

00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:45.724
for RL being in parallel with
RON.

00:36:45.724 --> 00:36:48.188
And you all know the value of
that.

00:36:48.188 --> 00:36:52.318
It is another one of our very
simple patterns like voltage

00:36:52.318 --> 00:36:55.797
divider and so on.
Resistances in parallel can be

00:36:55.797 --> 00:37:00.000
computed as RL RON divided by RL
plus RON.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.709
What is VTH?
VTH is the open circuit voltage

00:37:05.709 --> 00:37:10.224
here.
If I take out this capacitor,

00:37:10.224 --> 00:37:15.933
I want to find out what the
voltage here is.

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:22.838
Ah-ha, voltage divider.
VS, the voltage divider here,

00:37:22.838 --> 00:37:28.149
RL and RON.
I could write this down as VS

00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:34.018
times RON/(RL+RON).
Remember you will see again and

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:37.860
again and again and again in
6.002 or any circuit stuff that

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.660
you do, you will see them all
over Thevenin.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.874
Voltage dividers,
current dividers,

00:37:42.874 --> 00:37:45.869
resistances in series,
resistances in parallel,

00:37:45.869 --> 00:37:49.646
RC thing-a-ma-jigs like this.
So if you just remember those

00:37:49.646 --> 00:37:53.488
10 to 15 intuitive patterns then
you are pretty much set for

00:37:53.488 --> 00:37:55.506
life.
It just comes on again and

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:57.786
again and again.
Parallel resistors.

00:37:57.786 --> 00:38:03.146
Voltage dividers.
You should be able to write

00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:07.342
down a voltage divider in your
sleep.

00:38:07.342 --> 00:38:12.469
So this is what I have.
Let me now write down

00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:19.578
intuitively what I expect the
node X to do just by inspection.

00:38:19.578 --> 00:38:24.007
Let's see.
What is the initial value of

00:38:24.007 --> 00:38:31.000
the voltage across the
capacitor, intuitive method?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.891
This is how Professor Perreault
would do it, remember?

00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:38.855
He would start off by saying
ah-ha, initial value is VS

00:38:38.855 --> 00:38:42.306
because I am told it is VS.
I start off with VS.

00:38:42.306 --> 00:38:46.344
And so I start off here.
What is the value after a long,

00:38:46.344 --> 00:38:48.987
long time based on this circuit
here?

00:38:48.987 --> 00:38:51.997
V Thevenin.
After a long time this is a DC

00:38:51.997 --> 00:38:54.640
voltage because that is a DC
voltage.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.000
The capacitor looks like an
open circuit after a long time.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And VTH appears there so it is
simply V Thevenin.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.230
And then when you see those
two, boy, I love doing this,

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.461
you go like this.
That is the coolest part.

00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:21.153
And then I am done.
It is so simple.

00:39:21.153 --> 00:39:25.153
Three seconds or less,
I am able to tell you what the

00:39:25.153 --> 00:39:28.461
delay of an inverter is purely
by intuition,

00:39:28.461 --> 00:39:33.244
completely intuitively.
I mean I haven't done any

00:39:33.244 --> 00:39:36.297
solving.
It is just by observation.

00:39:36.297 --> 00:39:39.529
Took this circuit,
made my life easy,

00:39:39.529 --> 00:39:44.108
Thevenin, looked at RTH,
VTH and then sketched it by

00:39:44.108 --> 00:39:47.789
inspection.
Again, if you find that things

00:39:47.789 --> 00:39:51.470
are really, really,
really simple don't be

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.882
surprised.
Once you get some conceptual

00:39:54.882 --> 00:40:00.000
understanding things are indeed
very simple.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.185
You can eliminate a lot of math
just by staring at things

00:40:05.185 --> 00:40:08.518
attempting to build up the
intuition.

00:40:08.518 --> 00:40:14.074
As a next step what I can do is
write down the expression for

00:40:14.074 --> 00:40:17.222
VB.
And I write down the expression

00:40:17.222 --> 00:40:21.018
from a falling transition.
How do I do it?

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:23.888
What was it?
What is the method?

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:27.592
I take the lowest value of
interest here.

00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:32.612
That is VTH.
And then I add to that this

00:40:32.612 --> 00:40:35.806
difference decaying
exponentially.

00:40:35.806 --> 00:40:39.290
And that difference is simply
VS-VTH.

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:45.096
And that decays exponentially.
This form is the e^-t/RC form.

00:40:45.096 --> 00:40:49.645
And, boom, I am done.
Many of you are wondering,

00:40:49.645 --> 00:40:53.516
Professor Agarwal,
if life was so simple,

00:40:53.516 --> 00:40:58.354
why on earth did you have us
mess around with those

00:40:58.354 --> 00:41:03.000
differential equations to get
here?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.598
You show us differential
equations and then you don't use

00:41:06.598 --> 00:41:09.362
them anymore.
Well, that is a good question.

00:41:09.362 --> 00:41:12.704
The answer to that is that you
need to understand the

00:41:12.704 --> 00:41:14.953
foundations.
Once you understand the

00:41:14.953 --> 00:41:18.552
foundations you can find
simplifying techniques to get to

00:41:18.552 --> 00:41:21.830
where you need to be,
but you need to understand the

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.401
foundations.
You need to at least see why

00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:28.000
things are the way they are at
least once.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.093
Understand the foundations and
then find intuitive ways of

00:41:34.093 --> 00:41:39.331
getting your answers.
So now my falling delay here

00:41:39.331 --> 00:41:45.851
is, I start off with VOS and I
need to get all the way down to

00:41:45.851 --> 00:41:50.234
what value to compute.
At some point here,

00:41:50.234 --> 00:41:55.151
this is a valid one,
at some point VB becomes a

00:41:55.151 --> 00:42:02.484
valid zero for the output.
And that is when I stop my tF

00:42:02.484 --> 00:42:06.931
block.
What is the value here for this

00:42:06.931 --> 00:42:11.978
to be a valid zero?
Don't all yell at once.

00:42:11.978 --> 00:42:16.184
VOL.
I simply had to figure out what

00:42:16.184 --> 00:42:20.510
is the value of time,
this is Page 7,

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:27.000
for which this expression
decays down to VOL.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:38.834
So it is VTH+(VS-VTH) e^-tF/RC.
Then I simplify this.

00:42:38.834 --> 00:42:44.524
How do I do that?
VOL-VTH.

00:42:44.524 --> 00:42:53.627
Then I divide that by VS-VTH.
So VOL-VTH.

00:42:53.627 --> 00:43:05.147
Divide that by VS-VTH.
Take logarithms on both sides

00:43:05.147 --> 00:43:14.911
and then multiply by RC.
So I get tF is -RC log of that.

00:43:14.911 --> 00:43:20.946
This is R Thevenin and this is
CGS.

00:43:20.946 --> 00:43:30.000
How did I get this?
VOL-VTH divided by VS-VTH.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.822
Take logs on both sides.
And then multiply throughout by

00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:41.804
-1/-RC and I get my tF.
Done.

00:43:41.804 --> 00:43:50.337
Let's do it for the same set
numbers, just that we add an RON

00:43:50.337 --> 00:43:55.884
of 10 ohms.
I will do this for RON of 10

00:43:55.884 --> 00:44:02.000
ohms and compute the value for
you.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.953
tF=-RTH.
RTH is RON parallel RL.

00:44:06.953 --> 00:44:11.268
This is 10 ohms.
That is 1K.

00:44:11.268 --> 00:44:20.056
So 10 ohms in parallel with 1K
is approximately 10 ohms.

00:44:20.056 --> 00:44:26.448
So let me just use
approximately 10 ohms.

00:44:26.448 --> 00:44:33.000
1 pF, that is RC times ln of
VOL.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.377
Oh, I need to give you a VOL.
Let's say my discipline has VOL

00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:43.417
being 1 volt.
And so therefore I end up

00:44:43.417 --> 00:44:47.137
getting a VOL-VTH divided by
VS-VTH.

00:44:47.137 --> 00:44:51.921
Since RON is much,
much, much smaller than RL,

00:44:51.921 --> 00:44:57.874
since RON is 10 ohms and this
is 1K, most of VS will drop

00:44:57.874 --> 00:45:02.450
across RL.
This is a hundred times

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.006
smaller.
Compared to VOL,

00:45:05.006 --> 00:45:07.989
which is 1 volt,
VTH is very,

00:45:07.989 --> 00:45:12.037
very small.
VTH will be on the order of

00:45:12.037 --> 00:45:18.642
0.05, and so therefore I simply
write down VOL here and say VTH

00:45:18.642 --> 00:45:22.797
is approximately zero,
and I get VS-VTH.

00:45:22.797 --> 00:45:28.123
This is approximately 5.
So let me just say this is

00:45:28.123 --> 00:45:34.495
approximately.
And if you do it you will get

00:45:34.495 --> 00:45:38.955
1.6 pico-seconds.
Again, just for fun,

00:45:38.955 --> 00:45:45.464
let me write the corresponding
RC time constant for the

00:45:45.464 --> 00:45:52.214
circuit, which is RTHCGS.
So RTH is approximately 10 ohms

00:45:52.214 --> 00:45:58.000
and CGS is 1 pF,
so this is 1 picosecond.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.067
Now you will understand why I
have been writing this time

00:46:08.067 --> 00:46:10.973
constant down.
It turns out that the time

00:46:10.973 --> 00:46:13.951
constant is a very,
very important number.

00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:17.510
So you see an RC circuit,
and you compute its time

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.651
constant for an RLC connection
like this, it is the series

00:46:21.651 --> 00:46:25.864
resistance times the capacitor.
The time constant is a very

00:46:25.864 --> 00:46:29.278
important number.
And usually the circuit delays

00:46:29.278 --> 00:46:34.000
are in the neighborhood of the
time constant value.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.135
In this case this is 1 pS.
That is 1.6 pS.

00:46:37.135 --> 00:46:40.347
And in this case we had 0.1 nS
and 0.16 nS.

00:46:40.347 --> 00:46:44.858
So the time constant itself is
a good indicator of what your

00:46:44.858 --> 00:46:48.529
delays are going to be like.
If you have no time,

00:46:48.529 --> 00:46:53.117
you are sloshing your cereal
down in the morning and you need

00:46:53.117 --> 00:46:57.323
to know how long the delay of
the inverter very quickly,

00:46:57.323 --> 00:47:02.266
you have three seconds.
Just do the RC and that is a

00:47:02.266 --> 00:47:06.800
good first approximation.
What I would like to do next in

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.738
the last three or four minutes
is set up a little demo for you

00:47:11.738 --> 00:47:15.704
for your recitation,
and then your recitation will

00:47:15.704 --> 00:47:17.000
cover it.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
This is a true story.
This really,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.818
really happened.
In this West Coast school,

00:47:29.818 --> 00:47:33.818
which shall remain nameless,
they had a chip,

00:47:33.818 --> 00:47:37.760
they built a chip.
And the chip had a bunch of

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.304
pins, as you might imagine.
And the pin,

00:47:40.304 --> 00:47:44.086
as you have a trace on a board,
a wire on a board there are

00:47:44.086 --> 00:47:47.673
some capacitance attached to
wires, between the wire and

00:47:47.673 --> 00:47:49.695
ground.
And that is a capacitor.

00:47:49.695 --> 00:47:52.434
And they just called it a load
capacitance.

00:47:52.434 --> 00:47:56.282
It could have been 0.1 pF or
0.01 pF or something like that.

00:47:56.282 --> 00:48:00.000
What they found when they built
this chip --

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.986
What they found was that the
voltage here they expected to

00:48:03.986 --> 00:48:06.503
look like this,
this computer science

00:48:06.503 --> 00:48:09.650
abstraction and so on,
zero to one transition,

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:13.636
boom, it should look like this.
But for the reasons we saw

00:48:13.636 --> 00:48:17.832
today the observed transition
was much slower and looked like

00:48:17.832 --> 00:48:20.069
this.
So the students said ah-ha,

00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:23.706
let's speed up this chip.
We can speed up the chip by

00:48:23.706 --> 00:48:27.132
looking at the RL and RON of my
driving inverters.

00:48:27.132 --> 00:48:32.307
And if I make RL small --
Notice if I make RL small my

00:48:32.307 --> 00:48:36.016
delay is small.
If I make RON small my falling

00:48:36.016 --> 00:48:39.725
delay is small.
So let's make really small RLs

00:48:39.725 --> 00:48:43.516
and RONs and let's all have fun.
Unfortunately,

00:48:43.516 --> 00:48:48.379
what they observed was that by
making RL and RON both small,

00:48:48.379 --> 00:48:53.406
the RC time constant small they
expected to see a much sharper

00:48:53.406 --> 00:48:56.373
rise time.
And this was the original.

00:48:56.373 --> 00:49:01.736
But what really happened was --
They expected this to get

00:49:01.736 --> 00:49:05.555
faster and kind of look like
this, but what happened was

00:49:05.555 --> 00:49:08.194
disaster struck.
What they observed was

00:49:08.194 --> 00:49:11.388
something like that.
This is a real-life story.

00:49:11.388 --> 00:49:15.000
And so instead of getting
something like this they go

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.194
something like this.
And why is that a problem?

00:49:18.194 --> 00:49:22.083
That is a problem because
notice when I expect to be at a

00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:26.041
zero, I got some spikes that
went higher than VIL into the

00:49:26.041 --> 00:49:30.000
forbidden region and did bad
things to me.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.574
So let me show you a little
demo and show you that that's

00:49:33.574 --> 00:49:36.000
exactly how the circuit is
behaving.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.633
Notice that this is what I
expect but this is what I see.

00:49:48.633 --> 00:49:54.467
Look at the purple curve here.
Notice these spikes that are

00:49:54.467 --> 00:49:57.485
showing up there.
This is true.

00:49:57.485 --> 00:50:01.949
They saw it happen.
And why is this happening?

00:50:01.949 --> 00:50:06.224
It turns out that what was
happening was that the two pins

00:50:06.224 --> 00:50:10.125
were next to each other.
And I will show you a little

00:50:10.125 --> 00:50:13.875
demonstration here.
Let's see if you can figure out

00:50:13.875 --> 00:50:17.849
why this was happening.
Think of these as two pins and

00:50:17.849 --> 00:50:22.275
the pins are close together.
I am just modeling the two pins

00:50:22.275 --> 00:50:27.000
with a role of wire.
And what I am going to do is --

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.652
I am going to separate the
wires and keep them far apart.

00:50:36.652 --> 00:50:39.000
It is like keeping my pins far
apart.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.521
Hey, guess what happened?
Those nasty spikes went away.

00:50:42.521 --> 00:50:46.043
But then I cannot keep my pins
1 meter apart on a chip.

00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:48.913
Your laptops are going to look
20 yards long.

00:50:48.913 --> 00:50:52.760
You want the pins to be very
close to each other so that you

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.413
can have many pins on chips and
therefore have very small

00:50:56.413 --> 00:50:57.847
systems.
But then look,

00:50:57.847 --> 00:51:02.428
I get the spikes.
Any idea why that is happening?

00:51:02.428 --> 00:51:06.736
Why is that when the pins are
close together I get those

00:51:06.736 --> 00:51:08.067
spikes?
Any ideas?

00:51:08.067 --> 00:51:10.417
Somewhat?
We just learned about

00:51:10.417 --> 00:51:14.412
capacitors, so this must have to
do with capacitors.

00:51:14.412 --> 00:51:18.328
There is this parasitic
capacitor between the pins,

00:51:18.328 --> 00:51:20.992
exactly.
Here is what is happening.

00:51:20.992 --> 00:51:25.065
Here is what I expect.
I expect a nice square wave at

00:51:25.065 --> 00:51:28.198
the output.
But instead I have a pin next

00:51:28.198 --> 00:51:31.650
to me.
And I have a faster wave form

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.814
driving it.
And so therefore there is a

00:51:33.814 --> 00:51:36.660
parasitic capacitor here.
And because of that I get

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.018
something called "crosstalk".
And the model for crosstalk is

00:51:40.018 --> 00:51:43.377
some resultant resistance with
the parasitic capacitor and I

00:51:43.377 --> 00:51:45.996
get those spikes.
And the 6.002 experts saw the

00:51:45.996 --> 00:51:48.102
solution.
They said how do we fix this

00:51:48.102 --> 00:51:50.208
problem?
6.002 experts said the way we

00:51:50.208 --> 00:51:52.884
fix this problem if it is slow
it may be better.

00:51:52.884 --> 00:51:56.015
Instead of having sharp
transitions let me drive it with

00:51:56.015 --> 00:52:00.000
slower transitions.
Let's switch to the demo again.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.094
You will see this in
recitation, but I will show you

00:52:03.094 --> 00:52:06.127
the demo very quickly.
I have a sharp transition of

00:52:06.127 --> 00:52:08.979
the input, which is that yellow
thing out there.

00:52:08.979 --> 00:52:11.405
I am going to make the
transition slower.

00:52:11.405 --> 00:52:14.924
Switch to a triangular wave.
And you will notice the spikes

00:52:14.924 --> 00:52:15.834
go away.
Oh, no.

00:52:15.834 --> 00:52:18.018
That is the wrong one.
The other one.

00:52:18.018 --> 00:52:20.688
There you go.
The moment I switch to a slower

00:52:20.688 --> 00:52:22.811
transition boom,
the spikes go away.

00:52:22.811 --> 00:52:24.813
You want to switch back to
square?

00:52:24.813 --> 00:52:27.119
There you go.
The 6.002 experts saw the

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:30.146
solution.
Slower transitions.

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:33.648
And you will do this example in
detail in Section tomorrow.

00:52:33.648 --> 00:52:34.648
Thank you.
