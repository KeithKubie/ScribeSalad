00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:03.278
- [Voiceover] As we've already
talked about multiple times,

00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:06.366
World War I broke out in 1914

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.898
and the beginning of it was all about

00:00:07.898 --> 00:00:10.708
Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:14.377
using the assassination of
Archduke Franz Ferdinand

00:00:14.377 --> 00:00:16.624
as the pretext for
declaring war on Serbia.

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:19.178
This was in July, July 28, 1914,

00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:20.897
they declare war on Serbia

00:00:20.897 --> 00:00:23.474
and if you were a military
analyst at the time,

00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:25.355
you would've assumed
that this would've been

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:27.050
kind of a quick action

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.652
and this is why frankly Austro-Hungary

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:30.533
was so eager to declare war on Serbia.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.181
They thought that it would
be very easy for them

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:34.202
to put the Serbians out of commission.

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:35.014
Austro-Hungary ,

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:37.220
you're talking about this empire here.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.288
Huge economy,

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.564
huge military industrial complex,

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:41.609
huge army.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:42.839
Serbians,

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.511
much smaller country,

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.928
much poorer country.

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:48.319
They had also fought several recent wars.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:49.666
They were very ill-equipped

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.083
so any military analyst would thought

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:52.708
that this would be a short war,

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.937
but 1914 did not prove that way

00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:56.330
for the Austro-Hungarians

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.163
and this actually could be
viewed as a huge victory,

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:00.045
a huge surprise,

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:01.276
for the Serbians,

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:03.250
that the Serbians were able to keep

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.525
the Austro-Hungarians back.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:09.008
Serbians hold.

00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:10.123
Now this isn't to say that it wasn't

00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:12.375
incredibly, incredibly, incredibly bloody.

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:15.905
You've had several offensives
across the border into Serbia.

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.482
The Austro-Hungarians
briefly captured Belgrade.

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:19.968
Then the Serbians capture it back.

00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:21.988
In the meantime tens and
hundreds of thousands

00:01:21.988 --> 00:01:24.008
of folks were dying,

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:25.820
but at the end of 1914,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.538
you would have surprised
the military analyst

00:01:27.538 --> 00:01:29.163
and the Serbians were able to hold

00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:30.882
despite being less equipped

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:34.713
and despite just being a smaller country.

00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:36.083
Now the luck for the Serbians

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:37.940
did not hold out that well

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.843
as we go into 1915.

00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:41.609
By 1915,

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.303
other parties other than
the Austro-Hungarians

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:48.250
decided to get involved
against the Serbians.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.248
In particular,

00:01:49.248 --> 00:01:51.849
you have the Bulgarians
that prior to 1915,

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.521
they were kinda trying to figure out

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:57.143
which side of the war
they want to fall in on,

00:01:57.143 --> 00:01:59.419
but they have had several battles

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.300
or several wars recently with Serbia,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.622
one as recently as 1913.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:06.655
They were eager to capture
back some territory

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:09.535
so in 1915 the Bulgarians joined the war

00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:11.299
on the side of the Central Powers

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.296
and as we exit 1915,

00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:16.176
you have a joint offensive
between the Bulgarians,

00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:19.148
the Austro-Hungarians and the Germans

00:02:19.148 --> 00:02:23.513
against the small country of Serbia

00:02:23.513 --> 00:02:24.465
and the Germans interest

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.276
other than the fact that
they wanted to support

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:30.549
their ally, Austria,

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.476
they were also eager to take control

00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:35.843
of the railways between
Berlin and Constantinople

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:40.843
and that railway went into Serbia

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:43.018
and so if they were able to capture this,

00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:44.365
take Serbia out of the war,

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:46.663
then they would be able to send supplies

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:51.284
much more easily to their other ally,

00:02:51.284 --> 00:02:52.840
the Ottoman Empire.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.036
So on October of 1915,

00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:57.752
October of 1915,

00:02:57.752 --> 00:03:00.516
you have a joint offensive
between the German army

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:02.838
and this is what this map
right here is depicting

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:03.720
right over here.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.858
This is the third Austrian army,

00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:07.226
this is the 11th German army.

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:09.107
This is the first Bulgarian army,

00:03:09.107 --> 00:03:11.034
this is the second Bulgarian army

00:03:11.034 --> 00:03:13.867
and their joint offensive
is hugely successful

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:15.075
for the Central Powers.

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:17.536
They're essentially able
to roll into Serbia.

00:03:17.536 --> 00:03:19.742
It's actually impressive
on the side of the Serbians

00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:21.344
that it took this much force

00:03:21.344 --> 00:03:23.039
to be able to roll through Serbia,

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.711
but they were able to roll through Serbia,

00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:26.963
essentially occupy all of Serbia.

00:03:26.963 --> 00:03:29.401
They put the Serbian army on the run

00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:32.907
and the only redeeming
thing for the Serbians

00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:34.835
is that some element of the Serbian army

00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:39.479
was actually able to escape
through Montenegro and Albania

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.894
and some of the civilians

00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:43.813
and then they were
transported by the allies,

00:03:43.813 --> 00:03:44.834
by the entente,

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:46.762
to be able to recuperate and then join

00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:49.493
as we'll see on the Macedonian front.

00:03:49.493 --> 00:03:54.493
So 1915 you have the Central
Powers roll through Serbia

00:04:04.224 --> 00:04:06.459
so to any observer right now,

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.478
Serbia is essentially lost.

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:11.033
Now right when that was happening,

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:13.634
the allies had recognized that Serbia

00:04:13.634 --> 00:04:15.979
was in a very difficult situation

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.837
and as we got to the end of 1915,

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:18.719
they did start...

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:23.719
The French and British troops
did start to land in Salonica

00:04:24.338 --> 00:04:27.876
right over here in order to,

00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:28.572
one would think,

00:04:28.572 --> 00:04:31.606
help the Serbian forces.

00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:34.439
Now they weren't able to arrive and act

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.645
in enough time to prevent what happened

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:40.082
in October of 1915.

00:04:40.082 --> 00:04:41.243
You have some French forces

00:04:41.243 --> 00:04:42.775
that were able to essentially distract

00:04:42.775 --> 00:04:44.238
the Bulgarian second army

00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:47.512
that aided to some degree
the Serbian retreat,

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:51.134
but essentially they started
to build their own forces

00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:53.642
right over here in Salonica.

00:04:53.642 --> 00:04:54.780
Now this is interesting

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.891
because we're talking about
this region right over here,

00:04:57.891 --> 00:05:00.074
kind of Macedonia and Greece

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:01.607
and at this point in the war,

00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:04.114
Greece had stayed neutral.

00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:05.879
The king was leaning towards...

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.342
King Constantine the first,

00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:10.314
he was leaning towards the Central Powers

00:05:10.314 --> 00:05:12.450
while the prime minister

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.051
and I'm sure I'm going
to say this incorrectly,

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:16.305
Venizelos,

00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:19.138
he was leaning toward the ally parties

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:21.413
so you started to have
this kind of disconnect

00:05:21.413 --> 00:05:22.226
between the two

00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:24.246
and the prime minister resigns,

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:26.104
but he has active support,

00:05:26.104 --> 00:05:30.701
especially in kind of Macedonia and Greece

00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:35.276
and obviously he has
support amongst the allies.

00:05:35.276 --> 00:05:39.354
So as you go into 1916,

00:05:39.354 --> 00:05:43.185
you have a coup for Venizelos
in Macedonia and Greece,

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:45.577
especially in around Salonica,

00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:47.620
which is essentially
being held by the allies,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.106
even though Greece is essentially...

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:51.428
Is officially neutral.

00:05:51.428 --> 00:05:56.428
So coup for Venizelos,

00:05:57.907 --> 00:05:59.880
which leads to a very
interesting situation.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.831
So after the coup for Venizelos,

00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:03.387
you essentially have Greece,

00:06:03.387 --> 00:06:04.617
kind of Macedonian and Greece

00:06:04.617 --> 00:06:07.845
is under the control of
the supporters of Venizelos

00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:10.213
and supporters of the allies

00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:15.213
while the rest of Greece
is still loyal to the king

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.898
and the king is leaning
towards the Central Powers,

00:06:18.898 --> 00:06:22.473
but it's not really clear
what he wants to do about it.

00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:24.610
Then you get into 1917,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.210
the allies start to get a
little bit forceful about it.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.857
In 1917 they have a blockade.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.481
They apply a blockade of southern Greece.

00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:34.887
Obviously blockades are always
inflict a lot of hardship,

00:06:34.887 --> 00:06:35.862
economic hardship,

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:37.093
human hardship,

00:06:37.093 --> 00:06:38.184
on civilians,

00:06:38.184 --> 00:06:43.184
but this essentially
forces in June of 1917

00:06:44.897 --> 00:06:48.411
Constantine the first...

00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:52.312
Constantine goes into exhile

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:53.729
and essentially at this point,

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.586
all of Greece is under...

00:06:55.586 --> 00:06:58.605
Is kind of supporting the allies

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:01.530
and Greece goes on the side of the allies

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.970
so in this map right over here

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.037
that shows kind of the Allied Powers,

00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:06.523
the entente powers

00:07:06.523 --> 00:07:07.684
and the Central Powers,

00:07:07.684 --> 00:07:09.518
Greece right over here is depicted

00:07:09.518 --> 00:07:10.772
as an Allied Power,

00:07:10.772 --> 00:07:14.603
but it was officially
neutral as we go through 1917

00:07:14.603 --> 00:07:16.809
only after the overthrow as...

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:19.480
Only after Constantine
the first goes into exile,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.100
do we have Greece
formally becoming an ally.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.512
And so that set gives
us the set up into 1918.

00:07:28.512 --> 00:07:30.741
So you had regrouped Serbian forces

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:31.438
and at this point ,

00:07:31.438 --> 00:07:33.086
it would be called the Macedonian front.

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:35.385
Serbia has been lost
to the Central Powers.

00:07:35.385 --> 00:07:38.868
You have regrouped Serbian
forces at Salonica.

00:07:38.868 --> 00:07:40.231
They've been transported to Salonica

00:07:40.231 --> 00:07:42.878
and in Greek Macedonian general.

00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:44.340
You now have the Greek army

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.966
who is now on the side of the allies.

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.241
You have the British and the French army

00:07:48.241 --> 00:07:52.282
and so as we get into September 1918,

00:07:52.282 --> 00:07:53.814
they are ready to go on the offensive

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:54.650
and you need to remember

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.740
what's happening in the rest
of Europe at this point.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.480
You might remember August 1918,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.570
this is the beginning of
the 100 days offensive

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.379
that marked the allied
victory on the western front

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:06.167
so news was already getting in there.

00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:08.838
You had great morale amongst the allies,

00:08:08.838 --> 00:08:13.830
you had not so great morale
amongst the Central Powers

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.129
and so in 1918, September,

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:21.129
you have the allied offensive

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.488
coming out of Greece,

00:08:24.488 --> 00:08:27.112
coming out of I guess you could
call it Macedonian Greece.

00:08:27.112 --> 00:08:28.087
Hugely successful.

00:08:28.087 --> 00:08:31.709
They were able to retake Serbia

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:32.986
and actually some of the British forces

00:08:32.986 --> 00:08:36.276
are able to go east and
retake Constantinople

00:08:36.276 --> 00:08:37.785
and so this part,

00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:39.294
this Macedonian front,

00:08:39.294 --> 00:08:42.104
is part of this overall we
saw on the western front,

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:46.609
kind of the end to the
Central Powers ambitions

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.954
in World War I

00:08:48.954 --> 00:08:51.253
and it ends with an
armistice on this front

00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:52.460
and as we know,

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.945
as we get into November of 1918,

00:08:54.945 --> 00:08:58.706
you have essentially
armistices or cease fires

00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.146
on all the major fronts

00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:02.137
and the allies have essentially won.
