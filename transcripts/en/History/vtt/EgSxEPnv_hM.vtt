00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.961
- Okay, Bill Goldberg here

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.587
for another installment
of "Tu's Tutorial,"

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:06.297
with Tu Lam.

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:09.801
This rope has taken down
a number of competitors.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.511
The floor is yours.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.973
- Well, first, you need
a fast, slashing blade.

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:18.685
If I hit the blade
at a 3 position,

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.270
look at the contour
of that blade.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.274
It's just going to slash,
but it's pushing the object

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:25.608
out of my blade path.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.610
If I'm able to generate power

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.155
coming in from the 1:00
down to the 7,

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.157
that's going to give me
my angle of attack.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.326
The reason why I want to go
to a steep angle

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.246
is because there's no weight
at the end of this rope.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:41.458
If I come in at a steep angle,
basically, it pulls the rope.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.253
It tightens the rope as I'm
cutting through it at an angle.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.881
It won't push the rope
out of my blade's path,

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.134
and I want to generate as much
power and speed as I can

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.928
at a very steep angle
going down.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:56.389
This is really hard,
because, Bill,

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.351
it requires a lot of accuracy.
It requires angles of attack.

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:04.022
And in the end,
it's about speed and violence.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:06.775
Blade management
has a lot to do with it.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.902
Let's just say if I
hit this at the tip.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.029
You see how I just
ran out of blade.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.947
I want to hit this thing here,

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:15.241
and then, pull down
in a slashing motion.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.244
- You want to maximize as much
of that blade as possible.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.955
- It's not an impact,
it's a slash.

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:22.707
Distance will generate

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:25.585
where I'm going to impact it
on my blade.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.754
If I'm too far away,
I'm going to hit it at the tip.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.798
I want to measure the distance

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:30.882
comparing to the geometry
of my blade.

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.217
If I have a longsword,

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.927
I'm going to be back
a little bit more.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.221
I have a short katana,
I'm going to be closer.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.307
- And about where on the rope?
Is it adjusted to your height,

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:42.477
or is it adjusted to where
the rope is actually centered?

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.437
- You want to adjust it
to your height,

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.189
because I don't want
to swing it high.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.066
- Understood.
- I want to swing it

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:51.820
where I personally am going
to generate the most power.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.905
For me, it's around right here.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.406
- Show us how it's done.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.493
Hi-ya!

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.165
Our tutorial is over.
