so there are certain systems that are in
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.580
so there are certain systems that are in
the United States right now that seem to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
the United States right now that seem to
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.890
the United States right now that seem to
be able to provide better value based

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
be able to provide better value based
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.929
be able to provide better value based
care these systems that are commonly

geisinger and what they do is that they

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400
geisinger and what they do is that they
 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.120
geisinger and what they do is that they
have the ability to provide care across

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130
have the ability to provide care across
 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.780
have the ability to provide care across
the continuum so if you see someone

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
the continuum so if you see someone
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880
the continuum so if you see someone
within the system you're likely to be

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
within the system you're likely to be
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.140
within the system you're likely to be
referred to somebody else within the

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150
referred to somebody else within the
 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.790
referred to somebody else within the
system and that information that you

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
system and that information that you
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.890
system and that information that you
that you is obtained from the first

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900
that you is obtained from the first
 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.380
that you is obtained from the first
person you saw is seen by that second

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
person you saw is seen by that second
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.600
person you saw is seen by that second
person so you reduce the costs of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
person so you reduce the costs of
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.540
person so you reduce the costs of
repetition additionally those systems

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
repetition additionally those systems
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.399
repetition additionally those systems
tend to control their administrative

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409
tend to control their administrative
 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.030
tend to control their administrative
costs a lot tighter and they also tend

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040
costs a lot tighter and they also tend
 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.399
costs a lot tighter and they also tend
to follow certain things like formulary

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409
to follow certain things like formulary
 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.979
to follow certain things like formulary
restrictions and they have decision

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
restrictions and they have decision
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.119
restrictions and they have decision
support for their physicians in the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129
support for their physicians in the
 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.289
support for their physicians in the
electronic medical records that they use

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
electronic medical records that they use
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.850
electronic medical records that they use
and they all have basically a hundred

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
and they all have basically a hundred
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.680
and they all have basically a hundred
percent electronic medical record

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690
percent electronic medical record
 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.469
percent electronic medical record
utilization

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.789
electronic medical records are important

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799
electronic medical records are important
 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.740
electronic medical records are important
because they allow for information

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750
because they allow for information
 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.450
because they allow for information
sharing the problem with electronic

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460
sharing the problem with electronic
 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.130
sharing the problem with electronic
medical records is that if there are a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140
medical records is that if there are a
 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.770
medical records is that if there are a
hundred different vendors and therefore

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780
hundred different vendors and therefore
 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.940
hundred different vendors and therefore
a hundred different records that

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950
a hundred different records that
 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.240
a hundred different records that
information cannot be shared across

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
information cannot be shared across
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.999
information cannot be shared across
so-called systems so if you as provider

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009
so-called systems so if you as provider
 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.219
so-called systems so if you as provider
ex has a certain system in me as

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229
ex has a certain system in me as
 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.859
ex has a certain system in me as
provider why has a different system

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
provider why has a different system
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.060
provider why has a different system
those in for those systems don't share

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070
those in for those systems don't share
 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.859
those in for those systems don't share
information in the current state and

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869
information in the current state and
 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.279
information in the current state and
Aras as a result the goal of the record

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289
Aras as a result the goal of the record
 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.919
Aras as a result the goal of the record
in terms of making information portable

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929
in terms of making information portable
 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.440
in terms of making information portable
and transferable is lost their very

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450
and transferable is lost their very
 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.630
and transferable is lost their very
effective within the system so the tests

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640
effective within the system so the tests
 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.010
effective within the system so the tests
aren't repeated you can see tests that

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020
aren't repeated you can see tests that
 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.630
aren't repeated you can see tests that
were done previous day or the previous

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640
were done previous day or the previous
 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.309
were done previous day or the previous
month they're very good for trending

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319
month they're very good for trending
 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.210
month they're very good for trending
tests and trending information but the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220
tests and trending information but the
 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.630
tests and trending information but the
real promise of the electronic

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640
real promise of the electronic
 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.229
real promise of the electronic
electronic medical record is not

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239
electronic medical record is not
 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.699
electronic medical record is not
obtained until you have a way to link

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709
obtained until you have a way to link
 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.170
obtained until you have a way to link
different records with different

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180
different records with different
 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.940
different records with different
information systems so if you would

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
information systems so if you would
 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.470
information systems so if you would
think of the electronic medical record

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480
think of the electronic medical record
 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.229
think of the electronic medical record
as the car so you right now the

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239
as the car so you right now the
 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.690
as the car so you right now the
administration is buying cars but we

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700
administration is buying cars but we
 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.569
administration is buying cars but we
need to build roads so that the cars can

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579
need to build roads so that the cars can
 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.860
need to build roads so that the cars can
travel and all that information that is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
travel and all that information that is
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.690
travel and all that information that is
obtained at a practice in Denver can be

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
obtained at a practice in Denver can be
 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.210
obtained at a practice in Denver can be
seen at a practice in Boston if a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
seen at a practice in Boston if a
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.930
seen at a practice in Boston if a
consultation is required in Boston there

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
consultation is required in Boston there
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.000
consultation is required in Boston there
the promise of the record starts to come

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010
the promise of the record starts to come
 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.520
the promise of the record starts to come
to fruition additionally the record can

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530
to fruition additionally the record can
 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.580
to fruition additionally the record can
also provide a way for the patient to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590
also provide a way for the patient to
 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.640
also provide a way for the patient to
have some input of end and access to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650
have some input of end and access to
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.970
have some input of end and access to
information about their care if the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980
information about their care if the
 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.340
information about their care if the
record not only becomes the EMR the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350
record not only becomes the EMR the
 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.580
record not only becomes the EMR the
elect the electronic medical record but

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
elect the electronic medical record but
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.960
elect the electronic medical record but
becomes a window to the personal health

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970
becomes a window to the personal health
 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.900
becomes a window to the personal health
record I believe that they should be one

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910
record I believe that they should be one
 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.180
record I believe that they should be one
in the same that the physician should be

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190
in the same that the physician should be
 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.400
in the same that the physician should be
able to see a part of a patient's record

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
able to see a part of a patient's record
 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.199
able to see a part of a patient's record
and that the patient should have access

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209
and that the patient should have access
 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.259
and that the patient should have access
to the same information in a view that

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269
to the same information in a view that
 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.490
to the same information in a view that
he or she can understand that would

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500
he or she can understand that would
 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.970
he or she can understand that would
allow the promise of the record to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980
allow the promise of the record to
 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.250
allow the promise of the record to
really be realized because once you

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260
really be realized because once you
 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.320
really be realized because once you
start giving patients

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330
start giving patients
 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.790
start giving patients
access to their information you start

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800
access to their information you start
 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.010
access to their information you start
empowering patients you start empowering

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020
empowering patients you start empowering
 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.500
empowering patients you start empowering
self management and you start really

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
self management and you start really
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.430
self management and you start really
developing a shared strategy of care

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440
developing a shared strategy of care
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.440
developing a shared strategy of care
between the patient and the care

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
between the patient and the care
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.940
between the patient and the care
provider

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950
 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.699
I think that the government should also

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709
I think that the government should also
 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.059
I think that the government should also
think about investing in things that

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069
think about investing in things that
 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.250
think about investing in things that
enable patients to take better care of

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260
enable patients to take better care of
 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.309
enable patients to take better care of
themselves so again the medical record

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319
themselves so again the medical record
 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.780
themselves so again the medical record
is not enough we need something that

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790
is not enough we need something that
 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.150
is not enough we need something that
patients can see and we need them to

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160
patients can see and we need them to
 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.520
patients can see and we need them to
have access to their information whether

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530
have access to their information whether
 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.080
have access to their information whether
it's through readily available

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090
it's through readily available
 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.240
it's through readily available
technology like a cell phone or a laptop

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250
technology like a cell phone or a laptop
 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.970
technology like a cell phone or a laptop
or a passkey that they can go to a

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980
or a passkey that they can go to a
 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.530
or a passkey that they can go to a
public library and get their information

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540
public library and get their information
 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.839
public library and get their information
yes there's a question of safety but

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849
yes there's a question of safety but
 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.400
yes there's a question of safety but
that has to be managed appropriately I

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410
that has to be managed appropriately I
 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.509
that has to be managed appropriately I
think those are the types of things that

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519
think those are the types of things that
 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.120
think those are the types of things that
that the government should be spending
