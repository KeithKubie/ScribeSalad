00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.550
[laughter]

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.189
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hello.

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.149
All right, Ian.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.469
Fantastic.

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.049
And welcome to another episode of The Friday
Games Review.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.049
I, as always, am Dan Galpin.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.130
And with me, we have Daniel Pham.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.130
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Hey, guys.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.130
How are you doing?

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.269
&gt;&gt;Dan: And today, we're going to be looking
at Asian RPGs.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.770
They're both Japanese and Korean RPGs, which
have become very, very popular in Google Play.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.960
And here on the producer cam, we have Ian
Ni-Lewis, who is going to be not only chiming

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.350
in with important and incisive comment, but
also pouring the beers for us today.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.350
So, yeah.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.650
Let me go ahead and take care of my most important
duty right now.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.650
[clink]

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.901
Today, we are pouring something that I think
our resident foreigner should probably name

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:53.910
for us.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.109
This is a--.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: We're talking about Reto here.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Who we actually haven't seen yet.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.100
Let's make that clear for the audience.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.829
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ale des Deux.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: Very good.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.190
OK.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.180
Actually brewed right here in the Valley.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.340
San Jose, California, actually.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.680
Home of me and also hobos who get hacked apart
with samurai swords.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.170
That was our news story of the week.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.210
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's to have to keep this show topical.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.640
Anyway, [ indistinct ] pour this.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.360
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: And the sharpest one.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.478
&gt;&gt;Dan: It could be really dangerous if I was
wearing this hat near the San Jose Sharks.

00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:40.478
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:41.478
And we'll--.

00:01:41.478 --> 00:01:42.478
&gt;&gt;Dan: By the way, a big shout-out to Scout,
who's an APM here who loaned me this hat for

00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:43.478
the show.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:47.410
We are trying to figure out what would be
the proper show to wear a giant red squid

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.510
hat for.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.780
And somehow, hey, wow.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.780
That's nice.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.610
And somehow, this one won the straw.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.610
So today, we're--.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.980
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's a great hat.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.430
It is a good, it is a good hat.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.430
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I love it.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, yes, please.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.899
Here, we get the compostable glasses for me
rather than the fabulous Oktoberfest glass.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.829
That is a fantastic Google Oktoberfest glass.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.000
People should see this, yeah.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.129
There we are.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.719
So, it's great to have Daniel aboard here.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:20.719
And--.

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:21.810
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Great to be here.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.850
&gt;&gt;Dan: Thank you.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.850
Thank you.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.719
And we've had a lot of fun playing the games
this week.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.569
One thing about these Asian RPGs in general
is it takes a long time to actually get into

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.569
the game.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.569
And--.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.450
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, I mean, in just the 40 hours
I've had or--

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.450
[Dan laughs]

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.430
so to playing, I really couldn't get a really
in-depth look at any one title.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.970
It requires hundreds and hundreds of hours
just to get it right.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.340
&gt;&gt;Dan: The best part, Final Fantasy Three
actually, which is one of the ones we're looking

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.030
today, shipped on Google Play.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.849
And there were a bunch of reviews that said
the game was only a couple of hours long.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.549
And that is because a couple of people only
played through the intro.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.470
And after the intro, it actually plays the
credits and then it goes on to play the other

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.280
30 hours of game play or so.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.280
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yes.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.019
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, these are really deep, intensive
games.

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.620
Another thing that's interesting about all
of these games, and we're only gonna be looking

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.360
at four today, all four of these games are
originally ports from other platforms.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.390
So, a lot of the experience on Android is
colored by how deep the port operation actually

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.659
got.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.599
And so, Final Fantasy Three, I believe, came
over from the DS.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.000
The rest of them from the PlayStation portable.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.139
And it's possible is the only four, I don't
know if it actually appeared on anything else.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.840
So, that one, it's just the style, certainly,
of that game.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.049
And we also have really three distinct styles
of game play here.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:54.090
We have Final Fantasy Three, which is a turn-based
fighting game, but without significant deep

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.489
tactics.

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.999
We have Spectral Souls, which is a deeply
tactical turn-based fighting game.

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:05.599
And then we have arcade-style role playing
games, which are Inotia Three and Zenonia

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.599
Four.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.700
So we really do have quite a variety of game
play all under the general umbrella of Asian

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.700
RPGs.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.950
And there's a lot of things that are very
specific to this style of game play.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.720
Deep story is what drives the game.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.160
There's certainly RPG elements and they vary
depending on the game.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.010
We also have different monetization strategies
across these four games.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.610
So, we can talk a little bit about what the
impact of the specific porting that was done

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.980
as well as a little bit of the game playing
styles itself.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.320
So, let's start off with the game we played
the most, which is Final Fantasy Three.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.830
I think both Daniel and I are old Square fans.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.880
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, definitely.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: Why don't, I'll bring this up.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.260
And I'd like Daniel to chime in on this one.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.670
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Sure.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, what's interesting about this game
is they actually are supporting two different

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.000
modes of save game within the game.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.750
You can actually quick save, which uses a
save state.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.820
And you can do that anywhere within the game.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.960
But it also supports what was traditionally
the game with save slots.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.160
So, you've got continue, new game, and load
game.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.520
Continue just goes into the last quick save.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.150
One thing to note in this game, if you don't
actually save slots, you actually, when you

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.660
die, you die.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.840
So, it is actually important to use the old
school save game system.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Definitely.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.180
I made that mistake the first time playing
through this game.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.440
And it was a little bit annoying, but--.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a little bit of a shock to a modern
game.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.410
We're not used to a game where we actually
are killed off after ten hours of game play

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.050
and suddenly have to start over.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: And--.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.630
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Instantly reminded me of Battletoads.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.500
That's a game for another day.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.600
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.080
So, another thing you'll notice is that we're
looking here at the typical screen.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.600
And we're slightly covering the only controls
that are there.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.510
You'll see there aren't actually a significant
number of controls on the screen.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.970
The controls are actually activated when we
touch the screen.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.990
And very much this style of game play.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.150
This, again, is a remake of the original Final
Fantasy Three, which showed up on the eight-bit

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.460
Nintendo Entertainment System, or Famicom.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.590
And, in fact, I don't think it ever shipped
in the United States other than through some

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.820
very creative people who produced English
translations of this.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.940
And it wasn't really until we got into the
later Final Fantasy games that we actually

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.423
started numbering them appropriately in the
US.

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:38.840
I could be wrong, but that's my recollection
here.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.570
So, the game itself is pretty straight-forward.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.510
We're inside of a town right now.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.460
We can exit the town.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.540
And in Final Fantasy true epicness, we actually
have a flying machine that we can use to fly

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.860
around the world map.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.410
This, by the way, is the intro part of the
game, just to let you know.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.800
This is the first section of the game where
we actually have to free this town where everyone

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.690
has been turned into ghosts from the clutches
of this djinn.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.530
And we have to get some Mithril rings and
all sorts of fun stuff like that.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:22.720
And really, they've done a marvelous job with
this remake from the DS.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.790
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm sorry.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.930
Did you say "clutches of gin?"

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: Of a, [laughs].

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.770
Yes, of a D-J-I-N-N.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.770
OK.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.770
Suddenly I lost interest.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.770
Carry on.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.770
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:36.770
So, we lost our viewers right there.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.410
They thought we were talking about alcohol
for a moment there.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.060
So, there's beautiful little in-game cut scenes.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.060
And it's interesting.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.380
They've actually chosen, you may not be able
to tell this from looking at the graphics

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.760
that run through the game, but they've actually
chosen to keep the game unfiltered for the

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760
most part.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.100
So, you'll see that the graphics look, instead
of looking blurry, they look intentionally

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.100
blocky.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.120
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120
That was really nice.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120
A nice touch by them.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.930
And back in the cut scenes, I was really impressed
by that.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.070
I didn't expect something like that to come
out of an Android game.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.990
But maybe I just had poor experiences playing
Android games in general.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exact.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.240
We need to get you playing more Android games,
it's clear.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.240
Yeah.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.240
It's really beautifully done.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.540
They've also done a very good job of integrating
most of the Android features.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.980
Probably the only really confusing thing is,
again, the old school elements of the game,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.660
which we definitely have to get used to if
you haven't played this sort of game in a

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.660
while.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.660
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.830
For some of our younger viewers, they may
not be familiar with this style of, that this

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.279
game is shown in.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:40.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.430
And, so talk about the things that were done,
they're done well.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.540
One of the things I really enjoyed is that
even though the game has old school, unfiltered

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.930
graphics, if you look at the font, you can
see the font is rendered at full resolution,

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.850
independently of the game.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:59.410
And that makes the game feel so much better
because your eyes aren't trying to focus on

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.240
a font that's blurry or filtered.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.579
And it's also not trying to, you're not looking
at something that's really, really low resolution.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:10.639
And it really fits in quite well with the
game--even with the old school graphics.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:15.010
You can see that both on the font there in
the text as well as on the map and menu icons,

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:20.290
which we're covering up with our current view
here in the corner.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.389
So, there are some things that are interesting
about this.

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:26.990
One is that we hit the back key.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.709
We get close application, OK?

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:34.150
First of all, it's a little jarring because
we actually end up getting a dialogue that

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.629
is a system dialogue rather than our own.

00:09:36.629 --> 00:09:44.329
It's also a dialogue that's not a Holo-style
dialogue So, we're kind of thrown out there.

00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:48.430
You can see we actually have, at the bottom
of the screen, a vestigial menu key that doesn't

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.430
do anything.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.430
I touch it.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.430
It doesn't do anything.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:59.649
And we also have the zoom button over here,
which allows us to stretch or zoom in to make

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:02.370
it as if we were playing this on an old school
device.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.870
So, all of this could easily be corrected,
of course, by simply targeting a more recent

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.610
version in terms of the menu and the zoom.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:14.089
And as far as the back key is concerned, in
this case, it really just makes sense to go

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:16.230
back to the main menu since you can continue.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.449
This would be a perfect opportunity to quick
save, go back to the main menu.

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:23.069
It would be much, much less jarring for the
user.

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:26.850
Now, if you quick save within the game, you'll
note it's a little confusing, too.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.889
You click the quick save button, say "Yes,
perform quick save."

00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:34.250
And it does immediately then kick you off
of the game and take you back to the title

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.250
screen.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yes, yeah.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.649
&gt;&gt;Dan: And quick save is really what it does
when you exit the game in the middle of playing

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:41.649
it.

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:43.350
So, by doing that, you go back.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.720
This is probably, this is what the default
behavior should be, probably should pop up

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.920
something, let you know that you're quick
saving and then take you back to the title

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.920
screen when you hit the back key.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.490
It should give a bit more warning.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:11:02.569
Yeah, I mean, again, quick saving, because
it's such a simple thing to quick save, in

00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:04.920
this case for the end user and it's very easy.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.920
It's really straight-forward.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.990
You just hit continue.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.670
It can be done with really, really minimal
prompting.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.279
So, there's a lot of, there's a lot of work
that goes in to prompt the user to try to

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:15.290
help the user out.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.339
The reality is what mostly what they wanna
do is just immediately quick save when they

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:21.930
hit that back key, similar to what happens
when you hit the home key.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.930
And then the game is closed.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.970
It actually will quick save for you if you're
in the middle of game play.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:32.740
So, that's something I would definitely look
at in terms of being able to just interact

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.149
that much more smoothly with Android.

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:38.749
Another thing is I'll go here back to--.

00:11:38.749 --> 00:11:41.350
So, now I have right now exited.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:48.940
I'm going back to the main screen here, which
is, once again, as a general rule, you wanna

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.019
be able to continue past all of these things
here at the beginning.

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:55.259
It's just, you hit the back key here, close
application.

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:57.439
It's not really necessary if you're on the
title screen.

00:11:57.439 --> 00:12:02.269
So, this is just something I would definitely
like to see them clean up.

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:06.290
And again, I think everything else when we
get here is, in this game, is really just

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.830
is vestigial from its original origins.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.540
You have a limited number of save slots.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:16.000
You have, and the game really is about knowing
when to save, making sure you have saved at

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.300
appropriate times.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.440
And it's very traditional.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.360
Your object is not to complete the story,
but it's also to avoid death.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.360
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yes.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.759
&gt;&gt;Dan: Death is very painful in this game
and can cause you hours and hours and hours

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:30.380
of having to redo things.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:35.699
And interestingly, you can't quick save at
any time, but quick saves don't really help

00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:41.120
you out other than to save your progress because
you can only have one slot and the game deletes

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.470
the quick save slot when you die.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.470
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yes.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.119
&gt;&gt;Dan: So again, it's very, very much about
juggling those internal slots.

00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:53.550
I think it's a little bit confusing to a user
of the game that you have to juggle these

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.319
kind of two independent mechanisms.

00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:56.749
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I was angry.

00:12:56.749 --> 00:13:01.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: But it is really good that they have
that and it definitely makes it a mobile and

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.509
complete title.

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:08.380
The other game that I think is really interesting
that's close to the same, closest to the same

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.249
genre is Spectral Souls.

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:14.720
And Spectral Souls is an epic and huge, huge
game.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.569
Thank you for changing the, yes.

00:13:16.569 --> 00:13:17.569
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:23.610
I also have to mention that the developers
of Spectral Souls are probably my favorite

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.829
developers ever.

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:31.069
So, hey Carlo and that other dude that I can't
remember who's buddies with Carlo.

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:32.610
[Dan laughs]

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:40.600
You had, you gave us the most epic night of
drinking at the Marriott Skybar ever.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.470
&gt;&gt;Dan: Who is us, by the way?

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:43.579
I was not there.

00:13:43.579 --> 00:13:44.579
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:45.819
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Neither was I. I wasn't there either.

00:13:45.819 --> 00:13:48.649
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, so it's true that Dan Pham was
not there.

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:50.579
Dan Galpin left early--

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:51.579
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:13:51.579 --> 00:13:52.579
&gt;&gt;Ian: before we found the stuff--.

00:13:52.579 --> 00:13:53.579
&gt;&gt;Dan: Before the epic stuff happened.

00:13:53.579 --> 00:13:54.579
Yeah, exactly.

00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:59.929
&gt;&gt;Ian: Android in the corner that was six
feet tall and the CEO of SpryFox put it on

00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:01.889
and went dancing around the bar.

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:03.600
That was a good night.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.579
&gt;&gt;Daniel: And that was a little bit of an
edited version from what I heard earlier.

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:08.579
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:12.910
That was good, that was good editing for our
family viewers.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.420
So, Spectral Souls.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.619
Let's get back to the game.

00:14:17.619 --> 00:14:21.920
But we've had, the good thing is that we've
had a long relationship with these developers.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.009
They've done a really, really good job of
taking a really epic game from the PlayStation

00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:29.420
portable and bringing it here.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.240
But you do see a lot of vestiges of what they
had to do.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.730
One of them is if you look at the on-screen
controls here, you can see that you have a

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.259
constant on-screen hub of arrow keys.

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:45.129
And the arrow keys are actually fairly far
apart here on this tablet, if you look here

00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:49.499
on what is I believe your, are you the left-hand
side of the screen?

00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:52.519
I guess we're seeing a mirror here.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:55.610
So, and so, you'll see they're actually fairly
far apart.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.420
And you'd actually want those to be closer
together on a tablet of this screen size.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.999
But on a phone, they're in about the right,
they're about the right size and orientation.

00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:08.560
The rest of the buttons are actually pretty
good on the tablet, although you do have to

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.970
reach fairly far if you're actually trying
to control it with two hands to get to the

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.230
start button there in the center.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:21.319
And then you have buttons that are anonymously
labeled "A," "B," "C," and "D," with no indication

00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:22.910
of what their function might be.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.579
"B" normally goes back.

00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:26.779
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's part of the mystery, Dan.

00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:30.449
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is part of the mystery of, and so
part of your job in this, and I think if you're

00:15:30.449 --> 00:15:34.999
this kind of gamer who enjoys those kinds
of games, is to try to puzzle out how the

00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:37.279
user interface works as you're playing the
game.

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:39.689
Also, the game is very, very deep.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:44.759
If you're used to Final Fantasy levels of
combat, this is much more like Final Fantasy

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:51.339
tactics, where there really is a lot of tactical
element to the combat itself.

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:56.869
The goal is to chain attacks in order to inflict
maximum damage.

00:15:56.869 --> 00:16:00.439
And also, the terrain is very, very important.

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:01.450
There actually are hills--

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.450
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: in the terrain and elevation.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:10.290
And you actually have to move strategically
to sometimes cut off other player, other characters

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:14.800
sometimes to surround them properly so you
can chain attacks appropriately.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.199
So, there is really a lot of strategy in this
game.

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:19.839
We're very, very early in this game, in this
scene here.

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:21.600
Some little notes.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.261
Again, we're just coming back to it.

00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:30.910
It's PlayStation portable origins, we do see
this incredibly low res font here that they've

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.029
chosen to--.

00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:35.529
You also notice they've chosen to filter all
of their graphics.

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:37.040
The HUD isn't very high res.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.660
It's very, very nice by the way.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.279
All the elements they've added are definitely
there.

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:48.429
But in terms of, it is a little bit jarring
to have that in there in terms of--.

00:16:48.429 --> 00:16:53.069
It would be great if they could figure out
a way of actually modifying the engine to

00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:56.089
support some higher res text, or perhaps just
not filtering the text.

00:16:56.089 --> 00:17:02.730
In this particular case, I think the filtering
is actually diminishing from the impact of

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.199
the text within the game.

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:11.870
And really, the only other comments I have
are comments about what, about the HUD and

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:17.169
just making the game a little bit cleaner
in terms of being able to have people understand

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:19.140
the controls.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.339
Once you realize that you're playing a game
that includes a set of random buttons and

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.449
you have to figure out what they do in different
situations.

00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:28.500
And the game is consistent with how they're
used, 'cause, of course, it was consistent

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.539
on the original game.

00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:31.620
I think you do figure that out.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:37.659
You can see like, all the screens they have
in the game are all very, very simple, nondescript.

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:38.830
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: Again, a nice use.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.880
You're actually seeing, this is a dialogue
Hitting the back key again doesn't do anything.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.950
It should.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:49.500
So, these are just little, when you're porting
these games, it's always tricky to figure

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.620
out what to do in each one of these situations.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.020
And if we were gonna look at this today in
terms of featuring, they would definitely

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.179
say, "Hey, the back key should be popping
back out of that pod screen or move them back

00:18:01.179 --> 00:18:04.120
to the main screen of the game rather than
stopping there."

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.190
But in general, it's, for what it is, it's
a very good game.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.950
Also, note that this game has an enormous,
enormous, enormous secondary download.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.940
And this game was one of the first enormous
games to ship.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.940
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.200
So, if you're downloading this game, plan
to go get a cup of coffee, take a bathroom

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.039
break, watch a TV show, something along those
lines before you can actually play it.

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.039
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:30.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: As I recall, you guys, can't you like
play Pong while you're downloading this?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, yes.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.540
I'll say it.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.830
One of the cool things the developers have
done is you actually--

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: I thought that was awesome.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: They implemented Pong.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.880
Now, unfortunately, it's, as far as I can
tell, it's impossible to win their game of

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.210
Pong.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.210
You can play it--

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yes.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.289
&gt;&gt;Dan: during the download.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:45.820
And that brought back some great memories
as well.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.820
So, yeah.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.820
And it's very cool.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.820
It actually gives you progress.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.299
I think it does win for the coolest downloader
on Android.

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.299
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, by far.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.299
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:59.019
I just wanna also point out to you guys that
we have just regained the amount of viewers

00:18:59.019 --> 00:19:03.510
that we lost while I was telling my Carlo
Perconti getting drunk at the Marriott story.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.510
[Dan laughs]

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:10.309
So, I just thought I'd break in to see if
my face on the TV is actually gonna lose us

00:19:10.309 --> 00:19:11.710
four or five more viewers.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think people are just interested,
I think people are in suspense as to whether

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.490
or not this squid hat is actually gonna fall
off my head at some point during--.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.010
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's sliding backwards a little
bit.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.019
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's, this is a very challenging hat
to wear.

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:28.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: I don't think people are waiting to
see whether it falls off.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.680
They're waiting to see if it starts to become
self-animated.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.130
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, that's possible.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.130
Yeah.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.360
It could become self-aware during the show.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: I will say this.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.490
I've been watching the YouTube livestream.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.770
And actually, if you guys are watching on
YouTube Live, there is a livestream comments

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.299
where I'm like pathetically typing, "Hey,
dude.

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:50.299
Anybody there?

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:51.299
How about some questions and stuff like that?"

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:52.299
[Dan laughs]

00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:56.740
I feel a little bad about myself actually.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:02.649
But I would say out of about 20 comments,
about 12 of them are praising Dan's hat.

00:20:02.649 --> 00:20:03.649
&gt;&gt;Dan: Is that right?

00:20:03.649 --> 00:20:04.649
Yeah.

00:20:04.649 --> 00:20:05.649
&gt;&gt;Ian: The squid hat is a huge winner.

00:20:05.649 --> 00:20:06.649
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:11.419
&gt;&gt;Ian: On the other hand, according to our
G plus stream, the Android beanie, clear loser.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:12.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: Really?

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.840
People did not like the Android beanie.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: I know.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.840
They did not.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: But it's because they felt that it
was a poor quality Android beanie and you

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.880
could do better, Dan.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.880
There we are.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.289
&gt;&gt;Ian: Back to our regularly scheduled program.

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:24.610
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Goal for next week?

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.140
Get an even better hat.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.679
&gt;&gt;Dan: Better beanies.

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:28.710
So, yeah.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.600
I don't really have that much more to say
about Spectral Souls because I only played

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600
it for about four hours.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.220
And it really takes a long time to get farther
into the games.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.220
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:43.559
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, I can only assume the story stays
engrossing and fun as it certainly was from

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:44.559
the start.

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:48.361
So that gets us through, I think, the two
that I would describe as Japanese RPGs that

00:20:48.361 --> 00:20:49.820
are in this set.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.899
And now we also have two Korean RPGs as well.

00:20:51.899 --> 00:20:55.000
&gt;&gt;Daniel: And the two I enjoyed a little bit
more than the first two.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.340
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, you really?

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.340
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.340
Actually, I did.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.120
I'm more of a fan of the arcade-style games.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.200
I have ADHD.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200
It's not--.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.090
I don't actually have ADHD but--.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.269
&gt;&gt;Dan: I feel like we should have some music
here.

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:13.950
As you now tell us stories how this has impacted
your life.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.950
Sorry.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.950
Go on.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:16.950
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Let me rephrase.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.120
I have a short attention span and these games
manage to keep my attention a whole lot better

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.370
then the first two have.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.370
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.740
And we've got two examples in this genre.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:31.360
We have Inotia3 which is from Com2uS.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:39.600
And this game was really, I think it really
set the bar high for Korean RPGs coming to

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.600
Android.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.240
It was really the first one that I was excited
about.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.799
And yes, [indistinct].

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:52.419
But good that it didn't force me to join there
to do that as a general rule.

00:21:52.419 --> 00:21:54.030
So we can continue the game.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.399
I'm a level four Barbarian.

00:21:55.399 --> 00:22:00.139
For anyone who's played the game knows that
I haven't played that far on this tablet.

00:22:00.139 --> 00:22:01.309
So, some general notes here.

00:22:01.309 --> 00:22:04.090
And we've actually talked about Inotia in
previous episodes.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.669
I don't need to go over this in great detail.

00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:11.600
Obviously, on the tablet, the HUD is huge.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.590
It's enormous and it's low res.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.220
And these, as you're controlling the character,
you can see I really do have to move my finger

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:23.000
quite a long way across the tablet in order
to actually use this controller that is here

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.480
on the left-hand side.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.200
Also, we're seeing, once again, evident that
this game was a port.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.310
As you know, the graphics are very, very low
resolution for modern devices.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.310
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.769
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now, that doesn't really take away
from the charm of the game very much.

00:22:37.769 --> 00:22:43.580
And I certainly would not want them to not
bring this game to Android just because of

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.580
that.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.180
I think they've done a really, really nice
job with the original pixel art on the game.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.779
And it's really quite charming.

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:57.890
The basic game is controlled using, essentially,
a single button control with a bunch of pop-up

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.309
buttons that have different actions.

00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:03.860
And this is just also very, very, really very
straight-forward--very intuitive.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.530
You can slash things with your action button.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.539
And there's also a series of action controls.

00:23:09.539 --> 00:23:11.890
The game involves a lot of repetitive actions.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:17.080
So, ads are, as you can see, placed into the
game with this is I believe an ad-supported

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.080
game only.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.930
&gt;&gt;Reto: Dan, if you want for people to be
able to see the controls, if you actually

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:27.309
take the Galaxy Nexus out of that plastic
container and put the tablet in there, then

00:23:27.309 --> 00:23:29.740
people will be able to see your hands as well.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's a good point.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.410
All right.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.410
So, 'cause we can't actually--.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: Or just hold it--.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.340
Well, if you use preset one, you can actually
hold it.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.980
&gt;&gt;Reto: Dan's had made preset one a little
tricky.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: We should, yeah.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.760
Show us preset one, just to--.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.760
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sure.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: All the presets, 'cause they're awesome.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: The cable has come loose, so you'll
wanna fix that.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:50.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: Ah, yes.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.570
That's a good point.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: There you go.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.570
See?

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.570
How beautiful is that?

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: That is glorious.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.570
All right.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.570
Fabulous.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:58.570
So, you can actually see the HUD and how long
it, the amount of distance I do actually have

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.039
to move my fingers across to change the direction.

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:04.980
So we definitely wanna see, the fact that
this is a large screen device being taken

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.980
advantage of.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.370
I'd like to see the HUD be higher resolution
as well.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.919
Generally, fonts in the game be higher resolution
as well.

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:15.621
And, 'cause they do feel blurry on this device.

00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:16.990
But the controls are fun.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.730
You actually have an option of using these
special attacks here as we kill off deer.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.200
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I really like the control mechanism.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.020
I can mash all day long on a game like this
and get results.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.320
But you're right that the HUD size does make
it a little difficult to smash all the buttons

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.639
at the same time.

00:24:35.639 --> 00:24:36.639
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:37.639
[laughs] That's right.

00:24:37.639 --> 00:24:39.600
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's something, I used to love doing
StreetFire, too.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.210
Just button mash all day.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.140
&gt;&gt;Dan: But again, very, very, very similar
in style.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.919
In buildings, we have this sort of different
building view, which makes this building--.

00:24:48.919 --> 00:24:51.620
I mean, from the outside this building looks
actually quite small.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.899
From the inside, the building's enormous.

00:24:53.899 --> 00:24:54.899
[Daniel laughs]

00:24:54.899 --> 00:25:00.440
And that's also, I would say, something that,
I didn't even notice the fusion machine.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.440
That's cool.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.330
This is just how you synthesize things.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.610
Also notice, hitting the back key here does
not pull me out of what is very obviously

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:09.610
a dialogue in the game.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.000
We have an on-screen back control.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.580
So, there about a billion reasons that the
Android market, sorry, Google Play.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.890
I should start to drink every time I say Android
Market.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:20.890
Google Play team.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.890
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I'll drink for you.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:22.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Thank you.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:27.299
The Google Play team would have lots to say
about this before featuring it.

00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:31.720
But it is really a very well done game in
this genre.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.990
But another thing the game does do is, and
one of the first quests in the game--there

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.580
are lots of quests is that's how the game
is broken up--is to actually send you back

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.860
to Google Play to rate the game.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.980
And if you rate the game high--.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.980
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.519
&gt;&gt;Dan: If you actually go and take that quest,
it pops up Google Play and then it gives you

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:51.460
some special potions.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:56.500
And as we probably mentioned before, that
is actually against the policy of Google Play.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.789
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It made me a little bit sad.

00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:58.789
&gt;&gt;Dan: It did.

00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:59.789
It did.

00:25:59.789 --> 00:26:02.740
At least they're not asking you for a five-star
rating, but they are asking you to rate the

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.230
game in return for giving you something within
the game.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.230
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: As a general rule, we love games and
encourage people to review.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.299
Just try not to incentivize them other than
saying, "Yes.

00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:18.490
If you liked our game, review us."

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.600
&gt;&gt;Daniel: And if I am gonna review a game,
I want a little bit better of an incentive

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.600
than just some potions.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.600
[Dan laughs]

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.549
Maybe like a cool sword or something.

00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:30.139
&gt;&gt;Dan: Someone can contact Daniel offline
for incentives, for rating incentives.

00:26:30.139 --> 00:26:31.220
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, please.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.220
Yeah, please.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.340
Send me a message online.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.789
Like, make sure it's at least a sword or some
cool armor or something, custom graphics.

00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:42.559
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] Again, I'm gonna pull it off
of here 'cause it's too hard to keep HDMI

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.559
actually going.

00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:46.440
So, we're not going to able to use that camera
anymore.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.240
But the game really is deep.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.270
It has quite a lot going for it.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.730
So, the final game that we're actually looking
at--we're going through these pretty quickly

00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:00.390
here--is from our friends over at GameVille.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.390
And--.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:02.860
&gt;&gt;Daniel: We're gonna do Zenonia.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.090
Is that correct?

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.220
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is Zenonia Four.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.030
And Return of the Legend.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.432
And we, I was excited about this game for
a lot of reasons.

00:27:12.432 --> 00:27:15.470
One of it is that it's just beautiful, beautiful
pixel art.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.470
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, I loved it.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.470
I loved it.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.529
The art was amazing.

00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:20.549
Everything's high resolution.

00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:21.760
The controls are really easy.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:29.139
It's, I hate to say this, but it's almost
a more polished version of the Com2uS game.

00:27:29.139 --> 00:27:35.340
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it is definitely, it is definitely
a later game.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:40.470
You can see that I've got, it actually, it
makes use of vibration when I'm doing this.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.519
And actually, I'm pretty far in the game here.

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:47.480
We're already several hours in the game.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.820
I'm level six.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.669
[laughs] And again, the game is very high
resolution.

00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:55.230
I would still like to see higher res fonts.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.279
It's still a bit blurry.

00:27:56.279 --> 00:28:02.919
And one of the nice things about this game
is that you'll notice actually, and I should've

00:28:02.919 --> 00:28:09.960
mentioned that before when talking about Inotia3,
that you actually do see artifacts due to

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:18.870
basically filtering where it's actually blurring
stuff that's outside of the current texture

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.870
of the game.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:20.870
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:21.870
Yeah.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:22.870
That's right.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:23.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: So you see like, little pixels, stray
pixels here and there.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.299
You don't see any of that in this game.

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:28.640
It's just, it looked beautiful at this resolution.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:34.440
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Another thing I wanna note is that
this game and the last game, you can skip

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.759
through a lot of the cut scenes.

00:28:35.759 --> 00:28:40.860
So, if you're not a fan of story driven games
and you wanna skip right to the action, you

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.860
can definitely do that.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Another is if you have a short attention
span, this is the game for you.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.730
&gt;&gt;Daniel: That's why I love these games.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.429
That's why I love them.

00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:48.429
Get right to the action.

00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:49.429
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:50.429
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Skip all the stuff.

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:53.549
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now, for me, this, I will say that
from a game play perspective, there was a

00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:56.799
little bit too much of I walk off a screen
and I walk back on it.

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:57.799
Oh, look.

00:28:57.799 --> 00:28:58.799
All the monsters are back.

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:02.269
And I know that's an important part of the
element of this sort of game and it certainly

00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:06.889
gives you the unlimited ability to keep leveling
up, but I did find it a little frustrating.

00:29:06.889 --> 00:29:11.170
Now, is there a better way to use potions,
by the way, then going to your inventory here

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.500
and actually picking 'use potion'?

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.830
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I couldn't find it.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.830
I was like, "Really?

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:16.909
That's how I have to do this?"

00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:21.450
But maybe if someone, there is this plus button
here, but it doesn't seem to help.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.450
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, there, I was really hoping for
something better within the HUD to say, "Hey,

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.019
I really wanna use a potion 'cause I'm almost
dead."

00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:29.019
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yes.

00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:30.019
&gt;&gt;Dan: And there was no way to get that.

00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:34.690
&gt;&gt;Daniel: That was one of my complaints as
well that if you're in the middle of a five-monster

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.600
fight and you wanna use a potion, it's annoying
to have to go into the menu screen.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is jarring.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.429
And again though, big action button.

00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:49.360
I think it's interesting to look at this and
compare this against what we saw in Final

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:55.580
Fantasy Three, which had really, really minimal
displaying controls on screen.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:00.100
And this, we have lots and lots of stuff all
over the screen.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.080
And it's, they're both very effective.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.590
I think this, in some ways, is more intuitive,
but I really like the minimalist approach.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.080
And once you've actually played the game for
just a few minutes, you figure out fairly

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.080
quickly.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.690
One thing we have this many buttons on the
screen, even though it is somewhat intuitive

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.899
buttons on the screen, it's like when you
have this many buttons, it starts to get tricky

00:30:19.899 --> 00:30:20.900
what you're actually doing.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, I had a question for you, Dan.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.200
First, based on some things that we're seeing
on the YouTube livestream.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: How are the controls on this compared
to Inotia?

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.539
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think they're a little easier.

00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:38.100
The controls are a little closer together.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.110
So, I find it's a little easier on a tablet.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.720
They still have the same basic problem, though,
that they aren't scaling the signs of the

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.179
D-pad for the tablet, which I would like to
see.

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:49.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, they really should be scaling that.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.270
And would you like to explain to our developers
the best way to do that?

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: Sure.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:00.240
So, what we're talking about here is this
device is a large screen device which has

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.070
a screen resolution of--.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.429
&gt;&gt;Daniel: NDPI.

00:31:03.429 --> 00:31:12.299
&gt;&gt;Dan: Sorry, a screen, yeah, density of what
we call NDPI, which is about 150 pixels per

00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:13.299
inch.

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:17.190
And so, what we were trying to do whenever
we size one of these controls, we're actually

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:22.200
looking to size them based approximately on
the size of your finger.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.990
In this case, we're trying to look at what
is a comfortable motion.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:31.210
The good news about this particular HUD is
it really is a good compromise between form

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.210
and function.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:37.290
It works very, it works well enough because
the controls are all placed close to the edge

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:38.370
on both sides.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:45.809
So, it's actually very, very easy to reach
all of the controls within the game.

00:31:45.809 --> 00:31:51.620
And so, it's not, it's a little bit better
than what's going on with Inotia, which has

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.110
controls that are farther out and much, much
better than what was going on with Spectral

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.980
Souls where you had controls just spread across
the whole screen.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.980
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.129
&gt;&gt;Dan: Even though Spectral Souls had these
very, very beautiful high res controls, which

00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:05.990
I really, really liked, having them spread
across the screen made things challenging.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:10.309
Because they put the buttons in the corners,
they actually work fairly well on a tablet.

00:32:10.309 --> 00:32:12.700
And you can actually see.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.289
Oh, is the cable out again?

00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:16.659
Oh, sorry guys.

00:32:16.659 --> 00:32:17.659
It's again--.

00:32:17.659 --> 00:32:21.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: When Reto was making that motion, it
wasn't dirty.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.740
It meant, "Put the cable back in, Dan."

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:24.740
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.740
Right.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.740
Exactly.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.870
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, I also have one more question and
it's just based on what I'm seeing from the

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:30.870
screen shots here.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:35.580
Keep in mind that I haven't actually played
this game, but as far as I can tell, on the

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:42.519
screen when you're in the action, you are
apparently a fairly young child wearing a

00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:46.049
cowboy hat and carrying a gigantic gun.

00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:47.049
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:52.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: But in the cut scenes, or when you're
actually talking to somebody, you're apparently

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.870
a cross between Billy Idol and Britney Spears.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.370
So, can you explain that?

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:59.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, it's interesting that you mention
that.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:04.590
Actually, in the game story line, it is actually
mentioned that the character is surprised

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.020
that he looks like a child.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.620
And he's actually been brought back in time.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.529
So, they do actually try to justify the childlike
experience.

00:33:11.529 --> 00:33:15.770
However, they are talking about the somewhat
older child that appears in the cut scenes

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.370
rather than the very young child.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:26.799
Now, this kind of squashed art style is hallmark
of both Japanese and Korean role playing games.

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:33.149
And so, having the character run around in
this wide-eyed childlike form is definitely

00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:35.179
a signature element of these games.

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:38.380
And I think a lot of the reason is the characters
are small.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.120
They want to differentiate them very, very
easily.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.720
And if they actually tried to make them look
more adult, there's fewer pixels to draw eyes,

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.419
fewer pixels to draw facial features.

00:33:47.419 --> 00:33:51.740
And so, it became easier in these games to
differentiate them by having these kind of

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.850
squashed cartoony forms.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.049
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Large heads.

00:33:55.049 --> 00:33:56.049
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:33:56.049 --> 00:33:58.999
So that's, and this has just stayed now and
become part of the art form even though we

00:33:58.999 --> 00:34:00.029
don't need it anymore.

00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:05.429
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm not gonna argue with that, but
you can't explain the bare midriff.

00:34:05.429 --> 00:34:06.429
You just can't.

00:34:06.429 --> 00:34:07.429
[Dan laughs]

00:34:07.429 --> 00:34:12.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: I thought it would be interesting because
his dad, also, walks around in a fairly shirtless

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.200
way.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:21.139
And I thought it was to make him be more childlike,
is his dad has like, the 12-pack going.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:22.339
And he has like this, the, yeah.

00:34:22.339 --> 00:34:23.339
I don't know.

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:26.480
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I love how there's a thousand other
elements of this game we could be reviewing,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.309
but we're looking at the bare midriff and
the shirtless dad.

00:34:30.309 --> 00:34:34.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: We are following Ian's interests, here.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.770
So, in any case, so things to note in this
game.

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:43.490
One is the back key, pops up and says quit
game and go to main menu with, again, a system

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:48.250
dialogue We do, once again, have the vestigial
menu key.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:49.569
We have the zoom in key.

00:34:49.569 --> 00:34:52.230
It's always fun to actually push this and
see what happened.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.339
Does the game die?

00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:55.550
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's a surprise in every different
game.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: I suspect this game is just gonna be
massively unhappy now that we've done this.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.480
But we'll see.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.600
It's always interesting.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:10.970
So, this is what the game would look like
if you're running it on like, an ancient device

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:12.280
by the way.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.740
Actually, let's do back.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.390
I don't want to do a new game.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.390
Let's do continue.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.200
So, and again, a lot of people say, "Well,
how does pixel art scale?"

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:29.890
And we can't possibly do a game with, that
supports different screens on Android because

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.140
pixel art doesn't scale.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.780
It just looks terrible when it has to go down
to a lower resolution, especially this style

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.780
of art.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.930
This is the one people complain about the
most because it's got outlines on it.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.059
To be honest, this is totally playable.

00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:46.640
Like, I would not be embarrassed at all on
a device with this low resolution having to

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.020
actually have this style of art.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.609
So, this is just a note out to you game developers.

00:35:51.609 --> 00:35:53.400
It's not nearly as bad as you think.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.329
I just died.

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:58.869
So, I'm gonna quit the game now that I've
died.

00:35:58.869 --> 00:35:59.869
Extreme action RPG.

00:35:59.869 --> 00:36:04.920
And that's actually the way the game monetizes,
is you actually, you can buy things that allow

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.050
you to resurrect yourself.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:10.329
So, the game is focused on death because death
is how they make money.

00:36:10.329 --> 00:36:13.250
At least one of the ways they make money within
the game.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.250
There's also some advertising.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.829
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Maybe that's why the potions are
so hard to get to.

00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:17.829
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's possible.

00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:18.829
I was curious.

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:22.450
I don't like to be the one who's being the
one mounting conspiracy theories, but that's

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.970
certainly a possibility that I considered.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.640
So, yeah.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:32.230
From a perspective of the game, having that
menu key just doesn't really help them, but

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:37.800
it does actually allow us to talk about something
which I think is fun which is exactly how

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.680
a game does support multiple screen styles,
multiple screen resolutions.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:46.970
And as you can see, it's really not that bad,
even for a game that's as high resolution

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:50.100
as this to actually scale down to incredibly
low resolution.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:55.320
When we're zooming in there, we were going
down to like, original G1 resolutions.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.560
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: But if you want to avoid having that
in your game, it's actually quite easy.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:05.400
You simply have to make sure that you have
the manifest saying that you support all screens

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.650
and that your targeting a recent version of
the SDK.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.040
So, it's, get that out of your game.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.040
Your game doesn't need it.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.280
The game looks beautiful without it.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.630
And don't give a user a reason to push that
button and crash your game.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:18.890
It's just not worth it.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:20.670
And the game, by the way, doesn't have to
crash.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.480
That's just the game not handling the re-size
message appropriately.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.290
So, I wanted to take a brief mention.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:30.620
We did have a couple of other games that were
nominated.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.360
And I know that this was a very narrow nomination
pool here.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.090
We had Parallel Mafia, which really is not
fitting to Asian RPG models.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:45.030
It does have some artwork that's, I would
say, reminiscent of this, but it really falls

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.900
into a totally different category of game.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.161
So, sorry to say, we're not looking at it.

00:37:50.161 --> 00:37:58.300
The same thing with My Kingdom for a Princess,
is that what it is I believe it's called.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.300
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: We're looking for the prince.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.340
&gt;&gt;Daniel: My Kingdom for, it's a long title.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a long title, for the Princess.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.620
&gt;&gt;Daniel: My Kingdom for the Princess Three.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.680
And which also falls into that category.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.660
Now, I will say that I did try to look at
this game.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.089
I spent a long time trying to get it download.

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:15.740
And you can see we're on the download screen
now.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.970
And as you see there, it thought it downloaded
a little part of it and then went back and

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:19.970
it failed.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.860
And it's re-downloading again.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.480
The game might be really beautiful.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.390
It certainly, this title screen is gorgeous.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:30.300
The developers, this is a very, very popular
developer with a lot of popular titles.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:37.050
So, we'd love to have a look at it, but if
a download does not properly resume, and this

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:41.470
one does not seem to--at least in the three
times that I've had it fail--it has restarted

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:42.470
completely.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.579
That's gonna keep people from playing your
game.

00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:49.920
And so, it's something, it's a shame to spend
the thousands of hours in developing a game

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:55.150
title like this only to not have a method
of getting the game to the user.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:39:00.151
Now, the other thing, of course I would say,
is that because this is on Google Play, we

00:39:00.151 --> 00:39:04.210
really should be using APK expansion files
to deliver the other content.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:09.880
That way, Google Play will automatically deliver
the content to the device for you and you

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.640
don't have to worry about having this downloader.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.510
Now, if you do have content that you're trying
to split across different screen resolutions,

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:22.320
there's a limited amount of that that can
be done using the APK, multiple APK facility

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.810
within Google Play.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:29.270
And, but in general, I think the vast majority
of these games it's not necessary to even

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.270
do that.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:34.140
I think that we're at a point now with modern
hardware, with scaling pixel art looks pretty

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.140
good even.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.140
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:40.309
&gt;&gt;Dan: So just wanna do a brief mention of
those two, why we're not having them on the

00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:41.309
show.

00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:45.750
But it's always important to me that we, that
things get delivered in a way that's good

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:46.750
for the user.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.140
I will say one nice thing about My Kingdom
for the Princess is that it does not have

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:54.230
the vestigial zoom control, although it does
have the vestigial menu key.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:58.400
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I also wanna say that I did get
a chance to play Parallel Mafia and it is

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.460
a very entertaining game, but maybe we can
cover it in a different show where we cover

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.460
miscellaneous games.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.440
It's more of a mash-up type of game.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:15.349
It's like a MMO combined with a little bit
of RPG with geographical and regional elements

00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:16.569
to it, too.

00:40:16.569 --> 00:40:17.569
So--.

00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:23.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: When I looked at Parallel Mafia, I
really felt like it was representative of

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:28.280
what I think is a new genre of games that
I think we're calling location-based games.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.760
So for instance, Red Robot Labs has a game
called Life is Crime.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.859
It's very similar.

00:40:33.859 --> 00:40:38.740
There's a couple other games out there that
are like this where you're basically playing

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.990
on a real map.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:45.290
So it might be actually really cool to do
a show just around location-based games.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:46.640
It's a pretty new genre though.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.300
I don't know if we'll have enough titles to
look at.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, I think that's a good, could
be a great idea.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.599
And I mean, I certainly wanna see more innovation
in the mobile game space.

00:40:56.599 --> 00:41:01.030
I think one of the unique things about being
on these mobile platforms is that we carry

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.480
them around with us.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.350
And so, that does open up a whole bunch of
new gaming.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:07.500
Plus, potentials.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:13.770
Plus, there is a lot of opportunity for promoting
local businesses within a game and monetization

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:14.770
as well.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:18.670
So, I think it's a really interesting category
both in terms of game play as well as in terms

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.569
of finding new ways of monetizing games.

00:41:22.569 --> 00:41:25.410
So, I think that's, we're gonna have a short
show today.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.180
I don't know if there's anything else we wanna
say.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.180
We do, of course, always value your input
on our moderator page.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:37.751
So, please continue to nominate games for
our next few weeks.

00:41:37.751 --> 00:41:41.220
We do have a few more weeks lined up.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.550
And we will continue to hopefully be here.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.550
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yes.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.700
We'll definitely be here.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.070
Do we know what's down for next week?

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.070
No, but--.

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.070
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hold on.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.070
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, no.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.070
We do.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.070
That's right, folks.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:56.540
We are having a short show today.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.170
Our show is only going three minutes overtime.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.950
And before we leave, yes, we do have a show
next week.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.810
We do have a topic for it.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.170
It escapes me at the moment what it is.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:13.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: I do know the week after next week,
we're gonna be targeting NFL apps.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:14.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's right.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.640
Week after next it's all about football.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.040
And not Reto's kind of football.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, no.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: Our kind of football.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.040
&gt;&gt;Daniel: The real kind of football.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: The next week we have brain and puzzle.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right, soccer.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.510
&gt;&gt;Ian: And before we leave, let's just do--.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: Brain and puzzle games.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Ah, brain and puzzle.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:36.309
Yeah, actually brain and puzzle games, we
have this request from a viewer that wanted

00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:39.490
to nominate their brain and puzzle game.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:44.520
I think that it's a great genre and I'm really,
really excited to take a look at that.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.680
I will be back here next week.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:54.280
I sat out this show doing the producer thing
because I am, if nothing, not an Asian RPG

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280
fan.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.280
But before--.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, are you saying that Daniel Pham
is our Asian correspondent?

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:02.290
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, he's our token Asian.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:03.380
That's right.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.020
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Thanks, guys.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.109
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:07.109
Right.

00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:11.030
Any VPI or M RPGs, it's just [ muttering ].

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.770
&gt;&gt;Daniel: You guys can guess.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:15.180
You guys can guess.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.599
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:17.599
Anyway.

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:18.599
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Moderator page.

00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:20.380
You guys can Google.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: What kind of Asian do you think Daniel
Pham is?

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.720
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yes, what kind of Asian do you think
I am?

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's right.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:31.160
And also, I just wanna make sure that everybody
holds up their beer before we leave, yeah.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.380
How much has Dan drunk?

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.869
How much has Dan drunk?

00:43:34.869 --> 00:43:36.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: Not very much.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:42.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hard to tell in this, but I think I've
got about a quarter bottle left.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.100
So, I'm not doing too well.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.100
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Dan you.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, we're both Dan, so it works out.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:49.750
I think Daniel--.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: He's not broken until he loses the
deposit on his apartment.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.299
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] So the, yeah.

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:58.109
&gt;&gt;Ian: Guys, thanks for tuning in.

00:43:58.109 --> 00:44:00.730
Thanks a lot for being on the livestream.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:06.880
By the way, I do have to mention, so there's
some great comments right at the end of the

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.880
livestream.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.630
First, I think Dan Galpin should be drinking
more beer.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:11.630
That's a great.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.790
Oh, I love that comment.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:20.310
The other ones are, it would be great to review
something like the old school Elite.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:21.330
Oh, my God.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:23.040
I have to tell you.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.400
That is so true.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.760
Elite was my favorite game ever.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.609
&gt;&gt;Dan: Did you leave that comment, Ian?

00:44:29.609 --> 00:44:31.549
That sounds like a comment from you.

00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:32.549
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Someone else left that comment.

00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:37.290
I think Ian created a new account and signed
in as himself just to post that comment.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.290
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: If I was gonna create an account, it
would not be named Dennis P. Boost.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:46.369
No offense to the Dennis P. Boosts of this
world, but this wouldn't be my first choice.

00:44:46.369 --> 00:44:47.369
&gt;&gt;Dan: There you go.

00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:51.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: I would probably go for, I don't know--.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: Dennis Q. Boost.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: Probably.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.540
Anyway, so yeah.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.470
Elite and Rogue, actually, were the two suggestions.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:59.160
I think those are both great suggestions.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.390
Rogue, it's interesting 'cause Rogue, I think
that almost all of these RPGs that we looked

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:09.240
at today actually do, are descendants of Rogue
to some degree or another.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.250
Actually, if you play Dungeon Hunter Three
from Gameloft, it pretty much is Rogue with

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:16.920
updated graphics and a couple of additional
elements.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.119
But yeah.

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:22.270
I think that there's certainly, I wanna see
more games that are like Elite.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:25.680
I'd like to see the original Elite come back
in some super awesome form.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.040
I was a huge fan of the--.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.369
&gt;&gt;Ian: The original Elite come back as a mobile
title.

00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:34.640
And not that, OK.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.599
All props to the original Elite authors, but
when you brought it to PC and called it Frontier,

00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:41.170
it was a mistake.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.650
You did not do well with that.

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.000
There were issues there.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: I was a huge fan of the Wing Commander
games.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.770
I was a huge fan of Fighter.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.230
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, me too, actually.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: Privateer Two, one of the best games
ever made.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.480
And after that, Frontier.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.880
And I actually, I was a huge fan of Star Flight
as well, in that series of games, which all

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.600
owe that their legacy to Elite.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.400
So, it would be great to see that.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.609
There's a, I also wanna, as far as early games
that I wanna see, I very much wanna see Archon

00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:08.930
come to Androids.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hell yes.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.579
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, it's React Games, you have the
license.

00:46:13.579 --> 00:46:15.690
Bring it on, all right?

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:19.760
And that's pretty much it, I think, for us
on the Friday Review of Games.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760
Again, come back.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.610
Keep nominating brain and puzzle games for
us to look at next week.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.569
I, as always, am Dan Galpin.

00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:27.700
With me is Daniel Pham.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:35.150
And, of course, we have Reto, who is currently
running our technical deck here.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:36.690
And we have Ian on producer.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.880
So, thank you all.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.880
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Thank you, guys.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.880
We'll see you next week.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: And cheers.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:40.882
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Cheers.
