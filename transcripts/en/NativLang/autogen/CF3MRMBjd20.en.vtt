00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.880
 If I want to roar all the ridiculous things, in Japanese, I only need to write a simple sentence. 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.250
 This sentence will continue to grow longer, grow longer, and grow longer: until we throw a "Chinese character bomb" like a ninja in a writing system, 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.199
 But I have not figured it out yet 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.240
 The things that make Japanese characters cross the top make them really embarrassing. 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.539
 Don't forget, you can't forget that Japan borrowed Chinese characters from China. 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.240
 This is important because it explains what happened next. When a Chinese character crosses the sea by boat, 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.800
 It takes its own Chinese pronunciation, but Chinese and Japanese are 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.210
 Two very different languages, the pronunciation system is different. So every Chinese character is not pronounced like the Chinese say. 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.800
 But pronounce it like the Japanese heard it. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.059
 Let us imagine this history. "Hello, who are you?" 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:58.100
 "Han (han)." "Hey, look (kan)." "No, it is Han (han). "Yes, look (kan). Nice to meet you, see (kan)." 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.559
 This is the top of the Sapporo ice sculpture. 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.179
 What makes this confusing cultural mismatch better is that it happened a long time ago. 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.939
 The exchange of sounds, this is the way Chinese characters from ancient China sounded to the ancient Japanese. 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.299
 As I explained last time, most of the Chinese characters are like a bad dumb game. 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.499
 Some Chinese characters tell you this "sounds like" 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:25.709
 In Japanese, the confusion from this phonetic voice game blurs "sounds like" 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.609
 Fantasy shows that the pronunciation of the mixed culture of Chinese characters is Chinese and Japanese. 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:38.740
 read. In Japanese, people call this "sound reading", which literally means "sound reading" if you use 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.490
 If you read the Chinese pronunciation of a Chinese character, there will be more than one way to go. 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.849
 Understand "sound reading." We continue, this is the 5th century Chinese character Wu Yin 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:53.349
 Then there is "kan'on", which is the Tang Yin from the 7th century. 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:59.049
 The pronunciation of "tou'on" was later transmitted to Japan. 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.349
 The final "sound reading" is "kan'you-on", after a few centuries, irrelevant or even wrong pronunciation 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.600
 It became a regular correct pronunciation. So, yes, don’t do the “sound reading” you are learning. 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.560
 In fact, there are a lot of Chinese and Japanese pronunciations surprised. 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.210
 This has interesting consequences. If you go to some Zen ceremonies, they will recite some 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.000
 The heart of the script written in Chinese ancient Chinese. But here is Japan, and these are all Chinese characters. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.520
 So how do you think the scripture is pronounced? Use ancient Chinese? No. Use standard Chinese? No. 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.490
 In Japanese? Nor is it! They are just a series of "sound readings". 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.700
 Basically it leads to gibberish in both languages. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.670
 Chinese characters can be more than just "sound reading" or even "training"! As I said before, Japanese and 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.980
 Chinese is a very different language, which means that all borrowed audio readings have passed through one century after another. 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.170
 Also a foreign vocabulary. But you thought 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.460
 Is the Japanese local vocabulary set aside to make room for the sparkling new Chinese phrases? 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.510
 No, the Chinese characters that come over must also adapt to Japanese. So at that time Japanese words were matched with Chinese characters. 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.680
 It looks very appropriate. 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.210
 This is the Chinese character of "truck" or "big car", it has some sound reading, 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.600
 The basic one is "sha", but there is already a word in Japanese: "kuruma". So this word can 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.100
 Represents any pronunciation above. 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.290
 This is really unscientific, just like you can have a variety of Chinese pronunciations. 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.600
 When reading a Chinese character, why not have a variety of Japanese language training? 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.840
 There are even more trainings to join. Self introduction, 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.460
 This is to have a proper name, and it is usually another Japanese native pronunciation of Chinese characters. 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.450
 The moment of excitement is not over yet, friend! 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.420
 Because it is time to forget the pleasure of reading and think about the fun of writing. 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.990
 This is a system that really makes you crazy... 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.370
 I mean, um... really amazing... this is a Chinese character! 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.580
 If you want to play faster, lose the meaning and history of Chinese characters, 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.459
 You can get some borrowing words that are only used for pronunciation. 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.810
 When you see "sushi" like this, this is just a loan, not these words. 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.499
 Have the meaning of this word. 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:22.620
 Sometimes, according to the logic of Chinese characters, Japan will build its own Chinese characters. 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.900
 Just put together the words! Because you will become rich because of this dumb game. 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.419
 These words are called "national characters." 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.400
 Sometimes, there are some updated or older methods to write the same Chinese character. 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.090
 I want to believe it! I'm dying! 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.050
 Sometimes, a Chinese character is too complicated, or you just think that you are creative, you need 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.650
 Simplify it in some way. By simplifying, I mean, completely transform it into not recognized by the public. 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.800
 But I will sit and look for something like "What is that? It is not in my 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.840
 On the official Chinese character list." Simplified! 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.289
 And proficient in a Chinese character is just a small part of "battle." Chinese characters often don’t have like you 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.529
 The meaning that is considered, or that they do not represent some meaning as they are. 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:07.360
 Japanese likes to combine a few Chinese characters to say a word. Walk you, Japan! Despite stacking up the words! 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.499
 If you are still comfortable with the Chinese language, go further and grab those simple three-character idioms. 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:16.800
 Or a four-character idiom, these idioms usually use very short syllables 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.400
 To express the meaning of esoteric. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.600
 No! 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.900
 I assure you that this is not the whole thing out of control. did you see it? 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.330
 This is not the strange syllable that was said last time, not when you start reading, training, borrowing words, 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.529
 Simplify the abbreviations to memorize the dilemma of Chinese characters. 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.699
 This is when you first put the ink into the seemingly regular 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.830
 The paper looks up when the beast comes up. Ok, 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.879
 Think about how intricate these Chinese characters are, they have small horizontal lines. 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:54.460
 There is a pen, and...--when I am serious enough to tell you that there is a correct, wrong 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.710
 Write when writing each stroke. 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.889
 You did it, but next time, I need you to help me.
