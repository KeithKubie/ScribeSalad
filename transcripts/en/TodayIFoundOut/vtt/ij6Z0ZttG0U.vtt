Why Potatoes are Called Spuds

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.010
Among other definitions, a “spud” is a
“sharp, narrow spade” used to dig up large

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.610
rooted plants.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.570
Around the mid-19th century (first documented
reference in 1845 in New Zealand), this implement

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.560
of destruction began lending its name to one
of the things it was often used to dig up,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.560
namely potatoes.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560
This caught on throughout the English speaking
world and this slang term for a potato is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.560
still common to this day.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.700
A false origin of how potatoes first began
being called “spuds” you might often read

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.160
is that it came from the 19th century group
“The Society for the Prevention of an Unwholesome

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.820
Diet” (SPUD), who among other things felt
potatoes shouldn’t be eaten.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.829
Previous to the mid-20th century, while abbreviations
were prevalent in text, pronouncing them as

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.760
words was not something people typically did,
being something of a very modern phenomenon.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.309
In fact, according to linguist David Wilton,
“There is only one known pre-twentieth-century

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.719
[English] word with an acronymic origin and
it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.649
The word is “colinderies” or “colinda”,
an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.280
held in London in that year.”

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.549
No surprise then that the word “acronym”
didn’t pop up until 1943.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.439
Beyond referring to potatoes, the ultimate
origin of the word “spud” isn’t known,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.829
first showing up in English around 1440 referring
to a short dagger, possibly from the Dutch

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.049
“spyd”, the Old Norse “spjot” (spear),
or the Latin “spad-” (sword).

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.479
Whatever the case, after the 15th century,
the word expanded from meaning “a short

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.880
dagger” to also referring to various types
of digging implements and eventually to those

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.759
tubers we all know and love, potatoes.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.359
Interestingly, when potatoes were first introduced
to Europe, they met with a lot of resistance

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.209
for a variety of reasons, from people thinking
they were poisonous to people refusing to

00:01:51.209 --> 00:02:03.869
eat them because they weren’t mentioned
anywhere in 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.380
the Bible.
