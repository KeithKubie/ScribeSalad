00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.100
The sun is a star.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.560
That’s a profound statement, and one that’s
not really all that obvious. Those little

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.169
sparks in the night sky are pretty, but don’t
look anything at all like the hot, blazing

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.570
orb that lights up our days. It was a pretty
remarkable intellectual leap to understand

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.440
the Sun and the stars are just different flavors
of the same kind of object. The only difference

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.220
is that the Sun is close, but the stars are
terribly far away, so they’re fainter.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.680
Right away, let’s clear up a misconception:
A lot of people say the Sun is a middle-sized,

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.249
average star. But that’s not fair. Sure,
it’s somewhere in the middle of the size

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:43.100
range of stars, but the vast majority of stars
are dim red dwarfs, far smaller than the Sun.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.540
By size and number, the Sun ranks in the top 10%
of stars in the galaxy! In our solar system,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.920
it’s clearly the dominant object: brighter, more
massive, and more influential than anything else.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.520
But, what is it?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.719
The Sun is, essentially, a big hot ball of mostly
hydrogen gas. It’s 1.4 million kilometers

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.780
across — more than 100 times the Earth’s
diameter, and big enough that well over a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.980
million Earths could fit inside of it. And
it’s massive: 300,000 times more massive

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.580
than the Earth, a staggering two octillion
tons of gas.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.860
But if we want to truly understand the Sun,
we have to look into its heart.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.680
At the very core of the Sun, conditions are
hellish. The pressure is a crushing 260 billion

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.000
times the Earth’s atmospheric pressure,
and it’s a searing 15 million degrees Celsius.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.340
Under those conditions, hydrogen is completely
ionized, which means the electrons in the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.670
atoms are stripped from their protons. This
makes the core a thick soup of ultra-hot subatomic

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.440
particles. In fact, the protons are squeezed
together so hard by the octillions of tons

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.750
of mass lying on top of them that an amazing
thing happens: They fuse together.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.170
Through a complicated series of steps, the
hydrogen atoms fuse together to form the heavier

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.050
element helium. Along the way, some of the
nuclear energy stored in those atoms is released.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.940
That amount of energy is described by Einstein’s
famous equation E=mc2, which states that mass

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.340
can be converted into energy, and vice-versa.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.420
Atoms are pretty small, though, so each helium
atom made in the Sun’s core generates only

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.610
a tiny bit of energy… but a lot of helium
atoms are made. A lot. Get this:

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.370
Every second of every day, the Sun converts
700 million tons of hydrogen into 695 million

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.980
tons of helium. The missing 5 million tons
— the equivalent weight of 15 Empire State

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.080
Buildings — is converted into energy, and
that’s a lot of energy.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.860
Enough, in fact, to power a star.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.470
It’s equivalent to detonating 400 billion
one megaton nuclear bombs every single second.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.120
That’s millions of times the entire nuclear
arsenal of our planet. Every second.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.690
And that’s why, even from a distance of
150 million kilometers, the Sun is so bright

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.210
you can’t even look at it. Even from that
distance, its heat can be felt on your skin

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.630
when you stand outside.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.180
Hydrogen fusion occurs in the core of the
Sun. The energy released heats the gas above

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.490
the core, but not quite enough to fuse hydrogen
into helium. Further from the Sun’s center

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.550
the gas becomes less dense, and at some point
the heat pouring up from below makes the gas

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.160
buoyant: it rises, in the same way a hot air
balloon on Earth rises. This process is called

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.080
convection, and it’s an efficient way of
transferring heat. Huge columns of rising

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.500
hot gas stretch hundreds of thousands of kilometers
high, bringing the Sun’s internal heat to

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.620
the surface. The gas then cools and sinks
back down into the interior. We can actually

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.120
see the tops of these columns, packed together
across the Sun’s face.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.080
Above the convecting layer is a much thinner,
cooler layer very near the Sun’s surface

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.730
called the photosphere, or literally the sphere
of light. This is where the density of the

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.410
material inside the Sun gets thin enough that
it becomes transparent; light can shine right

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.750
through it. At this point, the energy from
inside the Sun is free to travel into space.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.569
It’s this light that we see when we look
at the Sun.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.239
The Sun is a gas and doesn’t have a solid
surface, but the gas in the photosphere thins

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.079
so rapidly compared to the Sun’s huge size
that you can think of it as the Sun’s surface.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.870
And there’s one final layer above that:
The ethereally thin corona, sort of like the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.150
Sun’s atmosphere. It’s less than 1% as
dense as the photosphere, but actually much

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.960
hotter; temperatures there can reach over
a million degrees! However, it’s so thinly

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.430
dispersed that it’s incredibly faint, and
can only be seen during a total eclipse, or

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.760
using special telescopes that block the intense
light from the Sun itself. The corona extends

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.280
for millions of kilometers.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.960
And in a sense it doesn’t actually end. The
corona merges into what’s called the solar

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.650
wind, a stream of subatomic particles moving
away from the Sun. It blows out in all directions,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.360
though mostly along the Sun’s equator. The
speed of the wind is usually about a million

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.240
kilometers per hour — yes, seriously — and can
reach speeds even much higher even than that.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.940
When hydrogen fuses into helium in the Sun’s
core, the energy is released in the form of

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.760
light. This light immediately smacks into
a subatomic particle, which absorbs it, converts

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.940
a little bit of the energy into motion, and
re-emits the light with a little bit less

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.419
energy. The light works its way out of the
Sun this way, losing energy every time it

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.139
encounters a particle, until eventually it
gets to the surface, and is free to fly away

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.739
into the Universe as a much lower-energy photon
of visible light.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.540
So how long does this process take?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.220
I’ve seen different numbers for it, some
as much as a million years. But a lot of those

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.260
calculations don’t model conditions inside
the Sun accurately; for example they don’t

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.360
take into account the gas convecting for hundreds
of thousands of kilometers. More modern calculations

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.100
show that it takes closer to 1 or 200,000
years for the energy to work its way out.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.620
That’s still a pretty long time: The light
you see from the Sun now got its start in

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.830
the Sun’s core around the time Homo sapiens
first appeared in Africa!

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.900
The Sun’s surface is, to put it kindly,
a mess. And the key to that mess is magnetism.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.009
I’ve been saying the Sun is made of gas,
but that’s not entirely accurate. It’s

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.960
so hot inside the Sun that electrons are stripped
from their parent atoms in the gas, creating

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.600
what’s called a plasma, a gaseous soup of
charged particles. We’ll learn more about

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.030
that in a later episode. But, what’s important
now is the fact that a moving electric charge

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.639
generates a magnetic field.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.560
The interior of the Sun is essentially all
charged particles in motion. Convection, coupled

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.150
with the Sun’s rotation, sets up rivers
or streams of plasma inside the Sun, each

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.970
generating and carrying its own magnetic field.
When this plasma reaches the Sun’s surface,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.410
their magnetic fields do too.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.540
Maybe you’ve seen those looping arcs of
magnetism around a bar magnet when it affects

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.590
iron filings on a piece of paper. The solar
magnetic fields are like that, except there

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.670
can be zillions of them all over the Sun’s
surface, where they can interact and even

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.780
get tangled up.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.580
When the plasma reaches the surface, it cools.
But if the magnetic loops tangle up, they

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.220
prevent the plasma from sinking back down
into the Sun, like a knot in a shoelace prevents

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.370
it from going through the eyelet on your shoe.
Plasma shines because it’s hot, but as it

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.270
cools it dims. It sits on the surface, dimming,
producing a dark spot on the surface of the

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.550
Sun, which we call… a sunspot.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.400
Sunspots can be huge; they commonly dwarf
the entire Earth, and some are so big they

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.100
can be seen without using a telescope (as long as
you’re wearing adequate eye protection, of course).

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.660
Around the edges of sunspots, the magnetic
field lines are concentrated. This can energize

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.270
the plasma even further, heating it up. This
creates a bright rim around sunspots called

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.080
faculae (Latin for “little torch”). The
dark parts of sunspots dim the overall light

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.460
from the Sun, but faculae can be so intense
they compensate for that, and even add more

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.080
light. Ironically, sunspots actually increase
the energy output of the Sun.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.140
Plasma on the Sun’s surface can flow along
these magnetic loops, too. This can create

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.340
huge arcs of material called prominences or
filaments, stretching for hundreds of thousands

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.610
of kilometers across the Sun, looking like
fiery arches.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.770
We think these magnetic field lines are feeding
energy from the Sun’s surface into the corona,

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.520
which is why it’s so much hotter. It’s
not exactly clear how this happens, but scientists

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.920
are following several leads right now. This
long-standing mystery may soon be solved.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.680
Magnetic fields on the Sun also have a huge
amount of energy stored in them. You can think

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.430
of them like very tightly wound and very stiff
springs. But remember, these magnetic field

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.579
lines get tangled up. If conditions are right,
they can actually snap, in essence creating

00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:39.870
a gigantic short circuit. When this happens,
all that vast energy stored in the lines explodes

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.330
outwards all at once in an event we call a
solar flare.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.980
Even an average solar flare is mind-crushingly
powerful; a big one can release as much as

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.839
10% of the entire Sun energy output. This
explosion blasts out high-energy light and

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:59.399
launches material off the surface of the Sun at
high speeds, sending it into interplanetary space.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.620
Another type of solar eruption is called a
coronal mass ejection, or CME. It’s similar

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.730
to a flare, but if a flare is like a tornado
— intense and localized — a CME is like

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.560
a hurricane, huge and strong. Like flares,
they form when tangled magnetic field lines

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.050
erupt, blasting out energy, but they occur
higher off the Sun’s surface.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.279
Both flares and CMEs eject material into space
— billions of tons of it, in fact. This

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:28.740
blast of debris can hit the Earth, and when
it does, there can be profound effects. Our

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.020
atmosphere absorbs the high-energy light,
protecting us. Also, the subatomic particles

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.589
are generally deflected by the Earth’s magnetic
field, so we’re OK.

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:41.109
But, if conditions are right, the Earth’s
magnetic field can interact with the particles.

00:09:41.109 --> 00:09:45.140
Massive numbers are funneled down into Earth’s
atmosphere near the poles, causing the air

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.430
to glow. This is what we call the aurora,
or the northern (and southern) lights. Depending

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.540
on the shape of the magnetic field, the auroras can
form spectacular multicolored ribbons and sheets.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.640
Not all the effects are benign, though. As
the magnetic fields interact, they can induce

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.620
very strong currents of electricity in the
Earth’s crust. This can overload power grids,

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:09.019
causing blackouts; in 1989 Quebec suffered
a massive power outage from a solar storm.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:14.050
The very first such storm ever detected was
in 1859, and it was also the most powerful

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.040
ever seen. If an event like that were to happen
today, it could cause worldwide blackouts

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.700
and potentially be very damaging. Satellite
electronics would be fried, too, and we depend

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:29.580
on those satellites for our modern civilization.
In fact, in 2012, a huge storm probably the

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:35.280
equal of the 1859 event blasted away from
the Sun… in another direction, missing the

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:41.400
Earth. Had it hit us, well, you probably wouldn’t be
watching this video now. We’d still be recovering.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.279
This is why studying the Sun is so important.
We depend on it for light and heat and the

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:51.679
very basis of life itself, but it’s entirely
capable of knocking our society to its knees.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.000
Understanding it is critical to our future.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.240
The Sun is the 2 octillion ton gorilla in
the room. We need to respect that.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.430
Today you learned that the Sun is a star,
powered by nuclear fusion in its core. Hot

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:08.810
plasma moves inside the Sun, creating magnetic
fields, which in turn can create sunspots,

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.170
solar flares, and coronal mass ejections.
These events can generate aurorae on Earth,

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.470
cause power blackouts, and damage satellites.
