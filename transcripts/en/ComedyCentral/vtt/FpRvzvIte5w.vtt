00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.430
Hey, check our shoe-cam,

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.920
just like the ladies
on the red carpet have.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.890
Who makes my shoe?
NYU medical center.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.990
Welcome to a special
Oscar's edition

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.460
of Melatony Movie Reviews,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.700
where I take over the counter,
completely legal,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.740
and not habit-forming melatonin
and then review movies.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm Melatony and this is
my roommate, Silent Siskel.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.560
Something is wrong with her.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.510
Says take one to fall asleep,
so I take four to stay awake.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.740
Now here's the best Oscar's
rundown you're going to get

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.440
without doing
a Google search.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.280
Christian
Bale's accent, the fuck?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.180
It's like when you meet
a guy at a bar,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.510
you go home with him,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.560
next morning you hear him
talk for the first time

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.600
and it's like,
"You're from Boston.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.300
If I had known
I wouldn't have..."

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.080
William Dafoe.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.020
Willem Dafoe.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.300
That's not a name.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.030
It's either William
or it's Will I Am.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.640
Anyway. Who?
What's the fucking guy's name?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.860
Richard E. Grant.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.710
If I wanted to hear
a middle aged dude

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.950
get all keyed up on coke
and talk about books,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.910
I would just call my dad.
I'll just keep it going.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.540
Ramen Malek is like that guy
that you like until he starts

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.900
telling you how he sees
musical notes as colors.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.290
Rami Malek's teeth,
hope they were in SAG

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.970
for doing a lot of work.
Mahershala Ali's performance ...

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.120
pretty good considering he had
to act opposite Sly Stallone.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.700
Not a conspiracy theorist

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.310
but I do believe
that Brad Cooper and Lady Gaga

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.540
are cheating on each other
with their spouses.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.800
All my eyes are closed.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.170
Snack break!

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.930
I whipped up
this unbuttered toast,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.820
totally awful, no seasoning,
cuts the inside of your mouth,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.520
and that's in honor
of Green Book.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830
Best actress,
best supporting actress.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.240
As usual, a tight race.
Lady Gaga losing to Glenn Close

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.610
reminded me of when I was
nominated for homecoming queen

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.740
in high school
but I found out it was a prank.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.590
And actually a teacher
won that year.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.190
This is the second nomination
for Melissa McCarthy

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.400
but the first movie

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.820
where she didn't have to hurl
her body into a fence.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.210
Jumping into fences,
like I love that.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.710
That's good film to me.
Meryl Streep was nominated.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.220
Didn't do any movies, but you
know what, it's tradition.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.740
Am I dead from melatonin?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.130
You never talk, I just like
don't know how you feel.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.470
Keira Knightley in the favorite.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.800
She's not in that.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.030
No she's definitely in it.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.790
It's like the role
that she was born to play.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.070
Yes, anyhow, if it comes down
to Emma Stone and Rachel Weiss

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.720
for the favorites,
like apples and oranges,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.650
same fucking thing.
Just gotta put some makeup on.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.020
But in my opinion,
the best actress this year

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.270
was my sister-in-law,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.520
for sticking it out
for the sake of the kids.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.720
Snack break.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.310
So in honor of Vice,
I roasted this pheasant,

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.340
which is what Dick Cheney
was hunting

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.810
when he shot that guy
in the face.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.859
Aw, I love you Lenny.
I'm a war criminal.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.780
The big story with best picture
is that this year the movies

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.650
are finally ones
that people have seen.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.850
What the hell was Shaped
Like Water?

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.640
I'm sorry, which of these movies
is a Spike Lee joint?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.850
I forget.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.090
BlacKkKlansman.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.320
Okay. I see that.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.430
BlacKkKlansman ... mention ...
kind of like ... pizza.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.360
Roma was made entirely
of black and white footage

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.190
that Fonzie Corazon found
at a Brooklyn thrift shop.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.320
The Favorite, it was shot
on a GoPro, which is awesome.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.450
I used to have a GoPro
but it got stolen by my friend

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.920
at the skate park,
which is not awesome.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.770
And he's not
my friend anymore.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.600
Bohemian Rhapsody, I watched it.
But I didn't see it.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.410
So in my opinion Black Panther
is the best movie

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.110
and it should win.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.480
I thought we discussed
why you shouldn't do that.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.570
Haters say that an action
franchise can't win best pic,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.250
but you remember
this parade of trolls?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.160
That movie was garbage,
so bad.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.870
I actually took my cousin
for his birthday

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.050
and I made him pay me
back for the ticket.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.790
So the Oscars
don't have a host.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.500
Neither does Panera Bread,
and it runs itself.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.460
So now you know literally
everything there is to know,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.090
and you can finally win
your office Oscars pool.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.910
Enjoy the Oscars,
and tune in next week

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.610
when I tell you
everything you need to know

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.310
about the Academy Awards.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.550
I'm not dead. Just happy.
