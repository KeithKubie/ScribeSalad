DAVID EDERY: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:02.880
Let's see.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.350
OK, so I'm going
to admit, this was

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.120
supposed to be a free-to-play
fundamentals talk.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.140
But then the more
I worked on it,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.150
the more I realized I wanted
to talk about misconceptions.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.130
So it kind of turned into a
free-to-play misconceptions

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.370
talk.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.700
I hope you're OK with that.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.430
If you're not OK with that,
you can yell at me later.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.150
So the first misconception I
wanted to talk about is-- oh,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.650
and actually, you
guys may not know.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.640
My company made "Triple Town,"
"Alphabear," "Bushido Bear."

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.286
We just released "Alphabear 2".

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:26.160
We made a game called
"Realm of the Mad God."

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.260
Those are all
free-to-play games.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.194
Some of them reached
huge audiences.

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:32.110
Most of them did not
make all that much money.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.210
We're trying to
get better at that.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.585
I think we've finally gotten
a little bit better at that.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:38.070
So anyway, OK, free-to-play
misconceptions.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.827
So the first one is people
will donate to you if you just

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:44.910
ask nicely and take all
the free-to-play stuff out

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.630
of your game.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.410
I hear this all the time.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.960
It's a really common
misconception.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.900
You'll hear it most particularly
from the vocal minority

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.620
in any game.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.640
They'll just say ah,
if you would just

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.139
take out all this
free-to-play crap,

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:56.620
we would just give you money.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.590
We actually tried this
many, many years ago.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.330
Because we like to do
these kinds of experiments.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.330
And it failed miserably.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.680
We made basically, no money.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.050
I know lots of other
indies have tried it.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.674
Virtually all of them
have also failed.

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:08.460
There are like one-in-a-million
examples where they actually

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.290
make good money
taking donations.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.850
And that ends up
fooling everybody.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.912
Please don't do this.

00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:14.370
Don't assume that
you can basically

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.470
do no work to make money
and just ask for donations

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.220
and you'll be fine.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.636
People give donations
because they

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:21.080
see a picture of a starving
child in their Facebook feed,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.720
or because their
friend has cancer.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.660
Those are the things that
cause people to give donations.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.260
They don't give donations to
you because your game is fun.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.690
That almost never works,
so please don't do that.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.780
The second misconception is
that any game can be profitable

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.000
if you simply sell
aesthetic items only,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.770
which are items that
make you look good,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.500
or show you dancing or
whatever, and not a functional

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.580
benefit in any way.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.830
And that obviously, is
a misconception as well.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.210
It depends on the game.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.839
So in particular, it depends
if it's a multiplayer game.

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:50.880
Like if you have a
multiplayer game where there's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.530
a lot of person-to-person
interaction,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.960
people can see your character
doing certain things,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.904
then yeah, it makes
perfect sense.

00:01:56.904 --> 00:01:58.320
You can show off
for other people.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.610
You can dress nicely
for other people.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.318
You can do a dance
move for other people,

00:02:01.318 --> 00:02:02.670
so it makes sense to buy stuff.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.084
When you're in a single-player
game where nobody can see you,

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:08.250
it doesn't really make sense
to spend a lot of money

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.360
on aesthetic items.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.884
It can work.

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:13.659
I mean, these are all like
sort of general rules, right?

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.200
I'm sure there's an exception
that proves the rule somewhere.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.660
But for the most part,
it's a really bad idea

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.640
to make a single-player
game and then

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.770
try to make all your money
selling aesthetic goods.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.420
In general, even in
multiplayer games,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.140
like in our upcoming
"Steambirds Alliance" game,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.290
which is based on an MMO we made
called "Realm of the Mad God--"

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.191
that's a highly, highly
real-time multiplayer game.

00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:37.690
In theory, we could make money
selling only aesthetic items.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.330
But we also sell
functional ones that

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.340
are designed not
to make it easier

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.056
to win or to beat other
people, but just to make

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:45.930
your game playing
experience more convenient.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.480
Like we'll sell
inventory storage

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.790
if you want to be a pack
rat and save more items.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.430
You don't have to, but it
makes the game a little bit

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.971
more convenient and
a little bit more

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:57.600
fun if you can be a pack
rat and store more stuff.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.710
So we sell you that.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.168
And that sells really, really,
really well even though it's

00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:02.640
not a pay-to-win item.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.696
So in general, I highly
recommend not deciding

00:03:05.696 --> 00:03:08.070
that you're just going to sell
aesthetic goods unless you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.530
have a multiplayer game that
can really potentially support

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.030
that.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.124
And even then, be aware
that for the most part,

00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:15.540
the games that
make a lot of money

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.019
doing that tend to be these sort
of massive cultural phenomenons

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.060
like "League of Legends."

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.019
And in general, my
argument is if you're

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.560
betting that you're going to be
the next "League of Legends,"

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.390
maybe you have an
overconfidence problem.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.800
That's kind of my way
of thinking about it.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.610
So the next misconception--
that you can

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.710
divide gamers into
either they're hardcore

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.749
or they're casual.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:36.790
I think this is nonsense.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.300
And in fact, I think almost
every bucketing nowadays

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.870
is harmful.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.300
Like I'm not a fan
of another bucket

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.559
of saying oh, people
in the United States

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.350
have different attitudes
about free-to-play

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.930
than people in China.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.961
Like sometimes
yes, sometimes no.

00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:51.960
It depends on the genre.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.500
It depends on the target
group that you're targeting.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.990
So no, in general, no
to all of this stuff.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.760
And let me give you
a concrete example

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.600
of where this might break down.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.561
If you look at the word
game audience, which

00:04:03.561 --> 00:04:05.310
is something I'm very,
very familiar with,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.130
you might say, oh OK, that's
clearly a casual audience,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.730
right?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.365
Like it's mostly
women, like a majority

00:04:10.365 --> 00:04:12.390
of women who play
them, more adults

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.640
than kids, on and on and on.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.950
That must be a casual audience.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.720
Well, what are the stereotypes
we have about casual gamers?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.490
They don't like
complicated games

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.980
and they don't like competition.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.100
Totally wrong.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.020
Totally wrong.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.112
Scrabble in
particular, and "Words

00:04:27.112 --> 00:04:29.070
With Friends," which is
the modern incarnation,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.100
has basically trained
generations of word gamers

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.190
to lust for blood.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.430
Like they want to
crush the competition.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.500
It's amazing how
much they want it.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.510
And so we make
single-player word games.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.880
And we know for a fact that
it's hurting our retention.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.130
We get feedback all the time
from people who are like,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.870
I love this game,
but I would love

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.524
it so much more if you had
any sort of competition in it.

00:04:48.524 --> 00:04:50.940
So right now we're working on
putting a tournament feature

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.380
into "Alphabear 2."

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.560
Because these people
want to compete,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.660
including whatever
stereotype you

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.300
want to conjure up, the
50-year-old, 60-year-old

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.120
grandma who only plays Scrabble.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.920
She likes beating people.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.880
So don't fall for this trap of
people are hardcore or people

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.810
are casual.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.140
Just focus who it is that
you're trying to serve, and try

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.550
to understand them better.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.680
The people I'm trying to
serve for "Alphabear 2"

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.260
are people who like word
games and cute things.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.630
And those people happen
to like competition also,

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.130
in many cases.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.490
I don't call them casuals.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.632
And this, by the way, is
a great example of this.

00:05:27.632 --> 00:05:29.590
It's one of the few
screenshots I have in here.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.120
This is a game
called "Love Nikki,"

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.510
which was hugely,
hugely inspiring

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.950
to the people in our studio.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.790
Because a lot of developers who
we respect and designers who we

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.730
respect were telling us you
cannot make a complex RPG

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.090
for your target market.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.400
You just can't, it won't work.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.026
You need to keep
it super simple.

00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:52.900
It needs to be easy to
learn, hard to master.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.080
I'm sure you've heard
that a million times.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.420
It's just got to be easy
learn, hard to master.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.950
And you have to go
with the "Candy Crush"

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.970
style of monetization.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.120
You can't do anything
more than that.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.245
You want to do puzzle and
dragon for casual gamers?

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:02.087
You're crazy.

00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:04.420
This game, for those of you
who aren't familiar with it,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.060
is a game about acquiring
clothing and then having

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.140
dress battles.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.520
Like, that's what you do.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.710
You have your little
dress-up battles.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.670
I cannot tell you how
amazing this game is to me.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.560
It is so complicated.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.640
There are so many
currencies, and affinities,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.800
and various things that
play into whether you're

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.660
going to succeed in a battle.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.591
And this game is played,
as far as I know--

00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:29.590
I don't have all the
details because they're not

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.100
made public.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.990
But as far as I
know, the audience

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.540
is overwhelmingly female, pretty
broad in terms of age range.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.250
And it makes a ton of money.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.880
It doesn't make any
sense if you follow

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.400
the whole stereotypes of
what a casual gamer is

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.810
willing to tolerate.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.502
It makes no sense whatsoever.

00:06:48.502 --> 00:06:49.960
But this game is
really successful.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.418
And the fact that
it was successful

00:06:51.418 --> 00:06:54.490
gave us the courage to make a
fairly complicated meta-game

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.530
in "Alphabear 2."

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.946
I don't know if
we would have been

00:06:56.946 --> 00:06:59.470
willing to if we didn't know
something like this existed.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.400
So anyway, take that
for what it's worth.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.775
Another misconception--
there's a few lucky developers

00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:08.400
who can rely on primo featuring
by Apple and Google to succeed.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.150
They don't really need
anything else aside

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.560
from making their good game.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.270
That's no longer true either.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.820
It used to be true.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.450
And I'm speaking
from experience.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.130
We've been very
lucky as a developer.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.430
Everything we've ever made has
gotten a really great feature

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.810
by at least Apple or
Google, and oftentimes both.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.900
But to put this in perspective,
when "Alphabear 1" came out

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.380
not that long ago, we got
in the first few weeks

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.760
after it was out a
million downloads.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.770
And that was with one
really good feature

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.680
and one OK feature.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.150
When "Bushido Bear" came out,
same thing, over a million

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.650
downloads in the
first few weeks.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.066
When "Alphabear
2" came out, which

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:48.880
was just a couple of months
ago, we got better support

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.140
in terms of overall support.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.170
Both platforms supported
us very strongly,

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.920
which isn't always the case.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.130
And yet we only got a few
hundred thousand downloads

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.062
in the same time period.

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.270
That's with the best feature
we could have asked for.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.270
We literally could not
have asked for any better

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.020
from either side.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.640
It's just the
nature of the beast.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.540
Things have changed.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.314
The market is more
competitive now.

00:08:10.314 --> 00:08:11.980
Google Play and the
App Store themselves

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.860
have fundamentally changed
in a few different ways.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.160
And you basically cannot rely
on features to be a success

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.040
anymore.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.161
You have to, at the
end of the day--

00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:23.410
and I think Mike was talking
about this earlier on his

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.580
panel--

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.220
you have to have an LTV that
enables you to play the user

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.000
acquisition game.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.090
You have to be making at least
$0.50-$1 per user on average.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.429
And the number depends on
the nature of your audience,

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.720
and the cost of acquisition
for users in that audience.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.770
But the bottom line
is, if you're not

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.478
making a decent amount
of money per user,

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.650
you're going to fall flat.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.750
This has been a very
hard realization for us.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.810
As a company, we've always
been really, really focused

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.110
on just trying to make
the best game we can

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.860
and not worrying too
much about the money,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.776
and then hoping that
we'll be rewarded for it.

00:08:52.776 --> 00:08:54.642
And that doesn't work anymore.

00:08:54.642 --> 00:08:57.100
So basically, almost all of
our effort now on "Alphabear 2"

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.920
is going into trying to raise
up the LTV of our users, which

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.350
is not, to be perfectly
honest, the most fun

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.660
part of game development,
at least not for us.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.995
But it's that or die.

00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:09.370
And so we're trying
to figure out

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.340
how can we do that kind
of work and still enjoy

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.501
what we do for a living.

00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:15.250
And there are some
creative ways to do it.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.390
So in "Alphabear
2," for example,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.270
you can get rewards
for watching ads

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.250
in this mode called TV Time.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.240
And when you watch those ads,
your avatar and his companion,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.530
Doc Bear, are sitting there.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.113
And they literally crap all over
the ads that you're watching.

00:09:29.113 --> 00:09:31.000
They have like critical
commentary about it.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.240
And that made me feel better.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.730
I almost don't care
if our users like it,

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.620
although they do, by the way.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.980
It made me feel better about it.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.156
So whatever it takes.

00:09:42.156 --> 00:09:44.530
Figure out what makes you feel
better about monetization,

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.030
and then take it
super, super seriously.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.030
Because if you don't,
you're going to fall flat.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.180
So another misconception--
with compelling enough content

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.040
and IP, you can sell
content packs to succeed,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.000
and that's really
all you need to sell.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
That's mostly false too.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.070
So I'm sure all of you
guys remember "Mario Run."

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.530
It's like oh, Mario is
finally coming to mobile!

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.110
My god, it's going to
be an enormous success.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.130
How can it not be
an enormous success?

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.021
It wasn't an enormous
success, it turns out.

00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:12.770
Or at least it wasn't
a big enough success

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.186
that Nintendo was willing to
do something like that again.

00:10:15.186 --> 00:10:17.420
It's really hard,
it turns out, to get

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.606
people to pay just for what
they see as a content pack.

00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:24.230
I don't fully understand why, to
be completely honest with you.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.000
I have not spent enough
time thinking about it

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.999
to really understand it.

00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:30.020
But it's not the most
successful monetization scheme.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.620
It's one of the
easiest ones, which

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.620
is why it's so tempting
for developers to do it.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.510
It's like, oh sure,
like I'll make

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.720
300 more levels, which
I can have a content

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.980
team do in a month or two.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.680
And then I'll put them
out there for 10 bucks.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.340
Because it's so straightforward,
it's very tempting.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.620
It doesn't tend to work.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.620
There are exceptions
again, that prove the rule.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.786
But it doesn't tend to be
the most successful model,

00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:53.570
so be wary of this one.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.400
Another misconception-- players
will only tolerate opt-in ads.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.090
This is, by the
way, a misconception

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.730
that I had until
very, very recently.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.481
It's false, but it's
false in the same way

00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.563
a lot of things I've been
talking about are false.

00:11:05.563 --> 00:11:07.147
It's false depending
on your audience.

00:11:07.147 --> 00:11:08.563
There are some
audiences for which

00:11:08.563 --> 00:11:09.890
this is almost certainly true.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.040
My guess is that if you tried
to make a game like "Fortnite,"

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.080
and you put enforced
interstitials into it

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.700
that you would fail miserably.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.460
Because my guess is since
"Fortnite" users are not

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.770
accustomed to that, they
would be furious with you.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.353
They'd be like, why am I going
to play this piece of crap that

00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:27.000
forces me to watch ads
when I go play "Fortnite?"

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.020
But on the other hand, if you're
trying to make a word game,

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.612
like I was with "Alphabear
2--" well, let's go

00:11:32.612 --> 00:11:34.320
look at what the number
one word game is.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.124
The number one word
game on Google Play

00:11:36.124 --> 00:11:37.790
currently is a game
called "Wordscapes."

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.456
Oh, interesting.

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:41.060
After almost every level, it's
making me watch a video ad.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.960
What the heck?

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.170
And there's still number one.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.670
Apparently, they
have a great rating

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.960
and they're making good money.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.920
So even though I knew that,
I couldn't believe it.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.380
I just could not
internalize the fact

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.210
that forced interstitials
would be OK.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.110
Because I personally
dislike them so much.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.170
And so we launched without them.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.590
We didn't have them in the game.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.935
And then we were disappointed
after a ton of work

00:11:59.935 --> 00:12:02.060
on rewarded video-- we
spent weeks and weeks trying

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.680
to make our rewarded
video like the "TV Time"

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.700
thing that I mentioned earlier.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.060
We spent weeks and weeks
trying to make that compelling

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.360
and it didn't really work out.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.940
We had some views,
but not nearly as many

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.200
as we needed to survive.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.061
So finally, some friends of
mine hit me over the head

00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:15.560
hard enough.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.370
And they were like,
you really need

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.360
to try to force interstitials.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.860
And you're like, fine, fine, OK.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.609
But even then, we were
so worried about it

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:22.111
that we did an A/B test.

00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:24.110
We weren't willing to
just put them in the game.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.900
So we had some users in the
A/B test seeing interstitials

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.820
after basically every
game, and some users

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.555
seeing them very rarely.

00:12:30.555 --> 00:12:32.930
So now I can tell you factually,
because I A/B tested it,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.555
there was zero
difference in retention.

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:35.960
Like literally, zero.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.611
None.

00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:39.110
The people who saw
them all the time

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.484
retain just as
well as the people

00:12:40.484 --> 00:12:42.290
who didn't barely see them.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.820
And then interestingly
enough, we

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.930
didn't have a
control group where

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.490
you didn't get forced
interstitials at all, just

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.290
because we were worried about
dividing up our audience too

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.800
much.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.650
But we compared our
pre-test retention

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.840
to our post-test retention.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.660
At most, maybe we lost like
half a percent retention.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.610
Like, it was meaningless

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.360
So long story short, for
our audience, at least,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.110
forced interstitials
were completely fine,

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.960
and helped us make
a lot more money.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.887
Please don't leave
this lecture and think

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:10.220
David Edery said put forced
interstitials in every game.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.690
Absolutely not.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.690
Figure out if your
audience is OK with them.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.042
And then the next question is--

00:13:16.042 --> 00:13:17.750
even then, maybe you
don't want to do it.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.030
Maybe you can find some other
way to make money without them.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.680
But if you can't, if
you end up in the boat

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.304
we were in, where we were like,
crap, no one's watching our ads

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.750
and we already spent weeks
working on this, maybe.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.729
Some other tips-- moving
on from misconceptions.

00:13:31.729 --> 00:13:32.770
This is just a brief one.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:33.850
It doesn't really
actually have that much

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.540
to do with free-to-play.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.998
But I really want to mention
it, cause it's that important.

00:13:36.998 --> 00:13:39.100
We use a service called
Play TestCloud, which

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.590
is a place where we
can upload an APK.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.510
And then we'll get a video back
of the person playing our game.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.370
And we can see where
they're touching it.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.882
And they actually
speak what they're

00:13:46.882 --> 00:13:48.090
thinking as they're doing it.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.210
So if they get
confused, they're like,

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.440
I'm confused right
now, what's going on?

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.110
And you can know exactly
what's going on in their head.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.490
It's a godsend.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.201
It's so unbelievably useful.

00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:57.700
I don't know if you
have other ways.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.220
Like if you by some miracle have
access to a great playtest lab,

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.720
great.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.545
I mean, obviously, use that.

00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:05.170
And of course I do
things all the time.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.512
Even with stuff like
this, I'll go to neighbors

00:14:07.512 --> 00:14:09.220
and watch them play
and things like that.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.530
But I cannot tell
you how useful it is.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.510
Particularly in how
hyper-competitive the

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.850
free-to-play market is
today, your first 30

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.350
minutes to 60
minutes of game play

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.601
have to basically be flawless.

00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:20.475
Because that's what
you're competing against.

00:14:20.475 --> 00:14:22.060
You're competing
against companies

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.600
that have flawless 60-minute
experiences, because they have

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.460
infinite money and can do that.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.836
They can tune and tune and tune.

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:31.210
And I don't know
of any other way

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.370
to get there aside from
using a service like this

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.690
for a company like ours.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.720
I mean, we don't
even have an office.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.136
I don't have anywhere to invite
people to do play testing,

00:14:38.136 --> 00:14:40.510
so this thing is
a godsend for us.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:46.150
We will constantly be surprised
by what people are confused by.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.770
I mean, "Alphabear
2" was not all that

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.540
different in the first 30
minutes from "Alphabear 1."

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.100
And we were still
shocked at the number

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.516
of things in
"Alphabear 2's" first

00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:55.840
60 minutes that caused people
to freak out and get totally

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.860
confused.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.900
So anyway, I highly
recommend checking it out

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.297
if you don't already have
a play testing solution.

00:15:01.297 --> 00:15:03.880
The second thing-- and this is
more specifically free-to-play.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.502
I'm back to being on topic.

00:15:06.502 --> 00:15:08.210
Offerwalls can be
surprisingly effective.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.250
So I don't know about you guys--

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.130
of course, an offerwall
is the like, hey.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.340
It pops up a list of games.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.262
You download them, you get
some free coins in my game.

00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:16.720
My first experience
with offerwalls

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.430
was several years ago.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.722
I thought they sucked.

00:15:19.722 --> 00:15:21.430
They had all kinds of
technical problems.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.638
They tended not to work well.

00:15:22.638 --> 00:15:24.320
They didn't make me
all that much money.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.450
It wasn't worth the headache.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.850
So I kind of had this idea
that offerwalls were terrible.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.260
And then I had a couple of
friends with "Alphabear 2"

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.090
tell me, look, they've gotten
much better, you should try it.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.860
And I was like, OK,
fine, twist my arm.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.050
And so we spent like
six weeks or whatever--

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.180
I don't even remember
the amount of time.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.140
It was probably more than that--

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.090
trying to make our
rewarded video awesome.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.680
And we put this in
in like two days.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.638
And we put no effort into
making it compelling.

00:15:43.638 --> 00:15:46.330
We buried it in the store
menu, and that was that.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.270
And it makes as much money
as the rewarded video

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.200
does, even though I put no
effort into it whatsoever.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.400
Which is kind of both
wonderful and horrible.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.560
But you know, that's
game development.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.475
So if you have written off
offerwalls like we did,

00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:03.850
you might want to
check them out.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.340
They can actually make a
decent amount of money.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.484
And they don't seem to be
as sucky as they used to.

00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:11.800
And then lastly-- and this
is the most important tip

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.580
I'll give you--

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:17.007
is that I think it's vital that
if you're planning on borrowing

00:16:17.007 --> 00:16:19.090
elements from the meta-game
of a free-to-play game

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.464
that you've been
inspired by, you

00:16:20.464 --> 00:16:24.830
have to play it for
months before you do that.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.330
I've actually talked
to a bunch of--

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.344
I have some friends
who are consultants.

00:16:28.344 --> 00:16:30.010
Like for a living,
they just give advice

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.843
to other people on
free-to-play game design.

00:16:31.843 --> 00:16:33.497
And several of them
have told me this

00:16:33.497 --> 00:16:35.080
is one of the number
one mistakes they

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.750
see their customers make,
which is why I wanted

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.370
to close my lecture with this.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.690
I've noticed this myself too.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.287
You'll have someone who'll
be like oh, yeah, I played--

00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:45.370
I'll mention again that
I've actually played a lot

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.752
and really enjoy "Star
Wars, Galaxy of Heroes."

00:16:47.752 --> 00:16:48.710
I played it for a week.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.910
I thought it was awesome.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.490
I really like what
they do with--

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.170
whatever, fill in the blank.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.670
We're going to put
that in our game.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.380
Well, "Star Wars,
Galaxy of Heroes"

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.200
is a game that
evolves tremendously

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.169
over months of play.

00:17:01.169 --> 00:17:02.710
If you've been
playing it for a week,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.260
you have literally no
idea what you're doing.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.210
You cannot copy that
game effectively.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.800
You cannot copy a piece
of it effectively.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.214
You may, for example,
see where it's like,

00:17:13.214 --> 00:17:15.339
oh, OK, there's three places
in the game where they

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.690
sell things for hard currency.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.819
That must be where they
get all their revenue.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:19.930
Maybe.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.722
Or maybe those three
things are actually not

00:17:22.722 --> 00:17:23.680
really that big a deal.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.660
Maybe there's a fourth thing
coming four weeks from now

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.160
that you haven't
even unlocked yet

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.350
and it's actually where
the majority of the revenue

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.851
comes from.

00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:31.725
But you don't know
because you haven't gotten

00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:33.160
to that point in the meta yet.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.000
This is less of an issue
for the more simple games

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.680
out there, like the
hyper-casual stuff

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.030
that tends to be
pretty straightforward.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.580
But particularly, for things
that have a fairly complicated

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.080
meta-game, like "Love
Nikki," for example,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.060
that I was mentioning
earlier, you just can't.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.620
You absolutely
can't play that game

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.502
for less than several
months if you really

00:17:49.502 --> 00:17:50.710
want to deeply understand it.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.630
It does not matter
how smart you are.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.315
I work with some
really smart people.

00:17:54.315 --> 00:17:55.690
A lot of them were
super confused

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.856
by how these games made
money until they played them

00:17:57.856 --> 00:17:59.350
for six months.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.300
You have to do this.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.430
Please, if nothing else you
remember from this lecture,

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.710
remember this.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.350
And the thing is that I've
heard a lot of people say,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.920
when I tell them these
kinds of things--

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.826
but I don't like it enough
to play it for that long.

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:16.200
Then it's like, why are you
making a game like that then?

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.100
What are you thinking?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.590
Don't make something that
you dislike so much that you

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.544
can't bear playing it.

00:18:21.544 --> 00:18:22.710
That doesn't make any sense.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.760
You're not going to
do a good job, right?

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.950
So seriously,
either decide you're

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.900
going to find a way to like
it or move on and do something

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.400
else.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.160
But that is the worst
excuse I've ever

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.220
heard for doing a half-assed
job of copying a feature out

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.550
of some other game.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.299
And I hear it a lot, actually.

00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:39.840
And by the way, the
reason I included

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.720
these screenshots is because
this is just showing the event

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.890
system from "Alphabear 2."

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.040
The screenshot that says "live
to eat" is basically the entry.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.350
That's the sort of entry
portal to one of our events.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.510
And then the screenshot
on the right is a bundle.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.620
And it's a bundle designed to
help you succeed in that event.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.780
That is something
that I was directly

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.130
inspired by the way they
monetize events in "Star

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.680
Wars, Galaxy of Heroes."

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.420
It's been hugely
successful for us.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.510
We've made quite a lot of money
with this specific feature.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.100
I don't think I
would have thought

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.440
of the specific implementation
without having played

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.760
"Star Wars Galaxies" for--

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.530
I mean, I've been playing at
this point for over a year.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.030
But I had to play
it for many months

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.500
to really put that together.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.026
So it's worked out
very well for us.

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.400
I'm pretty confident
that I would

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.300
have screwed the pooch
on this if I had only

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.540
played the game for a week.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.410
Yeah.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.070
And I think that's it.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.150
Thank you very much, guys.
