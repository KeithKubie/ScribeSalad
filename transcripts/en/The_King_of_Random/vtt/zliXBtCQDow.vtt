Hey, what's up guys Grant here, popping in with another subscriber giveaway

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.900
I went down and picked up a Nintendo switch with Mario Kart 8

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.870
I'd like to give it to one of you so I got a link down in the description for some subscriber appreciation

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.899
We'll see you there. Hey guys, I'm Nate and today we've got a fun experiment

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.049
We're going to try and see if we can make our very own magnetic putty.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.100
There's a couple different methods we're gonna try and both of them involve using this synthetic iron oxide also called

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.280
magnetite, this whole one-pound bag is available on Amazon for less than ten bucks

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.060
and it goes a long way. As the first experiment

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.590
I have a little blob of silly putty and we're just gonna see what happens if we mix some of our magnetite powder

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.249
Into the silly putty. Now this bag is full of magnetic powder and you can see that a magnet does stick to it quite well

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.519
I don't want to get any of the magnetic powder directly on the magnet because it's a very fine grain powder

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.889
It would be nearly impossible to get it all off

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.429
But, I'll try pouring some onto a plate and then playing with the powder a little bit with our magnet under the, plate and [can you] see

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.630
It's a very fine powder

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.830
It does have some clumps and those break up into just dust, really

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.309
You can see how dark this stuff is and that does transfer onto your skin. If you touch this stuff with your bare skin like

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.729
It's just like charcoal dust it it gets, it gets on you. It just kind of likes to stay on

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.800
Alright, so there is our black magnetic powder. Let's see what happens if we bring our magnet

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.270
Underneath it on the plate

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.009
Cool little

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.999
Shards spike things forming pretty similar to what happened when we made our ferrofluid except in this case,  it's not a fluid

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.660
It's just a powder

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.350
we've got our magnetic powder and we've got a little bit of silly putty if you're not familiar with silly putty, it's a a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.339
Rubbery gooey substance that is like an extremely, extremely thick liquid

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.440
So this is already a pretty neat putty I want to see what happens if we mix a bunch of our

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.820
Magnetite powder into this, and see if we can get a magnetic putty that way

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.940
[Rubbing it in reeaaalll nice]

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.940
hoi youtube

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.820
Okay at this point our putty is completely black there's no trace of orange coloring left to it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830
so the magnetite powder has really

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.609
Overpowered all the orange color that was in it. Let's see how well this is attracted to a magnet. Oh, I would say definitely

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.199
Definitely more attracted and now it's sort of just jumps up to it

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.249
One of the things I've seen done with commercial magnetic putty is you can put some of it near a magnet and it sort of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.819
Just swallows the magnet whole this is a pretty powerful magnet. So, let's see if we can get that result using this putty

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.500
Despite leaving our homemade magnetic putty next to a magnet for a while

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.260
It didn't ever really envelop the magnet it started grabbing on to one end of it and then just kind of stopped

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.339
I think the silly putty itself is just a little bit too rigid and durable and then when you add in the magnetite it gets even

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.650
More rigid by just a little bit and in the end

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.599
It's so hard that it doesn't really like to move very much. Another cool little thing

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.150
You can do with magnetic putty often is pull a little strand away from the main blob using the magnet

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.189
And again, it's attracted to it

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.450
But it doesn't really pull it hard enough that it can stretch out very well while having black silly putty that's pretty much normal

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.169
But it's attracted to a magnet might be cool, it's not really what we're going for so

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.280
Let's see if we can use a different recipe and make a slightly softer putty

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.500
One recipe I've seen says you can use two parts multi-purpose white glue and one part

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.450
Laundry starch and we're gonna add one part of our magnetite powder to that as well

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.560
Let's see what we can get using that

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.280
This won't make a very large batch

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.619
But it might be about the same as the size of our silly putty glob so it'll be a good comparison

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.829
This is not a very smooth texture at this point

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.499
But I'm going to keep working it and see if it gets any better and it is already getting a little bit stiffer

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.799
So I think that's a good sign. It's still very sticky though

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.418
It might just because it likes to stick to the rubber on my gloves. I'm gonna try this without gloves

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.869
Mmm, sticky on my hands as well. Not just the gloves

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.780
Assuming the sticky is from the glue

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.120
Maybe adding a little bit more starch will stop it from being is sticky

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.660
Maybe this recipe is just really really sticky

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.929
That seems to be helping and it's still we ewey guggy

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.350
but it's not sticking to my hands nearly as much so I think it's just getting

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.820
Just the right balance of starch and glue because now this is turning into a putty that I can actually handle a little bit

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.410
So now we know if we're mixing our glue and our starch and it's too sticky

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.280
We just need to add a tiny bit more starch not even a lot

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.079
I just dipped it down in on one spot a little bit and now I can handle this and it like

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.049
There's really not sticking it to my hands anymore

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.130
If you want to make homemade silly putty I'd say this is a pretty good recipe

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.109
It is a little bit thinner, but it's pretty similar. I wonder if I can bounce the ball of this stuff

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.100
hmm not on this material just stuck right to it

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.459
a little it bounces off the workbench

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.379
Not as high of a bounce of silly putty, but a bounce

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:44.079
All right. Let's try adding our magnetite powder to this and I'm going to try and

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.799
Add about one spoonful

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.759
I think we have a good puddy

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:02.419
The question is whether we have a good magnetic putty let's grab our magnet and see how well it's attracted to it

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.119
Oooh, I would call that pretty attracted

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:11.689
Let's try the same test

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:16.699
We do the silly putty let's just make a ball and see how easily it moves to the magnet

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:23.899
It jumps right out of my hand nicely putting the magnet near it it immediately starts stretching out and grab onto it

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.109
The silly putty itself didn't do much to grab around the magnet

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.590
Let's see what happens if we just leave this putty near the magnet for a few minutes

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.959
That did a much better job than the silly putty it reached all the way around our magnet this magnet

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.790
Compared to the weight of the putty is probably too big for it to move with its own magnetic draw

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.420
but some of the putty reached

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.129
Over the top of the magnet and down in front and grabbed on to that side, too

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.809
So really did a pretty good job of enveloping the magnet. This works pretty well

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.519
it's a good magnetic putty I think the natural step at this point is

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.700
to make a lot more

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.550
magnetic putty

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.650
We now have one big old blob of putty

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:37.070
This is a there's a lot of do right here. You just let it sit for a second. It just starts stretching yourself out

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.890
Slowly slowly stretching yourself out so

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.499
Now we want to try and turn this into this

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:57.439
And we're just gonna pour our powder on top of it all around it. My hands are gonna end up so black from this

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:04.219
See

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:05.959
I'm black already

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:12.999
We now have a pretty giant blob of our putty let's do a test and see how magnetic it is

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:18.459
That's it's definitely sticking

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:26.739
And of course this blob weighs way more than our magnet and so it doesn't just get lifted up into the air just

00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:28.729
sort of

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:33.518
Grabs at a portion of it, whatever's closest to it and stretches that out

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:38.588
Let's try watching our magnetic putty swallow some of our powerful magnets

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:14.899
I would definitely call this experimental success mixing the magnetite powder with silly putty not so much

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:18.259
It is magnetic, but it's too stiff to really react to the magnets

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.460
But using our homemade putty made from white glue and liquid starch

00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:28.579
We were able to make a perfect consistency of putty so that when we mix the magnetite powder into it it reacts

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.779
Really? Well with the magnet, I mean the magnet gets drawn onto it it sticks to it

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:36.708
It pulls the putty away from the blob and of course if we put the blob in the putty

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.950
It just gets swallowed and you can see this is in real time

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:45.349
I'm not speeding up this footage like the magnet just gets drawn down into this stuff really quickly

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:51.560
Of course, this is an extremely powerful magnet, but we have a lot of magnetic putty so it seemed fitting to me guys

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.690
