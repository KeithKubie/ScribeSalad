00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.380
I think by now we have a
reasonable sense of what

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.990
linear dependence means.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.240
So let's just do a slightly
more formal definition of

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.010
linear dependence.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.390
So we're going to say that a set
of vectors-- Let me just

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.800
define my set of vectors.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.230
Let me call my set s
of vectors, v1, v2,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.760
all the way to vn.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.845
I'm going to say that they
are linearly dependent.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.320
If and only if.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.950
So sometimes it's written if, if
with a lot of f's in there.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.410
So sometimes it's written
if and only if.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.570
Sometimes it's shown like an
arrow in two directions.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.290
If and only if I can satisfy
this equation, I can find a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.250
set of constants c1 times v1.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.750
I can take a linear combination
of my vectors all

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.260
the way to cn vn, that satisfy
the equation that I can create

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.070
this into the 0 vector.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.760
Sometimes it's just written as
a bold 0, and sometimes you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.300
could just write it -- I
mean we don't know the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.100
dimensionality of this vector.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.610
It would be a bunch of 0's.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.040
We don't know how many actual
elements are in each of these

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.280
vectors, but you get the idea.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.770
My set of vectors is linearly
dependent-- remember I'm

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.030
saying dependent, not
independent --is linearly

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.010
dependant, if and only if I can
satisfy this equation for

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:51.335
some ci's where not all of
them are equal to 0.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.650
This is key, not all are 0.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.990
Or you could say it
the other way.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.465
You could say at least
one is non-zero.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.010
So how does this gel with what
we were talking about in the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.300
previous video where I said
look, a set is linearly

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.730
dependent if one of the of
vectors can be represented by

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.690
the combination of the
other vectors?

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.800
Let me write that down.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:35.320
In the last few I said, look,
one vector can be -- Let me

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.220
write it this way.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.330
One vector being represented
by the some of the other

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.050
vectors, I can just write
it like this.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.160
I can write it a little
bit more math-y.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.380
In the last video, I said that
linear dependence means that--

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.280
let me just pick an arbitrary
vector, v1.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.480
Let's say that v1, you know
this is arbitrary, v1 one

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.490
could be represented
by some combination

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.570
of the other vectors.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.070
Let me call them a1 times v --
let me be careful -- a2 times

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.170
v2 plus a3 times v3 plus all
the way up to an times vn.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.980
This is what we said in
the previous video.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.860
If this is linear dependence,
any one of these guys can be

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.930
represented as some combination
of the other ones.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.980
So how does this imply that?

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.790
In order show this if and only
if, I have to show that this

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.410
implies that and I have to show
that that implies this.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.870
So this is almost a trivially
easy proof.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.340
Because if I subtract v1 from
both sides of this equation I

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:49.320
get 0 is equal to minus 1 v1
plus a2 v2 plus a3 v3 all the

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.730
way to an vn.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.930
And clearly I've just
said, well,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.670
this is linearly dependent.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.160
That means that I can represent
this vector as a sum

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.510
of the other vectors, which
means that minus 1 times v1

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.770
plus some combination of the
other vectors is equal to 0,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.850
which means that I've been able
to satisfy this equation,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.960
and at least one of my constants
is non-zero.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.160
So I've shown you that, if I
can represent one of the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.440
vectors by a sum of the other
ones, then this condition is

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.160
definitely going to be true.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.380
Now let me go the other way.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.810
Let me show you if I have this
situation that I can

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.110
definitely represent one
of the vectors as

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.890
the sum of the others.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.730
So let's say that
this is true.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.190
And one of these constants,
remember it's not just this,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.370
it's at least one,
is non-zero.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.860
So let me just assume, just for
the sake of simplicity-- I

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.790
mean these are all arbitrary.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.270
I'll do it in a new color.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.610
Let me do it in the magenta.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.090
Let me assume that c1
is not equal to 0.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.370
If c1 is not equal to 0, then
I can divide both sides of

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.180
this equation by c1.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.240
And what do I get?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:19.860
I get v1 plus c2 over c1 v2 plus
all the way up to cn over

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.420
c1 is equal to 0.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.350
And then I can multiply both
sides of this, or I could add

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.510
negative v1 to both sides of
this equation or subtract v1

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.290
from both sides.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:41.290
And I get c2 over c1 v2 plus all
the way up to cn over c1

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.890
vn-- there's a vn here --is
equal to minus v1.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.400
Now if I just multiply both
sides of this by negative 1, I

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.200
get a minus, and all these
become minuses and this

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.480
becomes a plus.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.090
And I just showed you that
if at least one of these

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.160
constants is non-zero, that I
can represent my vector v1 as

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.920
some combination of
the other vectors.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.920
So we're able to go
this way too.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.200
If this condition is true, then
I can represent one of

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.040
the vectors as a combination
of the others.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.590
If I can represent one of those
vectors as a combination

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.360
of the others, then this
condition is true.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.710
Hopefully that kind of proves
that these two definitions are

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.240
equivalent.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.930
Maybe it's a little
bit of overkill.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.260
Let's apply that definition
now, to actually test. You

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.690
might say, hey Sal, why'd you go
through all of this effort?

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.180
I went through all of this
effort because this is

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.770
actually a really useful way
to test whether things are

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.460
linearly independent
or dependent.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.250
Let's try it out.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.170
Let's use our newly
found tool.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.520
Let's say I have the
set of vectors--

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.460
Let me do it up here.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.980
I want to be efficient
with my space usage.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:59.450
So let's say I have the set
of vectors 2,1 and 3,2.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.470
And my question to you is, are
these linearly independent or

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.270
are they linearly dependent?

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.440
In order for them to be linearly
dependent, that means

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.600
that if some constant times 2,1
plus some other constant

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.090
times this second vector,
3,2 where this

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.250
should be equal to 0.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.450
Where these both aren't
necessarily 0.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.570
Before I go up for this problem,
let's remember what

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.210
we're going to find out.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:38.790
If either of these are non-zero,
if c1 or c2 are

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:44.630
non-zero, then this implies
that we are dealing with a

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.380
dependent, linearly
dependent set.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:58.430
If c1 and c2 are both 0, if the
only way to satisfy this

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.060
equation -- I mean you can
always satisfy it by sitting

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.680
everything equal to 0.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.520
But if the only way to satisfy
it is by making both of these

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.830
guys 0, then we're
dealing with a

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.570
linearly independent set.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.110
Let's try to do some math.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.280
And this'll just take us back
to our Algebra 1 days.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.880
In order for this to be true,
that means 2 times c1 plus 3

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.870
times c2 is equal to -- when I
say this is equal to 0, it's

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.980
really the 0 vector.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.669
I can rewrite this as 0,0.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.120
So 2 times c1 plus 3
times c2 would be

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.159
equal to that 0 there.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:46.480
And then we'd have 1 times
c1 plus 2 times c2 is

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.730
equal to that 0.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.870
And now this is just a system,
two equations, two unknowns.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.420
A couple of things
we could do.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:02.340
Let's just multiply this
top equation by 1/2.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:12.170
If you multiply it by 1/2 you
get c1 plus 3/2 plus 3/2 c2 is

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.200
equal to 0.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.460
And then if we subtract the
green equation from the red

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.410
equation this becomes 0.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:25.290
2 minus 1 and 1/2-- 3/2 is 1 and
1/2 --of this is just 1/2

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.960
c2 is equal to 0.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.390
And this is easy to solve.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.090
c2 is equal to 0.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.770
So what's c1?

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.350
Well, just substitute this back
in. c2 is equal to 0.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.270
So this is equal to 0.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.720
So c1 plus 0 is equal to 0.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.940
So c1 is also equal to 0.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.190
We could have substituted
it back into that

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.440
top equation as well.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.320
So the only solution to this
equation involves both c1 and

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.610
c2 being equal to 0.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.680
So they both have to be 0.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:04.110
So this is a linearly
independent set of vectors.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.790
Which means that neither
of them are redundant

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.480
of the other one.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.600
You can't represent one as a
combination of the other.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.550
And since we have two vectors
here, and they're linearly

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.790
independent, we can actually
know that this will span r2.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.910
The span of my r vectors
is equal to r2.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.290
If one of these vectors was
just some multiple of the

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.610
other, than the span would have
been some line within r2,

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.260
not all of.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.400
But now I can represent any
vector in r2 as some

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.910
combination of those.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.300
Let's do another example.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:46.170
Let me scroll to the right,
because sometimes this thing,

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.060
when I go too far down, I
haven't figured out why, when

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.920
I go too far down it
starts messing up.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.480
So my next example is
the set of vectors.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.110
So I have the vector 2,1.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.520
I have the vector 3,2.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.490
And I have the vector 1,2.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.690
And I want to know are these
linearly dependent or linearly

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.440
independent.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.800
So I go to through
the same drill.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.890
I use that little theorem that
I proved at the beginning of

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.090
this video.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:24.710
In order for them to be linearly
dependent there must

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.840
be some set of weights that
I can multiply these guys.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:37.100
So c1 times this vector plus c2
times this vector plus c3

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:43.060
times that vector, that will
equal the 0 vector.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.690
And if one of these is non-zero
then we're dealing

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.390
with a linearly dependent
set of vectors.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.790
And if all of them are 0,
then it's independent.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.445
Let's just do our
linear algebra.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:10.520
So this means that 2 times c1
plus 3 times c2 plus c3 is

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.280
equal to that 0 up there.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.280
And then if we do the bottom
rows-- Remember when you

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.270
multiply a scalar times a vector
you multiply it by each

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.880
of these terms. So c1 times 1.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:29.200
1c1 plus 2c2 plus 2c3
is equal to 0.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.350
There's a couple of giveaways
on this problem.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.570
If you have three
two-dimensional vectors, one

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.070
of them is going to
be redundant.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.650
Because, in the very best case,
even if you assume that

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.540
that vector and that vector are
linearly independent, then

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.740
these would span r2.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.270
Which means that any point,
any vector, in your

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.250
two-dimensional space can
be represented by some

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.140
combination of those two.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.280
In which case, this is going to
be one of them because this

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.935
is just a vector in
two-dimensional space.

00:12:57.935 --> 00:12:59.940
So it would be linearly
dependent.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.890
And then, if you say, well,
these aren't linearly

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:07.030
independent then, they're just
multiples of each other.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.900
In which case, this would
definitely be a linearly

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.450
dependent set.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.290
When you see three vectors that
are each only vectors in

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.910
r2, that are each
two-dimensional vectors, it's

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.580
a complete giveaway that this
is linearly dependent.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.460
But I'm going to show it to you
using our dependent, using

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.560
our little theorem here.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.940
So I'm going to show you that I
can get non-zero c3's, c2's,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.270
and c1's such that I
can get a 0 here.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.000
If all of these had to be 0-- I
mean you can always set them

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.440
equal to 0.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.580
But if they had to be equal to
0, then it would be linearly

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.190
independent.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.220
Let me just show you.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.290
I can just pick some
random c3.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.420
Let me pick c3 to be equal
to negative 1.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.610
So what would these two
equations reduce to?

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.920
I mean you have just three
unknowns and two equations, it

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.050
means you don't have enough
constraints on your system.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.640
So if I just set c3-- I just
pick that out of a hat.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.290
I could have picked
c3 to be anything.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.460
But if I set c3 to be equal to
negative 1, what do these

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.230
equations become?

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:12.790
You get 2c1 plus 3c2 minus
1 is equal to 0.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:19.560
And you get c1 plus 2c2
minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:19.830
Right?

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.780
2 times minus 1.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.010
What can I do here?

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:28.950
If I multiply this second
equation by 2, what do I get?

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:37.360
I get 2 plus 4c2 minus
4 is equal to 0.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.580
And now let's subtract this
equation from that equation.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.600
So the c1's cancel out.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.960
3c2 minus 4c2 is minus c2.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.840
And then minus 1 minus minus 4,
so that's minus 1 plus 4.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.620
That's plus 3 is equal to 0.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.860
And so we get our -- Let me make
sure I got that right.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.190
We have a minus 1
minus a minus 4.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.150
So plus 4.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.170
So we have a plus 3.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.410
So that is a minus 2.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:28.225
So minus c2 is equal to minus
3 or c2 is equal to 3.

00:15:28.225 --> 00:15:32.480
And if c2 is equal to 3 and c3
is equal to minus 1-- Let's

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.510
just substitute here, so we
get c1 plus 2 times c2, so

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.760
plus 6, plus 2 times c3.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.980
So minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.830
c1 plus 4 is equal to 0.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.310
c1 is equal to minus 4.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.720
I'm giving you a combination
of c's that

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.210
will give us a 0 vector.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:03.920
If I multiply minus 4 times our
first vector, 2,1, that's

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:13.150
c1, plus 3 times our second
vector, 3,2 minus 1 times our

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.720
third vector, 1,2 this
should be equal to 0.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.510
Let's verify it just for fun.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:24.660
Minus 4 times 2 is minus
8 plus 9 minus 1.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.590
Yeah, that's minus 9 plus 9.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.490
That's 0.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:36.010
Minus 4 times plus 6 minus
2 that's also 0.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.370
So we've just shown a linear
combination of these vectors,

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.820
where actually none of
the constants are 0.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.840
But all we had to show was
that at least one of the

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.680
constants had to be non-zero,
and we actually showed all

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.690
three of them were.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.850
But at least one of these
had to be non-zero.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.100
And I was able to satisfy this
equation, I was able to make

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.560
them into the zero vector.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:02.460
So this shows, this proves,
that this is a linearly

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.520
dependent set of vectors.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.450
Which means one of the
vectors is redundant.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.520
And you can never just say,
oh, this is the redundant

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.410
vector, because I can represent
this as combination

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.170
of those two.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.589
You could just as easily pick
this guy as the redundant

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.960
vector, and say, hey, I can
represent this guy as the sum

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.609
of those two.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:23.380
There's not one bad apple
in the bunch.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.640
Any of them can be represented
by the combination of some

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.580
other, by all of the
rest of them.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.180
So hopefully you have a better
intuition of linear dependence

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.780
and independence.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.580
Maybe I'll continue.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.400
I'll do a few more examples
in the next video.
