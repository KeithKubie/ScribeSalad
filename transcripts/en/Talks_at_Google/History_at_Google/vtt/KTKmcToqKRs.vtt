00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.892
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:08.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.330
FRED TURNER: Thanks, guys.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.150
Great to see you here.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.860
Thank you for coming out.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.840
Appreciate it, especially
on a beautiful day.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.340
You could be out
walking the campus.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.390
It's great to have you here.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.400
I'm really excited to be
here, partly because I think

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
we're standing or sitting in
a place that has a history

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.040
that we tend not to know.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.350
And that's the history I
want to bring you today.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.870
I'm going to make a case that
goes through three points.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.370
Probably speak for
about 40 minutes.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.578
If you have questions of
fact as I move through that,

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:37.572
please jump right in.

00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:39.280
For more conceptual
stuff, maybe hold it.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.320
We'll have plenty
of time for Q&amp;A.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.820
And I want to start with
the problem of Facebook.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.300
Not as competition, but
as a historical problem.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.940
Where did this strange
form of sociability,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.910
architecture-enabled
sociability come from?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.120
And where did the hope that by
using these digital systems,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.910
we might become more
individuated, more expressive,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.384
more collaborative begin?

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:05.800
To answer that
question, I'm going

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.000
to turn back to World War II
and the birth of a media form

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.430
that I've ended up calling
the democratic surround.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.500
And it's a funny time.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.640
In a nutshell, World War II,
terrible fear that mass media,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.460
one-to-many media--
television, film, newspapers,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.660
and the like--

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.195
actually turn us into fascists.

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:27.320
And there's different ways
people think it happens,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.096
but they really
think it happens.

00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:31.720
And so the question at the start
of World War II for Americans,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.150
in government, in
law, in journalism

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.170
is, how can we do propaganda
in a way that will not make

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.650
our citizens authoritarians?

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.280
It turns out that
one of the answers

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.920
is creating multiple media.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.070
You begin to imagine a
world of multiple images,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.490
multiple sounds,
surrounding individuals who

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.310
are then presumed to be free.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.590
My argument will be that that
turn during World War II shaped

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.690
the '60s, shaped the
multimedia, especially

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.420
the psychedelic
multimedia of the 1960s.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.699
And brought us ultimately,
the social media of today.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.762
There's a big jump from
the '60s to social media.

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:12.720
That's the subject from
another book I've done,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.260
but we'll go there anyways.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.820
So that's where
we're headed today.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.370
So let's start with Facebook.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.955
So Facebook is many things.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:25.330
And in this room, I don't need
to get into the technology

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.320
of it at all.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.460
But in some ways, Facebook is
a vision of a particular style

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.870
of sociability.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.940
It's technology-enabled.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.170
It's individualistic.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.730
You speak often
as an individual.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.104
You can do things
collaboratively

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:38.980
and collectively.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.580
But it's a kind of tool-enabled,
expressive individualism.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.610
And in many ways,
the sort of building

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.170
of a platform world
in which we could

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.300
act independently
and individually

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.700
was meant to help us be free.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.250
When I came into academia
about 15 years ago,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.250
I was told that what you need
to do to have a democracy

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.720
is you need to
decentralize media.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.944
And a lot of the folks who
founded Facebook and Google

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:06.110
very much saw themselves,
I think in the early days,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.870
as building decentralized
media forms that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.210
were ultimately pro-democratic.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.720
I would argue that the
rise of Donald Trump

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.990
gives the lie to the sense
that decentralized media always

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.480
need to produce democratic,
anti-authoritarian techniques.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.300
But we'll come back
to that in a moment.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.240
Suffice to say that
Facebook represents

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.590
a world of multi-screen
sociability,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.480
individual,
expressive-enabled style.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.265
It's both commercial
and personal.

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.640
And it's controlled
and managed--

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.920
and this is the central
point, especially here,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.440
through processes of
aggregation, nudging,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.840
and architecture.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.760
It's a space that's
managed through design.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.470
And you all know this
better than most,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.960
it's not a space where
people negotiate contracts

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.550
with each interaction.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.230
On the contrary,
they use a tool.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.980
They do something.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.380
They do something together,
something else happens.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.600
And that interaction is
structured architecturally.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.100
The question I want
to address today

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.900
is, how did we get
to a place where

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.300
that architectural
management of individuals

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.890
was perceived as a
pro-democratic operation?

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.760
A little bit of background.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.890
So I've been an academic
for about 15 years.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.279
I was a journalist beforehand,
as Dave pointed out.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.400
And in that time, I've been
tracking the integration

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.430
of computing and computing
technology, computing culture,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.770
engineering culture
into American culture

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.380
more broadly after World War II.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.420
I am a perverse
creature in many ways.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.720
But in one in particular.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.917
I'm kind of an
engineering fanboy.

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:38.250
I know it's an odd thing, right?

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.640
But I am a scholar who
is not an engineer,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.980
but who studies engineers.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.250
And who thinks
they are ultimately

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.750
the agents of
cultural change that

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.124
are among the most important
in our particular historical

00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:50.624
moment.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.207
And so that's what
I've been studying.

00:04:52.207 --> 00:04:53.720
I've been studying
different visions

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.216
of engineering, different
visions of engineering culture.

00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:58.340
I started with this book
here, "From Counterculture

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.440
to Cyberculture," which
is a book about Stewart

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.970
Brand and the "Whole
Earth Catalog"

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.890
and a group of
countercultural figures

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.290
who really shaped what we
thought the internet would be.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.150
They brought us some of the
following terms-- virtual

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.230
community, electronic frontier.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.800
You'll know John Perry
Barlow just died.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.220
And my personal favorite,
personal computer.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.260
So I wrote that book.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.180
And I was here at Stanford.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.620
And you know, when
I wrote that book,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.730
I was told that the 1960s were
a revolution against everything

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.070
connected to the
1940s and the '50s.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.410
The '40s and the '50s
were black and white,

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.040
Cold War, locked down, very much
a kind of containment culture.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.870
And what I found when
I went to interview

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.150
these folks from the '60s
was that on the contrary.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.120
They were reading
all this literature

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.490
from the '40s and '50s.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.850
They were reading Margaret Mead.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.190
They were reading Erich Fromm.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.400
They were reading psychologists.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.570
They were reading engineers.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.150
They were reading
Norbert Wiener.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.740
And the question I had was, why?

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.080
And so I went back in
time, and I wrote a prequel

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.720
to that book called "The
Democratic Surround."

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.460
And that's the book I'll
be talking about today.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.822
All right, back to the past.

00:06:09.822 --> 00:06:14.810
Welcome to 1938, a
time of great fear.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.540
No one here was alive in '38,
but I've spent a lot of time

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.560
back in that timeframe.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.490
And at the start of World War
II, Americans faced a problem.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.100
We looked across the ocean,
and we looked at Germany.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.820
Germany was, we thought, the
most cultured nation in Europe.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.990
They brought us Beethoven.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.120
They brought us Gerta, the poet.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.760
They brought us all kinds
of great engineering.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.000
How was it that
they had fallen head

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.700
over heels for this crazy,
short, mustachioed dictator,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.620
Adolf Hitler?

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.250
How did that happen?

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.750
OK.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.497
So nobody really knows.

00:06:47.497 --> 00:06:49.080
Today, we might say
it's because there

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.380
was all this chaos in Weimar,
Germany after World War I.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.230
But at the time,
most Americans--

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.230
intellectuals, journalists,
folks in Roosevelt's circle

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.800
said, nope.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.610
You know what it?

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.510
It was the mass media.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.100
Mass media.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:09.360
Radio, film, the newspaper,
literally turned Germany

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.940
into an authoritarian nation.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.440
There were two theories
about how it happened.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.680
One, which is one of my
special favorites, is--

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.800
this is the picture of Hermann
Goring designed to show it.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.792
Was that Nazi leadership
was actually crazy.

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:26.250
So there are people who actually
thought, the Nazi leaders,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.560
they're all just actually
clinically insane.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.420
And something about
mass media has

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.050
let them transmit their
madness into our minds.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.100
OK, fine.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.270
That's one theory.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.490
Now remember, this is
only 15 years after Freud

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.387
has come to America.

00:07:39.387 --> 00:07:41.220
So there's a sort of--
suddenly, everybody's

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.817
interested in the unconscious.

00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:44.400
And everybody is
thinking, well, we've

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.260
got this unconscious space,
which they tended to think

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.843
was down here.

00:07:46.843 --> 00:07:47.940
I don't know why.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.070
But the unconscious is
somewhere down in here.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.220
And somehow, media
moved past your brain

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.320
and invoke your unconscious.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.220
This takes us to
the second theory.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.630
The second theory is that media
themselves are so powerful,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.377
just in themselves that they--

00:08:03.377 --> 00:08:05.460
by virtue of the fact that
they are what they are,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.340
turn off your reason.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.790
You can't think when
your mind is on media.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.969
That's the theory.

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:11.760
And when you can't
think, you can't reason.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.800
You can't defend
yourself with reason.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.900
And so you become
prey to a series

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.090
of desires coming
from your unconscious

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.449
to be attached to a leader.

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:21.240
And I thought you might
enjoy this picture.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.660
This is from a poster from 1937.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.610
It's meant to show how radio
is reaching even the smallest

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.460
houses in the farthest
plains of America.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.590
But you can see by the
thickness of these arrows,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.260
they look a little bit more
like bombers coming in.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.450
Like, radio is going
to bomb the prairie.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.669
And there's a fear
of these media.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.950
This is how bad the fear got.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.500
Here's Franklin Roosevelt.
Give you a little context.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.000
If you run with
American historians,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.360
as I do, and you say to
an American historian

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.150
of the 20th century, what's
the most important thing that

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.640
happened in the 20th century?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.070
They get kind of misty-eyed
and they say, Roosevelt.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.760
They do.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.780
They really do.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.550
And imagine my surprise when I
went back and started reading

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.060
magazines from this period and
saw Franklin Roosevelt referred

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.450
to as the fourth fascist.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.842
This is "The Saturday
Evening Post," right?

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.800
Franklin Roosevelt was
the father of democracy,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.930
at least in the 20th century.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.471
Why was he called
the fourth fascist?

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:19.740
Well, he was called that
alongside Tojo, Hitler,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.060
and Mussolini.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.040
Because people feared that
through his fireside chats,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.970
he was finding a way to use mass
media to emotionally manipulate

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.940
American audiences into
believing that they, too,

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.361
should centralize the state.

00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:37.110
Remember, this is the
era when he's trying

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.270
to rebuild the American state.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.728
They thought he
was trying to build

00:09:39.728 --> 00:09:42.390
a centralized American
state around an American

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.939
dictatorial-style leader.

00:09:43.939 --> 00:09:45.480
And they were terribly
afraid that he

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.160
was able to take
his personality,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.030
move it through the media, and
convince people to follow him.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:57.540
And at that time, the fear of
fascism wasn't unreasonable.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.440
We forget this.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.840
I knew nothing of this until
I started doing this book.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.820
1939, Madison Square
Garden, 22,000 Americans

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.410
rallied for fascism.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.250
For fascism.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.840
They rallied under
a banner that said

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.820
"stop Jewish domination
of Christian America."

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.220
1939, after Hitler
went into Poland,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.170
after Hitler
marched into Poland,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.280
1,000 Americans marched
down East 86th Street

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.460
in brown shirts of their own
making, faux-Nazi uniforms,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.910
carrying swastika flags and
American flags together.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.760
Crowds gathered and
watched and did not boo.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.750
They were not booed.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.600
Simply astonishing.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.310
I just couldn't believe this.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.810
OK.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.130
So Humphrey Bogart.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.180
Everybody here has seen
Humphrey Bogart movies?

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.370
OK.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.700
I'm sorry, this is the
audience interaction part

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.940
of our event today.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.440
OK.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.330
So tell me the name of a
Humphrey Bogart movie you know?

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.140
AUDIENCE: "Casablanca."

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:48.700
FRED TURNER: "Casablanca."

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.453
Good.

00:10:49.453 --> 00:10:50.280
AUDIENCE: "Maltese Falcon."

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.870
FRED TURNER: "Maltese Falcon."

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.440
Keep going.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.620
Pardon?

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.391
You can use your
phone if you have to.

00:10:59.391 --> 00:10:59.890
All right.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:00.931
Well, that's pretty good.

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:01.900
"Maltese Falcon."

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.684
"Key Largo."

00:11:02.684 --> 00:11:03.600
Was is it, "Key West?"

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.100
I forget.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.135
It's "Key Largo."

00:11:05.135 --> 00:11:06.760
I'm guessing that
none of you have ever

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.767
heard of a movie called
"The Black Legion."

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:09.850
I had never heard of this.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.110
I had insomnia one night.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.010
I woke up in the
middle of the night

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.218
and I'm watching this movie
called "The Black Legion"

00:11:14.218 --> 00:11:18.880
where Humphrey Bogart is a
black-shirted American fascist

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.640
who kills his Polish neighbor
because his Polish neighbor has

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.290
taken his job.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.230
This is 1937 in America.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.115
That's a very
popular movie in '37.

00:11:28.115 --> 00:11:28.990
And it's interesting.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.730
We never talk about
it now, but there

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.529
was a terrible fear
in the late '30s

00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:33.820
that fascism could happen here.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.860
If it had happened in
Germany, it could happen here.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.484
You can even see here
in the late '30s,

00:11:37.484 --> 00:11:39.880
these are British fascists
giving the fascist salute

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.380
in the late '30s in England.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.470
My point is that fascism is
a viable option in the United

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.790
States in that period.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.950
We tend not to remember it.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.640
And this poses a very
serious challenge

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.190
for American intellectuals
and government officials.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.250
How is it that we're
going to be able to make

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.510
a unified America that can fight
against fascism without turning

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.150
our citizens into
authoritarians?

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.650
What kind of media
can we design?

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.031
And what kind of personality
should they have?

00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:07.530
OK.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.341
We have to have one brief,
very deeply academic digression

00:12:10.341 --> 00:12:10.840
here.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.760
Bear with me.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.420
OK.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.970
So dominant idea in
this period comes

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.141
from something called culture
and personality anthropology.

00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.640
This was a theory that dominated
early 20th century American

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.570
anthropology, that every culture
had its own natural personality

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.980
style.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.050
And that your family
raised you into that style.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.380
So an effective family helped
you adjust your personality,

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.990
whatever it was, to the
personality of your culture,

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.420
such that you were able
to move easily within it.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.679
Media continued that work
once you left the family.

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.220
So one of the theories
running around

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.710
about how Germany
became authoritarian

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.590
was that there was a kind
of authoritarian personality

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.320
style in German culture
that matched up very

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.170
nicely to the way that
mass media worked.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.270
The question then
became in America,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.950
what is an American
personality style?

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.200
What is a democratic
personality style?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.870
And how can we create a
medium that will produce one?

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.790
So inside Roosevelt's
circle, there's

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.469
a group of folks who
say that doesn't matter.

00:13:13.469 --> 00:13:15.010
We need to do what
Goebbels is doing,

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.690
Hitler's propaganda minister.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.110
We need to go ahead, turn our
citizens into authoritarians,

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.160
call it a day.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.809
We'll deprogram them later.

00:13:23.809 --> 00:13:26.350
There's another group though,
led by Margaret Mead and an art

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.380
historian named Arthur Upham
Pope, and Gregory Bateson,

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.720
social scientists of the
mid-century, who say,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.470
no, wait a minute.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.594
That's actually disastrous.

00:13:33.594 --> 00:13:34.420
We can't do that.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.130
We cannot turn our
people into Germans.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.510
We have to be Americans.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.900
And we have to have found
a way of being together

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.690
around a democratic
mode of being.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.090
We have to think about what
a democratic personality is,

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.160
an American
personality, and we need

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.170
to build a medium that will help
people be unified in that idea.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.130
This is Gordon Allport.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.250
He's a member of the Committee
for National Morale charged

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.210
with doing this.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.585
The Committee for
National Morale

00:13:59.585 --> 00:14:01.550
is a group of 60 American
social scientists

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.550
who are advisors to
Roosevelt. They write books.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.780
They're very visible.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.670
He writes this
funny essay in 1942

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.600
called "The Nature of
Democratic Morale."

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.420
It's remarkably prescient.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.136
There are two words that I
want to flag for you here.

00:14:13.136 --> 00:14:15.490
The first word is "personality."

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.310
In this period, it
is the personality

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.500
that is the center of
resistance to fascism.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.420
Something about
your inner psyche

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.190
is the way that you're
going to resist fascism.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.590
The other word here
that's really important

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.090
is "coordination."

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.380
Fascism with a top-down,
bureaucratic, one-to-many way

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.820
of living and being.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.680
A democratic mode
of organizing would

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.600
have to be nonhierarchical.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.200
It would have to
be collaborative.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.530
It would have to be a
coordination mechanism.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.320
I hope you're beginning to
hear the word "Facebook."

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.960
Because this is where the
dream of a kind of coordination

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.690
mechanism for free
individuals is born.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.380
It's right here.

00:14:59.911 --> 00:15:00.410
All right.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.909
So good news and bad news.

00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:06.200
The good news is that the
Committee for National Morale

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.130
wants to save America.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.740
The bad news is they don't
know how to make media.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.270
They're just
sociologists, mostly.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.620
They really have no clue.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.350
Lucky for them, they're
in New York at a moment

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:20.030
when a group of Bauhaus artist
refugees have just arrived.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.940
And these guys know how
to make media like crazy.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.200
One of them is Herbert Bayer.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.670
Do any of you work with
type design here at Google?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.250
OK.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.900
If you're a type
designer here, you

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.700
are working with
Herbert Bayer's tools.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.190
Herbert Bayer developed
an all-lowercase typeface

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.100
that is frequently used
at Google, actually.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.260
Another thing that he
did was he developed

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.460
an exhibition style called the
360 degree field of vision.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.819
All right.

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:47.610
Totally wacky to be
thinking about politics

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.000
in terms of exhibition
design, but really important.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.640
When he develops this in
the mid-'30s, almost every

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.610
exhibition you go to
has a single picture.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.300
You look at it.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.290
You move along.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.780
Single picture,
eye-level, move along.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.360
Single picture,
eye-level, move along.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.310
What he says is no.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.420
That's hierarchical.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.860
That's domineering.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.740
What we need is to surround
people with images,

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.900
surround them with
sounds, and let

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.880
them choose the
images and sounds that

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.940
are most meaningful to them
and stitch them together

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.070
into their own personality.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.290
Only through this
process of integrating

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:26.877
multiple information sources
can people be free and whole.

00:16:26.877 --> 00:16:29.210
Again, this is starting to
sound a little bit like Larry

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.780
and Sergey in the
early days, I hope.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.080
Just a little bit.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.300
That integration piece.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.920
In Germany, before
he comes over,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.050
this is to help people
resist the pressures

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.640
of industrialization.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.400
When he comes to the US,
he desperately needs work.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.660
He says, oh, this is how you
make a democratic character.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.460
And almost immediately,
he's designing

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.320
propaganda environments.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.150
This is the first one.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.370
1942, this is a
museum exhibition

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.650
at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.920
And it is meant to be a
surround, a space in which

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.660
people walk through and see
giant images, small images,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.500
and integrate those images
into their own imaginations.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.430
A couple of things
about this space.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.460
To our own eyes, it might
look not very original.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.890
Big picture, small
pictures, no big deal.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.750
In the time that it was
made, that's a very big deal.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.140
Museums didn't do this.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.510
Second thing that's
important is we can clearly

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.270
see the manipulative
propagandistic intent.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.130
This is Pearl Harbor.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.020
This is a farmer.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.290
It says war.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.180
They asked for it.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.770
Now, by the living
God, they'll get it.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.460
Here is Tojo giggling
in the bottom.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.140
To an America that's
just been attacked,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.700
this is pretty straight-up
propagandistic.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.158
If you stand in
this corner, you're

00:17:43.158 --> 00:17:44.875
going to get pretty furious.

00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:46.500
But people didn't
perceive it that way.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.230
They didn't perceive that
they were domineered.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.350
On the contrary, they
really enjoyed the sense

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.500
that they could walk through the
exhibition at their own pace,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.750
making sense of it in the
ways that they wanted to.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.140
And I want to read you what
some of the reviewers said.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.681
Here's the guy from
"New York Times."

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:05.580
He says, "I think that no
one can see this exhibition

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.910
without feeling that he is a
part of the power of America.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.340
It is this inescapable
sense of identity.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.650
The individual spectator
identifying himself

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.900
with the whole that makes
the event so moving."

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.540
My favorite is a reviewer
from Springfield, Illinois.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.430
She says, "Road to
Victory does not

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.430
mold the visitors'
opinions, for that word

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.870
smacks of the fascist concept
of dominating men's minds."

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.990
The key point here is
that this exhibition

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.350
marries the search for
a democratic personality

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.560
to a design for
multi-image environments.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.060
That combination
is what I'm calling

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.890
the democratic surround.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.810
It's a combination
that informs how

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.830
we think about the design of
digital environments today.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.060
How did we get there?

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.380
Well, there are lots
of ways forward.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.310
And I won't take you
through all of them.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.110
But essentially,
this design feature,

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.830
this form that I've
just described,

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.000
moves from World War II
to the '60s in two ways.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.980
One, through a whole slew
of propaganda expositions

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.030
overseas that are
designed to change

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.760
the minds of our potential
allies or enemies.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.112
And the other through
a series of art worlds.

00:19:17.112 --> 00:19:19.070
This is what the propaganda
worlds looked like.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.153
This is the first of them.

00:19:20.153 --> 00:19:22.380
1956, Kabul, Afghanistan.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.830
That's a dome designed
by Buckminster Fuller.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:29.330
And inside, it's got
a whole slew of images

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.490
as well as of a mock TV
station, for whatever reason.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:32.990
OK.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.680
So here's this really
painful archival moment.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.380
So I'm at the United States
Information Agency Archives

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.296
in Maryland, near
Washington, DC.

00:19:42.296 --> 00:19:45.970
And I found a declassified
document about this program.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.700
It said, our job, as
information specialists,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.040
is to act like therapists.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.250
We need to first assess
the psychological condition

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.810
of foreign peoples, i.e.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.670
How democratic are they?

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.910
We then need to build a media
environment in which they

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.550
can experience
choice, collaboration

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.750
in a democratic mode.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.850
And then we need to test
to see if it worked.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.340
This is the environment.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.140
This is the test.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.420
It was early days.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.740
Afghan visitors were shown these
pictures as they left the dome

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.200
and asked, which one
characterized their response

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.370
to the dome most effectively?

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.152
Yeah, I know.

00:20:28.152 --> 00:20:29.360
This is kind of like, Really?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.990
I mean, I don't even
know what these mean.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.614
I got these images
from the guy who was

00:20:32.614 --> 00:20:33.960
in charge of the whole program.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.590
He showed me these pictures.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.756
I don't know what they mean.

00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:37.673
He doesn't know what
they mean either anymore.

00:20:37.673 --> 00:20:39.422
I think the one on the
left is meant to be

00:20:39.422 --> 00:20:40.650
sort of shock and surprise.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.240
The one on the right, ha-ha.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.440
I feel all warm.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.070
The middle one?

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.820
I don't know.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.730
It's almost stereotypes.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.020
OK.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.270
So that wasn't very
sophisticated, but this was.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:56.109
This was 1959, the American
National Exposition in Moscow.

00:20:56.109 --> 00:20:58.650
This is where the kitchen debate
between Khrushchev and Nixon

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.150
took place.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.450
It took place down
to the right there.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.070
And this is a gigantic
geodesic dome, glittering gold,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:08.950
created by Buckminster
Fuller with seven TV screens,

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.790
each showing a different
still image created

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.640
by Ray and Charles
Eames, the designers.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.590
This was meant to be
an environment that

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:21.144
showed Russians that we had a
diverse array of experiences.

00:21:21.144 --> 00:21:22.810
Russians were meant
to enter this space,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.210
see multiple images,
knit those images

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:28.320
into their own experience,
and to understand that America

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.200
was a place of choice.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.754
And it's kind of
funny, because--

00:21:33.754 --> 00:21:35.670
well, I'll tell you a
little more in a minute.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.400
This is what it looked like
when you entered that building.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.320
Those are the screens up above
showing images of America.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.220
A bit of the Family of Man
exhibition down to the right.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.050
And those are Soviet
citizens in the middle.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.900
What's intriguing
about this space

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.870
is that it wasn't just a
space for the persuasion

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.630
of Soviet citizens
to enjoy choice.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.360
It was also a place of
intensive monitoring.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.810
So this is a RAMAC
computer supplied by IBM

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.070
with a Russian translator.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.580
It was preprogrammed to answer
4,000 questions about America.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.430
To print out the answers
to 4,000 questions.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.930
The way that it was
supposed to work

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.780
was that the Soviet citizens
would go and ask the translator

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.710
a question.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.780
He would somehow key
it into the machine.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.430
The machine would
print out an answer,

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.857
and he would translate it back.

00:22:20.857 --> 00:22:23.190
The thing that the machine
did that I love best though--

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.470
I'm sure you can already
guess what it did.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.262
It recorded the questions.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:28.470
And this is really important.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.600
Because in this period,
America doesn't actually

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.700
know much about what the
Soviet Union is doing.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.110
We really don't know anyone.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.900
I was raised playing war
with my little soldiers.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.910
The soldiers were always
Russians and Americans.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.860
Very powerful.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.710
In addition to this
computer system,

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.460
there were 20
Russian-speaking translators

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.470
stationed around the space.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.644
They, too, were busy recording
the questions that they

00:22:51.644 --> 00:22:53.810
were asked and reporting
them back to their handlers

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.250
at the end of every day.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.160
Great records were kept of the
different American products

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.557
that were available
that people stole.

00:23:00.557 --> 00:23:02.390
They wanted to see which
things people stole

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.220
to see which things
they really wanted.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.100
I mean, this is the most
carefully-tracked exposition

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.300
ever created.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.790
It's a wonderful thing to
study because every document

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.450
connected to it is available.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.247
They took every
single press clipping

00:23:14.247 --> 00:23:15.830
from around the
Soviet Union in Europe

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.439
and collected it into a file.

00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:19.230
So for a guy like me,
this is manna, right?

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.510
This is just pure heaven.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.700
I can just show up
and there it all is.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.652
And it really was
an incredible thing.

00:23:24.652 --> 00:23:26.360
But the thing I want
to flag is that this

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.990
is an environment built out
of Herbert Bayer's designs

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.630
that they hope will allow
people to experience

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.590
democratic choice
under conditions

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.600
of pervasive surveillance.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.440
So that environmental model
also travels into the '60s

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.520
through the art world.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.540
This is John Cage.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.020
John Cage is a composer and a
pianist from the mid-century.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.700
He's often thought
to have been a sort

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.410
of psychedelic
countercultural figure.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.520
And he was.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.170
He was also a great patriot.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.210
I'll say more about
that in a moment.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.040
He's most famous for
a composition called

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.370
"4 minutes and 33 Seconds" in
which the following occurred.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:11.400
Guy goes to a piano, sits down
at the piano, and doesn't play.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.910
And in the not playing,
according to Cage,

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.130
allowed the audience to hear
the sounds that surrounded them

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.630
in the room.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:22.929
Cage was someone who actually
studied with the Bauhaus

00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:24.720
figures who brought us
the visual designs I

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.800
showed earlier.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.530
And he ended up teaching with
them at Chicago for a year.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.960
And when he did, he
absorbed their theories

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.610
of the semiotic surround.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.490
Their theories of surrounding
people with sounds.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:39.910
And he would go on to compose
pieces-- compose isn't

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.100
even quite the right word.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.715
He would go on to
challenge chords.

00:24:42.715 --> 00:24:44.600
Go on to challenge harmony.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.100
Say no, what we need
to do is help people

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.760
experience random sounds.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.270
One of the places that he
did that most effectively, it

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.740
was a place called
Black Mountain College.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.630
Black Mountain College
in the late '50s

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.390
was the home of the avant-garde
art world in America.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.430
And it was also the
home of democracy.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:06.640
I was really lucky.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.805
I found in the archives,
a summer class schedule

00:25:10.805 --> 00:25:13.830
from one of the students
in the 1952 summer session.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.120
Here's what they did.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.890
They had six teachers.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.340
Music with John Cage, dance
with Merce Cunningham,

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.140
who's over there on the right.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.630
Painting with Willem de Kooning.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.125
Architecture with
Buckminster Fuller.

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:28.000
Talk about a line-up.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.600
This is your weekly class
list, like unbelievable.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.670
In addition, they
were required to take

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.490
a course in culture and
personality anthropology

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.650
and the workings of
the United Nations.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.390
Weird combo, right?

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.380
The theory at the time was
that if we can surround people

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.530
with the arts and individual
creativity and encourage it,

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:51.070
and if we can help them build
new architectures to sustain

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.690
these new modes
of collaboration--

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.980
geodesic domes, performances.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.130
And if we can give them the
political theory of democracy

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.620
that we use at the
UN, they can literally

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.750
model first in their
own lives, and then

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.640
build a world that
looks that way.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.310
And so the summer of 1952,
Cage, Fuller, Cunningham,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.700
they gather together and
they stage what at the time

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.960
was called the First Happening.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.290
It's the wackiest event, right?

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.800
Nobody really knows
what happened.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.390
But something like this.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.130
A group of artists enter a room.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.450
There's a bunch of chairs.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.280
People sit down in the chairs.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.700
Somebody climbs a
ladder and reads a poem.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.590
A dog runs through the room.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.770
Somebody plays the piano.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.220
At the end, the artists all
get out teacups and put them

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.780
on the empty chairs.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.160
End of performance.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.860
It's like, OK.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.100
I first read that.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.830
I was like, why did they
think this was so important?

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.470
This seems kind of nuts.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.460
On what world is this important?

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.770
In retrospect, it
was hugely important.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.100
They were demonstrating in
their performance of the arts

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.880
that, in fact, you
could surround people

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.250
with visual images, strange
bits of performance,

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.700
fragments of experience, and
they could make sense of those

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.900
and become whole people.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.160
That idea traveled
directly into the 1960s

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.720
through John Cage's work.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.580
Cage went to New York
in the late '50s,

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.230
taught musical
composition to a series

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.200
of artists who went on to
build multi-image environments,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.760
multimedia environments
like this one.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.070
This is from the Us Company.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.360
It's a shrine.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.910
And you are meant
to enter it and have

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.640
the experience of being
united with people

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.750
around the globe in
your imagination.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.060
You are imagined to be all one.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.970
You are imagined to
share consciousness

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.020
with those folks who
are all around you.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.100
How many of you have
been to Burning Man?

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:48.630
Oh, my.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.540
There's a new generation at
Google today, isn't there?

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.121
That's interesting.

00:27:53.121 --> 00:27:53.620
OK.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.681
Pause for a riff.

00:27:54.681 --> 00:27:56.680
When I first came to
Google, the very first time

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.130
I came to these offices, I
went to building 42 or 43.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.950
I forget, whichever the main
check-in room was at the time.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.010
And the lobby was
entirely decorated

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.730
in images of Burning Man.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.730
Not so much anymore.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:11.550
Yeah, interesting.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.302
OK.

00:28:12.302 --> 00:28:14.260
So the burners have been
looking at this stuff.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.334
OK.

00:28:15.334 --> 00:28:16.500
And it's really interesting.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.240
It's a psychedelic
environment designed

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.448
to help you imagine yourself
as a new kind of person.

00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:21.780
Very technology-driven.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.390
Very much designed and meant
to be an expressive space.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:29.400
But also, something designed to
produce a new kind of person.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.300
It was called by journalists
at the time a "Be-In"

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.570
because you were meant to be in
the space and experience a new

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.180
way of being together.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.914
And this was the
poster for that event.

00:28:39.914 --> 00:28:42.330
What I want you to see is this
expression, we are all one.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.440
We are all one.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.030
We are all one.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.950
Very much a '60s thing.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.170
But also, very
much a '40s thing.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.780
Very much a kind of
we've won World War II,

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.130
universal humanist way
of looking at the world.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.020
This is what it could be.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.900
So if you look at the
'60s, you could say, wow,

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.510
what a happy ending to
the story of the '40s.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.220
We started with mass
media, fascism, hierarchy,

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.520
sort of rigid manipulation
of people through mass media.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.760
And now in the '60s, we end
up at something like the 1967

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.660
human Be-In in San Francisco,
where people paint their faces.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.130
They dance.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.420
Rock and roll bands play.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.620
Janis Joplin is there.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.730
Beat poets are there.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.290
It looks like a
great liberation.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.270
I should say, I'm famous
in my academic circles

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.070
for always ending on a downer.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.571
I'm going to try really hard
not to end on a downer today.

00:29:35.571 --> 00:29:36.070
All right.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.940
So on the one hand, if you think
about the democratic surround

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.790
as an alternative to mass
media, as an alternative

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.930
to top-down, authoritarian,
one-to-many media,

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.850
it looks pretty good.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.950
If you think about radio
as a kind of bombardment

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.777
for sending the same
message out to millions,

00:29:53.777 --> 00:29:54.610
here's the surround.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.610
This is the Family of
Man exhibition in 1955.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.415
And you can see that people are
free to move, free to aggregate

00:30:00.415 --> 00:30:02.135
as they want to.

00:30:02.135 --> 00:30:03.760
They can look at the
images that matter

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.718
to them, which will be
at all different heights

00:30:05.718 --> 00:30:06.992
and all different sizes.

00:30:06.992 --> 00:30:08.325
And they are free in that space.

00:30:11.872 --> 00:30:13.830
But I think we can also
see-- and this is right

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.910
to your point--

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.550
that this represents a
new mode of media power.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.940
It's a mode of media power
that we inhabit today.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.180
So the old mode
of media power was

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.750
imagined as mad political
leaders screaming down

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.700
through a single pipe being
heard by millions all at once.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.552
But when we look at the
Family of Man exhibition,

00:30:34.552 --> 00:30:36.760
we can see something that
the people who are visiting

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.260
the exhibition cannot.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.380
We can see the backstage.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.151
We can see that this environment
has been carefully arranged

00:30:44.151 --> 00:30:44.650
for them.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.450
It's been carefully
chosen for them.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:51.170
I dare say, it's a choice
architecture in a lot of ways.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.370
And there are people behind
the scenes building that choice

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.740
architecture, which
people may experience

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.900
as freeing and liberating.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.410
But which also offers
certain kinds of constraints.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.760
And this is where we are today.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.010
This is the hard thing.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.760
This is the 2010 consumer
electronics show in Las Vegas.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.570
And it's a precise imitation
of a later Herbert Bayer

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.160
environment.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.220
This aesthetic,
this form, this idea

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:23.030
that we can manage best
and free people most

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.690
by building architectures within
which they will make choices

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.150
from an array that
we have provided,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.780
that idea arises during
World War II as an effort

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.770
to defeat the forces of fascism
and the forces of mass media

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.590
that we thought at
the time were aligned.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.620
So we're beginning
to be in the present.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.730
And I just want to
say for a second

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.240
that we still have a problem.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.130
One problem is the
Orwell problem.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:52.580
The building a system to
constrain and contain.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.790
And you know, when people feel
free but don't act that way,

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.590
they can end up in
all kinds of trouble.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.923
There's another problem, though.

00:31:58.923 --> 00:32:00.860
It's the Trump problem.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.110
Whatever you think of
Donald Trump's policies,

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:06.440
you can see that he is
speaking in an idiom borrowed

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.140
from the happenings of
the '60s in a lot of ways.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.430
He's very emotional.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.510
He's very expressive.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:12.410
He's very free.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.290
He says whatever's on his mind.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.830
And the fact that we have
a distributed global media

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.570
system doesn't, in fact,
interfere with that.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.220
Because instead,
it sort of cycles

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.897
on to other media forms,
other media platforms.

00:32:26.897 --> 00:32:28.730
This is the challenge,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.810
We have transformed our
understanding of media power.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.014
We have, in many ways, left
the mess media world behind.

00:32:35.014 --> 00:32:36.430
I would argue that
we have not yet

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.980
figured out how
to make this world

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.770
work, which is why it's so
exciting to be speaking here

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.510
today.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.882
That's what I've got, and
I'll open it up to questions.

00:32:46.882 --> 00:32:47.590
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.370
If you guys wouldn't mind,
we have a mic in the back.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.161
FRED TURNER: Great.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.920
AUDIENCE: So advertising
is, of course, a hot topic

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.680
here in Silicon Valley.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.910
It pays all our
salaries in this room.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.760
How do these principles
apply to/differ

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.939
from modern advertising?

00:33:06.939 --> 00:33:08.480
FRED TURNER: Yeah,
great question OK.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.030
So the question is
really about advertising.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.280
Advertising is such an
interesting and tricky

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.560
business.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.610
I think in many ways, folks
have at different times

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.800
in the commercial
sector sought to build

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.650
advertising environments that
would serve as precisely choice

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.480
architectures.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.030
What's interesting about the
democratic surround piece

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.520
is that that choice
architecture was originally

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.730
a totally politicized
concept and only later became

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:37.140
a commercialized one.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.979
In the '40s and early
'50s, the people

00:33:38.979 --> 00:33:40.770
who were building these
environments really

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:43.854
saw them as not anti-commercial,
but not commercial.

00:33:43.854 --> 00:33:46.020
They were there to help
people appreciate difference

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.310
from one another.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.830
Over time, that
politics disappeared

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.300
and you ended up
in the late '50s

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.200
at Moscow in 1959 bringing
both this display mode

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.120
and all kinds of consumer goods.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.020
My own view on this--

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.050
I'll just speak my own view,
is that it's a very mixed bag.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.910
On the one hand, I get
frustrated in living

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.740
in a constantly
commercialized environment.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.760
It really frustrates me.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.159
I would like to be able
to leave that behind.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:12.610
On the other hand, I'm aware
that through those commercials,

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.699
I see not only an
array of products,

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:17.860
but an array of different
ways of living and being

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.219
that might not otherwise
be available to me.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.969
I guess the last thing,
I have to get back

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:24.790
to Orwell for just
a minute, right?

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.699
The scary thing is if you can do
the thing that I think you all

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:31.770
may be able to do to some
degree, which is predict

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.270
the desire of the consumer
before the consumer quite

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.210
has the desire, and offer
the product that triggers

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.090
the desire, then
we're entering a space

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.000
that's a little bit different
than what these folks imagined.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.060
And I'm starting to
be a little nervous.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:46.880
Does that help?

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.469
FRED TURNER: Sure,
you're welcome.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:49.570
I hope that's useful.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.810
I'm curious-- let me
ask you a question.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.602
Do you see yourselves
in this story at all,

00:34:58.602 --> 00:35:00.060
or does it feel
like something just

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.340
from a really different era?

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.990
I'm very curious.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.930
Yeah, go for it.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:04.790
AUDIENCE: I mean, this
definitely connects

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.685
with a lot of what we
think about in terms

00:35:06.685 --> 00:35:09.330
of ecosystem design.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.290
We're constantly
having conversations

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.119
about opt-in versus opt-out.

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:14.160
FRED TURNER: Interesting.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.010
Yeah.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.900
AUDIENCE: And the tracking
thing at like the Moscow Expo,

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.120
that reminds me a lot of
on online advertising,

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.699
you can track how often people
clicked or stuff like that.

00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:25.490
FRED TURNER: Right.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.830
AUDIENCE: It reminds me of
like an analog version of that.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:28.040
FRED TURNER: Yeah.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.640
I think it's very much an
analog version of that.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.210
And I actually think that on
the tracking side in particular,

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.877
there are digital people who are
going to design the computing

00:35:34.877 --> 00:35:36.710
systems that will
eventually become where we

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.350
are now who are at this event.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.320
And for them, I
think that tracking

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.750
and pro-democratic activity
are not seen as opposites.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.850
Orwell hasn't written yet.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:47.894
It's really like, no.

00:35:47.894 --> 00:35:49.060
We're just going to do this.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.022
It make sense.

00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:51.230
That that's very interesting.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.090
Part of my goal,
just as a historian,

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.790
is to try to provide
context to think

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.510
about things in the present.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.180
And no one has any time to
really read up on the past,

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:00.700
I get that.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.740
But it's also like,
this stuff is present.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.740
Other things that connect
or don't connect here?

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:06.573
I'd be very curious.

00:36:06.573 --> 00:36:07.240
Yeah, go for it.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.823
AUDIENCE: I'm an engineer here
at Google, so a former classics

00:36:09.823 --> 00:36:10.546
major.

00:36:10.546 --> 00:36:13.720
And I noticed you were throwing
around the word "democracy"

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.320
very frequently, as if
democracy was an artistic style.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.680
But that doesn't jive at
all with my understanding

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.850
of what the word means.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.690
FRED TURNER: Great.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.350
AUDIENCE: It's not
an artistic style.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:27.940
It's a way of making decisions.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.330
FRED TURNER: Great.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.730
AUDIENCE: And so the way you
arrange paintings in a room

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.900
has nothing to do with
making decisions at all.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.425
So I am very
skeptical of the claim

00:36:35.425 --> 00:36:38.189
that any artistic
style is democratic.

00:36:38.189 --> 00:36:38.980
FRED TURNER: Great.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:44.080
AUDIENCE: In particular,
artistic happenings.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.170
If you take away all
structure all together,

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.200
that is not democratic.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.090
That's the opposite [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.010
FRED TURNER: Totally agree.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:50.380
OK.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.515
So you and I are
actually, completely--

00:36:51.515 --> 00:36:53.140
I'm going to just
repeat the critique.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.345
Can you hear the
questions and comments OK?

00:36:55.345 --> 00:36:56.590
SPEAKER 1: You can repeat it.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.140
FRED TURNER: OK, great.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.070
I'll repeat it.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.722
So the critique in
a nutshell is I'm

00:36:59.722 --> 00:37:01.180
talking about
aesthetics as if they

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.430
were democratic and democracy.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.090
Democracy is not an aesthetic.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.947
It is, instead, a way
of making decisions.

00:37:06.947 --> 00:37:08.530
And some of the
environments that I've

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.427
described as
democratic-like happenings

00:37:10.427 --> 00:37:12.010
are, in fact, anything
but democratic.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:12.940
Fair summary?

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.480
OK, great.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.522
I totally agree with you.

00:37:14.522 --> 00:37:16.896
And this is one of those things
where in my presentation,

00:37:16.896 --> 00:37:18.250
I've perhaps been too slippery.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.170
What I'm trying to
give you a feel for is

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.120
what my subjects
thought was going on.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.090
They did believe that these
were democratizing activities.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.940
They did believe that if
you got the architecture

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.610
of an aesthetic space
right, it would then

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:33.010
be possible to make a
new kind of decision.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:33.700
Their logic.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.866
And I'm just repeating them.

00:37:34.866 --> 00:37:36.730
I'm not saying that
this is true or not.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.650
But these are America's leading
psychologists of the time.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.233
People like Gordon
Allport at Harvard.

00:37:40.233 --> 00:37:42.160
It's leading anthropologist
Margaret Mead.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.570
They really think that the way
democratic decisions get made

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.610
depends on the state
of your personality.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.650
You need to be oriented
toward collaboration,

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.910
oriented towards
sharing with others.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.160
You can't be an authoritarian.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.644
You can't be trying to dominate.

00:37:55.644 --> 00:37:57.310
So before you can
make proper decisions,

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.050
you have to get a
personality oriented

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:02.110
toward the possibility of
democratic-style collaboration.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.440
How do you do that?

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.520
You do it first in the family
as you raise the child up.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.130
But then with adults, you
build media environments

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.190
in which they can rehearse the
perceptual and psychological

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.560
conditions that they will
be needing to use when it

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.240
comes to decision-making time.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.980
So Mead wrote a great paper,
which I really recommend,

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.490
called--

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.031
it has the world's
most boring title,

00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.090
so no one's ever read it.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.240
But it's called "The
Small Conference."

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.860
And it's all about exactly
the thing that you describe.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.630
It's about, how do
you build a room

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.470
and build interaction styles
that will promote a personality

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.250
style that will in turn lead
to democratic decision-making?

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.090
Your critique is exactly right.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.672
So when I went to the
happenings in particular,

00:38:40.672 --> 00:38:41.630
I was really surprised.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.046
I was always told, these are
the most democratizing things

00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:45.370
to ever hit American theater.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:46.120
I got it in there.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.990
On the contrary, they were
authoritarian wonderlands.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.580
Almost all white men.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.840
Women in the shows tended
to be depicted either naked

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.240
or under wet sheets.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.690
They were horribly misogynistic.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:07.720
All of the kind of liberating
politics of the '40s were gone.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.680
I had no idea of this.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.475
In the '40s, radical anti-racist
critique in America said look,

00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:13.600
we can't be like the Nazis.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.433
We can't do the racist
things they're doing.

00:39:15.433 --> 00:39:16.760
We have to be different.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.462
Also, a radical argument
for sexual diversity,

00:39:19.462 --> 00:39:21.670
sexual preference diversity,
which I didn't even know

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.210
existed.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.750
I thought the closet ran right
up until 1969 and Stonewall.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:27.700
On the contrary, it
turns out that there

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.910
were people writing in '49,
in '48 and '50 saying, look.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.150
No, we need to open this up.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.850
We need to become
a diverse America.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.770
Those critiques have
melted away by the time

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.186
we get to the happenings.

00:39:37.186 --> 00:39:39.310
And the happenings without
structure are precisely,

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.920
I would argue, anti-democratic.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.440
Just right there with you.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.140
Yeah.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.620
Great.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.120
Great.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.328
I'm just going to repeat
the question for the record.

00:39:49.328 --> 00:39:51.710
So the question is, in
a curated environment

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.780
in which every
selection that you make

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.750
is nudged and shaped in
a particular direction.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.630
Not completely determined,
but nudged and shaped.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:03.530
And in which your behavior
is constantly monitored,

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.037
is that really any freer?

00:40:05.037 --> 00:40:06.620
So I'm assuming you
meant by "better,"

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.310
is that really any freer
than the mass media world?

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.780
And if you'd ask me that
question 10 years ago,

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.420
I would have said
yes, absolutely,

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.400
because people have
some degree of choice.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.340
If you asked me that question
today, I'd have to say no.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.320
I find myself strangely
filled with a longing

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.320
for Walter Cronkite.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.180
You know Walter
Cronkite, the newscaster?

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.220
I was raised in the era
of centralized media.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.320
We had three TV
stations in my family.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.160
In my town where we lived.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.790
And as a scholar, I was
raised to critique that.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:38.300
I was raised to say, centralized
media, centralized control

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.860
produces monolithic opinions.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.390
And that's bad.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:45.920
What I see now, on the
contrary, is radically dispersed

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.050
opinions, archipelagos
of opinion.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.420
Many islands everywhere
producing a kind

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.460
of chaotic lack of order.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.230
A kind of chaotic
lack of an ability

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.730
to make a decision
because we don't

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.720
share the same information.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.770
So not only am I bothered
by the power of those

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:03.550
who curate and monitor.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.080
I'm bothered by the ways
in which the individuation

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.010
of experience through media
makes it more difficult to come

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.490
to democratic consensus.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.220
So I'm bothered on both counts.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:15.910
Great.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:16.450
Great.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:17.530
So let me rephrase the question.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.710
You're asking a really
important question.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.960
And if my sociology
friends were here,

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.400
they'd be so happy to hear it.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.260
Because you're asking
about what my field

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.750
would call ideological work.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.180
Do we need to do
more ideological work

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.130
to promote a civic
vision that is

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.656
different than the one we have?

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.280
And particularly, do
we need to promote

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.010
a civic vision, something
like the European Union's

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.370
work together, making it
visible to ordinary folks

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.350
so that they can buy-in
to it, rather than try

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.730
to exit through Brexit?

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:43.570
Absolutely.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:44.954
I really think so.

00:41:44.954 --> 00:41:46.870
One of the things that
I fault Facebook with--

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.660
and some parts of Google, but
more Facebook is promoting

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:55.120
the notion that all we need
to be a healthy civic group

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.232
is more individualized
expression.

00:41:57.232 --> 00:41:59.440
If you talk to sort of Mark
Zuckerberg and the people

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.148
right around him--
and I know he's easier

00:42:01.148 --> 00:42:03.610
to pick on here than he would
be at the next town over.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:04.281
I get that.

00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:06.280
And there's a lot I admire
at Facebook, as there

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.238
is a lot I admire here.

00:42:07.238 --> 00:42:10.370
But if you talk to some of those
folks in the middle, I think--

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.950
middle of their
operation, you'll

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:16.760
hear that they genuinely
believe that connecting people

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.222
produces a more
democratic world.

00:42:18.222 --> 00:42:19.930
That we need to expose
one another to one

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:21.790
another's views
and simply connect.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.850
We need to realize as the
poster from the '60s has it

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.910
that we are all one.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.730
I'm here to tell you that is
insufficient for democracy.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.230
That tends to produce
echo chambers.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.790
It tends to produce
worlds where we

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.339
hang with those like ourselves.

00:42:34.339 --> 00:42:35.880
The challenge of
democracy-- and this

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.460
is the ideology I would promote
if it were mine to promote.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.110
The challenge of
democracy is not

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:43.740
to become more expressive
among those who already agree.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:47.987
It's to learn to work together
across lines of difference.

00:42:47.987 --> 00:42:50.445
How do you work with folks who
are very different than you?

00:42:50.445 --> 00:42:52.120
How do you make that happen?

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.760
And how do you
build institutions

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.310
that distribute resources across
differences so that people

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.110
who don't have a lot get more?

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.940
People who have
more can give more?

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.315
And you can actually
collaborate?

00:43:03.315 --> 00:43:04.814
That's the ideology
I would promote.

00:43:04.814 --> 00:43:06.110
I would use the word "civic."

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.954
I think the word "civic"
is under-utilized.

00:43:08.954 --> 00:43:10.120
I love the word "democracy."

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.020
I think it's been beaten
down a little bit, so I

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.936
use the word "civic" a
lot when I try to think

00:43:13.936 --> 00:43:15.660
about a civic ideology.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.891
Yeah.

00:43:16.891 --> 00:43:17.390
Right.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.960
That's right.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.876
It's not incompatible.

00:43:18.876 --> 00:43:20.390
And I very much
admire these folks.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:21.889
In fact, I almost
can't write a book

00:43:21.889 --> 00:43:24.962
unless I'm really pretty partly
in love with the people in it.

00:43:24.962 --> 00:43:26.420
I thought for a
while, for example,

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.040
of doing a biography
of Buckminster Fuller.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.630
And I got about
five months in and I

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.690
realized he was just
a horrible person,

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.500
and I couldn't spend
more time with him.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.300
And I felt bad because it's
a really important book.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.500
Somebody should write it.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.790
But I couldn't do it.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.510
But no, I think Margaret Mead
is somebody I really love.

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.689
And you know, she
back in the '40s

00:43:43.689 --> 00:43:45.980
had a saying that I think
applies right at this moment.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.330
She said, "Were the world
we dream of attained,

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.140
members of that new world would
be so different from ourselves

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.790
that they would
no longer value it

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:58.940
in the same terms in
which we now desire it.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.400
We would no longer be
at home in such a world.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.530
We who have dreamed it
could not live in it."

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.420
I think we live in her world.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.600
I think we live in the legacy
of the ideological turn

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.860
that she promoted.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.200
I'm still partway in
love with that ideology,

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.770
even as I know that it's brought
us things that maybe challenge

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.820
the values that underlie it.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.000
Yeah, go for it.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.130
That's a great question.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:23.075
So the question was, am I aware
of the sort of long commentary

00:44:23.075 --> 00:44:24.700
forums that are
emerging on YouTube now

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.360
with folks like Jordan Peterson,
sort of dark web model,

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.760
and how rich and how
thick that commentary

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.180
is as distinct from mass
media commentary, which

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.090
has gotten thinner and thinner?

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:36.840
Did I get that OK?

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.674
Yeah.

00:44:37.674 --> 00:44:39.340
I'm not aware of that,
and I need to be.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.115
I've heard of it.

00:44:40.115 --> 00:44:40.990
I haven't watched it.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.450
I think watching it is key.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:44.534
I have a problem.

00:44:44.534 --> 00:44:46.450
As somebody who does a
lot of historical work,

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.560
I have a time problem.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.162
I've watched with the web.

00:44:50.162 --> 00:44:51.620
I've been studying
things connected

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.690
to the web since the early '90s.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:56.840
I've watched things come
and go with great ferocity.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.352
And so I'm very slow
to react to stuff.

00:44:59.352 --> 00:45:01.060
I have friends who
are always telling me,

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.351
you need to try this, try that.

00:45:02.351 --> 00:45:04.250
Some things, like
Reddit, stick around.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.450
Other things, like
Myspace, not so much.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.980
And so I haven't seen
that yet, but I want to.

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:16.704
I've been struck by the
high-quality small-forum

00:45:16.704 --> 00:45:17.620
commentary that I get.

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.078
For example, on
Twitter I can often

00:45:19.078 --> 00:45:21.250
get very good, high-quality
small-forum content

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.480
from experts.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.150
I'm also struck by the
great sea of sort of almost

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.210
information that's out there.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.210
And I haven't found
much in between.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:30.280
YouTube's a great case.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.700
My daughter learned how
to do makeup from YouTube.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.370
She learned from
a makeup comedian.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:36.750
It was great.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.410
But I think that's fascinating.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:39.800
I'll be very curious
to see where that goes.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.300
Yeah, great.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.260
Go for it.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.070
Yeah.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.560
So is quantum consciousness
and the new spirituality

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.180
the antidote to what
I'm showing here?

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.580
No, on the contrary.

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:52.416
So I've spent a lot of time with
tech folks for a lot of time.

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.790
The mode of spirituality that
you're describing, I think,

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:58.480
is widely shared in the tech
community and not as widely

00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.682
shared elsewhere in my view.

00:45:59.682 --> 00:46:02.140
And I would argue that the mode
of spirituality that you're

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.600
describing is particular--

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.350
it supports basically a new
elite, a new aristocracy.

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:10.900
I'll go even farther
and say that there

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.390
are modes of behavior that
are available to people who

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.550
are super-smart,
super-scientific,

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.250
and super-well-funded that
are not available to others.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.330
Polyamory is one.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.310
It's available to
others, but it's

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:23.360
something that requires
a kind of coordination,

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.960
collaboration sense of
support that's not available.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.570
Certain modes of spirituality
are in touch with that.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:30.520
I'm struck by the
difference between that mode

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:34.990
of spirituality and Baptist
churches in the South.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.777
Really distinct.

00:46:35.777 --> 00:46:37.360
I'm not saying that
that's bad at all.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.400
On the contrary, I'm
fascinated by it.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.634
But I think it's distinct.

00:46:40.634 --> 00:46:42.550
And I think there are
modes of spirituality as

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:44.650
distinct from
organized religion that

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:48.640
are emerging that support a
kind of very individuated, very

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.970
tech-savvy, smart kind of life
that you can live if you have

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:54.490
all the resources that you would
need to be able to do those

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:55.640
things.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.770
That would be my--

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:57.840
I also do [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:58.960
I'm glad that you
asked about rhythms.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.580
Because of course,
that vision has

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.980
been around tech worlds
a lot in the past.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.670
The spirituality that you
described animated CW Post.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:08.350
I don't know if you
eat Post Cereals,

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:12.260
but CW Post was the inventor
of Post Grape-Nuts and the Post

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.240
brand.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.869
And he believed precisely
in the kind of spirituality

00:47:15.869 --> 00:47:18.160
that you're describing and
a slightly different version

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:18.664
of it.

00:47:18.664 --> 00:47:20.080
But he believed
that natural foods

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.880
were one of the keys
to maintaining that.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.044
He built a whole
community around it.

00:47:24.044 --> 00:47:25.960
There were other groups,
like the Oneida group

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.790
in 19th century
upstate New York,

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.550
who saw that-- or
the Fourierists.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:32.580
I mean, there's a whole series
of kind of groups like that.

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.260
And sometimes, I wonder
when I walk the campus here,

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.770
and particularly when I
see some of your colleagues

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.230
in communes where they live or
in new spiritual communities

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:44.740
that they participate
in, which I do.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.530
I sometimes wonder if they
are the new Fourierists,

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.440
the new Oneidas.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.960
I don't know.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.840
It's a question.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.150
It's a great question,
I just don't know.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:55.280
Yeah, I think the answer is no.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.280
I think that you cannot
have a democratic society

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.950
if the people who are making the
decisions about the direction

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:03.019
of the society don't
share the same facts.

00:48:03.019 --> 00:48:05.060
And the way that we've
managed that traditionally

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.054
in democratic
societies I think is

00:48:07.054 --> 00:48:08.720
through an elite that
would be in charge

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.680
of certain kinds of facts.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.850
You would be an economic expert.

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:12.183
You would be a technical expert.

00:48:12.183 --> 00:48:13.679
You would be a social expert.

00:48:13.679 --> 00:48:15.470
Those folks get together
and make decisions

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:18.630
and are informed by various
bits of news from down below.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:20.750
And in turn, send it back
through the mass media.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.910
Here, we can all agree on this.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.920
In the current condition, that's
not happening very effectively.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.430
And no, I think it's
very difficult to have

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.050
a democracy in that space.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:33.710
I'm hoping that we can
agree on fact again.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:37.130
I think it's no accident that
democracy and science tend

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:40.180
to rise and fall together.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.200
Yeah, we need facts badly.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.300
Great.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.107
OK.

00:48:46.107 --> 00:48:47.690
Thank you all very
much for having me.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:50.189
I appreciate your taking an
hour out of your day to be here.

00:48:50.189 --> 00:48:52.415
And it's great to be doing--
if you're a historian,

00:48:52.415 --> 00:48:54.790
you spend a lot of time alone
in your room with the past.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:56.582
It's so nice to be
out talking to folks

00:48:56.582 --> 00:48:58.540
in the present about the
things that you study.

00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.435
Thanks for having me.

00:48:59.435 --> 00:48:59.730
Appreciate it.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:00.460
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Fred.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.835
Thank you, everybody,
for coming.

00:49:01.835 --> 00:49:03.810
[APPLAUSE]
