00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.480
Let's say I have some subspace
of rn called v.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.840
Let me draw it like this.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.550
So that it is r n.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.770
And I have some subspace of it
we'll call v right here.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.790
So that is my subspace v.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:25.170
We know that the orthogonal
complement v is equal to the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.840
set of all of the
members of rn.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.460
So x is a member of rn.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:45.510
Such that x dot v is equal to 0
for every v that is a member

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.280
of r subspace.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.220
So our orthogonal complement of
our subspace is going to be

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.090
all of the vectors that
are orthogonal to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.830
all of these vectors.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.120
And we've seen before that they
only overlap-- there's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.890
only one vector that's
a member of both.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.220
That's the zero vector.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.300
It's right there.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.530
Let's take the orthogonal
complement.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.190
Let's say it's this set right
here in pink, so that's the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.650
orthogonal complement.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.710
Fair enough.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.910
Now, what if we were to think
about the orthogonal

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.590
complement of the orthogonal
complement?

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.560
So, that's the orthogonal
complement in pink.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.720
We want the orthogonal
complement of that.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.050
So this is going to be all
of the x's-- let's just

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.830
write it like this.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:37.350
All of the x's that are members
of rn such that x dot

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.210
w is equal to 0.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.620
For every w that is a member
of the orthogonal

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.660
complement of v.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.600
That's what that thing
is saying.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.080
So it's all of the vectors in
rn that are orthogonal to

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.690
everything here.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.670
Obviously, all of the things in
v are going to be a member

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.120
of that because these guys are
orthogonal to everything in

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.970
these guys.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.470
But maybe this is just a subset
of the orthogonal

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.360
complement of the orthogonal
complement.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.440
So maybe this thing in blue
right here looks like this.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.280
Maybe it's a slightly
larger set than v.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.450
Maybe there are some things,
these things that I'm shading

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.350
in blue, maybe there are some
vectors that are orthogonal to

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.490
the orthogonal complement of v
but that are outside of v.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.490
We don't know that yet.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.070
We don't know whether this
area right here exists.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.570
Or maybe the orthogonal
complement of the orthogonal

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.020
complement.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.540
Maybe that takes us back to v.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.285
Maybe it's like the transpose
or an inverse function where

00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:39.990
it just goes back to our
original subspace.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.880
Let's see if we can
think about that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.550
a little bit better.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.780
Let's say that I have some
member of the orthogonal

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.050
complement of the orthogonal
complement.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.880
So let's say I have some vector
x that is a member of

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.790
the orthogonal complement of
the orthogonal complement.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.140
Now, we saw on the last video
that any vector in rn can be

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.460
represented by a sum of some
vector in a subspace and the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.380
subspace's complement.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.930
So we know that x can be
represented-- we can say that

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.000
x can be represented as the
sum of two vectors.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.980
One that's in v and one that's
in the orthogonal

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.500
complement of v.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.130
So one, let's call that the
vector that's in v and let's

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.400
call w the vector that's
in the orthogonal

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.380
complement of V.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.400
Let me write it like this.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.700
Where v is a member of the
subspace v and the vector w is

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.140
a member of the orthogonal
complement of v.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.790
Right?

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.380
So this is some member.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.860
It could be some guy out here.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.080
It could be some
guy over here.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.370
He's a member of the orthogonal
complement of the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.120
orthogonal complement.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.930
Which is this whole area here.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.860
Which v is a subset of, but
we're not sure whether v

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.360
equals that thing.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.170
But we say, look, anything
that's in the orthogonal

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.730
complement of your orthogonal
complement, is going to be a

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.645
member of rn.

00:04:07.645 --> 00:04:10.770
And anything in rn can be
represented as a sum of a

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.120
vector in v and a vector
in the orthogonal

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.890
complement of v.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.839
So that's all I wrote
right there.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:25.620
Now, what happens if I take the
dot product of x with w?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.460
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.650
This is the orthogonal
complement of the orthogonal

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.160
complement.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.300
Would you take the dot product
of any vector in this with any

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.750
vector in the orthogonal
complement,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.030
which this vector is.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.280
Right?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.690
It's a member of the orthogonal
complement.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.660
You're going to get
0 by definition.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.490
These are all of the vectors.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.210
This factor is definitely
orthogonal to anything in just

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.590
v perp right?

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.780
Anything in v perp perp
is orthogonal to

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.030
anything in v perp.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.420
So, this thing is going
to be equal to 0.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.560
But what's another way
of writing x dot w?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.950
We could write it like this.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.050
This is the same thing
as v plus w dot w.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.940
Which is the same thing as
v dot w plus w dot w.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.700
Now, what is v dot w?

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.300
v is a member of our
original subspace.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.690
And if you take the dot product
of anything in our

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.290
original subspace anything in
its orthogonal complement,

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.740
you're going to get 0.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.970
So this term right here is going
to be 0, and you're just

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.450
going to get this term which
is the same thing as the

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.770
length of our vector
w squared.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.520
Now, that has to equal 0.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.330
Remember we just
wrote x dot w.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.080
x is a member of the orthogonal
complement of your

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.250
orthogonal complement.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.600
So, you dot that with anything
in the orthogonal complement,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.020
that's got to be equal 0.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.710
But, if we write it the other
way, if we write it as the sum

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.910
of v plus w and distribute this
w, we say that's the same

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.570
thing as the magnitude
of w squared.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.810
So the magnitude of w squared
has got to be equal to 0.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.360
The magnitude of w squared, or
the length of w squared, has

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.950
got to be equal to 0.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.810
Which tells us that w
is the zero vector.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.800
That's the only factor in rn
when you take its length and,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.030
especially when you square
it, you get 0.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.670
But you could just
take its length.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.080
So what does that mean?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.460
That means that our original
vector x is equal to v plus w.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.460
But w is just equal to 0.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.990
So that implies that
our original vector

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:44.050
x is equal to v.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.180
And v is a member of
our subspace v.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.000
Right?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.460
So that tells us that x is a
member of our subspace v.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.550
So we just showed that if
something is a member of the

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.870
orthogonal complement of the
orthogonal complement then

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.830
that same vector has
to be a member of

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.640
the original subspace.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.400
So there is no such thing as
something being in the

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.070
orthogonal complement of the
orthogonal complement and not

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.120
being a member of our
original subspace.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.220
All of this has to be inside
of this right there.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.430
So there is no outside
blue space like that.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.370
All of that is our original
subspace if you want to view

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.250
it that way.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.770
Now I just at the beginning of
the video, anything in our

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.770
subspace is going to be a
member of our orthogonal

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.080
complement.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.130
And then you can kind of reason
that in your head.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.680
Let's use the same argument to
just be a little bit more

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.930
rigorous about it.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.760
Right now we say if anything
is in the orthogonal

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.970
complement of the orthogonal
complement, then it's going to

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.460
be the original subspace.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.130
Let's go the other way.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.320
Let's say that something
is in the original

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.990
subspace just like that.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.550
Let me draw another graph
right here because

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.390
this might be useful.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.780
Let me draw rn again.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.310
Let me draw all of
rn like that.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.480
Now, we have the orthogonal
complement.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:23.600
Let me just draw that first.
So v perp And then you have

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.650
the orthogonal complement of
the orthogonal complement

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.200
which could be this
set right here.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.500
Right?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.100
This is v perp.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.350
I haven't even drawn
the subspace v.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.690
All I've shown is, I have some
subspace here, which I happen

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.950
to call v perp.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.140
And then I have the orthogonal
complement of that subspace.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.200
So this means that anything in
rn can be represented as the

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.400
sum of a vector that's here
and a vector that's here.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.300
So, if I say that w-- let
me do it in purple.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.400
If I say the vector w-- let
me write it this way.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.110
The vector v can be represented
as the sum of the

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:20.620
vector w and the vector x where
w is a member of the

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.580
orthogonal complement of v or
v perp And x is a member of

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.560
its orthogonal complement.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.540
Notice, all I'm saying, I could
have called this set s.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.530
And then this would have been
s and its orthogonal

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.410
complement.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.230
And we learned that anything in
rn could be represented as

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.900
the sum of something in a
subspace and the subspace's

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.350
orthogonal complement.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.220
So it doesn't matter that v is
somehow related to this.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.720
It can be represented as
a sum of a vector here

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.270
plus a vector there.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.480
Fair enough.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.950
Now, what happens if
I dot v with w?

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.340
I'm doing the exact same
argument that I did before.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.200
Well, if you take anything
that's a member of our

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.560
original subspace, and you dot
it with anything in its

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.120
orthogonal complement, that's
going to give us 0.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.900
What else is that going
to be equal to?

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.680
If we write v in this way, v
dot w is the same thing as

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.650
this thing dot w.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:29.600
So w plus x dot-- and this is
going to be equal to w dot w

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.020
plus x dot w.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.340
And what's x dot w? x is in the
orthogonal complement of

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.980
your orthogonal complement.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.710
And w is in the orthogonal
complement.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:40.950
So if you take the dot
product, you're

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.600
going to get 0.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.210
They're orthogonal
to each other.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:49.020
So this is just equal to w dot
w or the length of w squared.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.340
And since since has to equal
0, we just have a bunch of

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.060
equals here, that tells us that
once again the vector w

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.570
has to be equal to 0.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.840
So that tells us v is
equal to w plus x.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.400
But if w is equal to 0, then v
is going to be equal to x.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.940
So we've just shown that if v is
a member of the subspace v,

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:21.650
then v is a member of the
orthogonal complement of the

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.590
orthogonal complement.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.900
Right? v is equal to x, which is
a member of the orthogonal

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.170
complement or the orthogonal
complement.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:31.020
So we've proven it both ways.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.580
If you look at the original
statement, we wrote here that

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.290
if you're a member of the
orthogonal complement of the

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.840
orthogonal complement,
you're a member of

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.730
the original subspace.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.190
So, we've proven this and,
earlier in the video, we

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:49.160
proved that if x is a member of
the orthogonal complement

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.870
of the orthogonal complement,
then x is a

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.840
member of our subspace.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.300
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.460
Anything that's in
the subspace is a

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.150
member of v perp perp.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.150
Anything in v perp perp is
a member of our subspace.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.520
So, our subspace in v perp
perp are the same set.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.400
And of course it overlaps.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.670
This equals this.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.100
And of course it overlaps with
V perp and its orthogonal

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.200
complement only at the zero
vector right there.
