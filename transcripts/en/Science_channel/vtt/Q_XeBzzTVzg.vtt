00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.133
OHHH! LOOK AT THAT!

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.100
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.634
IT'S LIKE A CATHEDRAL.

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:14.968
THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR US TO SET UP

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:17.033
A MORE PERMANENT CAMP.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.100
OH! I LOVE IT!

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:21.801
ONE OF THE REASONS
THIS PLACE IS PERFECT

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.634
IS I CAN STRING
A COUPLE OF HAMMOCKS.

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:27.267
HAMMOCKS ARE GREAT
NOT JUST 'CAUSE THEY'RE COMFY...

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:31.601
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:33.601
...BUT IN AN UNFAMILIAR PLACE,

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.667
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO SLEEP
ON THE GROUND.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:37.801
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF
SUCH EASY ACCESS

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.067
TO THINGS LIKE --
I DON'T KNOW --

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:42.567
CENTIPEDES AND SCORPIONS

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:45.868
AND OTHER THINGS
I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT.

[ As Jamie ]
"ADAM, HOW COME YOU USED UP

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:50.868
ALL OUR GOOD DUCT-TAPE ROPE

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:56.467
[ Normal voice ]
"JAMIE [SCOFFS] I'M STRANDED
ON A DESERTED ISLAND FOR WEEKS.

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:58.167
I WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE
WHEN I SLEEP."

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.667
[ As Jamie ] "I DON'T REALLY
CARE HOW I SLEEP.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.267
"I COULD SLEEP ON A PILE
OF ROCKS AND MILLIPEDES.

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:05.200
I WOULDN'T CARE."

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.067
ALL RIGHT, HERE GOES NOTHING.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:12.300
OH, OH, OH, OH, OHHH!

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.868
OH!

[ SIGHS ]

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:19.200
WOW, THIS IS
SERIOUSLY COMFORTABLE.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.834
LIKE, I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING,
FROM TELEVISION COMFORTABLE.

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:24.501

WITH THE MASTER BED AND SHELTER
AND RAIN CATCHER ALL IN ONE

00:01:45.868 --> 00:01:48.901
WITH A NICE FOOT MAT
SO ONE CAN GET IN AND OUT OF BED

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:50.801
WITHOUT HAVING TO WEAR SHOES.

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:53.901
THE GUEST ACCOMMODATIONS
ARE ALMOST AS NICE

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:56.000
WITH A GUEST
RAIN CATCHER AND ROOF,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.567
ALONG WITH EXTRA ROPE
