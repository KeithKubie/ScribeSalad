ERIC FROEMLING: My
name is Eric Froemling,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.330
and I'm an indie
developer making a game

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.060
all by myself called BombSquad.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.410
I started writing BombSquad
purely as a hobby back

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.894
when I was finishing
up art school.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:20.060
I just wrote it as something
to play with my friends

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.560
at our little dorky
get togethers.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.759
I really enjoy creating
models, so everything

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.800
in the game-- whether it's
a character or a set--

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.610
is created in real
life and then brought

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.700
into the game, which gives
a really unique style.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.660
And for many years it
just existed as a hobby.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.220
And then a few
years ago I decided

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.490
to put it out and see
what I could do with it.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.610
And now it's my livelihood.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.200
Before Player Analytics,
I was pretty much blind.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.390
I was just guessing what
my players were doing,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940
and what was causing
them to spend,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.606
and where they were
spending their time,

00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:49.648
but I didn't really know.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.022
When I started using the tools,
it was a very eye opening

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:52.559
experience.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350
I could suddenly see
the low hanging fruit,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.010
where I could improve retention
or improve monetization

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.680
in the game.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.840
BombSquad is a multiplayer game
at heart, but 90% of my players

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.810
were going down the
single player path.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.590
So that helped me
focus my efforts

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.800
and add more content
and more things for them

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.096
to do when they were on
that side of the game.

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:11.720
Player Analytics
showed me that players

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.470
were earning more than they
were spending in the game,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.250
so I was able to
rebalance my economy

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.515
and make a significant
positive impact on my revenue.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:21.630
I immediately saw 140% lift in
the average revenue per user,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.609
as well as a 67% lift in
average revenue per paying user.

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.400
By looking at the Player
Progression Chart,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.670
I also learned that players
were having a hard time

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490
getting past level two
or three in my game.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.580
It was too hard.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.470
So I went back
and rebalanced it.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.540
I added an easy mode.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.725
And after that, I saw a
3.6x increase in the number

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.350
of levels that players
were completing,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.066
which helped increase
my retention.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.940
The Events Viewer is
useful a number of ways.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.690
One way I use it is
as a sanity check.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.660
After I release the game, I
can check the Events Viewer

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.640
to make sure people's frames
per second are still good,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.720
and everything's running
well with the game.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.678
Another thing I learned
from the Events Viewers

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:56.280
is that my tutorial is too long.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.250
And I see most people skip
it after about 10 seconds.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.519
Player Analytics really
helped me to open my eyes

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:03.810
and see what I was doing
right, what I was doing wrong,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.910
and correct the
ship to the point

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.970
where now it's
working financially.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.750
My biggest piece of
advice to developers

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.330
is put something out there.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.260
See what you did wrong,
look at the numbers,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.150
use tools like Player Analytics.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.670
Correct things and try again.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.128
And just be persistent, and
eventually you'll get it right.
