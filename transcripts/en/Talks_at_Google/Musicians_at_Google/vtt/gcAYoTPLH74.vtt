Bill: I'm thrilled to have Kristen Mather
and the West Point Band here.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.167
I don't know what people's
conceptions are of military bands,

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:15.500
but this is an amazingly loose,
fantastic band.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.900
And the music they're going to
play is great by Raymond Scott,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.233
who is a good Jewish boy from Brooklyn.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:25.200
Who, like all good Jewish boys,
changed his name [laughter]

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.133
supposedly because he had a brother,

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.733
and he was worried about
nepotism and other things.

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:34.000
Some of you may know the music that
was used in some of the Looney Tunes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.667
But the thing about the music, is
its incredibly happy, upbeat music

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.867
but really, really hard to play.

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:46.033
Thank Kate for arranging for this,
and Kristen and her colleagues.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:48.533

spending your lunch time with us.

We are West Point Band's Quintette 7.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:31.467
We are something a little different

already from this music.

We're really glad to be here.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.467
And right off the bat, we were playing all
last week in the deep, deep, dirty South.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:41.933
And then we came back Sunday

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:44.800
and we were playing up in Saugerties,
New York, way past New Paltz,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.700
and this lady comes up
to me and she says

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.333
" I received a letter
from your commander,

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:52.900
and frankly I find it embarrassing he doesn't
know how to spell the word 'quintet'."

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.867
Well, have no fear.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.967
Our commander probably knows
how to spell the word quintet.

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:58.767
I haven't asked him.

00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:03.267
But the way we spell 'quintet' is an homage
to Raymond Scott and his quintette.

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:04.100
You'll see a picture here.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.867
There's six gentlemen sitted
around playing their instruments

00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:08.800
with Raymond Scott at the piano.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.033
And he had a quintet
for this group of six musicians.

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:14.067
So, what would normally be a sextet

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:16.433
but in his 1930's sensibility,

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:19.333
he thought that the audience would be
distracted by hearing the word sex

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:21.500
before [chuckle] [audience laughs]
hearing his music.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.367
And, you know, he didn't want to
distract from his great music.

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:28.533
So we decided to have a little fun with
that and we made it our Quintette 7.

00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:30.833
Raymond Scott was this,
and that was a great introduction.

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:31.967
Thank you so much Bill.

00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:35.100
Was a great musician and he
graduated from Julliard at 22 and,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.067
immediately following that,

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:39.367
he took over working
at the CBS radio orchestra.

00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:42.533

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.633

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:56.033
and getting a paycheck playing this music.

00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:59.633
Like you said, it's extremely,
extremely difficult.

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:03.200
We wanted to go ahead and show just a little
bit of the diversity this music offers

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.667
before we get into more
about who we are

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:07.233

we really like to get into.

"Carmen" in this "Quintette Plays Carmen";

It's really interesting compositions.

00:11:36.567 --> 00:11:38.933
Something that I learned
in studying this music was,

00:11:38.933 --> 00:11:41.300
well, to call it composed
is really interesting.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.967
What he would do is he would sit at
the piano and he would play ideas

00:11:43.967 --> 00:11:46.833
and these fantastic musicians
would improvise ideas

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:49.933
as either responses or to augment
what he was playing.

00:11:49.933 --> 00:11:53.200
And then he would write it down and then
they would never, ever change it again.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.367
So, when we're standing up
and playing these solos,

00:11:55.367 --> 00:11:56.300
they're not improvised.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.133
And it's not because
we don't have that ability.

00:11:58.133 --> 00:12:01.533
It's because Raymond Scott was
a task-master and he demanded,

00:12:01.533 --> 00:12:03.900
"I needed the exact same way every time."

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.700

really, really interesting to me,

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:14.367

there's a lot of bureaucracy in the Army.

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:16.700

to be careful with what you do

He would reform this Quintette, 

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.533
and there was three versions,
four versions,

00:21:54.533 --> 00:21:57.433
and then he had a secret seven
and it kept going.

00:21:57.433 --> 00:22:01.533
As you can see here, IBM, Sony,
General Signal, Xerox, and Atari

00:22:01.533 --> 00:22:05.300
all referenced patents
he had made on his Electronium.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.067
And they did this
in the 80's and early 90's.

00:22:08.067 --> 00:22:10.567
So they were already,
like he was that far ahead of his time

00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:13.233
but just because he didn't
like working with people.

00:22:13.233 --> 00:22:15.833
It's amazing how resourceful
musicians are willing to be

00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:18.867
when it comes to their craft
and they're not people persons.

00:22:18.867 --> 00:22:20.900
We spend most of our time
locked in a practice room

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.900
as I suppose a lot of you had spent,

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.000
maybe when you were in high school or
early college coding or doing whatever,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.767
just locked into your room.

00:22:29.767 --> 00:22:34.000
This, "In an 18th Century Drawing Room,"
combines all of those ideas.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.033
So this is toward the end
in his compositional style,

00:22:36.033 --> 00:22:37.567
where he was still working with musicians

00:22:37.567 --> 00:22:41.133
and he takes this very famous Mozart
piano sonata, Yalin...

So, he takes that and
he puts it to this Quintette

00:23:03.067 --> 00:23:05.867
and he doesn't care about how it sounds
on any of the other instruments.

00:23:05.867 --> 00:23:08.300
I think we start off in like, B-major
and we go through F-sharp major.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.500
We go through all these ridiculous keys
and it's expected to sound as fluent as that.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.600
And I was complaining about this one day
because my trumpet part's really hard,

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.733
and I decided to complain
to our pianist, Yalin.

00:23:16.733 --> 00:23:19.700
I was like, "Yalin, isn't that piece
just really, really difficult?

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.367
Isn't that sick?"

00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:21.933

"No, my part's easy."

He checks out our marching.

But what happens is, is that people
graduate from West Point

interaction with the band.

band member on the day that there's a review.
