JONATHAN: Well, good
afternoon, and welcome

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.100
to "Musicians at Google."

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.090
Yeah, our inaugural show.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.460
This is so exciting.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.720
Thanks so much for
coming out to share this.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.065
This is Hollie
Cook's first US tour.

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:24.900
I'm going to go
way out on a limb

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.650
here and predict it will
be far from her last.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.900
Hollie is absolutely amazing.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.910
You will find that out
in the next few minutes

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.960
if you don't already know it.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.090
Her band is tight and smoking.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.260
This is going to be
an incredible show.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.790
They're at the very
beginning of their US tour.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970
We saw them last
night at the Paradise.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.020
It sounded like they've been
on the road for weeks already.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.510
Just unbelievable.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.045
Please join me in welcoming
Hollie Cook and the band.

00:00:58.256 --> 00:00:59.610
Thank you for having us.

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:04.739
I'm going to start
with a song that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.346
was my first single
from my first album.

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:10.356
It's called "That Very Night."

 NIGHT"]

HOLLIE COOK: Thank
you very much.

00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:33.645
I'm going to do
another old song.

00:04:33.645 --> 00:04:37.972
It's the first song that
I recorded as Hollie Cook.

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:39.774
It's called "Milk and Honey."

 HONEY"]

00:09:25.729 --> 00:09:27.770
HOLLIE COOK: So I released
a new album this year.

00:09:28.629 --> 00:09:30.670
So I'm going to play a
couple of songs from that.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.720
This song is called "99."

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.150
It's about
[INAUDIBLE], actually.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.931
So I'll just sing it.

00:15:55.931 --> 00:15:57.430
It's called "Looking
for Real Love."

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.650
It's also from my new album.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.560
Thank you very much
for coming and sharing.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.150
You're great critics.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.310

all know you by name.

But Next Level Band, do you want
to tell everybody your name?

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:02.966
We don't know you, yet.

00:22:02.966 --> 00:22:03.840
JAIME HINCKSON: Sure.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.120
My name is Jaime Hinckson.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.620
I play keys for Hollie Cook.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.400
I play guitar.

PATRICK BAILEY: Patrick Bailey.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.770

I play drums.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.575
JONATHAN: So you guys
are all from LA, correct?

00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:24.305
And you've played together for
a while now on other projects?

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.320
BLAKE COLLIE: We
played-- these two guys,

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.275
we played off and
on since '96 or so.

00:22:34.275 --> 00:22:36.710
This guy over here
on keyboard just

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:42.750
got to LA through a mutual
friend, and hit it off.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.760
And here we are to
instantly jump in

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.620
on the adventure with Hollie.

JONATHAN: Wow,
that's outstanding.

00:22:49.215 --> 00:22:50.440
How did you hook up?

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.210
HOLLIE COOK: How did we?

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.040
We worked together
earlier this year

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.790
when I played in California,
and I've worked with Patrick

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.980
before last year when
I played in California.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.730
And then-- they all just--
they all know each other.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.120
And it was--

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.580
BLAKE COLLIE: It was Warren at
Sierra Nevada, recommended--

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.360
I'm in a group in LA.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.780
A reggae band in LA
called The Lions.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.239
And Warren, who-- what's
Warren's last name?

00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:20.030
HOLLIE COOK: Smith.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.863
BLAKE COLLIE: Smith.

00:23:20.863 --> 00:23:22.640
Yeah, Warren Smith
recommended The Lions

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.480
because she had an LA show.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.815
And so we got to do a
festival date with her.

00:23:27.815 --> 00:23:30.160
And then a show in LA,
and then I stayed in touch

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.502
with Hollie, and with
David, and here we are.

00:23:33.502 --> 00:23:34.460
JONATHAN: Wow, perfect.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:34.970
Wow.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:35.469
Great.

Well, I won't welcome
you all to the US

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.560
since you live
here, but Hollie--

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.652
Hollie, welcome to the US.

00:23:41.652 --> 00:23:42.860

JONATHAN: Welcome to Boston.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.490
Welcome to Google.

So great to have you here.

00:23:47.612 --> 00:23:48.820
HOLLIE COOK: It's a pleasure.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.320
I'm excited.

00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:53.390
JONATHAN: You do come from
a family that's probably

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:57.252
more interesting than most
of the people in this room.

00:23:57.252 --> 00:23:58.960
HOLLIE COOK: I don't
know if that's true.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.760
JONATHAN: Well, I don't know.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.560
If you're not entirely
sick of talking about it,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.626
could you talk a little
bit about your family?

00:24:08.626 --> 00:24:10.845
HOLLIE COOK: My family is cool.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.490
My mom was a singer
later on in her life,

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.870
and she grew up with Boy George.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.680
And was around when he
formed culture club,

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.650
so she was backing vocalist
for a little while.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.460
Until it got crazy,
and I think she

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.960
decided that it was
not really her calling.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.280
To be in a huge pop band.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.950
So she change direction.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:43.440
But my father has always been
a musician, and still is.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.430
He's a drummer.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.150
He's Paul Cook, and he
played in the Sex Pistols.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.285
It's kind of normal.

00:24:55.602 --> 00:24:57.560
JONATHAN: If you grew up
that way, it would be.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.059
Sure.

00:24:58.059 --> 00:24:59.350
HOLLIE COOK: It's my normal.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.450
He's very cool.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:07.620
They both-- I owe all
of my musical ability

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.940
to both my parents.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.950
More the singing
from my mom, but it's

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.260
been an interesting ride.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.780
And they've been
extremely supportive.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.070
That's been the coolest part.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.850
Is that they've always
totally understood

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:21.940
where I was coming from.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:27.290
So aside from a few
disappointing school dropouts,

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.560
or whatever, they
were like it's OK.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.752
You're clearly taking
this seriously enough.

00:25:32.752 --> 00:25:33.960
JONATHAN: Well, that's great.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.950
Did they encourage
you to go into music,

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.340
or was it something that you
just naturally gravitated to?

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.640
HOLLIE COOK: They just
saw that it was something

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.580
that I was leaning towards
from a really young age.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.752
And they did-- they
got me piano lessons,

00:25:49.752 --> 00:25:51.460
and I had dance lessons
when I was a kid.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.950
They never pushed it on me.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.660
They just could see straight
away that it was something

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.200
that I was most likely
going to end up doing.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.520
So they encouraged it.

00:26:06.332 --> 00:26:09.420
JONATHAN: And how did you tend
to gravitate toward reggae?

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.210
HOLLIE COOK: Just the way
that you do, I suppose.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:18.240
I was a teenager, and I had
a few records here and there.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:27.190
And it was just-- it just had
something special about it

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.250
that I wanted to be
apart of in a way.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:36.820
I was singing in a band called
The Slits for about five years,

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.330
and they've got a very
strong reggae influence

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:41.170
in their music.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.090
So from performing
with them, I kind of

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.670
got deeper into the reggae vibe.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.340
And I met a producer
called Prince Fatty, who

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.060
I've worked with
on both my records.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.120
And once I met him, it kind
of all fell into place.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.270
And it felt like a
very true way for me

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.950
to express myself musically.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.700
And I stuck with it
because it felt good.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.900
JONATHAN: Reggae nicknames
are the best nicknames.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.190
I wish I had something
like Prince Fatty to go by.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.500
Really, but I'll
have to work on that.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.780
So the band-- have you
been playing reggae

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.835
mostly yourselves, or is that
just one of several styles

00:27:20.835 --> 00:27:22.020
that you've worked on?

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.700
JARED MEEKER: We've been playing
a lot of different styles,

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.170
and I speak for everybody
here in saying that.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.940
But reggae-- I've been
playing with Blake here

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.060
for-- since we were 20 years
old, or something like that.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.180
So we've been doing
it for a while.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.960
And when we were
first starting out

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.080
we were lucky to open up for
a lot of big name reggae acts,

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.260
and certainly got our feet wet.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.440
And that left a lasting
impression on us.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.180
So that was a huge
influence in how

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.300
we think about reggae,
and in some ways

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.880
every other genre
of music that we

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.830
play has a little
bit of reggae in it.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.690
Like naturally, you know?

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.960
There's certainly a
little bit of unity

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.650
that you can hear within
every style of music.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.170
It's like a through
line, but reggae

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.150
is something that's really
close to our hearts for sure.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:17.990
JONATHAN: Wow.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:19.200
Excellent.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.325
Yeah, the sound is amazing.

00:28:20.325 --> 00:28:21.760
It really is.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.650
I mean it's-- it's
clearly reggae.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:25.980
There's no mistaking that.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.380
But with your vocals, there's
just really nothing like it

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.750
in my opinion.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.025
Really completely special.

00:28:33.172 --> 00:28:34.130
HOLLIE COOK: Thank you.

00:28:35.522 --> 00:28:37.480
JONATHAN: Speaking of
your parents, there maybe

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.804
some people here who've
heard of the Sex Pistols.

00:28:39.804 --> 00:28:41.220
There may be some
people who think

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.200
that "Never Mind the Bollocks,
Here's the Sex Pistols"

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.960
is one of the greatest
albums recorded

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.980
in the second half
of the 20th century.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.085
So if you want to pass that on
to your dad, that'd be fine.

00:28:51.085 --> 00:28:51.765
HOLLIE COOK: OK.

00:28:51.765 --> 00:28:52.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.390
JONATHAN: There may be people
who also watched the Karma

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.810
Chameleon video once a month
whether they need to or not.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.540
So You could pass
that on to your mom.

00:29:02.972 --> 00:29:03.805
HOLLIE COOK: I will.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.040
That'll make them smile.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.740
JONATHAN: OK.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.620
Well that's great.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.400
People have not forgotten.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.660
So your tour just kicked off a
couple nights ago in Brooklyn.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.550
You were in Boston last night.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:18.460
You're doing the East coast
here, and for how long?

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.070
HOLLIE COOK: We've
got two more dates

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.510
in Philadelphia
and Washington, DC.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:26.120
And then we fly over
to the West coast

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:31.220
and start in Boulder, Colorado,
and drive down through.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.160
So we're going to Seattle,
Portland, Oakland, and Los

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.730
Angeles.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.110
JONATHAN: OK.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.630
HOLLIE COOK: So it's a mini-tour
for now being my first time

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:41.130
here.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.150
We'll do all the
stuff in the middle

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.360
hopefully at some
other point, I suppose.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.420
If there's an interest for it.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.920
JONATHAN: Yeah, I
think the American

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.350
Midwest needs to
hear your music.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.820
HOLLIE COOK: It's a big place,
so it takes a lot of time

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.720
to travel around
the whole thing.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.200
So, yeah, we'll keep it
East and West for now,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.660
and then we'll see what
happens in the future.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.960
JONATHAN: OK.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.970
So "Twice" is still pretty
new-- your second CD.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.640
Are you working on any
material for a third CD,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.720
or is the tour
keeping you too busy?

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.480
HOLLIE COOK: The
tour's keep me busy.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.810
I've been touring all
summer, but it's always--

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.480
I can't tell which
parts my favorite,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.200
but I do love the
touring aspects of it,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.970
and traveling around is one
of the most inspiring things.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:35.050
So it helps with the process
of writing new material.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.230
So there's stuff
in the pipeline.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:43.550
I don't have any plans for
a third album just yet.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:44.700
Like a whole album.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.040
I'm scared of the commitment.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.050
So I'll probably do
some short projects,

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.350
and then make an album
in a couple of years.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:56.470
Or maybe I'll surprise
myself, and there'll

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.918
be an album within
the next year.

00:30:58.918 --> 00:31:00.590
Who knows.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.370
I'd like to keep it
interesting by having

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:05.080
absolutely no plans whatsoever.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.950
JONATHAN: Well we'll
prepare to be delighted

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.012
whichever way you go.

00:31:08.012 --> 00:31:09.470
JARED MEEKER: By
the way, Jonathan.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.770
There is a reggae name
generator that you can just

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.990
go-- I'm sure with Google being
here, you guys know about that.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.250
But if you go type in
Jonathan, and you'll

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.432
get-- Ross John, or
something like that.

00:31:21.432 --> 00:31:22.265
JONATHAN: Excellent.

00:31:22.265 --> 00:31:23.150
Thank you for that.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:23.650
Thanks.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.360
There's a lot of days
where I really need that.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.300
You have no idea.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.600
So give me the URL.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.990
I'll do it this afternoon.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.420
Oh, a question from that
young lady in the audience.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.367
Do you want to come up here
and-- because otherwise we

00:31:39.367 --> 00:31:40.450
won't be able to hear you.

00:31:41.459 --> 00:31:43.250
AUDIENCE: I spent some
time in the Midwest,

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.980
and my favorite reggae
bar was The Wild Hare

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.460
and Singing Armadillo Frog
Sanctuary in Wrigleyville.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.600
It's closed now, but I
think there's probably

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.020
a pretty good scene there.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.510
So I would encourage
you to go to Chicago.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.610
But I also wonder where
is the reggae scene?

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.570
Are you going to pop
venues, or is there

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:08.320
sort of that subculture of
reggae music in the bar scene?

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.210
BLAKE COLLIE: The majority
of-- the strongest parts

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.660
in the United States--
of the reggae scene--

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.980
would probably be,
historically, New

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.190
York at the top of the list.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:26.610
Just for Jamaican families to
come and set up shop early on,

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.880
like in the '50s and
'60s and whatnot.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.080
Between the New York, and
then over to LA in particular.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.840
It could be due to the weather.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.465
And then Miami.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.210
The guy right here can
tell you about Miami.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.770
But those three would
be the strongest.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:49.820
And then, interestingly
enough, in California-- it's

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.940
referred to as West
coast by some people,

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.670
but California mainly.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:55.870
There's a California
roots reggae

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.630
scene that we're
all coming from,

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.690
and a part of the
different bands.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.750
The Lions, The Expanders,
The Aggrolites.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.320
Then there's reggae rock groups
like Revolution and Tribal

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:09.820
Seeds.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:16.480
So there's a whole huge, huge
scene over on the West coast.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:23.410
And so now, as it spreads from
LA up to Seattle and back down,

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:29.220
the main gist of LA and, or
Southern California and Miami

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.500
is certainly the weather.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.180
Which I will let
this guy take over.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.640
And then, from
where Holly's from,

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.890
would be the other
biggest area in the world

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:40.870
outside of Jamaica.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.440
It's just in the UK in
Brixton and places like that.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.360
Again, historically,
really, really famous reggae

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.590
bands-- Steel Pulse to Aswad.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.080
Groups like that
come from that area.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.170
So for what we're doing
here in the States,

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.010
that's the great
thing about this tour.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.860
Is we're hitting some
of these primary--

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.310
I should include Colorado too.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.980
You guys can maybe
figure out why

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.380
Colorado might like
reggae so much.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.406
So, with that said, you
can fill in the Miami void.

00:34:08.406 --> 00:34:09.530
JAIME HINCKSON: Well, yeah.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.071
I was born and raised in Miami,
but my family's from Jamaica.

00:34:12.997 --> 00:34:14.830
Jamaica used to be under
British rule, which

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.860
is why England has
so much reggae music.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.989
But reggae is such a
revolutionary genre.

00:34:21.815 --> 00:34:23.690
I could sit here and
name artists off the top

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.870
my head for days, but
you guys know them.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.474
Because reggae is
so revolutionary.

00:34:27.474 --> 00:34:28.474
It's very international.

00:34:28.474 --> 00:34:31.670
It's not specific to one city.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.449
Of course there's a lot
of Jamaican influence,

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:36.629
Caribbean influence in
Miami because it's so close.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.280
Everybody originally--
like my parents--

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.770
they migrated to New York.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:45.310
So a big influence there, and
of course Denver and California

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.280
for obvious reasons.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.489
But reggae is everywhere.

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:51.100
There's reggae festivals
all over the world,

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.050
and eventually we're going to
end up playing in all of them.

00:34:55.442 --> 00:34:58.287
[MOCKING EVIL LAUGH]

00:34:58.287 --> 00:34:59.620
JONATHAN: I guess we're all set.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.300
I wanted to thank
you again for coming

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.120
to visit us and play with us.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.580
That was an incredible set.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.590
You guys sounded amazing.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.430
Not a surprise.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.630
HOLLIE COOK: It was
an absolute pleasure.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:10.620
It's very cool to be here.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.161
JONATHAN: Wonderful
to have you here,

00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:15.300
and best of luck on
the rest of your tour

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.539
and whatever comes next.

00:35:17.539 --> 00:35:18.830
HOLLIE COOK: Thank you so much.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.569
And cheers for coming.

00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:21.110
JONATHAN: OK.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.568
BLAKE COLLIE: Thanks
for having us.

00:35:22.568 --> 00:35:25.660
