00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, here's what I came up with.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Instead of returning the ranks directly,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
what I want to do is say under 1 condition,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
if the ranks is equal to this ace-high or ace-low straight, rather,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
then I want to fix it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Otherwise I want to leave it the same.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If the ranks is equal to this ace low--and we'll fill in that later--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
if that's the case, then what I want to return

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is a fix, which is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is the only time when I'm returning a 1 as a value.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Up here we had 2 and above.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There was no 1 that you could return.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But now an ace, instead of being 14,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we're going to count the ace as a 1,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and we're going to do that only in the case

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
when the ranks that we had so far was an ace, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which according to the sorting would have come out as 14,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
5, 4, 3, 2.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And I got the syntax backwards here when I did the insertion,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so what I want to say is return 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
which would be the correct ordering for where we want to put an ace

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
if we had ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, as our hand.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And for any other hand, just return the ranks as is.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And my claim is that this will make everything work because

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
now we've taken this one hand that was problematic,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we corrected it by making an ace be a 1 instead of a 14,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and now all the other comparisons of ranks will work out properly.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This will, in fact, be a straight because 5 - 1 is 4, and there's 5 different cards.

00:01:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And the high value in here will, in fact, be a 5 and not the ace.
