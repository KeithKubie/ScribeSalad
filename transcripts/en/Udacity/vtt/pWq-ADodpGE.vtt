00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.688
We've had practice finding the equations of horizontal and vertical lines, as

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:11.106
well as finding the equations of lines given two points or given a point and a

00:00:11.106 --> 00:00:16.796
slope. This last problem, we're going to look at parallel and perpendicular

00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:22.245
lines. So, this last problem, we want to find the equation of a line. The first

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:27.710
line goes through the point 2,4 and is parallel to the line 3x plus y equals 7.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.326
For the first problem, find the equation of the line that goes through the point

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:38.608
2,4 and is parallel to the line 3x plus y equals 7. For the second equation,

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:43.338
find the equation of the line that goes through the point 2,4 and is

00:00:43.338 --> 00:00:48.889
perpendicular to the line 3x plus y equals 7. You can put your answers here and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:51.410
put them in slope-intercept form.
