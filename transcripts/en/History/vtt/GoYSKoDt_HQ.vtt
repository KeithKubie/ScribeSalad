00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:03.128
ther one
of you's had a chance

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:04.212
to hold this weapon yet,

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:05.839
but I want to show you

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.298
a couple of details
about this weapon.

00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:09.426
This is a very rare weapon
for even our league.

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:10.885
With over 500 members,

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:13.513
there's only two of these
in the league.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.558
That is a massive,
hefty weapon.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:19.978
This -- What this essentially
is, is a huge cleaver.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:23.356
There's varieties of this
all through the medieval period.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.984
This one is the so-called
Maciejowski chopper.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.278
It's from, uh,
the Morgan Crusader Bible,

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.363
where we see it depicted.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:34.159
You see this ripping through
mail armor -- chain mail armor.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.495
But even on plate,
it's devastating.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.706
What it lacks
in maneuverability,

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.710
it more than makes up for
in sheer brutal hitting power.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.174
I think the technical term
for that, John, is holy [bleep]

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.633
Yeah.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.926
It's not a weapon that uses
a lot of finesse.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.720
Again, it's not
an elegant weapon.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.681
It's a pretty brutal,
straightforward, you know,

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:59.017
diagonal hit,
vertical hit.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.102
There's not a lot of play
with it.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:02.771
You're not gonna see
a lot of warding

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.481
and covering and binding.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.815
You're not gonna see
a lot of parrying.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:09.319
You're just gonna see
smash, smash, smash.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.533
You know, one of the scenes
in the Maciejowski Bible

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.702
is a warrior --
a knight, actually --

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:21.206
using this weapon and cleaving
somebody from the neck

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:25.210
all the way down to the wet --
the waist.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.586
Mm-hmm.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.171
It's a very bloody depiction
in that bible.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.756
Everything's
spilling out.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.257
I mean, you can just feel
the power in your hands

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.052
with this thing --
like the size of it.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.804
Now, the -- the grooves,
or fullers --

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:38.598
uh, they're there for one
reason and one reason only

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.059
on any bladed weapon --
to reduce its weight.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.519
That's their
sole purpose --

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.563
to reduce weight and create
a structural strength

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:47.315
to it, like an I-beam.
-Well, you can feel the weight.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.359
You can feel the weight
at the top of the sword,

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.902
at the -- the peak.
-Yeah.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:54.906
So it's an inelegant weapon,
but it is a brutal cleaver

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:59.828
that's going to chop,
hack, cleave into targets.
