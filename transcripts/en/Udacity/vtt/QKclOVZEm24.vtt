00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.860
An ideal solution would be semantic, and it would

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.900
validate properly. It wouldn't require Java Script or a

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.960
server configuration, necessarily. It would only load one copy

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.370
of the image, and it would work across all

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.920
browsers, and be accessible. Unfortunately, that solution doesn't exist

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.020
today. There's several solutions under discussion. Right now, it

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.980
looks like the end solution will be some version

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.630
of the picture element. Hopefully, this will be hashed

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.760
out in the relatively near future, so stay tuned to

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.220
the standards community for more. There's a link to the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.970
Responsive Images Community Group in the Instructor Notes. In the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.750
meantime, though, let's take a look at some other solutions.
