Hi, I'm John Green.
This is Crash Course Literature.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.140
And this week we're continuing our discussion of Gabriel García Márquez's 100 Years of Solitude.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.360
It isn't just the story of all those Buendias we talked about last time.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.280
Today we're going to zoom out a little and look at how this novel can be read as a fictionalized history of Latin America's struggle to emerge from colonialism.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.740
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! No no no no no, this is a made up book about, like, alchemy and raining flowers and stuff. There's no history!

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.880
OK, Me From The Past, I'm not going to get into a debate with you about what constitutes realness.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.960
I'm just going to point out that there is a television show that has just debuted in your world in 1994.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.340
It's called The Real World.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.480
That show doesn't meet every definition of realness because, you know, the people participating in it are aware of the fact that there are cameras.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.400
And yet the show The Real World in 1994 does have something to say about real life in 1994, albeit not as interesting as 100 Years of Solitude.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.440
So yes, today we are talking about magic, but we're gonna get real.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.500
[Theme Music]

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.580
So let's begin today with a quick look at the history that Gabriel García Márquez lived through and, in some ways, was writing about.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.300
Gabriel García Márquez was born in 1922 in the small river town of Aracataca, located in the northern region of Colombia, near the Caribbean sea.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.560
But decades before that, at the end of the 19th century,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.020
several companies that would later combine into the United Fruit Company, which later became Chiquita, began to cultivate the region.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.880
The American writer O. Henry coined the term Banana Republic in 1904 in a collection of short stories set in Honduras called Cabbages and Kings.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.880
And since then the term has become shorthand for any unstable Latin American country whose economy is tied to exporting a single agricultural product.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.800
Many historians consider Banana Republics to be examples of exploitative neocolonialism,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.020
like when a developed county uses it financial and political power to manipulate a developing country's internal affairs.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.680
And if that sounds a lot like regular colonialism, it is, but the difference is that in neocolonialism,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.500
it's business entities that do the colonizing, and there's no annexation of territory to a colonizing nation.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.120
So it worked like this: foreign investors arrived, often offering improvements to infrastructure,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.080
like railroads, roads, and ports, in exchange for land, and the investors also offered employment opportunities for local people.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.160
But in most cases, these were not good employment opportunities, and the companies usually had a tendency to underpay and mistreat their agricultural workers,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.440
and when the workers complained, investors would often resort to violence to keep order.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.160
Sometimes these foreign companies even funded military coups or established new governments.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.140
And foreign companies used these tactics in García Márquez's home town of Aracataca.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.360
The banana workers didn't have written contracts.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360
There were no restrictions on their work hours.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.100
They were partially paid in scrip, which are vouchers to company-owned stores.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.680
And when the workers went on strike in 1928, hundreds of men, women, and children gathered in the town square, thinking the governor would address these problems.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.540
But instead the Colombian army, apparently at the behest of the United Fruit Company, set up machine guns on rooftops and blockaded streets leading away from the square.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.400
And when the soldiers opened fire, hundreds were killed.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.540
So in 100 Years of Solitude, García Márquez memorializes the Banana Strike Massacre by combining documentary realism with fiction.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.500
As a genre, documentary realism attempts -- and I emphasize ATTEMPTS here --

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.260
to document the "truth" of events, whether they be large historical narratives or intimate portraits of individual lives.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:26.620
Like, in 1926 the film critic John Grierson described documentary film as the "creative treatment of actuality" and that's a good way of thinking about it.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.120
Our understanding of the past is always filtered through the lens of a witness or a writer or a photographer, et cetera.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.000
It's never entirely objective.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.580
The lenses through which "true stories" are told are usually privileged lenses.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:46.340
For instance, stories are usually told by those who survived them, and also by those who have access to distributing the story, whether it's a printing press or a TV station.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.900
But in 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez tries to tell the story of the colonization of Macondo through the lens of its inhabitants.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.260
And these locals do little as the outskirts of their town are transformed

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.140
"into an encampment of wooden houses with zinc roofs inhabited by foreigners who arrived on the train from halfway around the world."

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.080
The language used to describe the foreigner's arrival is, at first, realistic, even journalistic.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.700
Like, they build a "separate town across the railroad tracks with streets lined with palm trees, houses with screened windows,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.100
small white tables on the terraces, and fans mounted on the ceilings, and extensive blue lawns with peacocks and quails."

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.480
And that closely resembles the actual documented events that occurred in García Márquez's hometown.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.400
In other words, they're believable.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.420
And yet unbelievable -- that is unbelievably horrible events also took place,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.440
and as García Márquez evokes those events he replaces straightforward documentary with the language of mythology.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.920
And the changes here can be subtle.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.160
Like, the narrator describes the foreigners as being like gods.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.060
"Endowed with means that had been reserved for divine providence in former times,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.380
they changed the pattern of the rains, accelerated the cycle of harvests and moved the river from where it had always been."

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.040
And this invocation of mythology has some precedent.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.160
Like, the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss described mythology as providing imaginary solutions to real social contradictions.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.340
In his 1955 essay, The Structural Study of Myth, he writes that,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.280
"The kind of logic which is used in mythical thought is as rigorous as that of modern science,

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.040
and that the difference lies not in the quality of the intellectual process, but in the nature of the things to which it is applied."

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.580
So García Márquez uses magical realism to merge the logic of the visible world with myth in order to integrate multiple realities:

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.920
the perspective of the colonizers
and those of the colonized.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.880
And often the transition from documentary to fiction is marked with a moment of humor.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.660
Like, "'Look at the mess we've got ourselves into,' Colonel Buendia says at that time, 'just because we invited a gringo to eat some bananas.'"

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:46.060
The levity of these moments makes 100 Years of Solitude a lovable, memorable, human, and also approachable novel,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.180
but something very not funny is about to happen.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.720
After Colonel Aureliano Buendia announces that he is,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.040
"going to arm my boys so we can get rid of these shitty gringos,"

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.700
17 of his sons are summarily hunted down and executed.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:05.660
And if you are more upset with the fact that I just said "shitty" than by the events of the novel, then there is something profoundly wrong with your world view.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.860
17 of his sons are killed and the violence that follows is even more unbelievable.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:18.260
After workers protest "the lack of sanitary facilities in their living quarters, the non-existence of medical services, and the terrible working conditions"

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.380
and complain that they are not being paid in real money but in scrip, lawyers hired by the gringos dismiss their claims.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:31.060
The lawyers argue that the workers were not in the service of the banana company because they had been hired on a temporary and occasional basis.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.540
These "sleight-of-hand lawyers" are sinister magicians who use logic to deny the humanity of the local workers

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.120
and they succeed in proving that these humans, as García Márquez writes, did not exist.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.560
I mean, consider the implications here.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.500
If you can use scientific reasoning and logic to prove that human beings don't exist,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.000
then you need some kind of effective counter-logic to represent, you know, the truth.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And García Márquez demonstrates how this might work in his description of the massacre.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.500
Like, once again, he begins by having the narrator present a logical series of events based on historical facts.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.940
Let's go straight to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:13.440
After the workers strike, they are summoned to the plaza by the train station under the pretext that the provincial leader will make an important speech, and machine gun encampments are positioned on top of the station.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.400
The narrator first notes the unreality of the event, describing it as a kind of hallucination, and then he evokes the language of comedy.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.760
"The captain gave the order to fire and fourteen machine guns answered at once."

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.560
"But it all seemed like a farce."

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:34.800
This gets to how difficult it is to convey the magnitude of the tragedy and how language, in a way, kind of fails in the face of such tragedy.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:43.800
Ultimately, it's language that the sleight-of-hand lawyers have used to prove that people are not people and here, language kind of falls apart in the face of human reality.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.740
And then there's the unlikely detail that there are only two witnesses to this massacre.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.240
One is a young boy whose "child's privileged position allowed him to see the machine guns opening fire."

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.120
It's worth noting that García Márquez was six in 1928, the year the Banana Strike Massacre took place in his hometown.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.560
Years later, when that boy recounts what he observed, he's thought of as a crazy old man.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.600
The other witness is José Arcadio.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.400
Although his body is thrown into the pile of corpses, he is not dead.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.520
He escapes, returns home, and spends six months isolated in a room.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.900
Eventually, he emerges.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.740
"There were more than three thousand of them," was all that José Arcadio Segundo said.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.800
"I'm sure now that they were everybody who had been at the station."

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.600
He is also thought to be crazy.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:31.560
The madness attributed to these witnesses doesn't result from them being dislocated from reality, but rather from the rest of us being dislocated from it.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:38.540
The real madness in the novel is the violence, or pretending that it didn't take place, or using logic to prove that humans aren't humans.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.500
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.940
But what are we meant to do with this knowledge of a massacre that took place nearly a century ago?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.100
And furthermore, are we even meant to care about the characters in this novel?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.400
It sure isn't easy.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.420
There are so many of them, and they have the same names, and they have these unreal, supernatural qualities, and make terrible decisions.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:01.080
I mean, given that the Buendia family enacts a catalog of sins and vices, including, but not limited to:

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.580
pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, sloth, jealousy, meanness, child abuse, pedophilia,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.800
incest, suicide, murder, we might even find it pleasurable to observe their downfall.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.920
It really is like a smarter, better version of MTV's The Real World.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.420
But my point is that we feel distant from the historical events represented in the novel and distant from the characters who lived them,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.060
but I still think that we have a lot to learn from the story.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:30.320
Because I think, on some level, 100 Years of Solitude is a book about how to remember, and maybe even forget, ethically.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.180
The story clearly associates too much remembering with a kind of living death.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:40.740
Like, consider Rebecca, the child bride and eater of whitewash and damp earth who may or may not have shot her husband in the head.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.880
After the funeral, Rebecca locked herself in her house and

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.960
"buried herself alive, covered herself with a thick crust of disdain that no earthly temptation was ever able to break."

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.980
And that's pretty much the last we hear of Rebecca.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.740
She becomes fully-engrossed in the solitude of her memories.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.440
The town forgets about her and she has no impact on her community's future.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.980
But the novel also associates too much forgetting or amnesia with madness and futility.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:09.900
Like, consider Colonel Buendia, the former warrior who loses his memory and devotes his golden years to making tiny golden fish.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.160
He then melts them, remakes them, and melts them again.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.980
This might be a peaceful thing to do, but it's pretty useless.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.720
So how do we strike a productive balance between remembering and forgetting?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.940
Well, if the form of the novel is any indication, one possibility is to adopt a sort of speculative approach to history.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.380
This means combining the facts that we acquire from documentary sources with an understanding that springs from more creative works.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.420
And it also means including more voices in the "true story" of what "happened."

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.680
Knowing that 300 or 3,000 people died in a massacre doesn't really mean anything.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.220
Numbers don't really penetrate our defenses and often neither does language.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.940
But for me, at least, this novel's combination of realism and myth gets through my defenses.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.900
It is a story, to paraphrase William Faulkner, concerned not so much with the facts as with the truth.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.620
Lastly, I just wanna turn to the consolations and risks of solitude.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.160
So reading 100 Years of Solitude is a solitary act.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.580
Like the enormous Spanish galleon that José Aracadio Buendia discovers in the jungle, this novel seems,

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:15.420
"to occupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and the habits of birds."

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.240
But you emerge from that reading experience exposed to voices that you never heard before and you never would have heard otherwise.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.740
That makes you less alone, or, more precisely, more aware that you were never alone.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:33.720
In fact, you are deeply connected to the people, both past and present, who experience various forms of violence and exploitation on behalf of your interests.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:40.940
It is difficult and rare to hear those muted voices, especially those from the past, and that awareness is García Márquez's gift to you.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.020
What you do with it is your choice.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.040
