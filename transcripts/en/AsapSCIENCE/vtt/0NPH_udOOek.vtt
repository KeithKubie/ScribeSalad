00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.880
Your eyes help you see the world.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.480
But you can't see this dot

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.480
No, seriously!

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.060
If you close your left eye,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.740
stare at this cross here with your right eye

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.220
and slowly move your head towards or away from the screen,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.020
the dot will disappear.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.140
Revealing the exact location of your blind spot.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.600
The cells of the back of your eye

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.560
transforms light into signals that are

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.640
sent to your brain.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.980
But they are missing right here because

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.300
this is where nerves and blood vessels

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.480
connect to the eye.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.320
So anything at that point in your vision you can't see;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.780
a.k.a your "blind spot".

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.140
If we add a line through the image and you try again,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.340
you'll notice that your brain fills in information

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.360
and makes you think the line is continuous

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.360
instead of there being a hole in your vision.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
You also can't see all twelve of these black dots at once for a similar reason.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.380
Go ahead and try; chances are, you'll only see a fraction

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.600
of them at once.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.800
The exact point your eye looks at is focused,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.380
But your peripheral vision isn't great and so your brain

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.660
often makes assumptions for whats there.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080
Because of the consistent grey line pattern

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.740
your brain assumes the rest of the image is just like that

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.560
and misses the black dots until you look directly at them.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.880
These two rectangles are flashing out of phase with each other, right?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.540
How about now?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.920
For most, the rectangles will now seem to be flashing at the same time

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.140
in phase but they aren't at all.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.360
And yet if we move these shapes beside them

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.300
just a few pixels you'll begin to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.420
see them out of phase again.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.200
The surrounding area has a direct impact on how you see

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.040
and perceive things, even if the result isn't correct.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.020
Not convinced?

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.320
Look at these flashing squares.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.760
Except what you might not have seen is that the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.140
middle square isn't flashing at all.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.840
If you remove the outer square we see it for what it is,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.060
a solid colour.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.520
Now try reading the sentence inside it.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.740
Did you catch the extra word?

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.980
Your brain doesn't always notice extra mistakes like these

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.780
because it doesn't affect the comprehension of the sentence

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.560
and your brain would prefer to act quickly rather than be perfectly accurate.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.880
Try staring at the middle dot in this illusion.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.000
When the picture isn't moving the colours are clearly changing quickly

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.200
yet when the image starts rotating

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.640
the colour change either seems non-existent or much slower.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.140
Our eyes and brain have evolved to see

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.860
but our vision makes assumptions based on learning, memory and expectation

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.760
and all of these illusions take advantage of this adaptation.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.920
It's an advantage to have rapid information processing

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.000
so instead of taking in every bit of detail to be 100% accurate

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.660
which would cause a brain overload, your brain makes assumptions.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.500
This faster perception allows for

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.140
faster reflexes and faster unconcious and unconcious decisions;

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.540
an integral aspect of human nature.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.580
Much like this halo, if you stare at the centre dot long enough

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.080
the brain will simply make it disappear.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.980
It makes an assumption the information is unchanging or unimportant and

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.800
as a result you can't see it.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.780
