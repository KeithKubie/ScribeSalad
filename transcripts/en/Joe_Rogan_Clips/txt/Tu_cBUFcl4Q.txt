Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. So did you look at the heart before they put it in you? Did you get a chance to see it? No, no, no. I was out. Yeah. It was out by that time. Yeah. Wow. Nope. Didn't look anything. So you wake up, lights come back on. Yep. And uh, doctors, every wipes, they're doctors. They're my wife's there. And uh, it was, uh, you know, a new day and I was like, uh, I want, I kind of wanted to, I kind of wanted to say, and I told you so. Yeah. That was the first pop. That's hilarious. Do so told you. So it was a funny thing to say. Would you come back from a heart transplant because you would be a, you would be surprised at how many so funny though if you did say that. So true. So it was so many.

Speaker 1:          00:52          I got so many people and it was overwhelming support, but I got quite a few, well, too many for me, uh, messages with the engine. I hope you don't make it. I hope you die and your, I wish we did already know stuff like that. Do you feel I'm sorry for those people now? Oh yeah. Most definitely now. Now I do, you know, instead of being angry before and I was like, yeah, you don't choke the shit out of him. But you know, now, I mean, you gotta be, um, what, what is your, your existence must be pretty pitiful for you to, you know, feel that much hate for somebody that you don't even know, never even met. I just can't stand Joe Rogan. I hate him. I've never met him. My niggers sit down. There's no happy people that are doing that. It's so transparent.

Speaker 1:          01:46          You gotta be pretty, you know, pump believably miserable, miserable, miserable. I'm a file of Joe Rogan just so I can talk shit about them. I don't care. I wish Joe Rogan was off the air, but I'm following every word he says because I don't want to miss nothing to Joe Rogan has to say, but I hate them. Yeah. Makes no sense, man. Well, it doesn't make sense, but a lot of people don't make sense. That's true. People live their lives and just very counterproductive ways and they feel like as long as they've got something, they're excited about that, that they're doing something, even if it's excited about hating you for no reason, man. I just, I don't get it. Time is too precious to waste on hate. It's just foolish. It's just, yeah, it's a foolish way to exist. Yeah. I can take, they can take, uh, livers and hearts and different origins from any nationality and switching around were interchangeable. Joe. We are interchangeable or all one thing. Yes. The only thing that separates us is the climate that we came from. That's it. That's it. So, and it, it, it, it makes racism. So everything's stupid. Tribalism of stupid across the board. The conservative

Speaker 2:          03:00          versus liberal, that stupid southern versus northern bat. Stupid to Asian versus black versus Pakistani stupid.

Speaker 1:          03:09          It's all super. Those boots. All stupid. We're are any boat dude. We were all back there right there. So, you know, we all one, we wouldn't be entertained. It's this outer shit that's on top, this epidermis, the skin, this stuff that, you know, the fights and it's what makes us interesting.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Shabbat it, it's like what's fascinating to me is that human beings came from every single spot on the earth. Yeah. One time they originated in Africa and spread out all over the planet. Gapped individual environment. When you meet someone from Ireland, they're white, like paper. That shit's just because there's no sun that body developed. It's like a, a solar panel for vitamin D. They're like, we've got to figure out, I get fucking vitamin D, this black skinny cut, no fucking son out here. We don't need this melon. And cause we're not protecting ourselves from the sun anymore. So they turned white. Yes. Did the same exact thing.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Megan, take that guy from Ireland, guy from African and this guy needs a part. It's, hey, let me switch it up.

Speaker 2:          04:20          This gentleman here, Graham Hancock was on my podcast last week and he's a brilliant, brilliant guy, but he studies ancient civilizations and people and one of the things that they're studying now is, um, the various civilizations that we didn't even know existed that existed in South America. Like huge, multimillion size of population, um, civilizations in the Amazon, like 20 million people living in the Amazon at one point in time and they think they were wiped out by Spanish explorers. Um, in European explorers that came over game smallpox, like the way they've gone wiped out 90% of the native Americans. They think the same thing happened down there in the Amazon. It just, they had huge cities down there that European settlers had reported on. They were just wiped out. But the point is that we are, we were everywhere and it's all one thing. It's all humans. Human race. That's it man. And the funny thing about white people that are racist is that especially like I have a neanderthal DNA does more primitive than homosapien DNA and it's only in white people. Like, it's kind of funny that way, you know, cause white, white racists, like they have to deal with the fact that the only white people carry that in the Anatol shitting them. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:34          And do you think that, I don't think that they would find that a, a bad thing

Speaker 2:          05:41          after neanderthal DNA? No, I think they'd be a oh yeah. Oh, right. Yeah. They weren't smart enough to stick around for whatever reason. I don't even know why, you know, they don't know if we out bred them or we interbred with them or if we wiped them out when they don't even know what they, they're also finding new humans there. There's um, a human they found in Russia called a Dennis, I think it's called Dennis Sullivan is that he's had, and they just found more bones of them in Tibet. So they know that these Russian people, that was a totally distinct sub species of human traveled, traveled to Tibet. Yeah. And, and neanderthals lived for half a million years, so they were around way longer than weaver. We've only been around, I think for a couple of hundred thousand years. Homo sapiens. Yeah. So they were around longer than us, like by a factor of like somewhere around 300,000 years. Yeah. All over the world, man. Just what a crazy animal we are. We just travel everywhere and find a spot and adapt. That's right. We make it work. Stay in a community so you can help each other and live off each other and adapt. And unfortunately that's where all tribalism comes from too. That we have this tight knit group and everybody else, fuck everybody else. It's US versus them. And that's inside of us. You know,

Speaker 1:          06:53          we met, wouldn't it be great and, and, and this where I don't think that it's wrong. If you're attacking guy, I don't think it's wrong to be very proud of being Italian. I, and if you're a Polish guy, I don't think it's, uh, wrong to be very proud of being imposed. Why can't I be proud? Or why can't you be proud of being whatever race you are. You can be proud of that. But there's that me that I have to hate another guy because he's not, no. The racing game. You can be proud of what you are and not hate another guy for being different than what you are. How? How about we give dad

Speaker 2:          07:36          try? Well, I think the feeling that you got from the second chance on life, this beautiful feeling of appreciation and celebration of, of this existence, that's what we need to try to foster in people. Oh, we need to try to like, let people know this is, this is a temporary thing, man.
