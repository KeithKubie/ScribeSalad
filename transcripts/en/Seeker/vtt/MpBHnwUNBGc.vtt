00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.980
It turns out stegosauruses fought pretty dirty.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.210
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.030
If you’ve ever hit someone below the belt
in a fight you’re not alone.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.090
Dinosaurs weren’t much better.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.050
The Allosaurus was among the fiercest killers
during the late Jurassic period.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.960
Standing nearly 40 feet high and weighing
as much as a ton, these carnivores’ jaws

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.330
were filled with long, serrated, backwards
curving teeth that could rip the flesh right

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.449
off the bones of even the largest plant-eating
dinosaurs.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.869
Like the stegosaurus.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.350
The Stegosaurus, a fierce killer of plants,
was also built for self defense with its double

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.329
row of plates running along its back and large
spikes on its tail.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.420
Spikes it could use for a devastating crotch
shot.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.839
At least, that’s paleontologist Robert Bakker’s
theory.

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.469
Researchers recently found a fossilized allosaurus
with a circular hole in its pelvis.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.469
That hole was flanked by a well-preserved,
fist-sized abscess exactly like what one would

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.539
see around an infected puncture wound.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.329
There weren’t exactly humans running around
with beautifully carved spears at the time,

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.659
so the only logical explanation for this kind
of fatal wound in an allosaurus is hit to

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.210
the groin from a stegosaurus’ tail; a well-aimed
shot, even if it was accidental, could have

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.079
pierced the predators flesh and caused the
infection that killed it.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.939
For scientists, this kind of evidence is a
window into how dinosaurs fought and interacted.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.970
It’s also maybe evidence that our instincts
to fight dirty are a little more natural than

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.970
we might realize.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.799
So, are you guys above a good crotch shot
or would you happily take a leaf out of the

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.500
stegosaurus’ book in a fight?
