00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So welcome back to the afternoon.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.510
Thank you all for coming
back so promptly and it's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.630
with much pleasure I hand over to
Tom Learner to introduce the panel.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.830
Tom Learner, as you all
know, is the Head of Science

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.970
at the Getty Conservation Institute
and we always joke about the fact

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.180
that we usually have to go out
of the country to see each other

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.330
so I will hand over to Tom
to introduce our panel.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.570
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Fenella.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.770
We're missing one speaker,
who are we missing?

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.120
Oh, here we go.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.010
I'm going to keep my comments
very, very brief because we ran

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.950
over slightly this morning and we
have four fantastic speakers now,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.200 position:56%
each with 20 minutes so I don't want
to eat anything into that at all.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.610
The bios for each speaker
are in your pack.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.280 position:56%
This is a pretty impressive panel in
case you haven't figured this out.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.600
I was going to say four
heavyweights from Europe.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.450
I don't want to use that
term in any sort of mean way

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.220
but if these were people applying

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.560
for the European Council Research
Grants these would be the advanced

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.650
level, four very, very established
figures in the European side

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.200
of the conservation science so I
believe Michel you're up first.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.710
I'd like to welcome Michel Menu
from the [inaudible] in Paris.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.840
&gt;&gt; I will move closer to you.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.190
So access is the principle aim

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.150
of the integrated infrastructure
initiative which is [inaudible]

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.050
so as Luca said it's service
given to the community in order

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.220
to get access to cutting
edge facilities

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.990
and [inaudible] based system
installed inside the Louvre Museum

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.840
in Paris, was at the
beginning of this [inaudible]

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.370
after the first European project
called [inaudible] was the only

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.610
fixed lab facility.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.720
Building the theory of one message
I wanted to emphasize and to point

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.870
out after Luca is that
this opportunity we built

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.880
with Bruno Brunetti and Antonio
Sgamellotti at the beginning,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.560
it is the development
of this theory of icubes

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.640 position:56%
and LabTech was a networking project
[inaudible] enables us to have

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.600
in the future a permanent
infrastructure

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.680
and the other thing I
have to emphasize is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.260
that it's [inaudible] what is
difficult to give a definition

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.170
for that is heritage science is
natural science follows cultural

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.680
heritage and also the data process.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.030
So FIXLAB is inside IPERION now,
given by four facilities and,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:12.840 position:56%
two in Hungary, one is in
Debrecen, one is in Budapest and two

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.720
in France, Aglae inside
the Louvre Palace

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.280
and SOLEIL is Synchrotron
in Paris, near Paris.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.270
I will first of all describe
the four facilities in brief

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.720
and give some highlights which have
been achieved during [inaudible].

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.050
The purpose of FIXLAB is to
give access to large facilities.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.930
Access is provided by complementary
nondestructive instrumentation

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.940
which gives barely not visible
but elemental, structural

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:05.390
and chemical analysis and with
the neutron project I will show

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.980
that we are able also
to do some imaging.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.570
First, the first facility in
Hungary is Atomki in Debrecen.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.060
There's access to iron
beam techniques

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.420
through Van de Graff
particle accelerator

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.720
and Zita [inaudible]
is the coordinator,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.450 position:56%
the head of this project, the access
for cultural help so in brief,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.910 position:56%
IBA is a set of different techniques

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.630
which are energetic particles
inducing several excitations

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.900
of atoms and gives clues in order
to have a total elemental analysis

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.620 position:56%
with [inaudible] which maybe you are
more familiar with x-ray fluoresce,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.320
it's almost the same and for
the light elements [inaudible]

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.890
for instance you can use
the nuclear reactions.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.190
You may have also analysis
information in depth

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.670
from the first micrometers
from the surface.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.420
In Atomki, they have a nuclear
micro problem that means in vacuum,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.830
they can have a beam spot of
one micrometer in diameter

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.730
and can get elemental maps or
a concentration at this stage

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.100
but an external microbeam is
also available with about 20,

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.240
30 micrometers in diameter because
you have a spread of diffusion

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.700
of the beam and you may analyze
directly the object without putting

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.810
in vacuum, without any preparation.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.450
That's the team, Zika is here
and we know the IPERION community

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.720
and know her and also
her colleagues here.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.550
The second facility is Budapest
Neutron Center associated

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.210 position:56%
with the Wigner Center and it's
based on the nuclear neutron reactor

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.230
and gives several techniques
I will show now.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:22.170
The neutrons are used
for elemental analysis.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.810
You may get this kind of analysis.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.310
You can also achieve structural
studies with neutron defraction

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.710
or small angle neutron
scattering and also

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.770
with the neutrons it's
used for imaging.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:47.450
This example is given for an
Egyptian jar and the imaging

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.080
with neutrons of this jar
was most interesting in order

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.120
to understand what the
content of the jar was.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.420
That's the team.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.670
The head of the project
is [inaudible],

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.230
the BND welcome desk is [inaudible]

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.510
and also [inaudible] is the
coordinator of the access to BNC.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:19.160 position:56%
The third facility is SOLEIL, it's a
synchrotron of the third generation

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:26.190
which has been implemented
a few years ago south

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.250
of Paris in Gif-sur-Yvette.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:47.500
Among 20 beam lights, about
11 beamlines can be used

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.800
for [inaudible].

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.810
These are the applications
you may get.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:06.130
Frederique [inaudible] is
the leader for IPERION,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:18.200
the task leader for SOLEIL.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.360
You may have tomography
beamlines at SOLEIL

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.860
with ANATOMIX, PSICHE, and PUMA.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:18.440
I will come back to PUMA
a little bit later on

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.060
and give some information

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:34.230
with if you increase the resolution
you decrease the energy and so on.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.360
You have also microbeam
lines at SOLEIL.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.640
You have five beam
lines which can be used

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.400
for cultural heritage purposes.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:57.150
What is also said is that this
project is enhanced not only

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:03.800
on cultural heritage
artifacts per se but also

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:10.560
with paleontological artifacts.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.880
PUMA is the beamline which is
photons utilizes materiaux anciens,

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.760
it's an acronym and it has been
optimized for ancient materials

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.310
so that means cultural and
paleontological materials

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:31.040
and 60 percent of the beamtime will
be allocated for ancient materials

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:39.810
so the description of PUMA and this
beamline, which develops ongoing

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:47.460
at the moment will be open
in about a year from now.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:54.830
That's the team SOLEIL, more
than 300 people so it's headed

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.760
by [inaudible] and
[inaudible] is somewhere here.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:04.480
He's barely visible
but Frederick is here.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:11.100
AGLAE in my laboratory and a long
time ago I installed this machine

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.270
and at the moment it's stopped
for renewing and for new,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:26.730
to be completely transformed
and to be completely automatized

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:38.070 position:56%
to give better service to the people
and so it's a tandem accelerator.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:51.090
It's an American tandem accelerator
from Middleton Wisconsin Medicine

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.220
and this is the only accelerator

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:58.990
which is 100 percent
devoted to cultural heritage.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:05.370
Claire [inaudible] who is here,
is now the leader of the group

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.300
with three other engineers
[inaudible].

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:18.450
So now, for the recent
application and some highlights.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:25.550
The first highlight was sent
to me by Atomki and by Zita.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:34.940 position:56%
They analyzed glass weights in order
to answer to detailed composition

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.030
of this glass weights
of the [inaudible].

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:47.190 position:56%
Identification of the traces and the
other colors and in order to look

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.160
at the technology and
at the same time,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:14:00.230
the same Portuguese team sent
medieval glass from a site in Italy

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:05.420
and here are the samples
which are embedded in resin

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:12.180
and the questions are almost the
same composition characterization

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:20.170
and also the understanding of
the alteration of the glass.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:30.450
Another highlight has been given
to me by the Budapest Nation Center

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:37.500
and they analyzed by Daniella
DeMartino [assumed spelling] some

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:44.010
artifacts from the Milano Cathedral
and they analyzed and wanted

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.450
to understand the deterioration
of [inaudible]

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:54.690
which strengthens the
architecture of the cathedral.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:15:02.950
You have to trust me about
it because that's deep into,

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:08.630
it's not bright enough but here
you have cracks which are visible

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:17.170
by the naked eye but others are
not invisible and has been revealed

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:24.170 position:56%
to light with the neutron tomography

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:33.140
and even cracks considerably weaken
the strength of the materials

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.700
and it was interesting for
the architects in order

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.000
to restore the cathedral.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.830
Another example briefly
concerns this processional cross

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:53.830
with the same applicant
Daniella DeMartino,

00:15:53.830 --> 00:16:05.350
from an abbey in Italy close
to Milano and the results

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:10.730
of that was used not
only gamma activation

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:19.670
but also some XRF x-ray
fluorescence and other techniques.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:27.790
It's a silver cross which is gilded
and they will be able to confirm

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:36.850
through the presence of
mercury the amalgam technique.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:43.330
The last highlight I
wanted to present is one

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.800
which has been achieved
in my laboratory,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.270
the Medieval Kashi project.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:17:00.990
It's a lustered ceramics from Iran
and this map shows the invention

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:09.600
of the lustered ceramics in
Mesopotamia in the eighth century

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.550
of the Christ and this
technique spread all

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.230
over the Mediterranean
basin to arrive

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:25.150
in Italy during the renaissance
period so Egypt, Madrid, Spain,

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:33.090
and this technique
continued at the same time.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:42.810
This object is so valuable but
like this, you are not allowed

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:56.440
to sample them and so ion beam
techniques are very interesting

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:02.570
in order to show how
the stratification

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.660
of the lustre has been
achieved during this time

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.520
and so we have this
technique called [inaudible]

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.000
by scattering spectrometry

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.980
and through processing the spectra
you may analyze the different

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:31.510 position:56%
thickness of the lustre proper which
is small metallic nano particles

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:36.880 position:56%
which are embedded inside the glaze
of the ceramics and processing that,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:45.330
you may achieve the thickness of
the coating of nano particles,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.540
the thickness of the glaze,

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:54.780 position:56%
and how deep are these nano
particles embedded inside the glaze.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:01.450 position:56%
And so, you can achieve through that
this stratography and the glaze,

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:05.030
the lustre, the glaze
again, and the ceramic body.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.730
So thank you for your attention.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:17.100
[ Applause ]

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you Michel.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.050
We'll get through the
four presentations

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.800
and then there will be a Q&amp;A
answer session at the end.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.340
Our second speaker will be
speaking about the second

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.820
of the three services
under IPERION's CH dealing

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.860
with transnational
access so you just heard

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.960
about the FIXLAB work package.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.190
Antonio Sgamellotti,
Professor Emeritus

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.750
from Universita di
Perugia will now talk us

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:47.860
through the MOLAB work package
looking at mobile laboratories.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much so I will
speak about the mobile laboratory

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:10.920
and archives in IPERION CH and
we start with the archives.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:18.640
Archives were introduced in the
last project in CHARISMA [phonetic]

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.180
and it was a very successful
platform.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.910
It's the access to the
archive or European museum

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.130
in cultural heritage institution.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:38.610
We started with six institutions,
The National Gallery in London,

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.380
the Opificio delle
Pietre Dure in Florence,

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.590
the Centre de Recherche et
de Restauration in Paris,

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:50.800
the British Museum in London, the
Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.560
and the Cultural Heritage
Agency of the Netherlands.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:03.840 position:56%
In IPERION, there was an increase of
the institution giving the service.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.660
We now have the Instituto
del Cultural de Madrid,

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.140
the Centre for Art Technological
Studies and Conservation

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:16.890
of Copenhagen, the
Rathgen Museum in Berlin

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:22.870
and the Instituut Royaal du
Patrimoine artistique in Brussel.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:28.660
This is a physical assess,
it's not a visual assess.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:34.620
The archive contains
a lot of documentation

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:42.480
but not just documentation, also
samples, also cross sections and so

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.770
on and so forth and those
are in different sizes,

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:55.840
in different nations so
some examples for instance,

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.410
in Opificio della Pietre
Dure you get a lot

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:07.980 position:56%
of information concerning Rafael
data, cross sections refractography.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:13.890
In the British museum you get
information about the technique

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:23.780
of old statue as in ancient times
and then you get cross section,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:29.970
then you have a spectra, then you
have map so a lot of documentation

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.550
which can be very, very useful.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.970
Useful to whom?

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:41.180
To each other, you are always
the chairperson [laughter].

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.980
Useful to whom?

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:51.660
To researchers, that they want to
collect information for instance

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:58.000
on paintings, on the material,
colors, support, stratigraphy

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.220
and composition of grounds.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:06.090
Art historians or archaeologists
what want to carry

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.700
on provenance studies
on different techniques,

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.670
conservators and scientists.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:20.710
It's not working properly
but it doesn't matter,

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:26.320
there were some examples
for instance one researcher

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.680
from Czechoslovakia went to
the Opificio della Pietre Dure

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.650
to study the ground of
the 16th century painting

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:42.400
and there was a lot of information.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.040
This is a typical case.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.200
This is the [inaudible]
the famous [inaudible].

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.740
It's a tryptic but the three parts
are in three different museums

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:09.070
in Florence in [inaudible], in
the National Gallery in London

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:17.780
and the other one is in
Louvre, of course [laughter].

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.500
I always say [inaudible].

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:27.840
This was a case of a researcher on
this triptych and the best way was

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.860 position:56%
to go to the archives of these three
important institutions where a lot

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.760
of information is present.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:46.840 position:56%
In this you'll see some of the
people working in Madrid, in London,

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:52.300
and in Paris in a very
relaxed atmosphere

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.460
and also the environment
is very pleasant also.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.390
Now let's go to the mobile
laboratory which together

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:07.560
with the FIXLAB was the
first infrastructure

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:18.180
in the European project [inaudible]
just these two infrastructures

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:26.920
and then you see things are going
to increase according to the needs

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:32.940
of the cultural heritage community.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.090
In the previous CHARISMA,

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:40.400
we had just two providers
[inaudible] Perugia

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:49.610
and the Florence CNR and then
the Universita di Perugia

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:55.000
and very recently also
a regional laboratory

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.680
in [inaudible] joined
to this joint project.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.190
And then the CNRS in Paris,

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:06.120
these were the two
provides in the previous.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:13.720
Now we have some more providers,
FORTH Foundation for Research

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:21.240 position:56%
and Technology in Hellas, Heraklion,
The Nicolaus Copernicus University

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:29.110
in Torun in Poland and the
Aachen University in Germany.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.210
Which are the users?

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:42.560
The user conservator-restorers,
who carry out research

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.530
on innovative methods in
restoration and preservation just

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:53.500
to make an example,
conservation scientists who want

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:57.410
to integrate their
measurements by micro-sampling

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:02.540
with non-invasive investigations
and of course art historians

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:09.790 position:56%
and archaeologists who want to study
execution techniques in painting,

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:14.490
ceramics, sculpture
and a lot of art works.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:26.510
A few examples, this is a study
that was done by the MOLAB

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:32.240
and the title was [inaudible]
studies on the last judgment,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:39.020
which is [inaudible] and is in
the [inaudible] museum in Poland.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.730
What was the aim of the project?

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:49.910
It was to study changes in
design, details in the composition,

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:57.940
stages of under-drawing, different
characters of paint layers in order

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:08.270
to identify material,
technique, and also the artist

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:14.880
because probably it's not
just [inaudible] is present

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:24.430
in these big paintings and
the [inaudible] of the Academy

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.950
of Fine Arts in [inaudible].

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:33.290
I just want to point upon an
important which is in accord

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:41.870
to the European rules
[inaudible] in the data,

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:47.630
the intellectual properties
of the results according

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:52.360
to the European rules
belong to the users.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:58.380
They do not belong to the MOLAB
operators but to the users.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.130
Very often at the end
there is a collaboration

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:09.060
and very often there is
a common publication.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.870
That was a very, in a way,

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:23.790
long project because three MOLAB
facilities were involved, CNR,

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:31.900
the Universita di Perugia and the
CNRS for 15 days of in situ access.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.270
Usually the intervention
lasts five days

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.910
and you spend a lot
of time traveling.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:45.370
I want to say that in the last
12 years, we have been traveling

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:52.980
for more than 200,000 kilometers
in Euro which is quite a lot.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:58.630
Fifteen days, because there were
three different MOLAB facilities

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:03.340
operating with 10 MOLAB
operatos, four users,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.630
and sis non-invasive instruments.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:17.890
Which are here, XRF, mid and near
infrared, UV visible spectroscopy,

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.930
XRD, multi-spectral scanning.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.190
This is the MOLAB working.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:31.700
Fortunately, there were three
separate parts of the tryptic

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:38.250
so they were able to
work at the same time

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:44.040
on the three different parts
and we got a lot of results.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.800
I just want to show some of them.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:55.350
For instance, using FTIR
and also XRD and I want

00:30:55.350 --> 00:31:00.170
to stress the importance
to use different techniques

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.190
to get some useful results.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:09.770
In the gem of St. Michael's
there is pure lazurite while

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:15.650
in the blue dress of Mary
there is lazurite and lazurite

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:23.030
with little amount of diopside and
azurite in the [inaudible] while

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:33.360
in the reflection of the blue dress
from this piece there is azurite.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.470
The infrared didn't have
good results on this case

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:45.380
but we were able to get interesting
results using the refractions.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:52.890
For instance, we were able to
detect the lead tin yellow type I,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:59.570
the cinnabar, the [inaudible]
hydrocerussite and cerussite

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.800
and also using UV visible
[inaudible].

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:14.030
Very, very interesting were
the results with the reflector.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:20.100 position:56%
Some results were already known this
is for instance the visible light

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:30.000
and this is the x-ray ready
made by the user in Warsaw

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.220
and also there was some
refractograpy made but look

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:45.280 position:56%
at the difference in how you can see
the details using the refractography

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.140
of the [inaudible] CNR in Florence.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.180
You can see easily all
the details and according

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.660
to these results it's
probably the [inaudible].

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:03.370
Research is still in
progress from this one.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:09.650
All this results were reported, one
of the chapters of Science and Art,

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:20.340 position:56%
the Painted Surface by the Royal
Society of London, of which I am one

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:27.620
of the [inaudible] together
with my colleague [inaudible].

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:32.470
And as you can see, this
is a joint publication

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:40.480
between the user [inaudible] and
the MOLAB operator [inaudible].

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:49.570
Passing from the previous CHARISMA

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:57.650
to the [inaudible] there was
also an increase of technique.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.820
We already had point
chemical analysis

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:07.170 position:56%
but we include more other techniques
like multi/hyper spectral imaging

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:11.230
and the visible near
and far infrared

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:17.050
and also x-ray fluorescence
scanning including 3D surface

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:23.240
and volume image which
were implemented

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:29.240
in the joint research activity
of the previous project.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:34.290
There is a strong connection
between the joint research activity

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:42.330
which has the mission to improve
the facilities in the MOLAB

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.510
so they implement new
instrumentation

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:49.880
and once they were tested and
they are well functioning,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.670
they became part of the MOLAB

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:56.360
so there is just a few
examples [inaudible].

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:05.480
You see, this is a
collaboration with the [inaudible].

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:11.640
This painting of the 15th century
was completely black probably due

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:18.090
to fire in the chapel and it was
almost impossible to read but look

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:25.540
through mapping, the different
elements lead, copper, alum,

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:31.560
gold and iron, you can see easily
and so you can be a good guy

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.860
in the restoration process.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:41.210
Spectral imaging, this is some
of the work that University

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:45.200
of Perugia did in which
it was possible apart

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.710
from the lead [inaudible] to
detect some important pigments

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:58.440
like [inaudible] in red,
emerald green which is in green

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:06.450
and aquamarine, which is in blue.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:16.090
Then, from the fourth digital
[inaudible] it was used to reveal

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:22.150
in situ detachments,
cracks and other defects.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:27.780
The purpose was the examination
of 19th century ceiling

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:36.110
to assess detachment and
cracks through the defect map,

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:41.140
risk map comparison
with conservators maps.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.560
This is a mobile single site
[inaudible] provided by [inaudible]

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:50.360
and you can get information
about the depth profiling

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:56.650
of hydrogen containing
materials in stone,

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.610
mortar, paintings and so forth.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:04.990
[Inaudible] tomography provided
by Torun in Poland for examination

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.410
of layered structures in easel
paintings and this is a project

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.880
in collaboration with the
Opificio della Pietre Dure

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.690
under Leonardo and that's all.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:25.290
The next call is coming
soon the 15th of February.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:31.830
Usually there are two calls which
are 15th of September and 15th

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.680
of February so if you
are interested,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.610
the call is almost
ready to be announced.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.510
Thank you very much.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:48.120
[ Applause ]

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you Antonio, and I
know there'll be some questions

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.100
about submitting samples
and projects

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.940 position:56%
for these things when we got to Q&amp;A.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:02.260
Our third speaker is Jorgen Wadum,
who seems to be Director of many,

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.620
many places in Copenhagen but the
quickest way is perhaps to talk

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.180
about the new Center for
Art Technological Studies

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.550
and Conservation called CATS,
and Jorgen is going to be talking

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:18.850
about the corporation networking
side of IPERION CH so Jorgen.

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:22.710
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:26.870
Well, you introduced the whole
gang up here as being very old

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:31.330
and mature consortium and true
you are of course however, CATS,

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:35.110
which is a small national research
infrastructure comprising the

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.950
National Museum of Denmark,
the National Gallery of Denmark

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.110
with which I'm working, and
the training school facilities

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:45.520
at the Royal Academy of Fine
Arts Training for Conservators,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.810
we only joined this group of
excellent researchers very recently

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.520
when IPERION was established,

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.140
after all the other preparatory
research infrastructures

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.960
so we are entirely new in this but
never the less, we have been tasked

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:09.150
with the task of facilitating
a corporation

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.420
and networking internally
within IPERION and also to reach

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.170
out to users and users
outside IPERION in order

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:20.980
to promote European cultural
heritage science and we are

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.240
of course, as you can see on the
slide, and which you will have

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.140
on the website of this
institute afterwards,

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.950
we wanted to foster
cooperation and action

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.070
with heritage science communities,

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.890
all users of the transnational
access points

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:37.190
that we just heard about,

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:40.630
and potential scientific
industrial partners.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:44.650
We also want to address more widely
the multidisciplinary researchers

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.020
and stakeholder's concerns with
this research area including both

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.140
conservators but also curators,
historians, archaeologists

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.930
and whoever is working with
cultural heritage optics also

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.050
within as I said, industry
or institutions or small

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:02.180
and medium sized enterprises.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:07.130
The specific objectives are
many and you can see them here.

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:12.290
It's focused on high level
advocacy of the expert meetings,

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:15.310
we want to make hands on workshops,
I'm going to mention a few

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:19.470
in a moment, seminars, and
to disseminate this as widely

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:23.250
as possible and hopefully to
engage as many of you as possible

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:27.230
in the audiences when they
are open for everybody

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.740
but we also organize
more internal workshops

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.660
where it is the IPERION
partners that collaborate

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:41.410
with maybe a few stakeholders that
we take in to be operating not

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:47.630
within a vacuum but within still
the surrounding environment.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.900
We also want to carry out a number
of best practices and protocols

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:56.740
to develop this to publish them
for all of you and to carry

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.800
out foresight studies
as you can see in order

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.800
to identify future
research priorities,

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.990
what we heard about earlier today

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.610
and opportunities for
innovation in this.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:13.120
You can see the acronyms CATS,
and CNR, and ND and [inaudible],

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.410
they are the institutions
that are in charge

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:23.250
of these individual projects
within work packets nine.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:27.240
What we are doing in CATS
is trying to take care

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.050
of the knowledge exchange
activities,

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:34.420
establishing these best practice
protocols together with the CNR

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:40.240
so Susanna Bracci, who is not
here and with Marika Spring,

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.340
representing the National
Gallery we worked

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.470
on these foresight studies I
just mentioned and Erik Buelinckx

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:53.580
from KIK-IRPA will work on
creating digital data management

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.640
and procedures for this.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.410
This will start later on in the
project and we do not have much

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:03.620
to share on this from my
side at this very moment.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.840
We have a lot of deliverables
that we want to share

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:12.790
that will be visible on our website
and eventually published also

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:18.050 position:56%
on other media, reports and surveys,
analytical data expectations,

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.490
we have recommendations of best
practice etc. We have a whole range

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:26.700
of deliverables that you can see on
the IPERION home page and they go.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.860
We are supposed to have a very
busy four years of research

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.600
and presentations as you can see.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.800
Well, some of these activities
have taken place of course.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.270
We have had an International
Conference on Glazed Ceramics

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:45.520
in Architectural Heritage which was
the first conference we organized

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.220
within the current IPERION network
and the aim of this conference was

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:54.710
to discuss [inaudible] and other
architectural glaze ceramics

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:58.400
of historic interest
manufactured and applied anywhere

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.750
that they may have been, their
characteristics, the decay,

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:05.960
and the conservation of
these kinds of objects.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:11.100
It was a conference that
was attended by 81 delegates

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.560
from a lot of different countries.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.860
Well, that was the top one.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.580
The second one was
more internal workshop

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.650
with just a few stakeholders

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.980
from outside the
conservation/restoration community

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:28.410
of the Netherlands, Cleaning of
Paintings and Protection of Metals.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:31.840
It was a workshop organized by
[inaudible] from the [inaudible]

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.190
in Amsterdam in collaboration also

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:40.250
with a joint project initiative
research project called CMOP

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:43.800
which is an abbreviation of
Cleaning of Modern Oil Paints,

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.890
which is a consortium between the
University of Amsterdam, the Tate,

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:52.280
the Getty, and a number of
other partners that work

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:56.170
on identifying safe cleaning
of modern oil paints.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.020
Again, there's a relationship
with [inaudible],

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:05.920
which is another project
running until 2018 actually.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.200
It is [inaudible] who is
sitting here in the auditorium

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.060
who is the project leader of
this project about the cleaning

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.880
of modern oil paints but
the workshop there was more

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.760
of internal character
defining what kind of practice

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.390 position:56%
and projects would be most relevant.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:29.030
Another project was Investigating
Heritage Material with Safer Ion

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.360
and Photon Beam Experiments.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:39.680
It took place as a collaboration
between the [inaudible] in Paris

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.240
and the meeting was also there,

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.880
attended by a huge
crowd 40 participants

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.730
and 30 guests from aound the world.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:51.030
Eighteen countries were represented
and the program included a part

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.590
from [inaudible] presenting also
recent advances, also round tables,

00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:00.490
[inaudible] and open sessions for
the people attending this meeting.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.690
In Copenhagen, organized in
collaboration between the Prado

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:08.420
and the National Gallery in London,

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:13.760
CATS hosted a workshop called
Preparation for Painting, Grounds

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:19.950
and Primings in European
Paintings 1500 to 1800,

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:26.030
and this was a workshop, which
is operating very closely

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:30.770
with workshop eight, which is led
by Joe Padfield and Marika Spring

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:32.070
from the National Gallery.

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:37.230
You will hear more about this
from Joe in a while, I'm sure.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:47.130
quantities of data like
cross-sections that we have heard

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:52.280
about in the previous
speaker will lie in archives

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.910
and be accessible via arts lab
but if we could digitize them

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:58.920
and put them online, we could
share them with the world

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.250
and you could share
yours with us probably.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:06.180
So, the idea is to create a
Europe-wide scale collaborative

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.090
development between
conservation science

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.840 position:56%
and digital documentation
specialists to more efficient access

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.580
to cross-sectional data,
improved data comparability

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.290
across the consortium.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:24.540
You may imagine that photographs
are cross-sections made in one lab

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.760
with one set of filters
are difficult to compare

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.560
with cross sections of the same
artist materials in another lab

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.660
with a different set of filters,
although we call them the same type

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.030
of either UV or natural
light, whatever.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.980 position:56%
We hope to come up with
suggestions for this over the course

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:49.390
of the IPERION research area.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:54.080
We also had a conference where we
were studying European Visual Arts

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.830
1800 to 1850, hosted
by CATS in Copenhagen

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:01.660
and this was a technical art
history conference because we tried

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.010
to bridge conservation science

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:09.130
to the hardcore humanities art
historians and they are not,

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:12.870 position:56%
some art historians fall asleep when
they see cross section number three

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:16.260
and scientists may do the same

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.700
when they see I don't know how
many images of something that they,

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.940
but we want to bridge this and
make questions and maybe try to see

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.560
if what we call technical art
history is actually not just art

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.690
history as it was in the past
with an added scientific value

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:38.750
of the analytical data that science
can produce for the understanding

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:42.170
of cultural heritage
objects in general.

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:47.490
So we're studying this over two
days and we have participants also

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:51.210
from the US in this conference

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:55.210
and then we've just had our
first doctoral summer school,

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.240
advanced characterization of
techniques, diagnostic tools,

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.190
evaluation of methods
in heritage science.

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:07.800
It took place in Madrid and was
organized by the IPERION in Spain.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:13.380
This doctoral summer school
will provide advanced lectures

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.530
on analytical and diagnostic
tools for students

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:21.800
and the lectures were
including up to date development

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.780
in conservation materials
and recent advances

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:31.820 position:56%
of all the aspects you would need
to be put in front of in order to go

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:39.040 position:56%
out and work in our sector and there
were 30 students attending this

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.400
summer school, also from
14 different countries

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.430
within the European community.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:52.280
Forthcoming meetings Intangibility
Matters is an international

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:58.900
conference that the LNEC in Lisbon
is organizing in May '17, two days,

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:03.110
which will look at the immaterial
sides of tangible cultural heritage

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:07.180
and discuss all sorts of
aspects related to the values

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.960
and reflections, etc. Keep an
eye out for the announcements

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.510
for this conference, I bet it's
going to be very interesting

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:20.120
for those working with
intangible matters.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:28.200
There will also be a
joint project initiative,

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:34.790
so next conference taking place
two days after in Beja in June,

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:38.270
also working in that
same direction and trying

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:42.260
to investigate objects
of that nature.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:48.250
The ion bean photon workshop was
so popular that the members wanted

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:53.740
to have another one so another one
also is popping up in '17 in June.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:58.250
It will be taking place in
Amsterdam and organized by the ICN

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:03.160
in collaboration with NICAS and
other partners so keep an eye

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.290
out for that for those
of you who are interested

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.430
in these kind of workshops.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.670
And then finally, there will be
an international conference called

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.400
Tempera between 1850 and 1950,
a painting technique at the dawn

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.970
of modernity which will be held
at the Doerner Institute in Munich

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:24.750
and it has to do with
in recent years a new

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:28.120
and profound attempt was made to
explore the complex research field

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.300
of tempera painting in the
19th and 20th century which has

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:39.310
until now only been very
briefly discussed in literature.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:45.020
We want to organize here a two
day program which also will look

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:49.850
at the sources of the
studio practice, materiality

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.170
and of course the art
historical aspects

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:57.160
of why is tempera painting having
a revival at that particular moment

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.980
and how can that assist us in
understanding you could say,

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:04.280
the bigger picture of the moment,
the interaction of technology

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:08.460
and aesthetics in painting
of that particular period.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.360
There will soon here in December
be a call for contributions

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.030
to this conference so keep
an eye out for this too.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:20.610
Well, drawing into other
work packages then the one

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:26.280
that CATS is particularly in
charge of is a work package her

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.560
on establishing cross disciplinary
best practices and protocols.

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.190
Susanna Bracci had
been making a survey

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:39.150 position:56%
and had asked colleagues primarily
in the European community to reflect

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:45.110
on best practices within analysis
and treatment of a variety

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:49.740
of objects and materials that we
encounter in our cultural heritage

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:55.610
at [inaudible] and this report
will be coming out pretty soon

00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:00.880
and will be the basis for
further research within IPERION

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.650
such as the foresight studies
and best practices and protocols

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:11.560
but mainly the foresight studies
and as I'm mentioning here,

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:18.380
which is aiming at exploring
the idea within IPERION not

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.440
to replicate what's
already been done elsewhere

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.200
in the development
heritage science strategies

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.260
but to consider the question
from the point of view

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.250
of developing strategies

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:37.510
that support the research
infrastructures examining what

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:39.190
instruments and tools
might be needed

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:43.490
to address the research priorities
being identified by the group

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:47.400
and where and how these are
needed to fill the gaps.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.520
This work is also ongoing

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:56.780
and we have research results
coming out as they emerge.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:07.960
There will also be a course
planned in November '17 in London

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.810
and combined with the second
user meeting taking advantage

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:14.200
of the presence of an audience
of stakeholders in London.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.800
The date has been chosen

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.630
to immediately precede another
planned IPERION workshop activity,

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:23.230
a colloquium on 3D imaging to
be held at the British Museum

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:27.010
on the 10th of November,
2017 so you're well ahead

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:31.380
and can start saving up
for the travels and we hope

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:37.520 position:56%
that you'll draw a lot of
participants from also this country.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:46.330 position:56%
Leading up to the speakers of
tomorrow also, we have a work packet

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.370
or task in the work packet
networking and external cooperation

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:55.100
on heritage digital data management
exploitation use and reuse.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:54:00.730
It's a very long title for this and
it is Erik Buelinckx from KIK-IRPA

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:06.370
in Brussels who is coordinating
this and I should say it's earlier,

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:10.970
the project is beginning to form
itself now and in the beginning

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:15.090
of '17, a first survey will be
carried out within this network

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:21.110
to identify and gather all relevant
information regarding the task.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:22.800
The main point of interest will be

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.780
to define a broader
network also outside IPERION

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:31.780
and to see how the
questions will be geared there

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:38.470
to involve DARIAH-ERIC
and other stakeholders.

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:44.530
Sharing data is something
that some fields

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:48.020
in the humanities are not
very good at I daresay.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.480
Others are very good at them.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.210
I believe that conservation science

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:54.530
and conservators are
sharing quite a lot however,

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:58.250
there are still elements
within research data

00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:59.700
that are not being shared.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.120
Let me just mention one,
dendrochronological data.

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:08.180
That is kept very strict
to the people who do this.

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:12.610
Maybe we should discuss how that
could change for the benefit

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:15.650
of the entire field and the
cultural heritage objects,

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:20.520
where you can combine of
course, knowledge about climate,

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:25.400
heritage objects, either
electronics, paintings, sculptures,

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.420
archaeological wood and everything
comes together there and can be

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.330
of huge importance for the field.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:34.590
So having said all this and having
showed you two slides very quickly

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:36.730
here that you haven't
got time to read,

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:39.170
I think I will simply just
say thank you and keep

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:43.060
up for the slides you will
get, and I hope that many

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.010
of you will join the
network activities

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:46.330
that we organized within IPERION.

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.130
Thank you very much.

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:56.840
[ Applause ]

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.380
&gt;&gt; Thank you Jorgen and thank you
actually for all three speakers

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.660
so far for being very punctual
and in fact a little bit early.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:06.170
We're catching some time
up so no pressure Georgios.

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.630
You have to no let us down.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.810
Our final speaker,
Georgios Karagiannis.

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:13.820
He's behind me right, yes,
the Scientific Internal Head

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.330
from the Diagnosis Centre
of the Ormylia Foundation

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:20.230
in northern Greece and he'll
be talking about the knowledge

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:24.950
and innovation technology transfer
research going on in IPERION CH.

00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:41.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
for being here.

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:45.050
I'm going to talk about knowledge
innovation and technology transfer

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:50.190
in IPERION project, which is a
rather difficult lecture actually.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:54.390
Since our cultural heritage is
our common memory and knowledge

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:57.880
as human beings, one of the main
concerns should be the cultivation

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.180 position:56%
of the current and next generations.

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.870
We do believe that and
so UNESCO guidelines

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:07.120
and documents are indeed fostering
consciousness of our culture

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.660
through the cultivation of the
current and the next generations.

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.360
All this is in accordance
with UNESCO.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.580
Also, the technological
development and the living data

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:18.910
of the technological development

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:21.390
so our endeavor should
also focus the cultivaion

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:26.710
of the next generation towards
the cultivated use of technology.

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:32.630
I would say that technology and
culture are things that go together

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:38.190
but technology, as you know, is a
Greek word related to the techni

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:43.400 position:56%
which is art and which is also the
craft creation actually and the term

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.900
of logos which is actually
our wisdom finally,

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:50.050
and finally our spiritual heritage.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.690
IPERION project is not far
away from this main idea

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:57.180
and this main target I would say,

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:03.660 position:56%
because we are using IPERION
various different kind of radiations

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:07.600
and state of the art prototypes in
order actually to make endoscopy

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:12.150
of an object and search the
deepest information of these

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:15.660
and the deepest hidden
beauty of the art objects

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.610
which is actually providing
us the possibility

00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:21.160
to create new cultural richness.

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.450
This is very important
because the self-consciousness

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:29.160
that we are achieving using the
results of the analysis is more

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.560
or less an exercise about
our self-consciousness,

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.580
according to Socrates,
which means [inaudible]

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.300
and this is a great
power actually in order

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:43.060
to create a new heritage
and a new art.

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:47.810
Well, within this vision I would
say that now as you have seen

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:49.830
in the morning and
from other presenters,

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:54.110
we have accumulated knowledge
within this series of projects

00:58:54.110 --> 00:59:00.450 position:56%
which actually LabsTech was
initiated in some initial discussion

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:05.740
of [inaudible] based on a
previous existing network.

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:09.030
Again, something started
again from Greece here

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:18.100
and of course this accumulated
knowledge is enriched using these

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:23.470
access actions and by acces actions
we are gaining advanced knowledge

00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:27.020
because we are not
providing our analysis only,

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:33.650
but we are gaining much
knowledge from the users.

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:39.070
Michel and Antonio talked
about these actions before.

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:43.940
I would say that the knowledge and
the innovation that we are gaining

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.460
within these projects and actually
in IPERION project is mainly based

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:52.030
on transnational access and
the joint research activities

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:56.060
that are main pillars
of the project.

00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.580
I would say that now, Professor
Antonio Sgamellotti we are

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:04.040
in the position to say that
we have a new heritage.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.620
It's not only the heritage of
the data that we have acquired

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.300
from cultural heritage objects
but it's also the creators

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.380
of the technology platform
that we have

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:16.110
and this technological platform
provides us the possibility o have

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:19.410 position:56%
this osmosis between the communities
of the technology provides,

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:22.770
the chemistry, physics, and
engineers with art historians

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:28.730
and the conservators and this is
now made practice so I would name

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:31.670
that this is a blessing and
finally a blossom of a new science.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:36.970
This is my dimension
about heritage science

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:40.460
and of course the incarnation
of innovation

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:44.390
in IPERION project is mainly based
on the diagnostic instruments

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:47.410
which we are going to talk
tomorrow about, diagnostic methods,

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.400
and the data that we are producing.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:55.090
These are the three actions that
you have been presented before.

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:57.530
So what are we offering?

01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:02.070
We are in the position to
make analysis of various kinds

01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:07.480
of objects, paintings,
byzantine icons, metallic objects

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.930
or various metallic materials,
ceramics, wall paintings,

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:16.720
glass objects and using these
techniques like optical tomography,

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.230 position:56%
non-radiating imaging, spectroscopic
mapping imaging or [inaudible],

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:28.720
acoustic microscopy new techniques,
nuclear magnetic resonance,

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.650
[inaudible] imaging, we are
providing to the end user

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:36.870
in the community two dimensional
mapping images of the materials

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:41.410
or [inaudible] and
finally combining them

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:46.560
with tomographic information
we are edging to having

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.950
by the coupling points
of the analytical points

01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:50.520
and the imaging methods,
high resolution

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.860
and fidelity 3D tomographic
information

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.560
with all the qualitative
information embedded on them.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.490
So this finally provides
us the possibility

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:04.380
to support the vivid navigation of
the adventure of the art objects

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:07.920
in time and in space so we
can navigate in the beauty

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.040
of these objects while
the time passes

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.150
in the space that they were found.

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:15.000
I had a mind to give some paradigms

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.690
which will be presented better
tomorrow in my presentation,

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:23.270
just to be coherent with
the previous speakers,

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:27.530
in order to have a more vivid
information about the kind

01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:31.350
of information that we received.

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:37.730
Sorry, we can go here next.

01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:42.740
Of course, this is, I took from our
colleague Hilda some [inaudible]

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.780
on some cases.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:50.280
The kind of [inaudible] that we
have is by infrared refractor

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.130
for instance, the art
drawings beyond the visible

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:54.880
so we have information
about what happens in the

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.400
under layers of the object.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.080
And of course, in this case for
instance we can reveal foils

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.140
on the gold leave in specific
areas of the art objects.

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.690
And then, using Tera-Hertz

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:10.810
for instance imaging we
have better penetration

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:15.300
than the infrared imaging,
revealing the hidden gold

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.780
in specific art objects.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.750
Mapping images as Antonio
had presented before,

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.650
we have [inaudible] with
the materials on it as well

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.210
as using synchrotron based
x-ray methods, we have evidence

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:30.410
of the degradation on the
material on the surfaces

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:38.160
as in the other layers and
then we have mapping images

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:45.560
and also hyperspectral imaging we
can observe better the distribution

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.060
of the [inaudible] of the object.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:54.260
And finally, tomography
is [inaudible] here

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.440 position:56%
with which we can navigate the depth

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.510
of the information the object
revealing the pathology

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:08.450
of the application with various
varnishes in the pigments in depth.

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:13.380
Since philosophy means Praxis, in
work package 11 of IPERION project,

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:18.200
we are trying finally to transfer
this innovation and recommendation

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.510
about art objects to
the industry and mainly

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:27.720
to small medium enterprises
and vice versa, I'm not sure.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.010
The osmosis between research
community and industry

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:33.850
or mainly SMEs will be stressed
targeting to the creation

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:36.340
of novel products and
spin off companies.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.970
These guidelines of European
Commission [inaudible]

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:44.130
and I do believe the market
needs such kinds of actions

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.030
but this action is
multidirectional interaction,

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:52.250
I would say because this processes
that are needed to be done in order

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:58.010 position:56%
to reach such a target are
unidirectional and are characterized

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:01.770
by the interactions in order to try
to match the supply with the demand

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:06.860
so we have to see what is a demand
and what is a market behind this

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:11.160
and in this case there
are many factors actually.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:19.210
Mainly, the researchers/us which
have to place their ideas in order

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:24.300
to chase for new funding and then
the other side we also have the

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.790
institutions where they
have to adapt themselves

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.900
to new global European and
national research policies and what

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.990
about the social impact
in assessment?

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:40.640
We have to have a turnover to
the society about the findings

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.510
that we were gaining and give
this knowledge to the society back

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:48.590 position:56%
and then the companies are the other
actors in private sector which need,

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:53.210 position:56%
indeed in the planet the companies
need new ideas and new opportunities

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:55.490
in order to overcome recession.

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:59.410
And finally, the government,
the decision makers who want

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:02.270
to assess their investment in
order to account for their policies

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:05.410
and here we have to fight
towards the governments in order

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.600
to take care of cultural heritage.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.100
And the various actors of
course imply various needs,

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:16.510
which much be coordinated
an then main channels

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.850
for research results transfer

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:21.110
up to now have been the traditional
patents databases usually

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:26.330
in the patent offices Of course,
these kinds of channels in order

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:30.830
to disseminate your knowledge,
the patents are restricted

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:36.590 position:56%
and they are not so well
accessible via the web technologies.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:41.600
Therefore, we thought that new
instruments are needed in order

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.730
to transmit the knowledge and
social media is a kind of tool

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:49.820
in order to do this work.

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:55.090 position:56%
Because of their features, scholarly
community has increasingly employed

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:57.950
social medial in order to
communicate their results

01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:01.410
in a better and faster way
and furthermore studies

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:05.380
about new metrics based on
social media are being developed.

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.330
What are the existing tools?

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:14.270
The existing tools of social media
are like LinkedIn or Academia,

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:19.480
ResearchGate, okay
Facebook, I don't believe that

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.100
but in any case this
is also social media.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.490
This situation is so the power

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:26.150
of social media is constantly
increasing, indeed it is increasing

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:27.920
and the new generations
are using them.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.070
For this reason, we thought that
the ad hoc social media focused

01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:34.510
on innovation and technology
transfer could increase the

01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:38.450
communication between various
actors that I presented you before

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:40.300
and the whole innovation system.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.740
So, in order to maximize
the technology transfer

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:50.370 position:56%
within the IPERION project, based
on common interests between industry

01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:51.690
and research area, we
are looking forward

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:54.330
to win to win collaborations.

01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:59.280
A new tool, we decided to develop
a new tool which is named SpinBook

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.490 position:56%
which was developed by IRCrES and
finally was adapted in collaboration

01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:07.570
with the ORMYLIA Foundation
for the needs

01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:10.400
of work packet 11 of
the IPERION project.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.510
While I'm presenting you first
this tool that is placed now

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:22.330
into operation and from now
on we will start using this.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.990
SpinBook considers all
types of actors involved

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:28.090
in the innovation process
from researches to companies,

01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:33.400
public administration, investors,
intermediaries enterprises.

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.550
These are the stakeholders of this.

01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:40.750
We expect that SpinBook will
be used by various actors.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.980
Political decision makers and
universities should also use this

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:47.570
so as far as one can
enter to the system

01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:52.330
to build a profile identifying
himself as a researcher

01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:56.720
or enterprise or broker, or
founder, or public administration.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.890
You make a login and you
make a profile there.

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:04.520
Also, we expect that
industrial sector should be able

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.410
to access the selected hi-tech
information in order to assess

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.830
in a reliable way the
economic potential of the range

01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:14.210
of available skills and to
have the chance to acquire it

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:16.270
within a short space of time.

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:21.370
The industrial sector is there.

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:28.980
I can skip this, so then in
SpinBook, we have the possibility

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.320 position:56%
to have a direct communication among
these profiles so SpinBook aims

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.370
to set up a social room
between all the actors

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.700
for the innovation process giving
them a sustainable visibility

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.810
and also giving a boost
to new ideas and projects.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:48.970
We have concrete control of
the data and careful validation

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:52.500
so when you are filling your
profile you are filling some basic

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.830
information related to the
research and to the institution

01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:59.050
in order to identify them.

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:01.080
This can be done in some minutes

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:06.280
and then this is a real-time
system informed real-time

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.380
so the various factors among
them can start communicating

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:13.610
and exchanging ideas
but the core objective

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:16.850
of SpinBook its powerful search
engine inside, with the capability

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:19.260
to retrieve information
extended to any type of document

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.610
that is loaded into the system.

01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:25.850
You can search about what kind of
technology you can find with this.

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:31.210
And then, this is done by
another form and that's the form

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:35.080
where the researcher
or enterprise can enter

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.570
and fill what is the expectation
or what is the innovation

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:41.720
and what is the pattern
that had developed.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:47.600
It can also add some multimedia
files there like documents, videos,

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.360
whatever related to the
pattern that he has done

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.150
so we are knowing exactly
who does what and where.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:11:00.490
And then, I would say that the
sole prerogative of SpinBook is

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:02.650
that it can also provide
the summary sheet

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.830
in which the researchers
decided to specify

01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:07.400
in more detail the applicative
potentialities of their results.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.200
Such information, for obvious
reasons are confidential

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.420
and have been collected in a
special section of SpinBook

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:18.260
and appear locked to
the consultation.

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.910 position:56%
To access the full reading of this
tab, users can get in touch directly

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:24.090
with the researcher
via a private message.

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:30.590
In this case, the software foresees

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:37.760
that they want [inaudible] gives
access to the one that asked for it

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.650
and then this is accessible
to other users

01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.730
and then the collaboration
can start the discussion.

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:49.630
In conclusion, we need to
provide the tools in order

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:56.520
to give our technology to the
ones that are interested for this

01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.070
and we are provided on the
other side this heavy heritage

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:04.990 position:56%
that I have described to you before.

01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:08.180 position:56%
The acquisitions of new technologies
are of paramount importance

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:14.070
for the European SMEs which usually
can only invest limited resources

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:15.990
in the innovation.

01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:18.310
Moreover, it's crucial to
promote strong interactions

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:21.940
between public research and the
industry through related figures

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:25.610
as investors and intermediaries.

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:30.840
Therefore, SpinBook's main
result will have to concretize

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.450
into a real European knowledge
community in the field

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:36.650
of cultural heritages like a
place of meeting and sharing

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:40.310
between the main groups involved,
as well as a progressive space

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:44.220 position:56%
of aggregation of any stakeholders
working in the process of production

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:48.720
and utilization of innovation.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:55.500
SpinBook is already published and
now you can see the link there

01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:02.580
and join it, and not we will
start filling it with companies

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.510
and patents mainly starting from
the users of the IPERION project

01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:11.510
and then we will see how it
will go, so thank you very much.

01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:30.040
[ Applause ]

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.910
&gt;&gt; I'm going to stand
here and you can share,

01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:34.830
there's enough microphones
now I think and I think right

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:38.120
in saying these microphones get
picked up by the camera but not

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.720
to the audience so it's not a
bad room actually for projecting.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:47.600
We have about 10 minutes assigned
to questions and hopefully answers.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.900
Does anybody want to kick it off

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.020
with a question for
any of our speakers?

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:55.860
And if not, I'm going
to get us going.

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:58.390
&gt;&gt; I have one, sir.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:59.690
&gt;&gt; You have a question?

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:00.990
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:02.290
&gt;&gt; Go for it.

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:07.100
&gt;&gt; This is technical but I wanted
to ask, what are the dimensions

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.560
of the various layers, if you know?

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.860
&gt;&gt; Of the various-

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.160
&gt;&gt; Layers.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:19.370
&gt;&gt; Of the various layers yes,
they are about micrometer layers.

01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:29.830 position:56%
The layer of embedded nanoparticles
is about 200 nanometers in thickness

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:38.220
and thanks to the efficiency of
the [inaudible] spectrometry,

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:44.770
we are able to measure
exactly with certainty

01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:48.690
of course, these different layers.

01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:55.560
&gt;&gt; Can I just ask some general
questions to Michel and to Antonio

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.750
about the three labs, so
MOLAB, [inaudible] and FIXLAB,

01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:04.770
just can you talk a little
bit about the process

01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:09.840
of how decisions are made about who
gets access to which instrumention?

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.350
Michel, do you want to
start off with the FIXLAB?

01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:23.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My laboratory gives access to the
three MOLAB, [inaudible] and FIXLAB

01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:30.430
and each, to get access to that,
you have to fill a proposal

01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:36.110
and as Antonio has mentioned
they are called twice a year

01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:42.060
and these proposals are
evaluated by peer review panels,

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:52.720
one for each access and if accepted
the applicant will enter in contact

01:15:52.720 --> 01:16:03.420
with the access provider and
they will have the possibility

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:11.720
to find a date where the MOLAB
can go to the work of art,

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:19.090
when the applicant can come to the
archives in the different centers

01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:27.080
or when the applicant can come with
his objects, with his artifacts

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:33.130
to be analyzed either in
Hungary or in France for FIXLAB.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:41.960
&gt;&gt; There is a panel for the
examination of the peer review.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:47.550
This is usually three people
and nobody from the providers

01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:55.010 position:56%
of the service is part of the panel,

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:59.250
[inaudible] everything
is then [inaudible].

01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:08.520
MOLAB is the only one
infrastructure,

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.880
which goes the other way around.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:20.680
The community is paying for
the operators, not for the use

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:24.060
and that was very difficult.

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:31.990
I was on the committee in
the beginning and they say

01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:39.070
but we do not have the forms, we
have the forms to pay the users,

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:45.150
not the operators and then the
second big question was how much

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:49.160
does it cost for MOLAB to be
a European infrastructure.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:54.510 position:56%
Because usually, the infrastructure
are very, very expensive [inaudible]

01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:01.750
and hard to convince
but they were convinced

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:06.260
that [inaudible] was
important but the software

01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:09.650
for the professionals were unique

01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:13.330
and that made the infrastructure
unique.

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:19.270
&gt;&gt; It's probably different
for each of the three services

01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:24.200 position:56%
but do you think the amount of time
or funding allocated is about right?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.450
Are we getting the right
amount of applications

01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:32.190
to projects being accepted or is it
too competitive or is it too easy?

01:18:32.190 --> 01:18:35.020
How is it sort of working out?

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:38.940
&gt;&gt; The applications are
helped by an access board.

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:48.260
That means if they wish
to write a proposal,

01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:56.660
if they want they can enter in
contact with the access board

01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:02.710
and they will have counsel
from the access board

01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:07.640
in order to reach the exact time.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:17.010
&gt;&gt; There is [inaudible]
facilitated proposal but in terms

01:19:17.010 --> 01:19:21.250
of your questions, I would say

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:31.130
that there [inaudible] very
few proposals [inaudible].

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:36.940
&gt;&gt; Jorgen, I have a
question for you as well.

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:41.500
I'm always intrigued with these
projects that try to pull together,

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.010
we call it best practice or
whatever it is where you're trying

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:47.400
to get different groups who
probably have very established ways

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.440
of working and you're trying
to get them all to kind

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.480
of adopt one methodology.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.670
Is it too soon to say in practice
the ease of that happening or not?

01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:01.400
Do you find people open to that
seeing a benefit or people kind

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:08.080
of dig their heels in and
say my way's the best?

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.630
&gt;&gt; I think you already
answered it [laughter].

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:12.660
&gt;&gt; It is difficult to find
common grounds in some places

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:17.330
and convince each other that
that's the way to do it.

01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:23.550
Sharing is also a difficult issue
in this, how much do you share

01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:26.070
and how well do you do it?

01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:28.870 position:56%
Talking about this, the founder of
the [inaudible] in the 19th century,

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:32.370
when he developed a good yeast he
went out in Europe and offered it

01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:34.080
to all of the other
breweries in Europe

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.770
so we could have a good competition

01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:38.970
on who could make the best
beer based on the same formula

01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:42.240
and that is a very
generous way of doing it

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.610 position:56%
and [inaudible] Foundation also
expects that any research that comes

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:50.100
out of the research that they
fund will be publically accessible

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.170
immediately as it is, so that will
set new standards and I think more

01:20:54.170 --> 01:20:56.860
and more foundations have
this request which means

01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:01.230
that we are obliged to
coordinate our actions,

01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:04.790
to make it interpretable
for other parties.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.430
&gt;&gt; Jay?

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:20.480
&gt;&gt; One of the parts of IPERION is
looking [inaudible] how different

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:32.450
people photograph cross
sections and so a number

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:46.570
of people photograph the same
cross section and so a number

01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:49.730
of institutions have changed
their photographic procedure

01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:51.780
to [inaudible] everyone else did it

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:57.650
so when people can see a clear
benefit and improvement in process,

01:21:57.650 --> 01:21:59.230
I think people are
willing to change.

01:21:59.230 --> 01:22:03.780 position:56%
It's only when perhaps there isn't a
clear indication for why [inaudible]

01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:05.080
that you will get [inaudible].

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.050
&gt;&gt; Sure and I've been remind
for anyone speaking down here,

01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:14.470
if you're going to say anything a
bit longer than a few words come

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:16.300
up here because we have
to have it on camera

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:19.800
but if I can paraphrase very, very
quickly, in the grounds project

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.850
that was presented very
quickly and will come up later,

01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:31.420
no doubt about it, Joe Padfield
found that when there's a real need

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:32.720 position:56%
for photographing in a different way

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.020
to compare grounds it actually
happened quite quickly.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.320
You also have to adopt
one method don't you

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.620
so maybe this is a political
discussion, I'm not sure,

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.060
I'm just intrigued at how it
actually works in practice.

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.360
&gt;&gt; It depends on [inaudible].

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.660
&gt;&gt; Was there another hand up here?

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:42.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm very curious too because the
SpinBook is something like Facebook-

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:46.220
[ Inaudible Comments ]

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:50.800
&gt;&gt; I'll repeat it,
SpinBook is like Facebook.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:59.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm very curious, I forgot to
ask this question, how do we control

01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:05.150
that we don't have fake profiles
on SpinBook because I [inaudible]

01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:10.510
for example and [inaudible]
for the rest of my life

01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:16.310
and I will improve this
dream through a fake company

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:20.710
and put the company on SpinBook.

01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:26.290
It is a nonsense question
I understand but I mean,

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:30.470
it has been filled with
something which is real,

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:32.690
which is connected to the reality.

01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:36.140
How can we be sure that
what is inserted is real?

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:39.890
&gt;&gt; Let me just repeat the
question for the camera.

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:41.190
The very brief version

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:44.550
of the question was how do we
prevent fake identities appearing

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:49.080
on SpinBook whether it's a
company or another sort of profile?

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:55.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; In the entrance for there are
four people that will be a committee

01:23:55.460 --> 01:24:01.610
in order to assess what is
getting into the system so up

01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:03.200
to there, we cannot do any more.

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.090
We can [inaudible] I suppose
sometimes if something is,

01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:09.970
now we have all the
capabilities, when we have an email

01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:12.620
or a contact point inserted

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:16.690
by Googling it several
times you can have an idea

01:24:16.690 --> 01:24:20.770
if something is fake
or something important.

01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:25.870
There will be this committee in
order to make this check initially

01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:29.500
and then we will decide if we
are going to leave the profile

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.860
or communicate with this guy.

01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:36.540
&gt;&gt; Dou you want to come up Jay
if it's going to be a bit long

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.840
because this is a bit strange.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.380
They're all going to
hear the question

01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:40.680
and I'm going to have to repeat it.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:42.410
I think we'll make
this the last question.

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.040
Come up, yeah.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:50.580
&gt;&gt; Hello, I was just going to say
that people can apply for more

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:53.820
than one access at the
same time and sometimes

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.350
if people are putting together a
project which makes use of more

01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:59.850
than one access that can be quite
beneficial and the other thing

01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:04.410
to say is that members of IPERION
can't apply for these accesses

01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:07.640
so it's all for people outside
of the project so it's not

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.820
like we can all apply for our own
access and it's all really great.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.740
It's actually for other people
so the purpose of these sorts

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.020
of presentations are trying to get
other people to make applications

01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:21.050
to IPERION because we can't
apply for our own accesses.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.430
&gt;&gt; But all within Europe right Jay?

01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:25.860
At the moment?

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:29.090
&gt;&gt; As far as I understand yes.

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:33.570
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] you cannot
apply from the [inaudible]

01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:36.830
which is in your country.

01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:48.090
For instance, in Italy you cannot
apply for the Italian MOLAB

01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:51.220
because they assess [inaudible].

01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:56.260
&gt;&gt; Great well no more hands up.

01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:00.030
We're going to take a quick
break, 15 minutes is good?

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:05.470 position:56%
I want to say a few things but first
please thank our fantastic panel

01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:09.340
for this.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.340
&gt;&gt; My name is Barbara Berrie.

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.490
I'm head of the Scientific
Research Department

01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:17.260 position:56%
and I'm standing in for [inaudible].

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.440
Unfortunately, Emiliano [assumed
spelling] has a family health

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:25.320
emergency and our thoughts
are with him at this time.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.470
I know he would have loved to have
been here with us and I also know

01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:36.900
that I won't come even close
to being able to give you

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:42.200
as much information as
he has at his fingertips

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:48.630 position:56%
but I have a great panel here, which
will help me work on all of this.

01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:51.680
But before we get to the panel,
I just want to talk a little bit

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.460
about some of Emiliano's work.

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:58.410
He is one of those rare people who
works not only interdisciplinarily

01:26:58.410 --> 01:27:01.310
but also truly multidisciplinary.

01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:08.450
He's trained as a medievalist and
he has worked to build a platform

01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:13.130
for the digital infrastructure
of research, digital research

01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:19.090
in humanities and it's called
CENDARI and that stands for,

01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:29.230 position:56%
and I have it written down somewhere
pardon me, maybe somebody can find

01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:32.120
which piece of paper
did I wrote this on,

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.620
it's the Collaborative European
Digital Archive Infrastructure

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:41.360
and in fact, there are some
pages in there that have

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:47.350
"technical documentation" and that
is really filled with information

01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:52.520
and the kinds of words that I can't
get my head around like light F

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:56.650
and pineapple, RDF converters,

01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:59.900
nerd (that one I do
know) and [inaudible].

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:05.680
All of these kinds of words that
describe what you need to know

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.170
in order to build this
kind of infrastructure

01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:12.670
and I can't really get there
but I think that web page,

01:28:12.670 --> 01:28:16.930
that documentation
shows it very well.

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:21.600
CENDARI is like DARIA, which
you've heard about and [inaudible],

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.040
and Parthenon and the new DIGILAB.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.170 position:56%
These are all pan European
initiatives that are being developed

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:33.200
as part of the infrastructure
to promote digital research

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.620
in humanities but today, I have a
great panel that's going to talk

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:42.310
about some of the nitty gritty
of doing that, really talking

01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:46.880
about where the rubber meets the
road on this and about what kinds

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:51.370
of content we're trying to prepare
to be loaded into these kinds

01:28:51.370 --> 01:28:53.760
of infrastructures and
some of the challenges

01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:01.470
of not only the foundation for the
infrastructure but also the layers

01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:04.510
on top that we will
be interfacing with.

01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:11.230
Since everybody's bios are in the
program I'm not going to read those

01:29:11.230 --> 01:29:12.530
and also because we're going

01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:14.420
to change the format
up a little bit here.

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:18.640
I'm going to ask all the panelists
to speak for just five minutes

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:24.810
so we'll go through everybody's
project and perceptions

01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:27.830
and then I'll come back with
specific questions that are tying

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:30.990
up some of the common
threads in the challenges

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:36.080
that each person is describing in
their effort and their endeavor,

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:40.480
and then I'll open
up the floor to you.

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.700 position:56%
As you heard that there is no
microphone for you except these ones

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:50.260
so if you have a question or a
comment to make, there are plenty

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:53.230
of seats up in the front row so as
you're thinking of your questions

01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:56.670 position:56%
if you're going to want to ask some,
please come sit in the front row

01:29:56.670 --> 01:30:00.460
and you can share the
microphones with us.

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:03.970
My panel starts, I'll introduce
everybody it's Merv Richard

01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:05.940
who is Chief of Conservation
at the National Gallery

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:07.710
of Art, he's my boss [laughter].

01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:12.990
Next to him is Joe Padfield
from National Galley of London,

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:15.040
Cecilia Frosinini who
is Vice Director

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:19.930 position:56%
of the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in
Florence, Fenella France who is here

01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:22.480
at the Library of Congress
and Michele Derrick,

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.280
who is at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston.

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.940
You'll notice that we're
mostly museum based people,

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.550
something that was noted to
and eluded to this morning,

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:33.830
that a lot of what goes on in
cultural heritage is happening

01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:38.370 position:56%
in museums in America but with that,
I think I'll start at the far end

01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:42.490
and ask Merv to tell
us about his forays

01:30:42.490 --> 01:30:46.500
into digital heritage research.

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:51.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; If you can't hear me then raise
your hand, I'll try to speak loudly.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.100
Like most of you in this room,

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.840
I actually sit here
with multiple hats on.

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:59.800
The National Gallery actually
has a very long history

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.750
of doing collaborative projects,
both scientific research as well

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:09.330
as in conservation with
institutions around the world

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:11.190
and we have fostered that.

01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:12.530
Now, there's a caveat here.

01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:16.660
On the flip side, there's a long
tradition particularly in America

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:20.320
but maybe equally in Europe
of yes, you collaborate

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.490
with your collaborators
and you share information

01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:25.160
but there's a long history
of conservators not wanting

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.970
to share information with
the much larger community

01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:29.270
for a variety of reasons.

01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:33.720
That's not why we're here today,
we're beyond that now thankfully

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:38.190
and for the purpose
of collaboration,

01:31:38.190 --> 01:31:43.050
many of us have long felt the need
to share data much more extensively

01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:47.270
than is possible through just
these mutual collaborations.

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:49.980
As a result, the National
Gallery, in partnership

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:54.080
with other museums including
some of you in this room,

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.700
has embarked with support
of the Mellon Foundation

01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:02.370
and Alison is here today, I'm sure
you all know Alison or I hope so

01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:07.580
but anyway, we have been
working for the last seven years

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:10.970
on something called
Conservation Space,

01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:12.940
which some of you are familiar with

01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:17.920
and Conservation Space is
directed towards the management

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:23.330
and preservation of the documents
that we generate in the course

01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:28.150 position:56%
of conservation as well as in
conservation science and the purpose

01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:34.380 position:56%
of it is to get away from filing
cabinets filled with pieces of paper

01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:40.220
that typically require someone's
memory to remember oh yes,

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:45.560
we did such and such with such
and such 10 years ago and to get

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.670
into a situation where the
information is much more readily

01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:52.690
accessible and by accessible
that can be

01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:55.080
to your local conservation
community,

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.090
that can be to the entire
public if one wishes.

01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:03.900
So with Conservation Space,
we looked for the development

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:08.030
of a digital took that would
number one, facilitate the day

01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:10.830
to day working practices
of conservators

01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:14.570
because if there's anything that
I've figured out over the years,

01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:17.560
if you don't create something
that people actually want or need

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.090
to use then the likelihood

01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:23.380
of them actually using
it is somewhat reduced

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:26.780
and with Conservation Space,
the objective was to find a way

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:36.250
of creating, storing, searching, as
well as sharing all of the records

01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:41.600 position:56%
that we are producing and when I
say records this is both in the form

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.240
of written documents
as well as images.

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:50.570
And so, I'm happy to say that
Conservation Space is live,

01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:54.200
I mean it's real now,
it's not just a concept.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:58.290
We've put it into production
at the National Gallery of Art

01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:04.830
at the moment and we are sort
of doing a slow, rolled out use

01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:08.400
of the software at the moment.

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:13.000
It is web based which means
that it lives in the cloud.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.270
The information on a document

01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:23.070
by document level can be made
accessible to user groups

01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:27.730
that you define so in other
words, you can restrict it solely

01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:30.750
to yourself, you can restrict it to
people collaborating on a project,

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:34.010
the people who collaborate can be
in the National Gallery or anywhere

01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:37.640
in the world as long as they
have user access and if you want

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.790
to share it with the
whole world on a document

01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:43.050
by document basis then you can
do that as well very easily.

01:34:43.050 --> 01:34:48.800
The scientific department is
actually one of the most rapid,

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:54.050
I think, adopters of starting to
incorporate the scientific data

01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:59.220
into the system and when
I say scientific data,

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:04.260
that means that it's in the form
of data tables and in the form

01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:07.490
of things like images of graphs.

01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:12.330
We are not trying to
address proprietary software

01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:15.890
that instruments develop.

01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:20.490
This is where we are and we feel
that this is a huge stride forward

01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:25.440
in terms of collaboration, which
is what this meeting's all about

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:31.100
and look forward to sort of future
interactions with all of you.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.400
&gt;&gt; Thanks Merv.

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.400
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, I'm from the UK,

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.340
just one of the non-American
people [laughter],

01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:44.740
there's two people from the EU.

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:48.730
I trained originally as a
chemist and then I trained

01:35:48.730 --> 01:35:54.690 position:56%
as a paintings conservator and then
I've spent the last 16 years working

01:35:54.690 --> 01:35:55.990
with computers.

01:35:55.990 --> 01:36:00.760
A lot of people working in cultural
heritage work with computers.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:03.720
It's quite a normal thing where
that's just answering emails

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.220
or whether that's writing reports
or typing up questions or looking

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:10.870
at pictures and a lot of the
work that we're trying to do

01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:14.420
at the moment is to
see how we can capture

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:19.110
that effort that's already
put in and make more of it.

01:36:19.110 --> 01:36:21.840
So as Merv said, Conservation
Space is looking at trying

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:26.070
to simplify the administrative
structure that already exists

01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:30.220 position:56%
when you type in word documents but
instead of saving them in once place

01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:33.680 position:56%
on your computer, you save them in a
place that other people can see them

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.940
and managers can organize them.

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:40.090
It's a question of if we come up
with a beautiful computing system

01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:44.220
that allows you to do all of the
things you'd like to do but all

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:47.190
of the work to do that is on top
of all of the work you already have

01:36:47.190 --> 01:36:49.920
to do, it doesn't matter how good
the system is, no one is going

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:52.800 position:56%
to use it they just don't have time.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.060 position:56%
So, in IPERION I'm responsible for
work package eight, which is looking

01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:59.780
at developments in
digital documentation.

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.870
The budget is good.

01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:05.120
It's not huge so we're not
looking to build systems

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.200
but what we're looking to do
is to test systems and as soon

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:13.870
as Merv releases Conservation Space
we're going to have a play with it

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:18.910
but it's looking to test ideas
of how people actually do things

01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:22.890 position:56%
so we're looking at small tools that
are being developed to help speed

01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:24.500
up individual little jobs.

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:28.010
Now, as I said, people use
computers all the time anyway

01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:31.740
but the thing is, there are large
numbers of IT professionals looking

01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:34.690
for projects in universities
to do and then there's a lot

01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:38.740
of cultural heritage scientists
struggling to answer questions

01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:41.460
because of the limitations
of the software they have.

01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:44.010
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I understand.

01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:45.340
[ Laughter ]

01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:50.640
&gt;&gt; How appropriate, go Siri!

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.690
You need to speak more clearly Joe.

01:37:52.690 --> 01:37:54.710
&gt;&gt; It's the accent.

01:37:54.710 --> 01:37:57.240
&gt;&gt; Make the tool more simple.

01:37:58.410 --> 01:38:04.100
&gt;&gt; I lost my train of thought
now so the question about is one

01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:09.360
of the first tasks in work package
eight is making practical solutions

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.400
so actual things that people
can use, actual entities.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.770
You mentioned a couple of those
terms that are on the CENDARI sort

01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:21.160 position:56%
of website you didn't like, like
RDF and the others and there's a lot

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:25.910
of informatics that can be hidden
underneath pieces of software

01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:29.010
to allow people to do more
so there's an awful lot

01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:32.880
of very clever technology sitting
underneath Conservation Space

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.040
that as a user you'd never
have to see it and care about,

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:39.110
but then a lot more is possible
with the information underneath.

01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:41.750
What we're looking to do
is in the first task is

01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:45.490
to provide tactical solutions
to actually show things working

01:38:45.490 --> 01:38:48.620
and to show people how they
could do them themselves.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:52.220
The second part of the work
package eight in IPERION is to look

01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:55.180
at the descriptions, how do
we describe this information,

01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:58.570
how do we be connected together so
most of you will be able to explain

01:38:58.570 --> 01:39:01.810
to me what it is you do and
why you do it and what it is.

01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:04.280
If you then had to explain
it to a computer in a way

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.980
that the computer could then
connect to other systems,

01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:11.120
it becomes very difficult because
you have to be very, very specific

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:14.520
and consistent so that's what
the second task is looking at.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.200
The third task is looking at
the notion of data formats,

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.870
it's that as we store more and
more of this information together,

01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:22.810
how can we make sure that people
will be able to reuse it tomorrow

01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:27.010
and in 10 years' time and in 20
years' time so as people have said,

01:39:27.010 --> 01:39:30.920
we're not looking to replicate the
very quality pieces of software

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:35.630 position:56%
that developed with instruments that
are purchased but to be able to look

01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:38.740
at that data and to be able to
reuse the data later once these

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:42.040
instruments no longer work and once
the software is no longer available

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.660
is becoming important as we're
generating huge amounts of data

01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:48.510
in some of these new techniques
that are becoming available

01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:49.810
so that's the third task.

01:39:49.810 --> 01:39:53.140
And then the final task within
work package eight is actually

01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.960
to produce resources of
information that people could use

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.150
and move forward so it's
been discussed already one

01:39:58.150 --> 01:40:00.970
of the first ones you're looking at
a grounds database so we're going

01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:03.470
to try and look at building
a database of ground samples

01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:06.060
and explain how they all
connect together, how they relate

01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.380
to the different artists
and different institutions

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:11.210
where the information is stored but
we're also going to try and build

01:40:11.210 --> 01:40:13.560
that on a fairly generic
model so that

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.740
that same database
structure can be used

01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.920
for other resources of information.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:21.970
So, how it can be used
for quantitative analysis

01:40:21.970 --> 01:40:24.330
of [inaudible] is going to
be another one that's going

01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:27.920
to be looked at but we are
looking at practical solutions

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.100
to doing these things so
Conservation Space, and I won't go

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.940
into actual numbers, had a
much bigger budget than we have

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.940
within the particular work
package we're dealing with.

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:39.790
There was another very interesting
project which is hopefully just

01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:43.330 position:56%
about to be released called Research
Space, which is going to be allowed

01:40:43.330 --> 01:40:45.780
to do different jobs, to do

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:48.880
with complex cultural
heritage information and again,

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.490
we're looking to make use of
these and use them and test them

01:40:51.490 --> 01:40:54.690
within IPERION rather than try
and write them again because a lot

01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:57.230
of people are working on
similar projects and ideally

01:40:57.230 --> 01:40:59.010
through communication it
would be great to make sure

01:40:59.010 --> 01:41:02.470
that we can each use each other's
work to move forward rather

01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:05.960
than continuing replicating
the stuff that goes forward

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:09.120
so there are lots of resources out
there, people are working on them,

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:12.070
there's lots of really good
work being done and we're trying

01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:16.260
to improve the communications
and provide real worked examples

01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:20.360
so that Siri can understand what it
is [laughter] we're actually doing

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:23.890
and it's often a lot of these
complex projects are done,

01:41:23.890 --> 01:41:26.630 position:56%
the project comes to an end, there's
a very shiny product at the end

01:41:26.630 --> 01:41:30.240
of it, everyone really likes it
and then a new project stars up

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.540
and they go well, we're
not going to use

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.070
that because we don't know
how it works and well,

01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:35.920
we're not sure we can do it so they
start again and build it again.

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.970 position:56%
If we can make sure that these tools
are being developed are building

01:41:38.970 --> 01:41:40.900
blocks, we can move forward

01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:43.270
and the golden rule is make
sure you can get your data out,

01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:46.130
actually it doesn't really matter
what the software is as long

01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:48.400
as you can get your data in
and you can get your data out,

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.900
you can move on to
whatever's going to happen next

01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:52.200
so these are the things
we're looking

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:55.960
at within work package eight
for the IPERION project.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.320
&gt;&gt; Thanks Joe, Cecilia maybe you'll
talk about some of these issues

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:02.200
from a slightly different
perspective.

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:06.740
&gt;&gt; Yes, always a different
perspective because I feel

01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:11.080
at a certain point
always out of context

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:17.960 position:56%
because I [inaudible] mainly working
with the scientist or a conservator

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:24.490
and so sometimes I feel
like a child of a lesser God

01:42:24.490 --> 01:42:28.170
because it's very difficult
that people trust me,

01:42:28.170 --> 01:42:30.230
people from the scientific
point of view.

01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:36.870
It's very difficult to make me
reliable from their point of view

01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:41.140
and also when I come back
to my original field,

01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:44.080
to my original background
and discuss

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:52.610
with traditional academic art
historians, I am always the child

01:42:52.610 --> 01:42:59.280 position:56%
of a lesser God because of course,
I mix my origin and great tradition,

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:08.290 position:56%
God given experience and scholarship
for very trivial kind of studies

01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:13.770
so this is very interesting
from some point of view.

01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:18.660
It's a continuous challenge
but this is also the challenge

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:24.970
of the great change that Italy
experienced especially in the field

01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:28.190
of conservation because for many,

01:43:28.190 --> 01:43:34.000
many decades in the
last century especially,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.860
the art historians were not really
involved in conservation but some

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:42.480
of them, very few of them

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:48.790
and generally speaking
they were all involved

01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:51.420
in the research regarding
the museum,

01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:54.440
and the exhibition, and so on.

01:43:54.440 --> 01:44:00.960
And also, there was a very
low level consideration

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.220
for the conservation field.

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:13.250
Conservators were considered more
like the craftsmanship of art.

01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:20.020
They were not considered a high
level position and it lasted

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:24.040
for a long time so I
think that in some ways,

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:33.900
this idea of art separated from
science affected the development

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:40.410 position:56%
of also the material art history
which is very, very behind in Italy.

01:44:40.410 --> 01:44:43.790
In our experience at the
Opificio delle Pietro Dure,

01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:52.900
we have this pioneeristic position
because we have always thought

01:44:52.900 --> 01:45:01.440 position:56%
to be a sort of Italian branch of
the [inaudible] and also because one

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:08.600
of our founding fathers [inaudible]
was very close to all the people

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:13.810
of the [inaudible] who founded the
school of the [inaudible] tradition

01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:17.870
but we were very distant
from the rest of the world.

01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:22.980
I think that in time and of
course these last decades,

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:28.650
these gaps have been filled
and are already filled

01:45:28.650 --> 01:45:33.570
and now we share our
expertise and we participate

01:45:33.570 --> 01:45:35.660
to all the major projects.

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:41.730 position:56%
For example, in the case of IPERION,
I think it is very important choice

01:45:41.730 --> 01:45:48.860
that Opificio made to appoint three
different people as representatives

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:56.090
in the frame of the different
task leaders of IPERION

01:45:56.090 --> 01:46:01.900
so we have a scientist, a
conservator and an art historian,

01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:10.400 position:56%
which is a sort of coronation of all
the story that I have tried to send

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:14.950
up during this short work.

01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:19.990
I think that I have benefitted
a lot as an art historian

01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:22.760
from this continuous experience

01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:26.330
and this continuous
sharing with the scientists.

01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:32.950
Most of the modern accomplishments
of art history cannot be

01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:43.710
so grounded, so based on the truth
in my opinion and especially what I

01:46:43.710 --> 01:46:49.460
like very much is the fact
that now it can deny many

01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:55.650
of the urban legends that were at
the basis of many constructions

01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:58.960
of the academic art
historians so I think

01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.470 position:56%
that this has been my personal
experience but also a general change

01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:09.500
in Italy for the professional
of art history.

01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:15.020
&gt;&gt; Fenella, tell us about
your initiatives here.

01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:18.020
&gt;&gt; So I wanted to, can you
hear me okay at the back?

01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:19.820
So, I wanted to start
by sort of going back

01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:23.950
to Professor [inaudible] talking
about stem to steam this morning

01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:26.140
because we're hearing
this theme come through

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:29.360
and I really adhere very
strongly to the fact that we need

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:32.770
to integrate the humanities and
the scientific data together

01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:36.440
because they're not separate,
they actually rely on each other

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:40.220 position:56%
and then also in terms of GLAM,
everyone keeps talking about museums

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.690
and I kind of want to put my
finger up and say no, I'm a library

01:47:42.690 --> 01:47:46.740
but we do science here too so we
have galleries, libraries, archives

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:51.090 position:56%
and museums, historic houses, all of
these institutions I think we need

01:47:51.090 --> 01:47:54.290
to think a little bit more
broadly in terms of our concept

01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:58.170
because the academic institutions,
many of them also have museums

01:47:58.170 --> 01:48:01.430
and libraries and I
very much want to pick

01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:04.190
up on Luca's [phonetic] point
this morning where he talked

01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:09.210
about data not just being
the captured document

01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:12.300
but the physical collection and
I'll come back to that at the end,

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:15.120
but we have many libraries
and museums

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.160
who have physical collections,

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:19.790
reference collections
that are being shared.

01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:24.300
And so, I think that comes back
to what is data, both physical

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:28.090
and digital components of the
same and as part of that too,

01:48:28.090 --> 01:48:29.860
what are archives and repositories

01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:32.550
because the repositories
are reference collections

01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:35.710
that when people retire are getting
thrown out and we all just cringe

01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:38.740
in horror when that happens,
really are critical parts

01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:41.760
of our institutions that
we need to be preserving.

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:46.440
There's many institutions with
lots of different initiatives

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:52.620
and I very much like what
Joe was saying that we want

01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:55.020
to be interoperable
and we really want

01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:58.490 position:56%
to build upon each other's
initiatives so if I do a small piece

01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:02.320
that actually is useful for
something else, I'd really rather

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.600
like my system to be agnostic

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.910
and actually interact
with everyone else's.

01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:10.370
And so we've talked, we've
heard about Conservation Space,

01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:14.790
Research Space, these [inaudible]
which I'll talk about in a moment

01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:20.080
but also a little bit broader so
I don't know how many of you know

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.750
about [inaudible], which is a
partnership between the Association

01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:26.300
of Research Libraries and
the Institute for Museum

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:29.050
of Library Studies and the
Sloane Foundation for the Center

01:49:29.050 --> 01:49:32.270
for Open Science so I think these
are initiatives we also need

01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:34.620
to be engaging with
and not reinventing

01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:37.540
when they're already looking
at ways of sharing that data

01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:39.650
and trying to make that open.

01:49:39.650 --> 01:49:40.990
Delighted to have Cliff
Lynch[assumed spelling] here

01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:43.320
from the Coalition for
Networked Information

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.220
and that's something also
we need to really look

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:50.010
at what other institutions we
should be engaging with as well

01:49:50.010 --> 01:49:54.120
because that allows us to use and
reuse our data more effectively,

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.960 position:56%
because if we all have data sets and
as we've heard, they've been used

01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:01.430 position:56%
for one purpose, we often don't know
what a different audience might want

01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:04.520
to use them for and I think that's
something we really need to push

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.120
on a lot more, to look
at the other audiences

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:10.220
that might be interested
in what we're doing.

01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:13.750
In terms of the collaboration
for sharing data and Joe

01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:16.310
and I will talk more about
this tomorrow but you know part

01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:19.150
of it really comes down to
the institutional policy

01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:22.450
and at what level management
supports that sharing

01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:24.490
and what level of sharing that is.

01:50:24.490 --> 01:50:28.360
There may be different models for
really looking at what type of data

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.990
and how you can share
that level of data.

01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:33.900
I just wanted to finish up
with talking about CLASSD,

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.760
another acronym, the Center

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.080
for Library Analytical
Scientific Samples.

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:41.800
Here at the library we both have
physical reference materials of all

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.590
of the types of materials that
we have in our collections

01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:48.900
and have been linking that to a
web accessible database of all

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:52.710
of the data that links back to
that original object or sample.

01:50:52.710 --> 01:50:55.770
Part of that has been trying
to drive ourselves crazy

01:50:55.770 --> 01:50:59.770
by extracting metadata from
proprietary instruments

01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:03.570
and encouraging the manufacturer's
that we really don't want

01:51:03.570 --> 01:51:06.900
to steal the software, we
just want to extract the data

01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:08.800
so really looking at what
are those open, sustainable,

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.280
file formats that we can do
that we can extract that from,

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:15.340
what other high level metadata we
need for people to be able to share

01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:18.920
and actually engage with that
database more effectively

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.660
and then pulling that out of
that nonproprietary format.

01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:28.280
It came up this afternoon about
the verification and validation

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:31.630
of the accuracy of the data so
part of this is actually insuring

01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:34.700
that there are experts who
are expert in a certain type

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:38.710 position:56%
of data analysis, I told Michele
that she is going to be put on here,

01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:41.990
that would actually be verifying
the accuracy of that data

01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:45.780
to make sure before it's put out
there, that that has been validated

01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:48.670
and then in terms of assuring

01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:51.530
that we don't have fake
institutions created

01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:56.100 position:56%
that there would be member partners
who would engage and have to be part

01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:59.300
of their [inaudible] agreement
and then any other researchers

01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:03.350
from that institution would
have the expirable account

01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:05.700
that would go through
the institution.

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:09.020
One thing I will talk about a
lot more tomorrow is this sharing

01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:11.790
of reference collections and
I know a lot of us have talked

01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:16.450
about the fact that we can't
all have all of the same types

01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:19.180
of materials but it's been
wonderful working with Michele

01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:21.520
because we've actually
been capturing data on some

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.670
of our [inaudible] and pushing
that into the CAMEO collection

01:52:25.670 --> 01:52:30.010
so I think really a more coherent
approach which we're all advocating

01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:33.580
for and seeing how much we can
use of each other's initiatives

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:36.290
to really get that global
perspective as Luca's been pushing

01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:40.560
and to move us all
forward to next steps.

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:44.630
&gt;&gt; Michele, maybe you just had
the introduction on CAMEO there.

01:52:44.630 --> 01:52:47.190
Maybe you can talk about
that and your development

01:52:47.190 --> 01:52:51.050
of an online digital resource.

01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:52.350
&gt;&gt; Okay thank you.

01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:55.900
I'm going to talk about
something a little different

01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:58.060
because this is CAMEO,
the Conservation

01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:02.650
and Art Materials Encyclopedia
Online, that has been online

01:53:02.650 --> 01:53:08.090
for over 16 years so, and
because I've worked on it

01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:10.280
for about 20 years,
I've got to brag.

01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.660
We actually made the cover page

01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:17.510
for Chemistry International,
September 2016.

01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:21.210
[ Applause ]

01:53:21.210 --> 01:53:29.700
&gt;&gt; We have, in the month of
November we had 11,200 users,

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.490
that's independent IP addresses.

01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:39.280
We have about 60 editors,
23 of which are in Europe

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:42.880
and CAMEO now resides
on media wiki software

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.180 position:56%
so I think what I'm supposed to talk

01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:49.140
about though is how did
we get to this point?

01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:53.970
How did it actually develop?

01:53:53.970 --> 01:53:56.570
The main thing, I thought
I was talking loud okay,

01:53:56.570 --> 01:54:00.990
the main thing I think is that
we were a single institution

01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:04.460
that was focused on
a single subject.

01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:08.580
Now, our subject is fairly broad,
materials used in art or used

01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:12.330
in conservation or
materials that can affect art

01:54:12.330 --> 01:54:17.970
so that can be pigments, coatings,
adhesives, formaldehyde, insects,

01:54:17.970 --> 01:54:21.140
but we had a topic and
we had an institution.

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:24.780
We had several people that
were allowed to work on it

01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:30.100
and we received generous grants
so we received an initial grant

01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:32.730
from the National Center
for Preservation Technology

01:54:32.730 --> 01:54:35.970
and Training, we received one
from the Institute of Museum

01:54:35.970 --> 01:54:40.630
and Library Surfaces,
IMLS, we received one

01:54:40.630 --> 01:54:44.080
from the Mellon Foundation and
one from the Crest Foundation.

01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:48.820
Each of these grants in general
helped us migrate the data

01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:55.440
from an older platform onto a new
platform but it also allowed us

01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:01.890
to do some data addition
and alteration and changes.

01:55:01.890 --> 01:55:06.980
We went from File Maker,
to Microsoft Access to SQL,

01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:10.940
to a proprietary software that we
were stuck in for about 10 years

01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:16.140
and had trouble getting our data
out of and now we're on media wiki

01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:25.860
and let's see, one of the most
important things that happened

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:31.800
to CAMEO was our collaboration
with Europe and this was started

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.410
by the dedication of Jean-Louis
Boutain [assumed spelling],

01:55:35.410 --> 01:55:41.810
who contacted me in 2005, and set
up a working group with [inaudible]

01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:46.090
and Jean-Louis Boutain
pushed people.

01:55:46.090 --> 01:55:51.550 position:56%
Because of the goal of
transnational access, we thought one

01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:55.860
of the most important things was
to add foreign language synonyms

01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:00.880
to the English language records so
that those could be searched on so

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:07.250 position:56%
that anyone could get access to the
records and after [inaudible] ended,

01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:10.650
then we became a working
group in CHARISMA

01:56:10.650 --> 01:56:14.840
and that gets us to
where we are now.

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:19.110
I did some statistics at
the beginning of CHARISMA.

01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:28.660
We had 48 percent of the users
were outside the US and now

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:34.880
as of November 2016, 63 percent
of the users are outside of the US

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:41.470
and in November of 2016, we
were used in 139 countries

01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:47.680
so I very much have
enjoyed working on this.

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:50.370
&gt;&gt; Well Michele, that's
great so this is an example

01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:54.790
of if you build it, they will
come but that has been one

01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:58.910 position:56%
of the questions that's been raised
by people funding and people working

01:56:58.910 --> 01:57:04.140
on developing infrastructures
for digital research

01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:11.590
and so your 11,000
users are from all over.

01:57:11.590 --> 01:57:16.100
Do you know if they're using
it for high school papers,

01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:21.970
for technical art history,
for painting?

01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:24.550
&gt;&gt; I have no idea.

01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:29.380
One of the things about CAMEO
is that when it started,

01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:33.870
there wasn't much competition out
there however, now there are lots

01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:37.210
of data bases that are very
specific for painting materials,

01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:39.620
for adhesives, for stones,

01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:43.160
etc so one of the things
we're doing is linking

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:48.690
to those different databases and I
check the people that are linking

01:57:48.690 --> 01:57:54.400
to CAMEO and one of the museums
is the Metropolitan Museum.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.800
They have their wonderful art
historical database that's

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:05.160
phenomenal and they actually link
to CAMEO for specific informations

01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:09.320
on the materials that are
used in the works of art.

01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:12.280
&gt;&gt; Maybe Joe, I can
just ask you a question

01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.030
about the IPERION initiatives.

01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:22.010
Have you in your work package
said who your audience should be?

01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:25.640
&gt;&gt; Yes and no.

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:29.840
Because that particular work
package one of the tasks is looking

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:34.060
at building resources, most of the
work is actually building process,

01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:35.380
how do you actually do jobs?

01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:39.280 position:56%
The audience of the actual resources

01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:42.920 position:56%
at the end are primarily aiming
towards cultural heritage scientists

01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:46.530
so people that actually
wanted to research rather

01:58:46.530 --> 01:58:51.280
than people just having
to explore it for fun.

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:56.640
The intention is that the resources
will be open to the wider public

01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:00.840
but they're not being written
in such a way to engage with,

01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:04.550
it's simply a different level of
resource that would be required

01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:06.290
to actually produce that.

01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:09.430
&gt;&gt; Merv, Conservation Space
on the other hand is written

01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:14.180
for a specific audience
in its concept.

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Right in terms of concept I mean,

01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:20.270
Conservation Space is being
developed to solve a problem

01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:26.490 position:56%
in institutions which is to
facilitate the actual work processes

01:59:26.490 --> 01:59:28.710
or workflow of practicing
conservators

01:59:28.710 --> 01:59:30.480
and conservation scientists.

01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:35.960
Now, when I say that, in essence
though what we're developing is a

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:42.070
document management system that is
intended for museums and libraries

01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:43.860
and in fact, some of the
biggest users may end

01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:45.710
up being conservators in libraries.

01:59:45.710 --> 01:59:52.700 position:56%
From that standpoint it is solving a
specific problem but then when I say

01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:56.590 position:56%
that we already have curators at the
National Gallery who are interested,

01:59:56.590 --> 02:00:00.080
oh can I use that as a research
tool and the answer is yes.

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:06.030
So, it actually has expandability
and one thing to emphasize here

02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:09.240
for those of you who are
familiar with semantic approaches

02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:12.400
to database development, I mean,
Conservation Space is built on top

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:18.790
of a significant Open Source
platform at the bottom-most layers,

02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:21.300
something called Alfresco
[assumed spelling], for the techies

02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:23.710
in the room and then there's
a platform on top of that,

02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:26.580
that the company we're working
with [inaudible] developed

02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:30.450
and it's a semantic
database and the advantage

02:00:30.450 --> 02:00:35.900 position:56%
of the semantic approach is that the
ability to now map to and interact

02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:39.460
with other databases
is expanded in our view

02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:43.250
and so you can link to
many other databases.

02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:48.330
&gt;&gt; You know, thinking of linking
makes me think about librarians

02:00:48.330 --> 02:00:52.830
and archivists and finding
resources so I'm really glad

02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:58.740
that we have Fenella here but I
think one thing that these objects

02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:02.450
that are tools proliferate
our ability

02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:05.320
to discover them is
going to be challenged.

02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:09.530
But one of the ways that this
can be helped is by the linking

02:01:09.530 --> 02:01:13.240
and I'm interested in hearing
how much linking is going on

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:17.670
but Fenella, perhaps I could ask
you do we need to have standards

02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:21.300
if we're going to be
linking among databases?

02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:25.930 position:56%
Or are there ways to get around that
or should we think about that now?

02:01:25.930 --> 02:01:30.680
&gt;&gt; So it's come up a few
times today that, you know,

02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:35.070
will people do what you want them
to do and I think the challenge is

02:01:35.070 --> 02:01:39.470
that whenever I, I started this
initiative about nine years ago

02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:40.940
and I asked all my colleagues

02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:43.850
at the time what do you want
to see in this database?

02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:46.320
And basically they said,
put something up there

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.890
because we don't really
know until we see something

02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:51.780
so that wasn't really particularly
helpful but I think you really need

02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:55.010
to start from a standard and
then what we have done is try

02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:58.570
to standardize the
approach of the open access,

02:01:58.570 --> 02:02:02.990
the standardized file formats,
extracted metadata, engaging people

02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:07.140
who are expert in different
instrument, but also then trying

02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:11.020
to make sure that the structure
is robust enough to add

02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:15.140
in addition fields when people
suddenly say wait a minute,

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:18.050
there's another way of
describing this that we can now do,

02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:20.560
we have a new instrument,
can we add that in?

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:23.700
So part of it is I really do
think we really do need to try

02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:27.680 position:56%
to standardize because otherwise
one of the challenges we all have is

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:32.570
that being such a multidisciplinary
field

02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:35.840
when one person says data someone
else hears something different

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.400
and I think we've all
had that discussion

02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:40.130
where we're using exactly
the same words and at the end

02:02:40.130 --> 02:02:44.750
of the discussion, five people have
gone in 12 different directions

02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:48.540
so one of the challenges is
how much we can have some sort

02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:51.340
of shared terminology
while still recognizing

02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:53.230
that there are nuances in there.

02:02:53.230 --> 02:02:57.500
But yes, in order to share we do
need to do that, but the data needs

02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:02.430
to be in a format that
is usable to that user.

02:03:02.430 --> 02:03:04.890
So for example, I may
be using something

02:03:04.890 --> 02:03:08.210
in a completely different
way to Joe or Michele,

02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:11.380
but as long as that data is in a
structure that they can extract

02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:14.330
and reuse then I think that's
the critical component.

02:03:14.330 --> 02:03:16.920
&gt;&gt; So along those lines
Cecilia, the kind of information

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:23.000
that you would want to pull from
a digital repository or asset?

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.680
X-radiographs, cross-sections?

02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:27.450
&gt;&gt; Yes, everything [laughter].

02:03:27.450 --> 02:03:31.460
&gt;&gt; She doesn't want too much,

02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:34.580
but some of these files
are going to be huge right?

02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:35.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:43.950
&gt;&gt; And how do you guide an
art historian to looking

02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:46.670
at them on a digital database?

02:03:46.670 --> 02:03:52.850
&gt;&gt; Here comes the problem
of the location especially

02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:56.230
in the university I think.

02:03:56.230 --> 02:03:58.290
We are struggling but I think

02:03:58.290 --> 02:04:05.590
that probably [inaudible]
the key person tomorrow

02:04:05.590 --> 02:04:08.660
to explain better this problem

02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:14.110
in the modern university regarding
the conservation scientist,

02:04:14.110 --> 02:04:17.760
their key role as a sort of bridge

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:20.280
between the traditional
art historian,

02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.770
the traditional scientist.

02:04:22.770 --> 02:04:32.170
From my point of view, I think that
we need to have a very important,

02:04:32.170 --> 02:04:38.100
at this point, it is very important
to have a generation of teachers

02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:45.760
that try to train these new kind of
figures and this is very important.

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:55.410
For example, in Florence, the
University of Florence has a school

02:04:55.410 --> 02:05:01.400 position:56%
of specialization for art historians
which is really a very formal,

02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:08.170
very academic but they have
selected some specific courses,

02:05:08.170 --> 02:05:13.120
one is called scientific diagnostic

02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:16.940
for art historians,
which is very nice.

02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:21.360
It's a sort of [inaudible]
you could say

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:31.150
so you know what [inaudible] was,
it was trying to teach to the son

02:05:31.150 --> 02:05:39.650
of the King of France whose formal
title was the [inaudible] of course

02:05:39.650 --> 02:05:46.530
and try to explain that in an
easier way and the very basic

02:05:46.530 --> 02:05:53.170 position:56%
of all the subjects for the cultures
so I think this idea that comes

02:05:53.170 --> 02:05:57.390
in our university to have
for example diagnostics

02:05:57.390 --> 02:06:00.120
for art historian is
something interesting

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:05.890
because you are not aimed to
explain them all the principles

02:06:05.890 --> 02:06:12.980
of chemistry, or physics or
whatever but to try to teach them

02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:19.340 position:56%
which are the questions and which
are the more probable investigations

02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:22.770
that can give some
answers to these questions.

02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:29.760
So I think that this is a good idea
and this is also probably the idea

02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:37.650
that we could keep in mind when
trying to build this linking

02:06:37.650 --> 02:06:45.860
between all the different databases
so you need different users.

02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:49.330
&gt;&gt; I think we might
need new librarians too,

02:06:49.330 --> 02:06:53.410
to help the art historian
going to the library

02:06:53.410 --> 02:06:58.430
to discover these tremendous assets
because so far as I can tell,

02:06:58.430 --> 02:07:04.020 position:56%
some of these are available already,
you just have to know where to look.

02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:06.160
But in terms of training,
I wasn't actually thinking

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:09.090
of getting the conversation
on to training quite yet

02:07:09.090 --> 02:07:11.100
but if we can just stay
on that for a moment,

02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:14.440
Merv and Joe you both trained
as conservators so you had

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:18.490
to have some science and I
think both of you actually came

02:07:18.490 --> 02:07:23.160
with science undergraduates rather
than art history as undergraduates

02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:26.780
and then picking up
science as a conservator,

02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:31.200
but if you can cast your minds
back, how difficult was it

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:34.650
to have one class with some
people with a science background

02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:40.370
and some people with none
to have the same class?

02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:43.800
How do we need to solve
this problem?

02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:47.840
Who can be the trainers
for the art historians?

02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:53.580
&gt;&gt; I remember people
breaking out into tears trying

02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:56.210
to explain certain
aspects of science.

02:07:56.210 --> 02:07:58.890
I think the difficulty with
this type of training is

02:07:58.890 --> 02:08:03.540
that you don't necessarily
want to turn an art historian

02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:06.170
into a chemist or an
IT professional.

02:08:06.170 --> 02:08:09.560
You want to give the art
historian enough understanding

02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:12.320
to know the questions they
should be asking or to know

02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:15.490
who they should be
asking the questions of.

02:08:15.490 --> 02:08:18.290
I think for university students,

02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:21.080
we need to tell them you're an
art historian, you need to go

02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:25.330
to a chemistry class, insuring
that they understand the purpose

02:08:25.330 --> 02:08:27.920
of the chemistry class is to
allow them to ask questions rather

02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:31.090
than for them to become a
chemist is quite important.

02:08:31.090 --> 02:08:35.680
Having a clear understanding of
what people are trying to learn,

02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:38.790
so I would have thought for
an art historian the best way

02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:41.810
to get information together on
a particular artist would be

02:08:41.810 --> 02:08:45.220 position:56%
to get every single object ever
created by that artist into one room

02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:49.110
to gather together all of
the historical examinations

02:08:49.110 --> 02:08:52.090
that have been done of all of
those objects into the one room,

02:08:52.090 --> 02:08:54.630
and then all of the specialists
who did all of that work

02:08:54.630 --> 02:08:59.750
into the one room, all at your
beck and call and with a few people

02:08:59.750 --> 02:09:01.970
to interpret the different
languages that were done.

02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:06.050
Now theoretically, you could come
up with a computer model to do that

02:09:06.050 --> 02:09:09.990
but that's kind of where we're
aiming towards and I would say

02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:14.060
that a big issue here is
trust because if we're looking

02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:16.820
at pulling information from lots of
different places, you need to know

02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:19.180
where it's coming from
and that you can trust it.

02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:23.100 position:56%
We've got a lot of stuff in the main
press at the moment about fake news,

02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:27.440
which is slightly more severe
but people need to know

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:29.910
if an examination has been
done, where was it done,

02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:33.610
do you feel that's an
okay interpretation

02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:36.460
because people aren't generally
going to be able to understand all

02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:39.430
of the raw data underneath
even if it's available.

02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:43.460
&gt;&gt; That was the case before it was
digital too wouldn't you agree?

02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:44.760
&gt;&gt; Yes.

02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:46.910
&gt;&gt; It's just that now with
the proliferation of access,

02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:48.210
we have to be more careful.

02:09:48.210 --> 02:09:49.510
&gt;&gt; You just have more
questions, that's the difficulty.

02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:53.660
I mean, instead of sort of spending
20 years exploring an archive,

02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:57.600
you may spend a week exploring
four so you're going to be hit

02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:00.050
by so much more information.

02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:01.570
Understanding that you
can make quick decisions

02:10:01.570 --> 02:10:04.580
about what you found
could be quite important.

02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:05.880
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:08.830
Michele, you have CAMEO
which started off you said

02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:13.100
with a rather broad remit
but can you talk a little bit

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:15.440
about the data landscape
and how starting

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:20.520
from there might have changed how
you decide what you're curating

02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:27.140
in your archive, your
digital archive?

02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:33.710
&gt;&gt; Sure so, at the point we started
CAMEO, we were taking information

02:10:33.710 --> 02:10:36.610
from the books on our
library shelves

02:10:36.610 --> 02:10:40.070
and putting it into
a digital format.

02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:43.860 position:56%
Because the books were being
submitted to me and I was putting it

02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:46.860
into the format, I had
a standardized structure

02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:50.530 position:56%
that I used for every single record.

02:10:50.530 --> 02:10:53.550
&gt;&gt; So wait, can I just say that
goes back to your fidelity issue?

02:10:53.550 --> 02:10:57.090
These were books Michele
that you trusted.

02:10:57.090 --> 02:10:58.390
&gt;&gt; Yes.

02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:59.690
&gt;&gt; Okay.

02:10:59.690 --> 02:11:00.990
&gt;&gt; Yes and it's documented still

02:11:00.990 --> 02:11:04.980
in the CAMEO records what
data sources were used

02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:09.860 position:56%
to generate information in that
record and when I found data sources

02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:13.890
that had discrepant information,
it's actually recorded there

02:11:13.890 --> 02:11:22.730
because I found them and I'm
sorry, I lost my train of thought.

02:11:22.730 --> 02:11:24.030
&gt;&gt; How did it grow?

02:11:24.030 --> 02:11:28.020
It grew from just taking the
traditional kinds of material

02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:30.070
from books and spread out?

02:11:30.070 --> 02:11:38.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly so the first
database for CAMEO was textual only.

02:11:38.930 --> 02:11:43.760
When we got it into the SQL format
then we were allowed to add images

02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.390
so we actually had an image
collection specialist that was able

02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:52.070
to take a lot of micrographs
himself,

02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:56.790
he pulled all the [inaudible]
pictures off he could off

02:11:56.790 --> 02:12:02.790
and added them there, he searched
the web for other pictures

02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:06.940
and put them in with credits
and we expanded to that,

02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:11.290
and then we started putting
data in so we have IR data,

02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:14.500
[inaudible] data, x-ray
defraction, x-ray fluorescence,

02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:20.990
polarized light images, anything
we could get for the materials.

02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:24.850
Some of that came from
our conservation records,

02:12:24.850 --> 02:12:26.450
some from our scientific records,

02:12:26.450 --> 02:12:29.700
others from other people
submitting them.

02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:32.810
&gt;&gt; And Fenella, along those
lines with CLASSD, is that to try

02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:39.980
and help fidelity of the
digital part of the content?

02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:43.250
How do we also make sure that
we're not getting fuzzy spots

02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:47.530
on the x-radiographs
that Cecilia's cohort-

02:12:47.530 --> 02:12:51.620
&gt;&gt; So it's a combination you know
I think of what we've always done

02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:57.130
with the analog and then the expert
and Michele is intimately involved

02:12:57.130 --> 02:13:00.120
with [inaudible] as well but
going from that sort of model

02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:02.950
where you have an expert
who will be responsible

02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:05.120
for a specific instrumental
technique

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:11.370
so you know this does not look
right and it gets sent back,

02:13:11.370 --> 02:13:14.340
so the combination of both
but also just allowing

02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:16.010
for more discoverability.

02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:20.350
I think that everyone's doing so
much work and even when I hear

02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:25.190 position:56%
about a different initiative, I had
three weeks to just even shut myself

02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:29.240 position:56%
in a room and look at some of these
initiatives but there's so much data

02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:32.430
out there that we just don't
know and we're not linking to

02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:34.680
and I think that's a
critical point that's coming

02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:38.880
through that there's a lot of data
there that's not being shared,

02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:43.250
it's not being saved, funding
stops and it disappears somewhere

02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:45.250
and that's where I
think we need to capture

02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:48.770
that before we lose all
of that historic data.

02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:52.590
&gt;&gt; Now on that note, I'd like to
open up the conversation to all

02:13:52.590 --> 02:13:57.680
of you and as I said there's a
microphone right here, you can come

02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:02.270
and sit in seats as you're thinking
of the questions, or you can shout

02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:07.320
out and I'll transmit the
information into the microphone.

02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:13.800
&gt;&gt; I can shout, I think
I'm loud enough.

02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:15.100
&gt;&gt; You can stand near
the microphone.

02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:16.400
&gt;&gt; I'm near it.

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:23.600
Hi, my question is I guess for the
group but particularly for Fenella

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:29.500
and Michele, I'm interested
in the accessibility of data.

02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:32.470
We have some systems like
the [inaudible] database,

02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:36.130
which holds infrared
and [inaudible] data

02:14:36.130 --> 02:14:39.210
that is only available
by membership.

02:14:39.210 --> 02:14:42.790
You contribute and then you're
able to use and you have

02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:44.960
to be an institution to use these.

02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:47.790
I used to work as a
private conservator

02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:52.390
and I did not have access to
these databases and I make a point

02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:55.390
that I try to get my students
membership so that they,

02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:57.440
as they go through their
career and they move from place

02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:01.180
to place will always have access
to these kinds of systems.

02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:05.930
I personally believe that we
might curate the data we put up

02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:10.210
but that we should let people use
it freely however they want just

02:15:10.210 --> 02:15:11.640
as they would use a book.

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:16.400
I'm wondering what your thoughts
are on that and your experiences.

02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:22.050
&gt;&gt; Well I can simply say that
CAMEO is open to the public.

02:15:22.050 --> 02:15:24.780
Anyone can access it,
it's free of charge,

02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:26.820
and there never will be a charge.

02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:31.520
The MFA is committed to
keeping it accessible.

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:33.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And with CLASSD, that's the same.

02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:37.600
I talked about the fact that
we would start with sort

02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:42.220 position:56%
of member partners because we want
to engage and encourage other people

02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:46.370
to put their data in so that was
the place to start with that,

02:15:46.370 --> 02:15:50.930
but it will be a registered user
and so there's no cost for that.

02:15:50.930 --> 02:15:54.380 position:56%
People are not required but we
really wanted to start with partners

02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:56.800
so that we would get more than
add data because there's a lot

02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:01.670
of much more interesting data out
there so to answer your question,

02:16:01.670 --> 02:16:04.530
the data set of whatever
there is will be available

02:16:04.530 --> 02:16:10.630
and can be combined so for one
sample we'll have the [inaudible],

02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:14.240
all of that linked to
the one object or sample.

02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:15.540
&gt;&gt; Joe?

02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:19.090
&gt;&gt; I was just going to say that
there are lots of sort of databases

02:16:19.090 --> 02:16:23.200
that are created that for various
reasons do need to be protected

02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:26.050
or closed to a certain extent.

02:16:26.050 --> 02:16:28.660
I think one of the very important
things to do about that is

02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:34.300 position:56%
to record why they're closed and if
there's a time limit on the closing.

02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:36.650
I think some of the
projects like [inaudible],

02:16:36.650 --> 02:16:38.350
they were essentially
closed to begin

02:16:38.350 --> 02:16:41.360
with to insure people contributed.

02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:44.960
I think at a certain point perhaps
they could be then made open again

02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:46.850
because it's reached
that critical mass.

02:16:46.850 --> 02:16:49.590
That's where you put that type of
data, that's where you would go

02:16:49.590 --> 02:16:54.380
for that type of data so
if people could access

02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:58.870
that information then that's
great but I think to allow people

02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:00.550
to start off with a plan

02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:03.790
and a slightly more closed
environment helps people

02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:06.640
with the engaging with
that to being with,

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:08.860
but there should be
a time limit on it.

02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:11.760
I mean, once after so
many years have gone

02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:13.850
by why can't other people use it?

02:17:13.850 --> 02:17:15.770
I think if that type of
thing can be captured,

02:17:15.770 --> 02:17:19.290
that can be really important and
often, people end up doing stuff

02:17:19.290 --> 02:17:24.950 position:56%
because that's the way we do it so
yes, it's closed because it's closed

02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:27.430
and it's sort of a
circular argument.

02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:30.450
If it's closed because it's
closed then why can't we open it?

02:17:30.450 --> 02:17:34.460
I would agree with you the notion
that if information isn't actually

02:17:34.460 --> 02:17:38.960
of a secret or personal nature
then if it can be used then great.

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:42.640
&gt;&gt; Maybe you can, and
I'll come back to Cecilia,

02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.300
just discuss the structure

02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:49.690
of Conservation Space allows
different levels of permissions.

02:17:49.690 --> 02:17:52.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean with Conservation
Space there are two aspects

02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:53.840
to this question.

02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:56.090
I mean, one is from the
standpoint of sustainability

02:17:56.090 --> 02:17:59.260
and since Conservation Space
is intended to actually help

02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:05.370
with work processes then while the
software is made available freely,

02:18:05.370 --> 02:18:08.660
in order to maintain the software
into the future there will have

02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:12.690
to be some kind of membership
fee which is associated

02:18:12.690 --> 02:18:19.190
with just sustaining the software
and continuing to develop it.

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:25.090
But in terms of them who is made
accessible since on a document

02:18:25.090 --> 02:18:30.280
by document level and with
the assignment of user roles,

02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:33.520
it means that you have
the capability of opening

02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:37.560
up those documents to
however broad a group you want

02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:40.210 position:56%
so that you're not making a decision

02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:42.680
from the onset about
who can see what.

02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:46.260 position:56%
You're deciding that this class of
documents the whole world can see it

02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:50.500
if they wish and so that's
where the flexibility

02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:52.810
in how you approach it
can make a difference.

02:18:52.810 --> 02:18:54.480
&gt;&gt; Part of the structure
of the system allows

02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:56.350
that and Cecilia you want to-

02:18:56.350 --> 02:19:00.100
&gt;&gt; Yes, I just wanted to point
to the fact that in Italy,

02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:06.900 position:56%
we have a specific legislation about
how this data can be accessible

02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:13.780
or not because most of the works
of art are property of the state,

02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:20.970
so we are compelled
to follow these rules.

02:19:20.970 --> 02:19:23.180
These rules are very old

02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:29.270
because usually they were set
only considering the photographs,

02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:34.090
the traditional kind of
photographs but they assume

02:19:34.090 --> 02:19:37.670
that there should be an
authorization all the time

02:19:37.670 --> 02:19:41.830
that you ask for data coming
from different archives

02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:48.350
so now all the database
that pertains to research,

02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:55.970
to scientific investigation and
so on are put in the same box

02:19:55.970 --> 02:20:04.190
like they were photographs because
there is no specific legislation

02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:10.520
about all this kind of analysis.

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:20.410
And according to these laws, we
need to ask for the authorization

02:20:20.410 --> 02:20:25.570
of the museum, of the church
or whatever, who is the owner

02:20:25.570 --> 02:20:31.090
of the paintings despite the fact
that the investigations are carried

02:20:31.090 --> 02:20:36.180
out by sometimes other
institutions, or universities,

02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:39.710
or so on so you need
a great collection

02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:41.990
of authorizations sometimes.

02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:46.880
That makes things really, really
difficult so that's the reason most

02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:56.200 position:56%
of these database are just for being
consulted, being read, being used

02:20:56.200 --> 02:21:00.610
but you cannot really retrieve
your original document.

02:21:00.610 --> 02:21:05.830
You cannot print an x-ray
or whatever without asking

02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:07.650
for a formal authorization.

02:21:07.650 --> 02:21:11.700
&gt;&gt; It shows that we still are
treating digital information

02:21:11.700 --> 02:21:14.550
sometimes the way we
treated analog information.

02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:18.020
We haven't actually
adjusted our thoughts.

02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:22.050
I think the permission level
that Merv talked about is a way

02:21:22.050 --> 02:21:25.340
to maybe help institutions
deal with that.

02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:26.790 position:56%
Fenella, you have some thoughts too?

02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:30.500
&gt;&gt; Yes, I just wanted to follow
on from both the user role

02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:33.540
and the access because one thing
we put into place was the fact

02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:37.330
that while we have
public domain so we have

02:21:37.330 --> 02:21:40.270
to make everything accessible but
partners may not want to put all

02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:44.250
of their collections out there and
so each partner would have control

02:21:44.250 --> 02:21:47.720
of their collection to say okay,
this came from a specific donor,

02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:51.460
we want to just keep this
for our in house location

02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:54.510
but this we will share, so there
would be those sorts of levels

02:21:54.510 --> 02:21:57.950
that would allow people to
decide at what point they make

02:21:57.950 --> 02:22:07.230
that accessible and
how they do that.

02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:15.590
&gt;&gt; One thing is clear is if I
have to say which is the priority

02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:23.800
in the data, it is
clear to me that a lot

02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:34.930
of information are already
available [inaudible] by all

02:22:34.930 --> 02:22:36.440
of us [inaudible] [laughter].

02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:41.520
There are many different
types of databases.

02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:46.210
Now, [inaudible] how to
make them work together,

02:22:46.210 --> 02:22:51.800
how you can bring together
whether this can be done

02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:56.060
through the invention
of another database.

02:22:56.060 --> 02:22:59.700
I mean, this is something
that does not make me happy.

02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:03.960
What makes me happy is what
Barbara was saying perhaps we need

02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:08.430
to train people on how to
look for the information.

02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:13.350
I mean, I have many courses
at the University of Bologna.

02:23:13.350 --> 02:23:18.560
One of the key courses [inaudible]
32 hours of frontal lesson

02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:20.540
and 18 lessons of laboratory.

02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:28.560
The first six hours of the 32
are just related with how to look

02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:30.970
through the website
on the information

02:23:30.970 --> 02:23:33.610
that is already available on
a given particular [inaudible]

02:23:33.610 --> 02:23:36.480
such as malachite.

02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:39.030
We want to know everything
about malachite,

02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:41.530
where can we find this information

02:23:41.530 --> 02:23:47.430
and then you train them regardless
whether they are librarians

02:23:47.430 --> 02:23:52.520 position:56%
or in this case they will be
conservation scientists first of all

02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:55.620
where to look, where to
find this information

02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:58.120
because they are already available.

02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:04.110
If you move a painting, I mean it
is very difficult to find the x-ray

02:24:04.110 --> 02:24:08.430
that [inaudible] because
as you say most

02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:11.360
of this information
has property rights

02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:16.230
and so they are not public not
because they cannot be made public

02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:20.160
but because there are rules
that do not allow you to make it

02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:27.920
so this information is frozen
there within the institution.

02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:31.480
This is why the [inaudible]
is becoming so important

02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:35.100
because what they are looking
for is all of the information

02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:39.350
which is not available and
probably will not be available

02:24:39.350 --> 02:24:42.650
because they are forced
to stay where they are

02:24:42.650 --> 02:24:46.900
because of many reasons,
the last one is

02:24:46.900 --> 02:24:51.680
that perhaps there are
institutions that don't want

02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:53.780
to make their house
section available

02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:55.880 position:56%
to the others just because they are-

02:24:55.880 --> 02:24:57.180
&gt;&gt; Theirs.

02:24:57.180 --> 02:25:05.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Just because they are theirs and
this is my job, I took a lot of time

02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:12.260 position:56%
to do this job and I don't want the
others to be part of this so we have

02:25:12.260 --> 02:25:16.150
to consider all of these
cultural diversity if you want

02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:18.470
because it relates also
with different types

02:25:18.470 --> 02:25:24.600
of cultural diversity so the key
point is the accessibility of data,

02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:29.380
not how to structure the already
available data in something else,

02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:36.380
how to make the accessibility
even more easy, in my opinion.

02:25:36.380 --> 02:25:38.570
&gt;&gt; Well, time will
take care of that one.

02:25:38.570 --> 02:25:39.870
&gt;&gt; What?

02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:41.170
&gt;&gt; Time will take care of that.

02:25:41.170 --> 02:25:42.970
People will die off, you know?

02:25:42.970 --> 02:25:46.040
[ Laughter ]

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:47.340
&gt;&gt; Not us but you know-

02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:50.680
&gt;&gt; And actually, if I could just
talk to that, this is something

02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:54.000
that came up very strongly when
we had the meeting in 2014,

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.760
that we need a better communication
platform and ways to actually link

02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:01.590
to all of these different
initiatives because you know,

02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:05.150
I think there's so much going
on that all these meetings

02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:08.100 position:56%
that were being mentioned and I
think Luca was saying he got invited

02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:12.410
to a meeting two days
away, how do we make,

02:26:12.410 --> 02:26:14.530
this is a little bit past
the data but if we don't know

02:26:14.530 --> 02:26:16.750
that a meeting is on we
don't know where that is,

02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:18.520
so I think that's another
part that we need to think

02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:21.630
about is how we communicate
and link more effectively

02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:23.230
between all our institutions.

02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:30.130
&gt;&gt; Another aspect of this is,

02:26:30.130 --> 02:26:35.770
I mean a while ago you were
asking the question about the fact

02:26:35.770 --> 02:26:39.440
that conservators come
from different disciplines

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:42.160
so many have a background
in art history or studio art

02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:43.960
with limited chemistry
or vice versa.

02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:48.540
And so, there's a learning that
takes place during the course

02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:52.640
of conservation training where
everybody has their strengths

02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:55.870
and weaknesses and everybody
helps each other out.

02:26:55.870 --> 02:27:04.750
Now, one thing that is a bit of
a problem when you look at people

02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:07.050
who are strictly studying
art history

02:27:07.050 --> 02:27:11.070
for example is relatively
few academic programs

02:27:11.070 --> 02:27:15.050
at the university level are
emphasizing the technical aspects

02:27:15.050 --> 02:27:18.010
of art history that I'm aware of.

02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:22.340
It's gradually changing I
think but this is an area

02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:28.190
where I think many art historians
either enter the academic world

02:27:28.190 --> 02:27:32.790
or the curatorial world
without having an introduction

02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:40.560
to the technical aspects of
it in a very solid way anyway

02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:43.990
and so they happen upon it because
of personal interest or because

02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:45.930
of their experience
wherever they are.

02:27:45.930 --> 02:27:49.250
So, I think influencing
the academic training

02:27:49.250 --> 02:27:53.450
of art historians is one what that
we could influence the future.

02:27:53.450 --> 02:27:55.860
I think one thing that's
very good is

02:27:55.860 --> 02:27:59.840
because we have become
much more effective

02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:03.200
at presenting our information
visually,

02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.810
that has really increased
dramatically an interest

02:28:06.810 --> 02:28:09.710
in what many people are
calling technical art history

02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:13.960
because obviously reading tables
of numbers does not go over well

02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:17.970
with many art historians but if
you can look at pictures or images

02:28:17.970 --> 02:28:20.990
that have been mapped to
show you specific information

02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:24.830
about where's malachite in
this particular painting mapped

02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:29.020
on an image or the dramatic
increase in what we can do

02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:30.550
with hyperspectral and other-

02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:32.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think simple
imaging tools

02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:37.030
like Photoshop have helped
take us to that first step

02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:39.920
and the more advanced digital tools

02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:44.700
that are being developed
specifically for our use

02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:50.290 position:56%
in layering multiple different kinds
of technical information in a way

02:28:50.290 --> 02:28:52.940
that gives an image
that an art historian

02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:56.500
like Cecilia can actually
work through

02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:01.340
and decode has moved us
significantly together

02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:04.640
over the past few years,
which is a wonderful thing.

02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:08.780 position:56%
People do say that vocabulary has
been a great divide between the arts

02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:13.920
and the sciences but I think it's
not just vocabulary, it's also ways

02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:16.370
of thinking and I think
we should get into that.

02:29:16.370 --> 02:29:23.090
Before we go on with vocabulary,
someone has a question here.

02:29:23.090 --> 02:29:29.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It's more a remark as a question.

02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:35.750
I think for [inaudible] where
malachite is in a picture

02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:40.840
for instance, might
also be very interested

02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:44.850
to know [inaudible] educated
laypeople say oh that's what I'm

02:29:44.850 --> 02:29:49.530
looking at so Photoshop
is one way of looking

02:29:49.530 --> 02:29:52.270
at it so that's my remark.

02:29:52.270 --> 02:29:56.660
&gt;&gt; Oh Joe, while Jorgen's coming
up do you want to, are you,

02:29:56.660 --> 02:29:59.200
okay all right, now we're getting-

02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:01.380
[ Laughter ]

02:30:01.380 --> 02:30:04.660
&gt;&gt; All right Joe you get to go
first because you're on the panel

02:30:04.660 --> 02:30:07.300
and then Luca, then Jorgen
and anybody else wants to come

02:30:07.300 --> 02:30:10.750
and ask a question,
you've got to get in line.

02:30:10.750 --> 02:30:12.050
&gt;&gt; Take a number.

02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:14.290
&gt;&gt; I was just going to
say we need to remember

02:30:14.290 --> 02:30:18.440
that this has the potential
for multiple different types

02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:23.140 position:56%
of research happening at the same
time so if you have an art historian

02:30:23.140 --> 02:30:25.040
who is researching the use

02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:27.530
of a particular pigment
that's a particular job,

02:30:27.530 --> 02:30:30.200
there's a particular skill
set involved in that.

02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:33.890
If you then have a scientist
researching the analysis

02:30:33.890 --> 02:30:38.040 position:56%
of a particular pigment, that's an
entirely different form of research.

02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:41.670
You can then have a digital,
I don't remember the term,

02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:46.720
someone doing digital humanities
who's exploring how you present

02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:49.080
information on that
particular thing.

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:52.480
There are a number of different
things to do and to sort

02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:55.440
of address Rocco's point
beforehand, you spend sort

02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:58.130
of six hours training them
how to find these pigments-

02:30:58.130 --> 02:31:00.250
[ Inaudible Comment ]

02:31:00.250 --> 02:31:03.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah but it's a question
about how many times do you do

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.870
that before you work out,
just put it all in one place

02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:08.210
and then they can all find it?

02:31:08.210 --> 02:31:12.470
If you looked back 20 years ago,
how long would it have taken them

02:31:12.470 --> 02:31:14.420
to find the same information?

02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:16.460
Now, it's not their research

02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:18.260
to make it more accessible,
that's the thing.

02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:20.860
It's someone else's research
to make it accessible

02:31:20.860 --> 02:31:25.560
but if you've got a lot of
informatics people doing research,

02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:28.800
if you effectively can
say it takes us six hours

02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:33.830 position:56%
to do this can you do it faster, can
we direct the research that's done

02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:37.360
by other people to make
our research easier?

02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:41.090
I think that's a tricky one because
often conservation science borrows

02:31:41.090 --> 02:31:44.500
from so many different fields we
can end up feeling it's our job

02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:48.370
to do everything whereas
that's not actually possible.

02:31:48.370 --> 02:31:49.670
Because we work

02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:51.450
in an interdisciplinary field
it's very good to be able

02:31:51.450 --> 02:31:54.720
to say this is my area,
it's not my job to do that

02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:56.610
but it would be really handy
if someone else can do it

02:31:56.610 --> 02:31:59.580
and then more we can
gather these questions,

02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:01.850
these issues that are
actually stopping people

02:32:01.850 --> 02:32:07.050
or slowing people down, we can
help each other move forward.

02:32:07.050 --> 02:32:08.350
&gt;&gt; It's true.

02:32:08.350 --> 02:32:10.870
&gt;&gt; Luca? You want to weigh
in and ask a question?

02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:20.490
&gt;&gt; Yes, more than a question I
need kind of advice for the panel

02:32:20.490 --> 02:32:30.190
and not only from the panel but you
may remember that we [inaudible].

02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:36.930
I remember having several
conversations with [inaudible]

02:32:36.930 --> 02:32:41.670
about where we are aiming to.

02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:48.800
By the way [inaudible]
so we will continue this

02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:50.330
cooperation [inaudible].

02:32:50.330 --> 02:32:56.990
Coming back to the point, maybe
we are too crazy visionaries,

02:32:56.990 --> 02:33:00.430
too [inaudible] but I
need to know we are aiming

02:33:00.430 --> 02:33:05.740
to because we are actually
aiming somewhere

02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:12.060
and we had this nice
[inaudible] too.

02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:20.270
My personal feeling and I've
been involved in [inaudible],

02:33:20.270 --> 02:33:28.910
my feeling is that we need to speak

02:33:28.910 --> 02:33:34.140
about [inaudible] stone
age problems.

02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:41.770
We are speaking about
[inaudible] useless without tools.

02:33:41.770 --> 02:33:52.500
Maybe it could be useful to
teach how to extract information

02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:54.590
on malachite but that's
very [inaudible].

02:33:54.590 --> 02:34:00.570
You have the digital system there,
maybe [inaudible]but I expect

02:34:00.570 --> 02:34:10.930
that I will be able to ask my
digital research assistant very

02:34:10.930 --> 02:34:19.100
complex questions in the near
future and in our field I'd say one

02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:26.010
of these questions could be
look, I found this manuscript.

02:34:26.010 --> 02:34:30.800
There's a very nice section
of drawing [inaudible] similar

02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:35.860
or related to [inaudible]
maybe before the age

02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:39.600
of that document and after it.

02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:40.900
Are you able to do that?

02:34:40.900 --> 02:34:44.650
Of course we need the
software [inaudible]

02:34:45.850 --> 02:34:50.390
but if you don't have the database
accessible you will not have the

02:34:50.390 --> 02:34:54.390
software because nobody's
going to develop the software

02:34:54.390 --> 02:34:58.820
for a non-accessible database
or a nonexistent database

02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:02.920
and if you get only the
database but not the tools,

02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:04.220
you will not [inaudible].

02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:15.950 position:56%
I think the most important knowledge
infrastructure around is Google

02:35:15.950 --> 02:35:20.120 position:56%
because [inaudible] of the knowledge
that is freely available [inaudible]

02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:25.930
so we need to aim to this
[inaudible] situation

02:35:26.970 --> 02:35:32.290
where we can have research
in a [inaudible] heritage

02:35:32.290 --> 02:35:36.030
and humanities and in [inaudible].

02:35:36.030 --> 02:35:40.130
When I'm studying an
object I put [inaudible]

02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:48.130
so if I'm studying a stone
I can access the inscription

02:35:48.130 --> 02:35:51.110 position:56%
and everything that has been studied

02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:57.250
and when I'm studying inscription
[inaudible] I can access the stone

02:35:57.250 --> 02:35:59.290
[inaudible] historical
context because the way

02:35:59.290 --> 02:36:05.490
of doing research is
doing correlation

02:36:05.490 --> 02:36:14.380
and correlation can be only for the
moment done by humans but you need

02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:19.150
to provide the information
to the humans [inaudible].

02:36:19.150 --> 02:36:22.070
That information must be there

02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:26.450
and in this very moment we are
discussing possible potential

02:36:26.450 --> 02:36:31.430
information there with the
exception of the [inaudible]

02:36:31.430 --> 02:36:38.090
but we cannot survive
without [inaudible] tools

02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:48.090
because this infrastructure
is databases plus tools,

02:36:48.090 --> 02:36:50.230
that will provide infrastructure
services.

02:36:50.230 --> 02:36:53.300
&gt;&gt; I think Luca has put his
finger on one of the challenges

02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:58.400
for doing the research, the
discoverability of information

02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:06.260
but then the intellectual part of
doing research requires our ability

02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:09.610 position:56%
to synthesize and I think we do rely
on Google and we are going to have

02:37:09.610 --> 02:37:11.850
to get over that in a little while.

02:37:11.850 --> 02:37:15.270
Jorgen, you had a comment
or a question.

02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:18.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah well it is both,

02:37:19.570 --> 02:37:25.520
you mentioned that technical
art history isn't being taught

02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:27.540
in very many places.

02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:43.550
It is coming up more and more and
we are now a two year master course

02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:50.090
in English at the University of
Amsterdam in technical art history

02:37:50.090 --> 02:37:56.550
where anybody here
[inaudible] and University

02:37:56.550 --> 02:38:01.350
of Stockholm they're
starting up in September '17,

02:38:01.350 --> 02:38:08.050
also a two year master for
technical art history combining the

02:38:08.050 --> 02:38:18.040
traditional art history and I
see from the colleagues I meet

02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:26.630
with in [inaudible] that there is
more and more questions being aired

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:33.480
about technical aspects of the
objects that they are curating

02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:39.630
in the galleries but also
having more and more questions

02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:45.860
to the validity of the
science that they are provide

02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:55.610
so they will ask these groups
more and more questions related

02:38:55.610 --> 02:39:02.600
to getting access to
the data we have

02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:08.740
and their questions will
be more and more complex,

02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:13.220
and they will question whether
the data is trustworthy.

02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:15.770
I mentioned in my presentation
[inaudible] dates

02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:20.130
that are being provided actually
are validated because there are

02:39:21.690 --> 02:39:27.100
so many aspects of [inaudible]
dating that are in the open

02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:29.780
so what is the date in
reality and the more that kind

02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:36.640
of a question comes, the more it
comes to us as [inaudible] group

02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:40.200
to provide sufficient amount
of valid and validated data

02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:44.770
and I think the market will be
increasing particularly also thanks

02:39:44.770 --> 02:39:46.940
to the database that [inaudible]
the questions will be more complex

02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:48.240
and they will be [inaudible].

02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:49.540
&gt;&gt; May I ask the audience if
anyone has an idea of a tool

02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:50.840
that they wish was already existing
to help them do their research

02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:52.140
in digital humanities
or digital art history?

02:39:52.140 --> 02:39:53.440
So, we're not quite getting the
message out of what's available

02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:55.190
to be used so Cecilia, your group,
we need to maybe help them think

02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:56.490
about what tools they would
need to crack open some

02:39:56.490 --> 02:39:57.830
of the digital data we have
and that's where Jorgen,

02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:59.390
your work with training will
help people devise the questions

02:39:59.390 --> 02:40:01.040
that then we build the tools to
answer, to crack open because some

02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:02.340
of these things are
hard like walnuts.

02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:08.050 position:56%
Well, if there are no more questions
and since Fenella has offered to,

02:40:08.050 --> 02:40:10.820
but before actually, before
we do that I'm just going

02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:16.480
to give everybody on the panel
another one minute if they want

02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:20.340
to summarize their
thoughts about where we are

02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:27.700 position:56%
and where they think we should be
going next especially maybe in terms

02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:31.390
of reacting to some of the
questions that have come up.

02:40:31.390 --> 02:40:36.890
Michele, shall we start with
you at this end this time?

02:40:36.890 --> 02:40:38.390
You're feeling good about CAMEO.

02:40:38.390 --> 02:40:44.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm feeling good except
Joe has introduced me to a lot

02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:48.180
of possibilities of things that
can be done now that CAMEO is

02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:54.410
on the media wiki platform as far
as because now it's multiple pages

02:40:54.410 --> 02:40:58.210
that you can search for but
apparently there's applications

02:40:58.210 --> 02:41:04.070
out there that you can ask
questions and it can pull a set

02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:09.600
of pages together in a group
and create answers to more

02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:13.380
than just the straight
single material questions.

02:41:13.380 --> 02:41:15.820
&gt;&gt; That actually would
be really interesting.

02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:19.290
I was just thinking about some of
these things which are like books

02:41:19.290 --> 02:41:24.170
that have the first page for
the introductory learner,

02:41:24.170 --> 02:41:28.850
the middle pages for
the student learner

02:41:28.850 --> 02:41:31.920
and the whole chapter
is for the researcher.

02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:36.070
And the truth is that
the digital assets

02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:40.290
that we are building have
information at all of those levels.

02:41:40.290 --> 02:41:44.130
The challenge is to use them
at our appropriate level

02:41:44.130 --> 02:41:47.010
so if you're going to
start that's great.

02:41:47.010 --> 02:41:49.740
&gt;&gt; Well hopefully it gives me
something new to think about.

02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:51.420
&gt;&gt; That's great.

02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:53.740
Fenella, concluding thoughts?

02:41:53.740 --> 02:41:58.420
&gt;&gt; So I think that very much making
the data accessible is critical

02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:03.940
but coming back to the datamining
and the tools, it certainly has

02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:06.640
to be there and I was on a working
group at the library a number

02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:10.000
of years ago and the whole
point they were saying was well,

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.620
we've got this data,
it's freely accessible

02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:15.430
but the point was there's no way
for people to actually get to it

02:42:15.430 --> 02:42:19.530 position:56%
and mine it and so I think those
two together really are something we

02:42:19.530 --> 02:42:29.890
need to look at to make ourselves
more functional to new audiences.

02:42:29.890 --> 02:42:34.010
&gt;&gt; Teach the people to work
together, that I think is not

02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:41.300
so easy because you said, it's
more a matter of a frame mind,

02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:47.980
a matter of how you think, how
you approach different problems.

02:42:47.980 --> 02:42:52.600
The same question tells
different things

02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:56.390
to different people
according to their background.

02:42:56.390 --> 02:43:00.110
&gt;&gt; So we have bridges to build
as well as infrastructures under.

02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:06.900
&gt;&gt; I think one of the
dangerous things here

02:43:06.900 --> 02:43:09.930
when we start doing digital
humanities research is the

02:43:09.930 --> 02:43:13.380
technology to some extent is
not really the problem anymore.

02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:16.150
The problem is the
questions and the imaginations

02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:19.140
of the people doing the work
and people asking the questions

02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:22.300
so we've talked a number of
times about standards and one

02:43:22.300 --> 02:43:24.870
of the biggest standards,
the ontological standards

02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:27.790
to describe cultural heritage
information now is something called

02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:29.090
the [inaudible].

02:43:29.090 --> 02:43:33.590
Now the [inaudible] has been around
and devised for 20 odd years now

02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:35.940
but they've just brought
out some new ones

02:43:35.940 --> 02:43:40.670
so there's one called [inaudible]
which is all about modeling belief

02:43:40.670 --> 02:43:42.470
so you can go through
the whole structure

02:43:42.470 --> 02:43:45.570
of ontologically modeling how
much you believe something

02:43:45.570 --> 02:43:48.310
and whether someone else
believes something else

02:43:48.310 --> 02:43:51.130
and I think there is a
danger to some extent

02:43:51.130 --> 02:43:53.610
of technological level gazing

02:43:53.610 --> 02:43:57.350
in that you can spend years
doing technology research

02:43:57.350 --> 02:43:58.650
because it's interesting

02:43:58.650 --> 02:44:02.100
and the technology research
is really fun to do.

02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:05.380
But, without the two
way conversation

02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:07.820
between the people actually
exploring the data or wanting

02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:10.450
to research the data that
other people have gathered,

02:44:10.450 --> 02:44:15.300
we're missing the opportunity
and often it's people say well,

02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:17.310
I don't really want to get
engaged with the digital bit

02:44:17.310 --> 02:44:19.510
because I have no idea what
it is and it's complicated

02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:23.000 position:56%
and then you've got the digital
people who need to apply for a grant

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.590
and to apply for a grant
it's got to be new and novel

02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:27.640
which means they keep pushing
the boundaries and you end

02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:30.140
up with this bit where the
technology is going like this

02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:32.610
and you end up with
a really sharp spike.

02:44:32.610 --> 02:44:35.390
So, I think our difficulty
moving forward is making sure

02:44:35.390 --> 02:44:36.950
that the developments

02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:41.350
in the technology are actually
making people's lives easier

02:44:41.350 --> 02:44:45.400
and making the jobs they need
to do easier and quicker.

02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:47.450
&gt;&gt; Okay challenge.

02:44:47.450 --> 02:44:49.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:54.850
&gt;&gt; I will sort of build on what
Joe just said which is that for me,

02:44:54.850 --> 02:45:03.010 position:56%
I think it's extremely important to
recognize that we need to have tools

02:45:03.010 --> 02:45:06.680
that are available to help people
do what they actually want and need

02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:09.500
to do, not to say that you
close the door on the fact

02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:12.650
that there are things that we
haven't even thought about yet.

02:45:12.650 --> 02:45:17.470
And when Luca raises the question
of how do we create these tools,

02:45:17.470 --> 02:45:24.440
I think that it's going to be very
important that the many databases

02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:28.140
like for example, if one is looking
for data it's not very useful

02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:31.060
to a broad audience
to absolutely have

02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:33.510
to know exactly what
is this database

02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:35.330
and then go there and search that.

02:45:35.330 --> 02:45:38.700
You need to be able to find
it more at a Google-like way

02:45:38.700 --> 02:45:41.710
where the search for
information doesn't require

02:45:41.710 --> 02:45:47.290
that you specifically go to
one site and certainly I mean,

02:45:47.290 --> 02:45:52.010 position:56%
with Conservation Space that
information which is made accessible

02:45:52.010 --> 02:45:56.460
to a broader audience, our hope
is that people use a Google search

02:45:56.460 --> 02:46:01.170
with the right tools they can
actually find us and then you know,

02:46:01.170 --> 02:46:06.110
the gallery for example
is the Official Archives

02:46:06.110 --> 02:46:10.890
of the Crest Foundation and
all of that information,

02:46:10.890 --> 02:46:14.140
which we're close to, will
be made fully accessible

02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:17.370
to the whole broad
community out there

02:46:17.370 --> 02:46:20.890
and it's not absolutely decided
but almost certainly it's going

02:46:20.890 --> 02:46:23.620
to happen by putting that
into Conservation Space

02:46:23.620 --> 02:46:25.960
but that will be available
to the public.

02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:30.240 position:56%
I think that people using their
normal search techniques like Google

02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:32.150
or something like that
and then finding

02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:35.910 position:56%
out that there's this wonderful data
out there can really inspire people

02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:39.130
to dream things we haven't
even thought of yet.

02:46:39.130 --> 02:46:42.730
&gt;&gt; Well that sounds like
a very good moment to end.

02:46:42.730 --> 02:46:47.090 position:56%
I would like to thank all the
panelists and invite Fenella to come

02:46:47.090 --> 02:46:51.510
to the podium for concluding
remarks.

02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:57.080
[ Applause ]

02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:02.630
&gt;&gt; This has got to be one

02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:05.690
of the most unwieldy
microphones I've ever worked with.

02:47:05.690 --> 02:47:09.520
So just a few things to put out
there to prime you for tomorrow

02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:13.380
and make sure that
you're still all awake.

02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:17.350
Just an overview that we've had a
really wonderful in depth overview

02:47:17.350 --> 02:47:20.250
of the state of research
infrastructure initiatives,

02:47:20.250 --> 02:47:23.850
we've looked at the challenges of
promoting these at a policy level

02:47:23.850 --> 02:47:29.260
and also looked at the differences
in approaches between the European

02:47:29.260 --> 02:47:32.280
and the US approach and the
different funding models and how

02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:37.680
that ties into, sort of pushing us
in slightly different directions.

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:41.700
That, from the US side a number
of my colleagues and I have talked

02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:46.670 position:56%
about the focus on some sort of
consortium to provide a united front

02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:51.760
in lieu of our Ministry of
Culture and what I very much

02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:55.210
like from [inaudible], how the
new baseline funding in the US,

02:47:55.210 --> 02:47:58.660
that we kind of are happy if
it's flat and it's not shrunk.

02:47:58.660 --> 02:48:01.270
It's sad but it's real.

02:48:01.270 --> 02:48:04.750
And how do we squeeze more
from the resources we have

02:48:04.750 --> 02:48:06.170
for our collaborative efforts?

02:48:06.170 --> 02:48:11.520
I think that's really what a lot of
us are saying that we're engaging

02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:13.940
in some of the efforts and
if we can make better use

02:48:13.940 --> 02:48:19.030
of those then we can really make
things go a little bit further.

02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:22.390
What I did find very strong though
is that the underlying thread

02:48:22.390 --> 02:48:23.690
in terms of the strength

02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:26.090
of the collaborations is
the personal connections

02:48:26.090 --> 02:48:30.120
and interactions and all of us
have found and have been motivated

02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:33.900
to engage more effectively because
of strong personal interactions

02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:36.410
and because we feel so
deeply about what we do

02:48:36.410 --> 02:48:38.890
and so I think that's going
to help us all move forward

02:48:38.890 --> 02:48:43.590
with the wonderful approach to
really sharing and being engaged

02:48:43.590 --> 02:48:47.330
in what the field needs,
where the field needs to be.

02:48:47.330 --> 02:48:51.060
So this heritage network of
experts and professionals linked

02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:52.820
to the multidisciplinary fields

02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:56.210
and colleagues outside is
really what we're trying

02:48:56.210 --> 02:48:57.760
to pull together here.

02:48:57.760 --> 02:48:59.780
And just as a final
point what I really,

02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:02.640
really want is my own virtual
digital assistant [laughter].

02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:04.670
So thank you all so much.

02:49:04.670 --> 02:49:09.330
If you have any questions about
location [inaudible] at the back

02:49:09.330 --> 02:49:12.370
and if any of you would like a
quick tour through our labs just

02:49:12.370 --> 02:49:16.160
to see what we've got, we'd be
delighted to host that so again,

02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:17.870
thank you to all of
the speakers today

02:49:17.870 --> 02:49:19.670
and thank you all for
your attention.

02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:23.360
