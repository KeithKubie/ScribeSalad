00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.700
- [Voiceover] What I would like to do

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.574
is find the area of this green triangle.

00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:05.989
And if you get so inspired,

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:07.700
and I encourage you to get inspired,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.767
pause the video and see if you can

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:10.753
figure it out on your own.

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:12.400
So whenever you start thinking about

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.172
areas of triangle, or least my brain says,

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:16.900
well look, I can figure
out the area of a triangle

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.200
if I know the base and the
height of the triangle.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.225
I can just multiply them and then

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:23.166
multiply that by one half.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.733
So, for example, if I have a triangle

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.804
that looks like this.

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:29.033
A triangle that looks like this.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:32.523
And if, if this is the base,

00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:34.238
this is b right over here.

00:00:34.238 --> 00:00:36.300
The length of this side is b.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.033
I'm gonna put the b in magenta.

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:41.673
And then the height, let
me do that in yellow.

00:00:41.673 --> 00:00:43.866
This is the height.

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.738
This is the height.

00:00:46.738 --> 00:00:48.789
Then I just multiply base
times height times one half

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.066
and I'll get the area of this triangle.

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.366
Or if the triangle looked like this.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.866
If it looked like,

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.233
if it looked like this.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.333
If it looked like this, I
could do the same thing.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.633
Where if this is the base, b.

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:05.600
So that is the base b.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.625
And now the height, I guess you could

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:08.161
say this, if you were to drop

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.666
a penny from here, it's
sitting outside the triangle.

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.433
So it looks different from this one.

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:15.141
But this would still be the height.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.433
This would still be the height.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:19.533
Right over here, ya do the same thing.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.867
One half times base times height

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:24.033
would give you the area of this triangle.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.066
So how can we apply that over here?

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.433
Well, this triangle is on this grid,

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:29.600
but it's kind of at an angle.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.033
With this grid it's hard to pick out

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:32.566
the base and the height.

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.366
for this triangle as a whole.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.200
But what we could do,
there's actually several ways

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.500
that we can approach this.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.852
Is we can break this triangle up

00:01:39.852 --> 00:01:41.933
into two or more triangles where we can

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.466
figure out the base and the
height for each of them.

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.166
So for example, I can break this one.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.000
Let's see I could, I'm picking this point

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.270
and this point because it breaks it up

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.200
into two triangles where I can figure out

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.402
the base and the height.

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:56.900
Well what am I talking about?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.853
Well this triangle over here, that I am

00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:01.130
shading in blue.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.067
If I, and I've switched the orientation.

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:05.733
I've rotated 90 degrees.

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:08.089
But if you view this yellow.

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.266
If you view this yellow as the base

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:13.933
of this triangle, you see
that the base is three.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:18.835
So, let me write the base
is equal to three units.

00:02:18.835 --> 00:02:20.366
And what's the height here?

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:23.633
Well the height here is going to be

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:26.900
The height here is going to be this

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.666
distance right over here, which is four.

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.366
Height is equal to four.

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:35.389
So the area, the area of that triangle

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.033
right over there, is going to be one half

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:42.400
times three times four,
which is equal to six.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.933
So this part right over here,

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:45.600
the area is six.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.033
And now we can do a similar thing

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.500
with this other triangle.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.300
'Cause once again, we can view this

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.933
yellow line, or now I have
this yellow and blue line,

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:54.033
as the base.

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:55.566
The base is equal to three.

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:58.233
So I could write that
base is equal to three.

00:02:58.233 --> 00:02:59.405
And once again, I've rotated.

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:01.466
So now the base is on the side.

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:03.233
So the base is three.

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.000
And then the height here,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.900
the height of this triangle

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.300
is two.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.483
If this is the base, remember
if this is the base here

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:12.900
we've just rotated it.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.553
Then this right over here is the height

00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:16.300
Height would be equal to two.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.433
So what's the area of this one?

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:21.400
The area of this one is going to be

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.133
one half times the base, three, times

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:26.666
the height which is two.

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:28.300
One half times two is one times three.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.834
This is going to be equal to three.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:30.928
So the area of the whole thing is

00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:32.600
gonna be this area of three

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.933
plus this area of six.

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:36.367
It's gonna be the area of nine.

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:38.467
Area is equal to nine.

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:39.866
Now that's one way you could do it.

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:41.200
Is you could just break
it up into triangles

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.000
where you could figure out
the base and the height.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.607
Another way, and this is you can kinda

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:47.533
view it as a maybe a trickier way.

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:48.700
Or ya kinda have to think a little bit

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.894
outside of the box, or maybe
outside of the triangle

00:03:50.894 --> 00:03:52.367
to do it this way.

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:54.200
Is to, instead of doing it this way,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.833
visualize this triangle.

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:57.868
And actually, let me, let me
clean this up a little bit.

00:03:57.868 --> 00:04:00.450
Let me undo all this work that I just did.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.733
Let me undo this to show
you the other approach.

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:06.066
The other way that we can tackle this.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:08.292
So, the other way we could tackle it.

00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:09.389
I'm gonna clean up the whole thing,

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.666
so I get more, so I get
more real estate here.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:14.515
So the other way that we could tackle it

00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:18.066
is imagine that this triangle is embedded

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.400
inside of our rectangle.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.774
So let me draw the rectangle.

00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:25.467
Let me draw a, let me draw
the broader rectangle.

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:28.048
And I think you might
see where this is going.

00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:29.733
'Cause as soon as you draw that,

00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:32.591
that bigger rectangle, then you see

00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.600
that that rectangle is made up of

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.900
the triangle that we're
tryin' to find the area of,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.400
and three other right triangles.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.800
We have this right triangle

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.633
that I'm shading in in yellow.

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:47.300
We have this right triangle that I'm

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.100
shading in, in purple.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.200
And then we have this right triangle,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.438
that I am shading in, in blue.

00:04:54.438 --> 00:04:57.071
So if we figure out the area
of the entire rectangle,

00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:58.333
and that's pretty straightforward.

00:04:58.333 --> 00:04:59.556
The area of the entire rectangle

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:02.500
is gonna be four times six,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.866
those little mentions of the rectangle.

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:05.066
Four times six.

00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:07.866
So the area of the entire rectangle is 24.

00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:09.400
And then you subtract out the area

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.700
of the purple, the blue
and the yellow rectangles.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.133
The purple, the blue and
the yellow triangles,

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:16.067
then you're gonna be left with the

00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:18.066
area of the green triangle.

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:19.233
So let's do that.

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:22.000
So what's the area of the purple one?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.533
Well this is going to be,

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:25.100
we're gonna subtract it out.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.433
It's gonna be one half,

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:29.209
six, the height right over here.

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:30.966
If we view this as a height of six.

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:33.200
And it's a base, right over here is three.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.833
So it's gonna be one half times six

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:40.766
times three, that's the
area of the purple triangle.

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:42.766
And then you have the blue one.

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:45.666
This is going to be minus one half.

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:48.668
Let's see, you could say height is one.

00:05:48.668 --> 00:05:49.767
So this is one.

00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:53.189
And then this base, you could say is four.

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.833
So that's four times four.

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:57.833
And then we want to subtract out

00:05:57.833 --> 00:05:59.933
the area of the yellow rectangle.

00:05:59.933 --> 00:06:02.733
So this is minus one half.

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:05.000
Let's see we could make this base two.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.967
One half times two times,

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:10.299
and this height is four.

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:11.738
Two times four.

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.367
So what's this gonna be?

00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:16.933
Well, let's see, one half
times six times three.

00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:18.392
That's three times three.

00:06:18.392 --> 00:06:20.766
That's going to be nine.

00:06:20.766 --> 00:06:23.273
One half times one times four.

00:06:23.273 --> 00:06:24.966
That's going to be two.

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:27.900
And then one half times two times four.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.376
Well that's just going to be four.

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:34.900
And so we're left with 24 minus
nine minus two minus four.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.133
So, this we're gonna do the same color.

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:39.433
Minus four, so what is that?

00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:41.800
24 minus nine is 15.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.933
15 minus two is 13.

00:06:43.933 --> 00:06:47.266
13 minus four is equal to nine.

00:06:47.266 --> 00:06:48.856
It's equal to nine.

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:51.500
So that's the other way, or another way

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.500
to get the area of this green triangle.
