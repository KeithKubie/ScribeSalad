evidence my god the evidence about
 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.919

adolescence when Greg and I wrote the

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700
adolescence when Greg and I wrote the
 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.450
adolescence when Greg and I wrote the
article we were you know we saw lots of

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
article we were you know we saw lots of
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.339
article we were you know we saw lots of
hints that depression and anxiety were

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
hints that depression and anxiety were
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.959
hints that depression and anxiety were
going way up yeah and we think that's

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
going way up yeah and we think that's
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.020
going way up yeah and we think that's
related to the overprotection yeah okay

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
related to the overprotection yeah okay
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.550
related to the overprotection yeah okay
so let's talk about that just for a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
so let's talk about that just for a
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.260
so let's talk about that just for a
second there go back to the book so I've

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
second there go back to the book so I've
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.630
second there go back to the book so I've
got a potential demographic explanation

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
got a potential demographic explanation
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.820
got a potential demographic explanation
over that in part well and I don't know

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
over that in part well and I don't know
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.170
over that in part well and I don't know
if you guys have looked into this or not

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
if you guys have looked into this or not
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.660
if you guys have looked into this or not
well there's there's two things that I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670
well there's there's two things that I
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.320
well there's there's two things that I
think might be contributing to it

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330
think might be contributing to it
 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.110
think might be contributing to it
one is two or three things one is the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
one is two or three things one is the
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.340
one is two or three things one is the
average age at which children are the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
average age at which children are the
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.540
average age at which children are the
average age at which people have

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
average age at which people have
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.790
average age at which people have
children's gone way up

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800
children's gone way up
 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.020
children's gone way up
why does that matter well because I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
why does that matter well because I
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.670
why does that matter well because I
think people get more conservative and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
think people get more conservative and
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619
think people get more conservative and
cautious as they get older a little bit

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
cautious as they get older a little bit
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.119
cautious as they get older a little bit
but true but it's a very small effect

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
but true but it's a very small effect
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.010
but true but it's a very small effect
okay and it's wait a second okay it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
okay and it's wait a second okay it's
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.900
okay and it's wait a second okay it's
the having of the kids which is what

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
the having of the kids which is what
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.310
the having of the kids which is what
makes them more conservative when you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
makes them more conservative when you
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590
makes them more conservative when you
have kids you are more threat sensitive

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
have kids you are more threat sensitive
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.790
have kids you are more threat sensitive
you're more likely to vote for the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
you're more likely to vote for the
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.639
you're more likely to vote for the
right-wing party so just delaying child

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
right-wing party so just delaying child
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670
right-wing party so just delaying child

child birth wouldn't okay what about
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.009
child birth wouldn't okay what about
what about fewer siblings that would yes

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
what about fewer siblings that would yes
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.440
what about fewer siblings that would yes
that's part of it and this is what we're

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
that's part of it and this is what we're
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.179
that's part of it and this is what we're
seeing in Asia too when you have a lot

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
seeing in Asia too when you have a lot
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.910
seeing in Asia too when you have a lot
of kids you're not quite as worried you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
of kids you're not quite as worried you
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.750
of kids you're not quite as worried you
don't have all your eggs in one basket

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
don't have all your eggs in one basket
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.670
don't have all your eggs in one basket
well and you can you can write as

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
well and you can you can write as
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260
well and you can you can write as
worried and the siblings raise each

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
worried and the siblings raise each
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.520
worried and the siblings raise each
other that's right right and then

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
other that's right right and then
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.510
other that's right right and then
there's a lot of things all night a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
there's a lot of things all night a
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.460
there's a lot of things all night a
larkey story that's maybe not right

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
larkey story that's maybe not right
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.320
larkey story that's maybe not right
exactly it's the free play and the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
exactly it's the free play and the
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.940
exactly it's the free play and the
fighting the working things out for

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
fighting the working things out for
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950
fighting the working things out for
themselves those are essential skills of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
themselves those are essential skills of
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.109
themselves those are essential skills of
adulthood okay so good so then all right

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
adulthood okay so good so then all right
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.270
adulthood okay so good so then all right
yeah let me take Emily sighs as part of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
yeah let me take Emily sighs as part of
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.010
yeah let me take Emily sighs as part of
it right well and then also what's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
it right well and then also what's
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660
it right well and then also what's
happening increasingly in schools is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
happening increasingly in schools is
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.670
happening increasingly in schools is
that kids aren't allowed free play and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
that kids aren't allowed free play and
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.190
that kids aren't allowed free play and
they're certainly not allowed

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200
they're certainly not allowed
 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.179
they're certainly not allowed
rough-and-tumble free play would

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
rough-and-tumble free play would
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.920
rough-and-tumble free play would
actually that's right that's one of the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
actually that's right that's one of the
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.899
actually that's right that's one of the
biggest things also the two that there

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
biggest things also the two that there
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760
biggest things also the two that there
are three giant there are a lot of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
are three giant there are a lot of
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.130
are three giant there are a lot of
causes it's I mean this is such actually

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
causes it's I mean this is such actually
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.539
causes it's I mean this is such actually
it's really fun puzzle because it's like

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
it's really fun puzzle because it's like
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.920
it's really fun puzzle because it's like
the biggest social science puzzle of our

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
the biggest social science puzzle of our
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.230
the biggest social science puzzle of our
age what is happening that's making so

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
age what is happening that's making so
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.359
age what is happening that's making so
many of our systems go haywire and I'm

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
many of our systems go haywire and I'm
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.490
many of our systems go haywire and I'm
focusing on the university the big three

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
focusing on the university the big three
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.830
focusing on the university the big three
I would say our one is the loss of free

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
I would say our one is the loss of free
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.499
I would say our one is the loss of free
of unsupervised free play yeah okay and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
of unsupervised free play yeah okay and
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060
of unsupervised free play yeah okay and

among young animals they have to
practice the skills for adulthood yeah

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
practice the skills for adulthood yeah
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.139
practice the skills for adulthood yeah
and getting in cakes that's shown that -

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
and getting in cakes that's shown that -
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.260
and getting in cakes that's shown that -
exactly so getting in conflicts and then

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
dealing with it
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.580
dealing with it
sometimes losing and we come back having

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
sometimes losing and we come back having
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.259
sometimes losing and we come back having
game in which there's a problem but you

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269
game in which there's a problem but you
 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.520
game in which there's a problem but you
have to work it out or the game stops

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
have to work it out or the game stops
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.679
have to work it out or the game stops
that's what kids always did yeah it's

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689
that's what kids always did yeah it's
 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.089
that's what kids always did yeah it's
only recently the nine peaking in the

only recently the nine peaking in the
 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.770
only recently the nine peaking in the
90s that they're always supervised

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
90s that they're always supervised
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.599
90s that they're always supervised
because we're afraid if we take our eyes

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609
because we're afraid if we take our eyes
 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.369
because we're afraid if we take our eyes
off them they'll be kidnapped and that

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379
off them they'll be kidnapped and that
 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.609
off them they'll be kidnapped and that
was never a risk that's never
