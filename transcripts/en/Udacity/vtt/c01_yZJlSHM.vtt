00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.940
Since we're talking about functions that are even,
functions that are odd,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.628
and potentially functions that are neither even nor odd,

00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:12.639
I've a graphed a bunch of different curves over here for you, curves and lines,

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.371
and I've labeled each of them with a letter.

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:21.471
I'd like you to tell me whether each of these graphs represents an even function, an odd function,

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:23.749
or neither an even function nor an odd function.
