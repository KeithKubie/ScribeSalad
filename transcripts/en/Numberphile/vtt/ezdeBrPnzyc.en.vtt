00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.560
Brady: "Careful, the Droste box."

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.000
Thank you.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.100
Hey, it's Brady Haran's birthday. By way of wishing him happy birthday,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.860
I made him a cake. So let's give him a quarter of this cake.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.800
Let's just say oh, you know, let's divide this up.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.280
Brady: "It's a square, is it?"

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.220
It's a square eight inches on a side, give or take. Let's divide it up

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.040
and put a few Sprinkles over here. There you go, Brady. I'll put a candle right in the middle.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.580
Where's my candle? What'd I do with the candle? Let's cut it right along here,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.280
along here.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.620
I made sure that this is halfway along there and over there. Yep, we got a quarter of this out of here.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.139
Okay, now I've got a cake. Oh, it's a square cake missing one corner. My wife's coming home.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.839
I've got two kids coming home and me.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.540
How can I divide

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.970
this remaining

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.930
part of the cake

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.229
into four equal parts?

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.759
That will make

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.689
both of my kids, my wife and me happy? Look easy to do it in three parts.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.989
One, two, right? One part, two part, three part.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.149
How do you divide this up into 4 equal parts?

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030
I told you that was gonna happen!

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140
I warned you. My wife's gonna kill me

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.420
for good reason.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.900
Didn't just warn me, it happened. Twice. So I'm an idiot.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.390
Brady: "Oh no!

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.140
"How did the fire get to the cocoa?"

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.809
It burned its way through here, and you can see the cocoa itself is burning.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.660
What shape is this in? It's sort of an L-shape.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.449
What if I reduce that L?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.160
And repeat, repeat it like this, and then a cut here,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.920
a cut here.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.360
I've now got four pieces that are nominally the same.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.489
One L-Shape here,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
one L-Shape here,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.770
one L-Shape here, and then one over here. They're all the same size,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.950
and, if you think about it,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.539
we can use recursion to do the same thing for Brady's piece

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.670
The whole cake was four, the whole cake was four, Brady got one full unit.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.889
I get three-quarters of a unit, my wife gets three quarters of a unit,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.289
one kid gets three quarters of a unit, the other kid gets three quarters of a unit.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.130
And it's all right because Brady got the biggest piece.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.940
Brady: "I've already had a little bit, Cliff

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.240
"I've already been eating it."

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.820
The cocoa itself is burning.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.580
Brady: "I warned you. I said don't put the candle."

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.040
I know! Hey, you did more than just warn me. So how do I get rid of this?

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.179
Geez it's hot! It's on fire!

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.819
Brady: "It's not going to be like a bomb or something is it 'cause it's all like packed in?"

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.029
Yes, exploding cocoa has been this huge problem across the ages!
