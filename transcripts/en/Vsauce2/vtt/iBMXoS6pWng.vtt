00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.599
Zorba.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:14.599
Zorba.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:15.599
Zorba.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.740
What if your briefcase had a secret?

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.740
Zorba.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.150
What instead of reams of paper inside was
full-featured computer?

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.150
Zorba.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.079
Introducing, Zorba.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.070
A rugged, portable computer for the new millennium.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.130
Featuring a 7” green CRT monitor, two 5.25
double sided, double density disk drives and

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.680
detachable keyboard with 2 foot coiled cord.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.170
Available now for just $1,595.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.640
Zorba.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.570
It's worth it.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.629
Zorba Portable Computer.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.760
The Expert’s Choice.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.679
Vsauce!

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.510
Kevin here.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.790
With a 34-year-old computer that took me three
weeks, 30 emails with three vintage computer

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.050
experts and a special request from an eBay
store exclusively dedicated to selling old

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.110
floppy disks… just to get it to play Zork.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.439
This is the Modular Micros Zorba 7.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.500
One of the earliest mobile computers, its
22 pound weight is 11 times heavier than a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.310
current MacBook, but it cost about the same
at $1595.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.810
Except that after adjusting for inflation,
that %1595 is actually $4,000 today.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.020
So in 1984, the equivalent of four grand got
you 4 MHz.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.789
Which at the time was four times the clock
speed of Apollo 11’s guidance computer,

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.590
but was about 996 MHz short of being able
to run Flappy Bird.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.870
So what can you do with this?

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.100
Skyrim.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.800
Well, 1977 Skyrim.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.280
A game called Zork.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.710
Alright, so let's do this.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.650
Let’s pop this in and check it out.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.260
There's the disk, hit enter.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.540
And.. error.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.680
And error.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.820
Error.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.310
It's literally just gonna keep doing this.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.970
This is where I was stuck for weeks.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.750
I'm just gonna reset it because it's not gonna
stop beeping.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.110
Okay and we're back.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.380
This computer will not run software without
very specific boot disks because it has no

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.580
built-in operating system.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.240
Zorba was one of the last 8-bit portable computers
running CP/M -- an operating system which

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.410
required booting from a disk before loading
any software.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.610
Computers that ran CP/M could run virtually
any software at that time since it was industry

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.340
standard -- which it would have remained,
except the company who developed CP/M failed

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.900
to sign a legal agreement with IBM to use
it on their brand new 16-Bit computers…

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.700
So IBM went with Microsoft instead and MS-DOS
conquered PCs.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.280
Whoops!

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.700
The problem with my Zorba is I bought it without
any disks.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.750
Only 6,000 Zorbas were ever made, so finding
one that still functions and has the system

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.280
disks is tough.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.970
Also finding anyone who A: Knows how Zorba
works and B: Has the ability to make new Zorba

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.830
disks was… difficult.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.090
The disk with all the errors was from some
guy who didn't know what he was doing.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.070
But a guy named Retro Rescue System did know
what he was doing and came through and made

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.830
me this system disk which does work.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.410
Check it out.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.850
Oooh.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.420
And Zorba is alive.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.840
It has a built-in 7” CRT screen, 4mhz CPU,
64k bytes of RAM, detachable keyboard, and

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.790
a weather-proof protective carry case.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.340
These computers were referred to as “luggables”
and they’re the direct ancestors of laptops.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.290
It was designed for business professionals
to do spreadsheets and word processing but

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.310
it became capable of doing world processing.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.030
In 1977 -- the same month Star Wars came out
-- four guys from MIT turned a side project

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.910
into one of the most influential and forgotten
pieces of gaming history.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.040
Zork was the first game to implement gameplay
elements that seem so self-evident that we

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.400
don’t even think about them now.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.910
Okay let's load Zork.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.871
Now that the operating system is loaded in
disk drive A, we have to access disk drive

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:03.160
B which is where Zork 1 is loaded.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.930
And now that B is accessed we just type in
Zork1 and return...

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.120
I messed that up.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.600
Don't mess this up.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:23.440
It's very particular.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.490
And there we go.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.090
You are standing in an open field west of
a white house, with a boarded front door.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.130
There is a small mailbox here.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.880
So one of the gameplay elements that we don't
think about today is objects having weight.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.180
A solid gold bar weighs more than a newspaper,
and the total number of objects carried depends

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.840
on the weight of their contents.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.480
Think Dark Souls.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.340
Or that items themselves can have contents.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.300
Meaning, it’s not just a bottle, it’s
a bottle that must be opened because there’s

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.280
water inside that you need.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.570
And the capacity of containers is also considered
so a paper bag won’t hold as much as a bucket.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.270
Zork also featured gaming’s first real villain
with its own personality.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.400
In his book Twisty Little Passages, Nick Montfort
identifies the thief as gaming’s first memorable

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.860
character.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.440
And the monstrous grue, responsible for one
of the 28 ways you can die in Zork, became

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.200
an early meme, you can still find “You are
likely to be eaten by a grue” T-shirts on

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.200
Amazon.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.380
Zork’s creators were inspired by a groundbreaking
game called Colossal Cave Adventure.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.510
“Adventure” was a text-based journey through
a fictional underground cave based on the

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.240
actual Mammoth Caves in Kentucky, and researchers
with access to high-end computers were in

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.260
love with it.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.180
Dave Lebling, one of the Zork creators, said,
“For 2 weeks, all work on the ARPANET stopped.”

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.920
The precursor to the internet was delayed
because of a video game.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.700
But Adventure was too simplistic for them.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.820
The parser only allowed for two-word commands,
like “Go north” or “Take shovel.”

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.850
They wanted to create a dynamic, immersive
text adventure that could handle nuanced full

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.070
sentences and had a sense of humor.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:23.290
Zork players could type full commands like
&gt; SWING BOTTLE AT TROLL, and they’d be met

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.340
with responses such as “Trying to attack
a troll with a glass bottle is suicidal.”

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.790
To distribute the game, Zork partnered with
Personal Software, a company with an impossibly

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:33.860
generic name.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.850
PS was responsible for VisiCalc, the first
ever spreadsheet program.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.840
Visicalc was one of the first pieces of software
to lure businesses into computers -- and Zork

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.540
was along for the ride.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.560
It’s funny to think about now, but at that
time, people had never seen a game this detailed

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.760
-- it wasn’t even like playing a game.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.630
It was like playing a book.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:01.750
But there was no in-game map or strategy guide,
let alone walkthroughs or YouTubing.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:07.760
Zork players spent weeks making their own
detailed maps of the world’s dungeon, items,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.060
mazes, and NPCs.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.620
Although they eventually published a hint
book printed in invisible ink to avoid spoilers

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.590
which now goes for $150 bucks.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:23.650
The result was connecting a complex story
directly to each player’s imagination.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:28.740
Without graphics to influence your concept
of the game, everything you visualized came

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.669
from your own thoughts.

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:36.270
And like modern franchises like The Witcher
or Mass Effect, players made choices and those

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.110
choices had ramifications.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.349
They had agency in a fantasy world unique
to them.

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:48.079
Zork was you -- only you.

00:08:48.079 --> 00:08:54.140
Zork’s rich world model helped pave the
way for everything from Zelda to Resident

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.459
Evil, but very few people seem to talk about
Zork.

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:01.459
So what happened?

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:06.720
Zork sold nearly half a million copies over
the next 5 years and helped fuel the first

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.490
round of the personal computer boom.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.110
But computers got more powerful.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:18.029
Companies like Sierra invested early in graphics-based
games which were about to take over.

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:25.319
Suddenly, the pioneering genre of text-adventure
games became an echo of the past.

00:09:25.319 --> 00:09:31.430
In 1985, Super Mario Bros. revolutionized
home gaming on the NES and that system was

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:38.000
so legendary that Nintendo recently revived
it with the NES Classic and sold over 2 million

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.160
units.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.839
No one is reviving Zorba.

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:47.269
By the time Zorba came out in 1984 it was
pretty much dead luggable walking.

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:53.660
Apple’s Macintosh introduced the GUI with
its famous Super Bowl ad and IBM’s DOS-based

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:59.050
PCjr came at an affordable $999.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.089
Zorba was trapped in time.

00:10:03.089 --> 00:10:09.610
But Zorba was part of the initial wave of
being able to take a computer with you.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.120
Zork was ground zero.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.149
Oh this is really hard to do.

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:18.170
This thing, no wonder no one bought this thing.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:24.100
Let's take this thing with me, clunk, clunk,
clunk.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.319
Alright.

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:29.769
Zork was ground zero for complex storytelling.

00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:36.319
And now everyday, we walk around with a computer
in our pocket capable of turning our lives

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:38.860
into digital stories.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.110
Your phone is Zorba.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.420
Your life is Zork.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.290
And the decisions we make can lead to Grue
or gold.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:11:36.550
And as always, thanks 

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.550
for watching.
