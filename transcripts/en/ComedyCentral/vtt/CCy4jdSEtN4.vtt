00:00:01.168 --> 00:00:03.570
You're getting married.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.972
It's such a huge deal.

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:06.707
I can't believe
it's happening to me.

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:07.841
Neither can we.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.843
Psych, you're the best.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.645
You guys are
my best friends.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.547
Okay, open your
presents, bitch.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:14.982
( Amy )
Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.986
Phil!

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.420
I use the same
kind myself.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:23.257
Let's just say it
really knows what it's doing.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.425
Okay.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.227
Me next,
me next, me next.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.766
This is called the Herminator
and it's the same one I use.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.669
It has an alarm clock
and voice control.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.638
It is the best.

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:38.705
No offense.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:39.740
None taken.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.610
Actually, speaking
of the best, open mine.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:46.346
Oh, boom!

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:50.617
Yeah, it's the Good Vibrations
Sweet Sensations,

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.553
and this thing
makes my eyes pop out

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:57.157
of my head and become
my vagina.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.326
Um, I just found
the battery life on those

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.128
things to be dog shit.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:04.131
Um, actually, it's also
a Boingo hotspot

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:08.168
and I know you travel a lot,
so I'm just really considerate.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.070
We haven't opened
my gift yet.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.343
It has GPS, you can
download 5,000 songs on it.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.378
Did I mention that you can link
mine up to your Facebook page?

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.682
You know what, mine also
functions as a mezuzah,

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.250
for when you
and Adam get a place.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.451
Holy cow!

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.253
Oh, a mezuzah's just
what Jewish people hang

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.388
outside their door
to feel safe.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.389
I know.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.525
You guys are
amazing friends.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.827
Yeah, but like,
I'm your best friend

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.096
and I just want you
to know that I care

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.299
about your vagina more
than I care about my own

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.103
and that's like the most
possible you can care,

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.137
if that makes sense.

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:45.339
It does make sense.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.908
But I also care about
your vagina a ton.

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.544
You know, sometimes
too much, I wonder.

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:51.678
I do wonder that.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.547
You know, I just--
for me, I just really

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:54.781
want your vagina to
be on the brink

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.950
of exhaustion
at all times.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.153
Carly, I haven't
opened yours yet.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.489
All the other gifts were so
amazing, it's embarrassing.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.192
Let's keep it light,
Carly.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.760
Come on!

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.395
Okay.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.796
Now you know I don't
make a lot of money

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:11.431
working at the
Container Store.

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.066
We do know, Carly.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.336
We know, because you've
said it a number of times.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:20.073
There's nothing we can do about
how much you get paid there.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.176
So I kind of made
you something.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.715
What is it?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.484
It's also a vibrator.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:33.954
That's us sophomore year
at the Grand Canyon.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.223
Oh Carly,
this is the best one.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.224
Really?

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.259
This is my favorite one.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.528
You guys,
isn't this the best one?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.831
It is nice,
colorful.

00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:45.999
Here, pass it around.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.768
It took about nine
hours from sketching

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.270
it out to its full
realization.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.105
Oh no.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.106
Oh.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.808
Oh, I guess
the glue's not dry.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.510
I'm sure you just
stick it back on.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.445
Some of the shells
are still sandy.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.447
Just be careful,
I guess.
