00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.300
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Welcome to
the National Book Festival.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.350
My name is Rumaan Alam, i"m an
editor at the New York Times,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.230
and it is such a
pleasure to be here.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.820
I was saying to one of the --

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.920
one of the women working
the event that I've been

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.710
to a lot of book festivals.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.160
And I expected something
really sedate and quiet

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.310
with like a few -- a few old
ladies with tote bags walking

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.650
down the hall, and it's
like Black Friday out there.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.370
Which is an amazing -- which
is testament to what kind

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.540
of a literary city
Washington D.C. is.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.760
And so, I'm really happy to be
here, and it's really a pleasure

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.840
to share the stage
with Sujatha Gidla,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.820
who has written a beautiful book
called Ants among Elephants:

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.660
An Untouchable Family and
the Making of Modern India.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.250
I have a million
questions for Sujatha,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.090
and I'm sure you will as well.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.520
So, about fifteen minutes
before we wrap up, I'll open it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.470
up to questions from
the audience.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.950
But we're going to begin by
listening to Sujatha read

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.620
from her book and then I'm
going to drive her crazy

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.310
with a million questions,
so, please.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.160
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Hi everybody.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.120
So, the book is Ants
among Elephants,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.430
this is my family
biography that intersects

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.060
with the you could
say biography India --

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.180
of India, Independent India.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.770
And I want to start with the --

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.710
this section that
describes my uncle's wedding.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.090
He was 25, 24 years old and
the wedding is taking place

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.150
in a village, and this is

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.510
about the preparation
of the wedding feast.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.350
In fact, somebody
actually, you know,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.580
suggested that I send this
excerpt to Food and Wine.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.010
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: You should
-- oh, is this about the pig?

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.310
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.610
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yes,
you should, you should.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.910
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: And it --
they would have been like,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.290
really horrified [inaudible].

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.590
So, all right.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.780
"On the morning of the wedding
Majula was walking by loud cries

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.920
from the alley next to here
uncle Galea's[Phonetic] house

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.370
in Sankarapuram .

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.410
She sat up in fright and
started praying, "Oh,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.350
David, Jesus, Lord save us!"

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.090
A cousin of hers sitting
nearby put her sari end

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.680
to her mouth to hide her smile.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.980
What, papa?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.620
No need to be scared,
they're just chasing the pig."

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.070
When Presenadro[Phonetic]
announced his son's wedding

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.670
to the village, everyone
started drooling

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.100
at that thought of the pig.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.840
A wedding in an untouchable
colony is a festival,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.820
and at the center of the
festival is the feast.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.550
At -- and at the center
of the feast is the pig.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.830
As soon as a match is fixed,
both the bride's house

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.050
and the groom's house get
hold of a piglet by buying one

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.570
in an untouchable market
or catching a stray.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.160
For weeks the families raise
their pigs with great care.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.760
A wedding pig is
no ordinary pig,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.030
it must be be treated
with respect.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.790
No one is allowed to
talk harshly to it,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.660
even if it should get n the way.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.850
"Hey, watch your mouth,
that's the wedding pig!"

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.400
The families feed it
as well as they can,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.120
giving it starch water left
after rice is cooked to drink,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.570
or sometimes even [inaudible].

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.840
Most untouchable families don't
have that kind of food to spare.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.800
And the best thing about a pig
is that it can feed itself.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.790
The staple for pigs in India
is what's delicately called --

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.090
filth.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.620
They eat human shit.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.360
If the [inaudible]
family it too poor

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.410
to feed their pig,
it's not a big deal.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.260
The pig simply goes around
the village eating shit

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.340
and gets just as fat.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.880
Untouchables will often
marvel, shit it may beat,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.460
but a pig's meat is the
sweetest meat of all.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.760
But the announcement of
[inaudible]'s wedding meant more

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.220
than just the prospect of pig.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.610
Presenadro had risen
above the condition

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.810
of all those he left
behind in Sankarapuram .

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.220
He was a teacher not a farmhand.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.620
He had lived in cities
and towns.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.860
He interacted with Caste people,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.820
with other educated
people, people with jobs.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.150
In the eyes of the villagers
he was a -- he was wealthy.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.400
He owned four and a
half acres of land.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.580
His son was the first ever to --

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.160
first ever college going
man from the village.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.000
And now that -- not the eldest

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.170
and favorite son was getting
married, there would be a lot

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.930
of pork at this feast.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.690
[inaudible] might even
get a pig that -- of --

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.150
pig of that exotic new breed.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.580
Only a year or two earlier,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.570
a new breed of pig had
arrived in the country.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.870
They're known

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.380
as Semapundalu[Phonetic]
European pigs,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.540
they come from Russia.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.100
Some call them red pigs
because their skin is pink

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.320
and hairless, and smooth.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.790
They're raised on farms in pens
not like loose in the streets.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.680
They're fed a calibrated diet
and grow many times fatter

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.000
and larger than Indian pigs.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.870
In fact, they seem to
have nothing in common

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.540
with the black, hairy,
filthy native pigs.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.670
But, whenever some -- whenever
anyone tries to raise one

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.190
of these foreign
pigs on his own,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.190
pretty soon it loses
its caste and turns

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.390
into an ordinary Indian pig.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.920
It's pink turning to black, it's
fat shrinking away as it runs

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.080
through the street
wallowing in sewers

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.350
and swallowing the effluvium.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.230
Everyone in Sankarapuram
looked forward

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.880
to tasting a European pig
at [inaudible]'s wedding.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.330
But, Presendra[Phonetic] had --

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.680
Presendra's[Phonetic]
son had other ideas.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.950
When the matter of the pig came
up it pained Satyam[Phonetic]

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.790
that his relatives were so
different from his cast friends.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.230
He had attended many

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.400
of his friend's weddings
while living in Gurdwara.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.280
And except for
Nyteria[Phonetic],

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.580
none of them had served meat.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.910
Meat is believed by
Hindus to be impure.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.550
Brahmins the purest
caste, eat no meat at all,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.860
not even fish or eggs.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.870
Untouchables, being impure
themselves eat even carian[beef]

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.190
the flesh of cows that drop dead

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.200
by the roadside of
age or disease.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.330
Which, since cows are sacred

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.570
and cannot be slaughtered is
the only kind of beef that falls

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.870
to human consumption
under Hindu law.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.680
Middle caste except for merchant
caste eat meat but never beef.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.000
And it is inauspicious
to serve any meat at all

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.250
at births, funerals, or wedding.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.820
Satyam[Phonetic] considered it
uncultured and even barbaric

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.400
to eat the flesh of a
pig on any occasion.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.230
A pig to a caste Hindu
is a symbol of filth.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.860
Untouchables are commonly
associated with two creatures,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.670
the craw -- the crow
for its blackness

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.130
and the pig for its foulness.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.930
When people assembled under the
Banyan tree to plan the feast,

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.290
Satyam[Phonetic] told them
there would be no pig.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.670
The elders took the
cigars out of their mouths.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.970
"What? What?

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.530
A wedding feast with no pig?"

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.840
Satyam[Phonetic] replied,
There won't beany meat."

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.680
They couldn't believe
their ears.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.130
The most fabulous that they
would ever attend was turning

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.430
out to be the worst
one they ever heard of.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.750
They wanted nothing
to do with it.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.500
Men, women, and children turned
and went home disappointed,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.480
but Satyam[Phonetic]
was unmoved.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.780
Discussion of the village --

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.390
discussion in the village
went on for several days.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.330
In the end, the elders
came to Presendro[Phonetic]

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.930
with a proposal, "How about a
pig for the village and hens

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.230
for the having red people?"

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.540
that is educated people,
the educated ones.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.320
Satyam[Phonetic] said, "Never!"

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.050
Presendro[Phonetic]
took his son's side,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.910
"He has stopped eating beef
in [inaudible] when had

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.060
to hide his caste for the sake
of being allowed to rent a room

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.230
in the house of a
caste in the family."

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.240
And now, the very thought of
beef was revolting to him.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.900
He didn't mind pork himself,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.610
but he could understand
how his son felt.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.750
Instead of a pig, he had
bought sacks of vegetables

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.700
and from some kamas[Phonetic],
whose children he taught

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.000
in Thalipuru[Phonetic],

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.790
some strange upper
caste flour based foods,

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.680
uperdums[Phonetic]
and ladus[Phonetic].

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.090
The villagers decided to boycott
the wedding all together.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.970
One thing saved the day,
neither Presendro[Phonetic] nor

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.010
Satyam[Phonetic] had a say in
what the bride's family could

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.520
or could not serve
at their feast

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.310
on the night of the wedding.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.260
Everyone knew
Kadumarah[Phonetic] had already

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.620
been raising a pig for
the last few weeks.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.390
Whether Kadumarah
bought the pig --

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.390
bought his big or caught
it himself was not clear,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.060
but it was a black Indian pig.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.970
That was the pig the young men
of the village were chasing

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.630
on the morning of the wedding

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.800
when they woke Majula
with their cries.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.200
Majula went out to watch the
agile young men armed with long,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.970
thick sticks, and clenching
cigars between their molars,

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.180
running through the village,
loin clothes pulled tight

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.220
over their crotches and
between their buttocks,

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.110
their bodies shiny with sweat.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.100
One carried a special net.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.710
The children of the village, 20,
30 of them naked, dust coated,

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.940
wild haired, runny nosed.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.760
The girls among them
also all naked,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.250
but for their snail shell
anklets and the little silver

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:48.400
or copper disks strung
around their waists

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.490
to preserve their modesty.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.410
They ran along the hunters.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.790
Everyone was screaming as
loud as he or she could.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.480
And the pig was screeching
even louder.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.480
Wild with fear, it
whizzed passed the house

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.850
like a cannonball, desperate
to escape the murderous youths.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.390
But a cloud of dust rose
beneath its hooves, and the feet

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.800
of the men right behind.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.100
it.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.570
The pig is chased instead
of just being tied down

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.050
and butchered to save its blood.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.250
The blood is what
makes it tasty.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.700
The idea is to scare the
pig with screams and cries

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.700
and make it run for its life

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.470
until it collapses
from exhaustion.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.120
In Sankarapardu[Phonetic]
that morning, young women

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.970
and girls admired the muscles
rippling beneath the men's

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.360
glistening brown skin as
they wielded their sticks.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.790
The women's eyes ran all over
the hunter's bodies taking

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.600
in the smalls of their backs,
their thighs, their chests,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.360
their narrow waists, the
lips that held their cigars.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.220
Each thought fondly
of her own man --

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:00.240
each thought fondly how her own
man ran faster than the rest,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.590
how he tackled the pick
expertly to the ground.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.520
The men were aware the
women were watching,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.930
and they tried their
hardest to impress them.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.180
The pig ran and ran for half an
hour until it could run no more,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.430
and finally it dropped
to the ground.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.210
One hunter threw his
special net over it,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.980
and the others raised
their sticks

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.280
and beat the animal
half conscious.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.570
They carried it to the
center of the village,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.140
and tied its snout shut
with a roop -- a rope.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.380
They tied its front
legs to a pole

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.830
and stood it up on
its hind legs.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.220
The dazed pig looked
up at the sky.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.600
As a piglet grows in size,
its neck gets soon so fat

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.830
that as long as it
lives, it is never able

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.830
to lift its head
and look at the sky.

skyward at last

in poverty all his life,
never having had a moment

of happiness, but for a
small respect at the end

when his son gets a
job and is finally able

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.510
to take care of his parents.

for the first time at
the end of his life.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.400
On that wedding morning,
the man responsible

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.690
for preparing the pig gently
roasted the still living pig,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.760
and carried it to
the bride's house.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.020
For lack of cutting board, they
unhinged the front door of --

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.700
and laid the pig on it.

Two elders, Uncle
Malayo[Phonetic]

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.730
and cousin Abednego were invited

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.430
to do the honors
and carve the pig.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.830
A few years before,
a Brahmin in Gurdwara

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.660
who worshiped Gandhi had
spread the principles

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.050
of nonviolence among all in
Sunri, especially the cruel

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.230
and crude untouchables.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.420
One day, he found himself
in an untouchable colony

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.930
where a feast was taking place.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.980
Before the men could
lay the pig on the door,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.220
the Brahmin pushed his way
forward and laid himself

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.650
down in the pig's place.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.080
He wept, "How can anyone

Haven't you heard the teachings
of our great spirit Gandhi?

up before they take a knife
to that creation of Gods.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.370
The youth in the colony full
drunk, pinned the Brahmin down

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.660
and held a knife to his throat
before their elders intervened.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.520
The Brahmin scurried off
and never tried that again.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.850
Good thing he didn't stay
to watch what they did next.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.080

bare to watch

as the wedding cook
separated out the intestines

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.140

it salty sauteed.

Other special parts
were carefully removed.

A curry made out of these
is not meant for everyone.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:14.780
A portion of it is given to the
pastor who performs the wedding,

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.800
and the rest goes to
the wedding families.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.510
For days the pig would
feed the whole colony.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.320
They'd make soup with
its bones and curries

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.980
out of its hooves and testicles.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.400

how diviine it is

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.950

"Chicken is nothing"

But the affair of the pig
is more than its taste.

The heroic -- it's heroic,
it's romantic, it's erotic.

It's a metaphor, it's rhetoric,
it is deeply philosophical.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.570
But these are all
mere super structures,

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.150

happy that read that section

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.670
because I love that metaphor
about the pig finally looking

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.490
up at the sky right
as its about to die.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.790
I think that we should start
at the beginning and talk --

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.940
just explain to an American
audience what caste means,

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.840
what is caste?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.140
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Okay.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.970
Caste is a social institution,
it's s social structure.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.890
I would say race in America is
also a social institution not

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.600
you know, based on
biological differences

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.350
between Blacks and Whites.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.150
I would say that in America
the race is a super --

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.370
a social structure,
because the fairest,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.570
the lightest skin Black man

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.440
with the bluest eyes is also a
Black man if there is one drop

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.500
of African blood in him.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.730
In that sense, caste is
a social institution.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.580
Unlike race, there is no
physical, visual differences

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.240
to tell one caste
from the other.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.590
Because of that, the differences
are imposed from outside,

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.450
these are external differences
imposed on these people.

You cannot go to the
same temples as we do.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.140
You cannot perform your weddings
in the same way that we do."

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:40.090
These are the external
differences imposed on people

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.620
to differentiate them that
these people are untouchable.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.620
So, caste in India,
the society is divided

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.210
into different castes.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.550
The top is Brahmins, they
are the purest caste.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:59.450
So, caste is -- has both -- two
things, occupation associated

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.850
with it, and purity, pollution,
scale associated with it.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:08.070
The Brahmins at the top,
they're a priestly caste.

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.660
They perform the priestly
functions, they're the purest.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.630
And the second is
Vais -- Vais --

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.900
no, Kshatriyas, that
is the warrior caste.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.490
And the third is the Vaishyas,
the merchant, trader caste.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.630
And the fourth is a
conglomeration of subcastes,

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.130
each defined by its occupation.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:33.390
Potters is one caste and
carpenters are one caste,

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.690
diggers ar one cast, and
even prostitution is a caste.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.440
It's by birth that
you're a prostitute,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.380
not by your choosing,
not by your --

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.600
circumstance, but
because you're born

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.430
in a prostitute family,
you are a prostitute.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.590
And underneath all
of these four castes,

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.850
these are outcasts,
they're untouchables.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.960
And so, they have the filthiest
occupations given to them

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.010
such as, removing dead animals,
and the carrying of human shit.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:10.180
And handling dead bodies are
these people's occupation.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.840
And there is nothing one can
do to choose their caste,

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.480
and there's nothing one can
-- that can do to escape.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.720
You're born into your
caste and you die in it.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.020

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.320

&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: But when -- so,
you mentioned before that --

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.460
it's the sort of
irrevocable imposed structure.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.370
How can people define
one another?

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.580
Like, how can you tell that
somebody is of a certain caste?

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.880
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.400
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Like, what are
the ways in which it's clear

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.950
to one person exactly how to
categorize another person?

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.910
If it's not about skin color,
like, what is it about?

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.350
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: So,
Rumaan here is South Asian,

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:58.100
I'm South Asian, do you see any
racial difference between us?

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:04.960
Nothing. So, but you have to put
these people apart, you know,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.260
so that everyone can say,
these people are untouchables.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.680
So, the first thing they
do is, they're not allowed

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.810
to live inside villages.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.710
They have to live on the
outskirts of a village,

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.110
they come into the village
only to perform services.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.380
So, the fact that you're
living there is one thing.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.770
And the second thing is
that, no interaction --

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:37.070
I mean, like in -- only a few
decades ago, women in Kerala,

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.570
the untouchable women were not
allowed to cover their breasts.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.380
They had to be -- they had
to stand naked breasted,

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.370
naked chested -- chest in
front of the landlords.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:52.170
And if their -- if they want to
cover their breasts they have

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:56.240
to pay tax, which is
very high and it's hard

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:02.030
for untouchables to, you know,
to be able to cover themselves.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.370
So, it's the Indian missionaries
that came there that fought

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.940
against that system, and
finally won the right

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.020
of untouchable women
to cover their breasts.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.160
So, this is one example of
how you set apart these woman.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.720
These women are not
covering breasts means

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.430
that these are untouchables.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.530
These women -- these
men are allowed only

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.550
to wear only loin cloth which
means that he's an untouchable.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:32.170
And he's wearing this hair
cut in a very odd fashion

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.060
that means he's an untouchable.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.540
He is not allowed to wear
footwear, that's an untouchable.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:42.010
And in one part of the country
you're supposed to hang a pot

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.850
on your neck so that your --
you cannot spit on the ground,

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.380
because other people
walk on the ground

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.860
and your spit is
filthy, it's impure.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.080
So,if you want to spit, you
can only spit in this thing.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.300
And you have to tie a
broom around your waist

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.630
so that wherever
you walk you wipe

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:06.190
and clean your you
know, steps behind you.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.780
And even now it exists.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.000
Like, a boy wanted to ride a
horse and his father was able

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.560
to buy a horse, but he was
killed because it is not done

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.770
that an untouchable
could ride a horse.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.970
And you could get killed
for wearing a watch,

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.480
you could get killed for
wear -- or riding a bicycle.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.030
And recently, a pregnant
woman was beaten to death

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:37.230
because she dared to touch
the trashcan of a caste Hindu.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.070
And these are like,
all these differences,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:47.850
which are not biologically
visual are imposed from outside.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.850
Don't wear a watch,
don't have a haircut,

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.890
don't ride a horse,
don't wear footwear.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.310
These are -- this is the way

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.900
that people differentiate
untouchables from caste Hindus.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.240
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I think there's
an assumption, at least it was

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.160
for me, that this way

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.110
of organizing society
is very -- very ancient.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.110
But, in fact, in
your book you talk

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.950
about your great grandfather?

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.970
Your great grandfather who had
been a sort of tribal person

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.130
in -- outside of an urban India.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.770
And this was -- this would have
been quite a while now, but now,

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.980
you know, not centuries ago.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:29.120
And that in his clan there
was no concept of cast.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.420
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.230
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And it was not
until the sort of urbanization

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.760
of this rural Indian
population that caste

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.140
as an idea even took hold.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:42.610
So, is it accurate to say
that it's not like, such a --

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.430
it's not an age old idea.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.730
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.210
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: It's not
old, it's a kind of --

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.800
it's weirdly a modern
way of organizing things.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.100
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.400
Yeah.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.700
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And you talk
about this books, the subtitle

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.290
of this book is The
Making of Modern India.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.840
And so, I think that works in
two ways where you're talking

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.980
about caste as a sort of
structure that helped give rise

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.780
to the India we know now.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.050
But you're also really
talking about--

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.850
in the section that Sujatha
read, Majula, the little girl --

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.150
the young woman who has gone

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.300
out to watch this erotic
pig hunt is her mother,

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.050
and the man who is getting
married is her uncle

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.760
Sacham[Phonetic]
or Eske[Phonetic]?

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.050
&gt;&gt; Esmay[Phonteci] es --
sorry Esmay[Phonetic], yeah.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.350
Okay.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.770
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And
he -- it seemed --

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.560
it felt to me like the making

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.140
of modern India was
really something

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.580
that he was a part of --

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.880
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.180
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Because,
this was a man who was,

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.500
as Sujatha has just said,
from a caste of people

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.460
for whom there was no
expectation in life.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.980
That you -- that he
would like a pig,

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.400
only see the sky upon
reaching his death.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.700
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.000
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: But he
wholly rejected that,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.430
and became a very significant,
political descenter.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:01.690
And sort of a gorilla
leader in a moment probably,

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.000
that's probably most associated
with what we understand

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.360
in this country as Communism,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.550
so this would have
been in the 50s --

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.850
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.150
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Right?

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.100
So, can you talk a little bit
about your uncle and what you --

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.190
when you were a child
did you understand

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.500
that your uncle was this kind

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.660
of freedom fighter,
that he was a hero?

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.840
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: So, my
uncle was born, you know,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.080
an untouchable, and they --
his family was very poor.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.970
And they were living in you
know, squalid conditions.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.180
But, at that time, the
British were ruling India,

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.320
and the whole nationalist
thing -- the struggle was, "Oh,

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.770
you know, we're poor because
the British are ruling.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.660
We're poor because they're
exploiting our resources.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.140
And so, it got into his mind
that, "Okay, if you get rid

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.720
of the British we will all
live, you know, like happily.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.970
Eat bread like the British
people, live in bungalows,

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.610
and wipe your mouths
with napkins",

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.280
and you know, that
kind of stuff.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.450
So, at 11 -- when
he was 11 years old,

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.870
there was an independence
movement.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.320
It came in the context
of World War II.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.770
World War II gave
Gandhi leverage.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.500
"Look, the British, we'll
support you in the world

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.900
if you give us independence."

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.710
So, it was somewhat militant,

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.740
more militant than
other struggles.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:28.080
And that struggle was what my 11
year old uncle was attracted to

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.290
and he participated in it.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.050
And at 16 the independence came,

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.630
and the very day the
independence came he saw.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.840
So, all these people
came together as one,

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.470
as united front to
fight the British.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.540
But once the British
left, these class lines,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.880
caste lines started
showing up, you know?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.180
And the very night of
the independence he saw

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.370
that things changed --

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.330
didn't change for him
or people like him.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:01.170
And the upper class, upper caste
people, the independence is

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.080
for them, for the lower caste,
untouchables by in large,

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.720
India remained the same.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.570
So, he was disillusioned with
the Independence Movement,

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.240
and you know, independence.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.640
But, at that very time,
there was a struggle going

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.640
on in the neighboring
state where the peasants,

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.530
the poor peasants were
revolting against a form

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.950
of slavery called
vehti[Phonetic], it's slavery,

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.790
but it's caste based slavery.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.630
So, that inspired him and
so, he wanted to join it,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:36.710
but by the time he was up to
it, the struggle was crushed.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.430
And it's because the
leaders of the struggle,

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.860
the Communists made a pact
with the rich peasants

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.910
and liquidated the struggle.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.810
And the poor peasants
who struggled,

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.790
fought for it, remained
the same.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.860
So, there was a dissident
group --

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.740
descent group who
broke off from it.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.740
And they were inspired
by the revolution

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.380
in China 1949 under Mao.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.600
And it's the Maoist struggle
that he was attracted to,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.700
and he went on to found
the Maoist movement

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:15.250
that now India calls the
most dangerous, you know,

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.950
security threat in India.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.660
That -- he was one of the
founders of the thing, and --

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.370
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And that's
an ongoing political struggle

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.670
in India.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.970
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla:
On going, yeah.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.270
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: The
Naxalites movement.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.570
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.640
Like, in the tribal areas, the
big mining companies are trying

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.840
to grab the land of tribals and
kick them out of the forests.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.430
So, he died, but his
legacy still lives

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.980
on even though he was
even expelled from it.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.170
So, it -- in that sense, he
wanted to take his destination

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.490
and his peoples' destination
in his own hands, and you know?

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.810
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Was that
something that you knew

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.110
about when you were a girl?

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.720
Did you have -- did
you understand

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.470
that your uncle was this man?

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.810
Or was it -- was that kept from
you because you were a child?

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.090
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: When I
was five years old he went

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.650
underground, he disappeared
from public life,

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.720
went to live in the forest.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.320
And we learned about him only

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.990
through the stories
of my mother.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.050
She would say, "That
your uncle went off

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:16.620
to fight for the poor people.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:22.060
He lives in the jungle, and
he has guns and all that stuff

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.910
to fight the rich
people, take their money

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.540
and distribute among
the poor people.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.850
That's the kind of story --

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.150
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: He's
like Robinhood.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.450
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla:
Robinson, right.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.750
.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.050
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.350
Yeah.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.650
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:37.950
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And --

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.250
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: So, obviously,
I was very inspired by that.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.550
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Right.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.850
So, I was going to -- I --

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.150
one of the most chilling
components comes toward the end

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.450
when you kind of
-- and I don't want

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.540
to spoil exactly what happens,
but, you shed some context

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:52.450
in the ways in which even this
Maoist struggle that seems to be

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.890
so idealistic, was
actually still riven

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.250
with these caste tensions.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.550
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.850
Yeah.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.150
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alma: And
that your uncle,

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:05.340
who was an untouchable man and
has this, really utopian ideal

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.970
that all men are created equal.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.270
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.570
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alma: Even
he was betrayed

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.870
by the people that he led --

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.170
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.470
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alma: That the
movement didn't really live

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.770
up to that particular standard.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.070
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.370
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alma: And
you close the book,

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.590
you do this really charming
thing of introducing yourself

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.060
as a baby at the end of
the book, and then you kind

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.520
of close the book
talking a little bit

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.350
about yourself as an adult.

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.800
And I'm curious,
whether you see yourself

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.480
as having inherited your uncle's
mantle of political activism?

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.460
and thinking about poverty,
and difference, and class,

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.970
and how we do that in this
country as opposed to India?

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.270
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Oh, yeah.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.570
Definitely.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.320
My uncle was the most
influential person in my life.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.000
And at 14, actually I wanted
to become a guerrilla like him.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.270
And it -- it was -- and I think
it was at 19 before I took

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.430
up rifle and ran off to forest,
I was arrested and tortured.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:30:02.090
So, that never happened, but --
and also, as I came to America,

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.310
and there's like, more
resources to read for yourself.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:09.530
And I read, you know, these
movements by myself instead

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.590
of getting indoctrinated.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.160
And I disagreed with
his political program

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.220
and tactics before he was
expelled from the party

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.510
that he himself founded,
and even after.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:28.900
But the main aim that, you know,
there should be equality, like,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.760
equal access to everybody
to all resources

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.750
that is still my ideal.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.570
And that problem is not
limited to untouchables

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.200
in India, but here as well --

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.500
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.800
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: You
know, the race question.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.640
And so, I don't see myself as
like, oh, I have to be in India

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.400
to fight against injustice, and
I can do this very well here.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:56.490
And I am very passionate about,
you know, social struggles,

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.250
anti racist struggles,
and I parcpated --

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.980
I participate in them.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.530
And of course, I do...

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:07.200
I still continue
his legacy of --

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.500
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.140
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: You know, the
passion for social struggle.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.920
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: We're going
to open it up to questions,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.080
so if anyone has a question,
but I have another one,

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.590
so while you guys are gathering
your thoughts or making your way

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.750
to the microphone, I want to ask
you a little bit about the way

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.960
in which you wrote this story.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.290
Because, you -- in the
section the Sujatha read,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:30.200
you could hear her reading
sort of close observations

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.920
and some scene setting.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.530
And in the New York Times
review by Michiko Kakutani,

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.010
she likened the work to Dickens.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.980
And I'm curious if
you can explain

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.890
to us how you learned
these stories.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.270
And how you approached
writing them.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.470
You used dialogue and
all of these things

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.450
that you couldn't had know,
because you weren't there.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.750
You weren't even
alive for so much

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.050
of what you're writing about

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:53.350
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.650
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Tell
me a little bit

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:59.530
about how you approached this
family's story, and how you,

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:02.010
you know, the responsibility
of writing something

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.110
that accurately -- accurately

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.590
that you couldn't
know firsthand.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.420
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: I
was able to write.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.910
I was even able to think of
writing down something only

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.690
because I left India
and I came to America.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:18.060
It's because, talking
about caste is taboo.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.130
The upper caste people
don't want to hear

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.550
that there is still
caste system in India.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.800
And lower caste people
like myself,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.140
we are too ashamed
to talk about it.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.830
We are too ashamed to inquire

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.810
into it why it happened
like that.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.740
And I came here, and I
came here during the Iraq

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.840
war demonstrations.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.990
And I saw at least
some White people

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.930
if not all White people
being anti racist,

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.610
and not just being anti racist,
but passionately anti racist.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:52.280
That could never had
been imagined in India

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.690
with untouchables
and caste Hindus.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:01.070
And so, if people are okay with
you know, people of other race

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.530
and it's not shame to
be a different race,

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.080
why can't I be like that?

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.630
Why should I be ashamed of
being born an untouchable?

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.480
So, that's when I
started inquiring,

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.580
why did I become an untouchable?

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:19.680
And so, I would talk
to different people,

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.760
but I thought the best source
would be to call my mother

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.960
and ask her, do you know
why we became untouchables?

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:33.150
And so, she started telling
the story of my ancestors,

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:37.110
that is her great grandfather.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.330
And it's only since then
that she knew the story of.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.460
And when she was
telling the story,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.030
I was able to realize how
they became untouchables.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.720
And so, while I started
this story to --

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.710
as an inquiring to
finding out caste,

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.400
but their stories themselves
I found very interesting.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.620
And she asked me to
talk to my uncle,

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.070
and my uncle led
a very colorful,

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.680
adventurous charismatic life.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.980
And --

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.280
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: That
is an understatement.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.580
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.880
Yeah.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.180
&gt;&gt; Ranmaan Alam: That
is an un -- I mean --

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.480
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.780
&gt;&gt; Ranmaan: Your uncle,
like, the things that he --

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.080
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.380
&gt;&gt; Ranmaan Gidla: The stories
that are relayed in his book,

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.680
and they have this quality
of -- it's almost like --

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.220
it's almost like the reader
gets to be on the telephone

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.540
and your uncle, do
you know what I mean?

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.840
It was like you're hearing --

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.140
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Oh!

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.440
Actually, a lot of this
interviewing is done

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.740
through the phone.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.040
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And
you can feel that.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.340
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.640
Yeah.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.940
&gt;&gt; Rumaan: Alam: I think
we have a question here.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.240
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah, sorry.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.540
&gt;&gt; I understand that
the constitution

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.840
of India reserves some
degree of political strength

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.430
to various castes by assured
proportions in the legislator.

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:41.810
I -- it at least originally did.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.330
But, is there a campaign by
the government or otherwise

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.450
to destroy the concept of caste?

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:52.350
To say, there are no difference,
that people are not predestined?

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:57.800
Essentially, is there any
acceptance of that as a concept

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.830
that the caste serves
no real purpose?

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.750
That it's a real --
it's a false concept?

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.960
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Actually,
I would disagree with you.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:11.130
Caste has a real purpose, it has
a real material basis for it.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.430
&gt;&gt; It --

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.540
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Because there
are certain classes of people,

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.600
a very tiny minority
of people benefit

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.010
from perpetuating this system.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.310
&gt;&gt; It has no biologic basis.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.610
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:24.910
Yeah.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.210
&gt;&gt; It serves economics.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.510
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.530
And the second thing is, in 1915
they have made untouchability a

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.300
ille -- a crime.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.500
But, India has literally,
thousands of rules

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.470
against caste discrimination,

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:42.750
but none of them
is ever respected.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:47.500
Just like here there is
no right or Black man

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.750
that White man is -- what is is?

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.740
Is obliged to respect, yeah.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.040
&gt;&gt; Is equal.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.340
It's, well --

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.640
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.940
&gt;&gt; Our system would
say equal justice.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.760
Is there a notion civically
and endorsed publically

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.860
that these considerations
just don't exist

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.160
and ought to be ignored?

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.540
Is there a popular
support for that?

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.840
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: A
popular support -- ?

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.080
&gt;&gt; In India for doing
away with the concept.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.520
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.820
I mean --

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.270
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Like,
politically is there any kind

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:21.920
of movement in the country to
move past the system to sort

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.910
of legalize -- legally say this
should not be the way it is?

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:29.260
Or you're saying -- or are you
saying that there are laws,

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.040
but socially they're
not enforced?

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.340
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.650
So, there's no point in fighting
for more laws and more you know,

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:42.970
these things, because the
laws are simply not followed.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:47.410
So, the only way
to fight for it is

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:50.510
to destroy the economic
structures

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.520
that necessitate the
perpetuation of caste.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.160
For example, in rural
India, landlords own castes

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.510
and they need laborers
to work for it.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:04.550
And they need laborers copiously
and reliably all the time.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.660
So, they don't want these people
to go to city and get educated

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.210
and become a doctor or a lawyer.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.270
They want to keep these people,

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.350
a reserve of people
to work on the land.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:18.110
That is the material
basis of caste.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:22.450
Caste is not like some evil idea
or something, it has a root,

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.550
economic root in it, you know?

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.590
And so, unless those
structures are demolished,

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.710
there's really no hope for you
know, abolishment of caste.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.010
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Right.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.310
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.610
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: We
have another questions.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:35.910
&gt;&gt; Hi. I have two questions.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.650
One is, where did
you learn to read?

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:41.540
I didn't know that India
educates untouchables.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.940
And the second is, how did
you get to America, like,

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.240
how did you get the money?

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.540
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yes, okay.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.330
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: But,
you know, I say this --

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.100
one time I said this to
the interviewer like,

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.720
how did you become like one
of these two persons of --

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.400
untouchables that escaped it?

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.610
I think that historically,
the green lights kept popping

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.340
up just in time for
us, you know?

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.280
Like, my great grandmother
was there in the --

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.370
Canadian White missionaries
came to India, and they wanted

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.010
to convert people
to Christianity.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:19.180
But, castes Hindus didn't want
to convert because they thought

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.650
that they would lose
their caste status.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:24.650
The only people left to
convert were untouchables.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:28.620
And untouchables in droves
took Christianity in India.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.560
And because they took
Christianity, I mean,

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.430
even otherwise they would
have been, they were allowed

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:35.850
into Christian schools,

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.020
missionary schools
to get education.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.270
They were allowed into
missionary hospitals

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:42.850
to get treatment for their
children and their ailing.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.290
And that's a historical
opportunity that happened just

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.230
in time for my great
grandparents.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.870
And the second generation
was independence.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:55.690
Immediately after independence,
there's this hunky dory feeling

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.690
of "Oh, we defeated the
foreigner and we're all one."

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:04.210
And so, people, some people
like, you know, believe it.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.280
And so, were treating
other people like, equally.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.460
And it is during that time that
my mother and father were able

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.510
to go to school and
get education.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.500
And those institution's
garment schools persisted

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.140
until my generation.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.070
And they're destroyed
after that,

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:25.680
now untouchables have very
little chance of advancement.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.980
And -- ?

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.280
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And
so, how did you come

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.580
to live in the United States?

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.170
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: I -- so,
as I said, my grandparents,

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.870
missionary educated, and after

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.500
that my parents in
garment colleges.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.690
And I also was able
to go to school.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:42.870
And I went to this institution
called IIT, the Institute

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.110
of Technology, it's
sort of like MIT.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.320
There, the trajectory of
students over there is

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.910
in final year take GREs
and [inaudible] to get

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:56.440
out of this country, and go
to the first world country.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.960
So, I happened to be
in that environment

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.780
and I just followed what
other people were doing,

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.080
and that's how I came here.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.150
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I think we
had another question here.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:13.240
&gt;&gt; You talked about the economic
supports of the caste system.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.750
Is there a religious
support to it?

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.870
And I don't know if these
thoughts are at all correct,

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:23.300
but I'm thinking, karma
and reincarnation.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.060
Are there religious
ties to the system?

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.370
And are there difference among
the different religious peoples

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.740
in India in their approach
to the caste system?

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.100
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Oh,
you know, people think

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.520
that caste is associated
with Hinduism.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.120
The basis for it is, Hindu is --

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:48.080
has a creator Lord Brahma
is -- was the creator.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.870
He created humans
to fall into one

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.240
of the four casts
or as an outcast.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.440
So, it says in Hindu text
that the Brahmin comes

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.140
from the forehead of the
ceater, the -- Lord Brahma.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.110
And the Kshatriyas , the warrior
caste comes from the shoulders,

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.130
the arms of the creator.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:15.030
And the Vaishyas, the merchant
caste comes from you know.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:17.830
And the service caste, potters.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.900
prostitutes, diggers,
carpenters,

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.060
they come from the
legs of the Brahma.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.090
So, it's also is -- the
occupation is assoc --

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.870
[inaudible] with the
religious purity.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.790
And so, Brahmins are
the purest people.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.960
And the untouchables
come un-sanctioned

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.900
by Lord Brahma beneath his feet,

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.700
and that's why they're
the most impure.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:47.880
So, Hinduism is basically a
religious prop for caste system.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.050
It justifies caste system,

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:54.260
it gives religious
sanction for caste system.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.040
I think if I'm not
incorrect, Confucian --

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.250
Confucianism is also a
philosophy that's, you know,

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.150
invented for social
structuring of people.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.910
So, it has religious purpose,

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:13.390
but Indian society is
what necessitates caste.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:16.880
So, even other religious people
coming to India they fall

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.370
into one caste or the other.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.400
So, Islam, they're
Indian Muslims have caste.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.020
Muslims outside don't
have caste,

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.800
but Indian Muslims have caste.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.830
Christians don't have
caste, they don't even know

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:31.500
about caste, but in India,
Christians have caste.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.800
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: You
had a question.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you said that to
dismantle the caste system you

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.150
have to attack the
economic structure

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.600
that is propping it up?

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.900
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.170
&gt;&gt; So -- but, that's an idea,
but to actually implement it,

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.580
will you say that it's --

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.590
it should be through the
political system like,

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:52.300
affirmative action, or if it
has been there for some time?

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.120
Or through people's movement
that are slowly coming up

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.860
and gaining steam in India?

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.160
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: [inaudible]

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.460
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: So, I -- the --

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.760
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: I'm
sorry, this light is --

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.060
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I know,
it is very bright.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.360
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.660
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.960
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: The question is,

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.260
whether there is a
political solution,

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.560
we only have two minutes, so --

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.860
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.160
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: This is a big
-- this is a tall order for you.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.460
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.760
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: To answer
whether there is a political

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.060
solution to this problem
via affirmative action,

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.360
is that -- that's accurate.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.140
Via affirmative action or some
other program, or whether -- ?

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.460
I mean, what I hear you
saying and I think what I hear

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.770
in the book is that you are --

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.250
you're thinking is a
little more radical even

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:29.600
than addressing this
through affirmative action.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.900
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Right.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.200
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: That
it's really --

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.500
and what you're talking about is
not just the breaking of castes,

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.430
but the breaking of a
larger capitalist --

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:36.730
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.030
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alma: System.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.340
But, do you have any --
do you have any optimism

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.640
or do you have any sense

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.480
that India is prepared
to deal with this?

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.780
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.210
I think India is
roiling, more roiling

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.300
than outsiders will realize.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:54.080
There is ferment of the workers,
they're ferment of peasants,

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.480
and the students are
really struggling

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.030
under the current Modi regime.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:05.300
And India is producing
18 year olds,

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:09.040
like 1 million every
month or year?

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.810
One of those books
mentions that.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:15.910
So, there's going to be an
army of unemployed in India,

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:22.280
and that makes it a, you know,
fertile ground for castes --

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.940
caste based, you know, wars and
discrimination, and violence.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:31.170
And so, I don't think any
political party that wants

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.540
to work within this structure,

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.250
parliamentary structure
can bring down castes.

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.700
And I think that the only way
is to bring down the structures.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:43.090
And it may seem impossible,
but you know,

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.960
things happen like that.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.950
In the world it happened
like that,

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:50.140
in America Civil War happened
and destroyed slavery.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.440
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alma: Yeah.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.510
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: And in French
Revolution the feudalism was

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:57.690
destroyed and established
the rule of the Bourgeoisie,

00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:59.870
and it can happen very much.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.260
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alma: I mean, they
say that kings were divine --

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.560
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla: Yeah.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.860
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Until
they no longer are.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.160
&gt;&gt; Sujatha Gidla:
Oh, yes, exactly.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.460
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alma: This was
such a great conversation.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.760
I highly recommend Sujatha's
book, it's a beautiful --

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.340
beautiful family story.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.950
And thank you everybody
for attending.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:14.010
Have an amazing time today.
