assistants things like Alexa have a

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970
assistants things like Alexa have a
 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.030
assistants things like Alexa have a
lilting female voice which you could

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040
lilting female voice which you could
 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.620
lilting female voice which you could
argue is a sort of working with a

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630
argue is a sort of working with a
 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.680
argue is a sort of working with a
gendered expectation of an assistant but

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
gendered expectation of an assistant but
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.180
gendered expectation of an assistant but
it's still working in the same principle

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
it's still working in the same principle
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.000
it's still working in the same principle
to sell a really new technology like a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010

little nub that has AI intelligence

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919
little nub that has AI intelligence
 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.849
little nub that has AI intelligence
inside of it make it talk just like you

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859
inside of it make it talk just like you
 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.250
inside of it make it talk just like you
would expect an assistant to talk to you

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
would expect an assistant to talk to you
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.409
would expect an assistant to talk to you
I think about this issue also with the

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419
I think about this issue also with the
 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.809
I think about this issue also with the
iPhone most famously you know Steve Jobs

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819
iPhone most famously you know Steve Jobs
 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.900
iPhone most famously you know Steve Jobs
was not creating a product category but

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910
was not creating a product category but
 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.580
was not creating a product category but
he did create the most profitable

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590
he did create the most profitable
 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.099
he did create the most profitable
product in modern human history and it's

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109
product in modern human history and it's
 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.680
product in modern human history and it's
important to remember that the iPhone

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690
important to remember that the iPhone
 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.770
important to remember that the iPhone
did not look new it looked like a touch

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780
did not look new it looked like a touch
 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.099
did not look new it looked like a touch
I pod it looked exactly like a product

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109
I pod it looked exactly like a product
 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.529
I pod it looked exactly like a product
that Apple already had so when people

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539
that Apple already had so when people
 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.170
that Apple already had so when people
picked it up they did

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180
picked it up they did

picked it up they did
have to think oh I don't know how to use

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460
have to think oh I don't know how to use
 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.770
have to think oh I don't know how to use
this how does it work

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780
this how does it work
 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.640
this how does it work

now it also does calls an internet and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880
now it also does calls an internet and
 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.790
now it also does calls an internet and
so I think that it's really important

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800
so I think that it's really important
 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.920
so I think that it's really important

pose this idea with Google glass which
 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.400
pose this idea with Google glass which
is Google's sort of famously flopping

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410
is Google's sort of famously flopping

here the point is that I think one of

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740
here the point is that I think one of
 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.379
here the point is that I think one of
the big problems with Google glass is

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389
the big problems with Google glass is
 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.050
the big problems with Google glass is
that it looked like a prototype it

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060
that it looked like a prototype it
 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.080

people who worked on Google glass and
 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.400
people who worked on Google glass and
they said the biggest problem with its

they said the biggest problem with its
 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.279
they said the biggest problem with its
rollout is that we had a prototype for

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289
rollout is that we had a prototype for
 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.640
rollout is that we had a prototype for
nerds and we sold it as a product for

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650
nerds and we sold it as a product for
 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.850

and I think that Google failed
 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.360
and I think that Google failed
tremendously in that in that aspect
