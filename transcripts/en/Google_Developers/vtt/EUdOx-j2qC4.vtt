00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.450
ARUN NAGARAJAN: --episode of
Google Developers Live.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.210
My name is Arun Nagarajan, and
we're actually coming live

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.630
from our London studios.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.460
I'm usually in the Google Apps
Developer Relations Team, and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.310
you probably have seen me from
the New York office and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.220
Mountain View office before, but
it's my very first trip to

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.800
London and today's episode is
extra special because we have

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.330
an engineer from our team.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.980
NICK JOHNSON: Hi.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.630
I'm Nick Johnson from
the AdSense API Team

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.760
right here in London.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.720
The AdSense API gives you
programmatic access to your

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.180
AdSense account.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.740
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Excellent.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.520
And it's actually, I should say,
sunny in London, which I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.930
was surprised by.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.360
I think I packed a lot of
sweaters and jackets that I

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.330
don't need, which is good.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.880
NICK JOHNSON: I think we were
all surprised by that.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And you said you
were at a ski trip where

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.290
it was warmer--

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.870
NICK JOHNSON: Yeah, it was
warmer in the ski resort than

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.820
it was in London.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.500
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
awesome.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.210
I'm glad to be here.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660
Today's episode's extra special
because what we do is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.400
a series called Script It!,
which basically is all about

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.990
using Apps Script in
interesting, innovative ways

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.870
where you can build something
that you may not normally

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.670
think about with Apps Script.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.040
So Apps Script is all about
taking Google Apps and doing

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.420
more with it, whether it's
extending the UI to show a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.240
menu within Spreadsheets,
or taking the data from

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.180
Spreadsheets and exposing that
to another service, into

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.270
Drive, for instance, or
automating things so every

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.060
half hour, check for an email
from a particular person and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.240
then alert me if something
interesting happens.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.650
So integrate, extend, and
automate are the three things

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.890
about Apps Script that are quite
common in different apps

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.470
that we've seen, workflow
apps and so on.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.570
But AdSense, which I'm not
super familiar with--

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.770
I kind of caught up with Nick
earlier to figure out what the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.410
product is about what the API
is for, and if you can walk

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.970
through what the product is for
and what the API is all

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.420
about, that would
be really good.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.770
NICK JOHNSON: OK.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.300
Well, AdSense is a monetization
solution, lets

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.180
you monetize your website
based on ads.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.380
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.550
NICK JOHNSON: Very simple,
very straightforward.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.390
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So if I'm a blog
publisher, I'd want to

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.661
drop in AdSense into
my page if I'm--

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.080
NICK JOHNSON: If you're a small
blog publisher, as I

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.840
myself am, you can just very
easily fire up an AdSense

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.050
account, stick a small ad on
your blog, and receive a check

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.120
in the post to a
certain extent.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.500
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.730
Can't complain.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.840
And then what's the
API all about?

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.120
Why is there an API?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.130
And can you show a little
bit about the API?

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.610
NICK JOHNSON: Well, yeah.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.920
Basically, there are essentially
two main use cases

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.940
we think of for the API.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.740
The first is if you're a larger
organization which is

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.610
using AdSense and you have
a need to use your own

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.370
dashboards, your own systems,
you don't want to use the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.180
AdSense front end as it is.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.190
You can use the API to pull
in your reporting

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.650
and inventory data.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.850
Secondly, you might be a
developer who is building a

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.320
mobile app or a desktop
app, a web app.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.730
So if you look in the IOS or
Google Play Stores, you'll see

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.190
plenty of examples
of those as well.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.399
So a lot of folks are already
using the API heavily.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.070
Excellent.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.149
And so can you show
where someone can

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.839
learn more about AdSense?

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.240
NICK JOHNSON: Yep.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.130
Well, if you look on the Google
Developers page here,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.080
you can find the AdSense
Services

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.490
from within Apps Script.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.640
So as you see, we have a fairly
comprehensive set of

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.170
documentation for that.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.120
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And to be clear,
AdSense has two APIs.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.770
The API that we expose from
Apps Script is the AdSense

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.505
Management API, correct?

00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:46.560
NICK JOHNSON: Yes,
that's correct.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.420
We also have a second product,
the AdSense Host API, but

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.830
that's not really
relevant here.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.180
It's a different product
entirely.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Got it.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.490
And can you point out
the page again?

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.880
It's under
apps-script/serviceAdSense,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.250
that's right?

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.780
NICK JOHNSON: AdSense,
that's correct.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.020
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Under
developers.google.com.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.790
So it's pretty easy to find.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.280
So can you show a little
bit about the code

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.760
and what can be done?

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.190
NICK JOHNSON: OK.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.980
Well, what we have here is a
fairly simple example we put

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.080
together using Apps Script.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.240
So if I just go over to an
example AdSense account, I

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.240
have a spreadsheet here, an
ordinary spreadsheet.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.665
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Let's take
a look at the screen.

00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:25.410
NICK JOHNSON: I'll just roll
up my sleeves, and you'll

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.920
notice, those of you who are
familiar with Google Docs

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.190
Spreadsheet, there's an extra
menu on the right here which

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.900
we've added using Apps Script.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.250
So I have New Report, Refresh
Report, which I'll come to

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.860
shortly, and then a couple of
preset reports from the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.975
AdSense front end.

00:05:39.975 --> 00:05:43.550
So if I hit Overview Last Month,
it'll think about it

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.540
for a moment, fill in some
columns, start date.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.280
So what I have here is I've
pulled up a very basic report

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.690
of your account for the
previous month.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.340
So you have dates, number
of ad requests,

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.200
coverage, which is--

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.350
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And it knew
which account to dial into

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.160
because who you were logged
in in the spreadsheet.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.950
NICK JOHNSON: Yes, it uses the
account you're logged into as

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.670
the spreadsheet.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.110
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Very cool.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.570
So you didn't have to
reauthenticate or anything.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.080
NICK JOHNSON: No, none
of that at all.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.530
And if you didn't want to use
one of the presets, I can hit

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.940
New Reports, and I've built a
very basic kind of UI which

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.540
lets you assemble it.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.670
But if I just move away from
that for a moment.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.780
This is one of the cool things
which you're able to do with

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.290
Apps Script.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.200
If I realize actually,
this wasn't the

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.110
data I wanted at all.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.220
I didn't want last month.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.140
I wanted the last two months.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.530
So remembering how American
dates work, if I change that

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.970
to a two and then I just come
up here and refresh this

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:57.730
report, give it a moment to
think, and just like that,

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.910
there's no further data.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.780
So that wasn't the
best example.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.290
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So
all the money was

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.420
made in the last month.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.951
NICK JOHNSON: All the
money was made in

00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:03.670
the last month here.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.360
So let me try something
else instead.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.310
Let's decide instead, let's say
I'm not interested in ad

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.130
requests at all, but I am
interested in how much money

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.300
was made by each of the
different ad clients or

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.840
products which we used here.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:25.380
So if I just change this to Ad
Client ID, hit Enter, and

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:32.680
refresh the report, I now
have the same data but--

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.480
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
really cool.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.040
So what you've been able to do
there is the header actually

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.830
corresponds to fields
in the API?

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.180
Is that correct technically
speaking?

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.650
NICK JOHNSON: Yes.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.470
ARUN NAGARAJAN: But as far as
the user is concerned, they're

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.440
just deciding which
column to see.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.130
NICK JOHNSON: Exactly, it's
just a spreadsheet.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.402
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:07:47.402 --> 00:07:49.630
NICK JOHNSON: And I can
actually, we added as well

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.180
another neat little thing we
were able to do is I've got a

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.710
Help thing here, which we
figured, why not just use a

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.340
spreadsheet?

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.070
So we have a list of all the
different dimensions and

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.430
metrics which you can use.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.670
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's
a nice trick.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.720
So is that a hidden sheet,
or is that something that

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.340
automatically populates?

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.770
NICK JOHNSON: No, this is
generated on the fly by the

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:07.530
Apps Script itself.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.720
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Very cool.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.160
Very cool.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.070
So how does this magic work?

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.760
So what did you have to do to
pull this all together?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.060
Can you reveal your tricks?

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.310
NICK JOHNSON: Well, that's a
very good question and I'm

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.220
glad you asked it.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.470
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Wasn't
set up at all.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.600
NICK JOHNSON: Actually, why
don't I just take a step back

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.810
and say Tools, Script
Editor here.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.040
So if I move over to that window
now, I've blown the

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.610
text up nice and big
so you can see it.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.450
First of all, this gives away
some of the magic right away.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.570
On the left hand side, you
will see the names of

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.830
dimensions and metrics here.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.080
And on the right hand side,
I've put more friendly,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.550
English versions of them,
which is what's used to

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.860
generate the Help page.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.580
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Got it.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.330
That makes sense.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.450
So you have a map of what makes
sense to the user versus

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.620
what the API uses.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.150
NICK JOHNSON: Precisely.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.570
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Got it.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.110
OK, cool.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.470
NICK JOHNSON: And then I
have them ordered as

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.140
well, just to simplify.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.660
ARUN NAGARAJAN: What that's
also good for is you could

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.380
localize it, potentially.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.610
So you could potentially have
a Spanish version or French

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.170
version, where they may type in
what makes sense to them in

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.345
that locale.

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:14.050
If that matches up to that same
tag, then you will get

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.620
the right data.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.870
NICK JOHNSON: Yes.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.700
That would work to some extent,
although some of the

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.978
slightly cheesier hacks I've
used here wouldn't work in

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.330
that case, but we'll come
to those later.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.670
ARUN NAGARAJAN: But
that's a potential

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.210
exercise for the viewer.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.380
NICK JOHNSON: And then just
here, these are the lists of

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.250
dimensions and metrics which
are used for the Overview

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.330
Reports which you
saw on the menu.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.730
And then second, I used one of
the special functions that's

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.170
available in Apps
Script on open.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.180
So essentially, this method runs
immediately as soon as

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.140
you open the spreadsheet.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.510
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.500
That's a trigger in Apps
Script parlance.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.420
NICK JOHNSON: So this creates
the magical AdSense menu.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.310
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.130
And I also see that you are
programmatically building that

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.150
array instead of populating
it in a big chunk.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
It's much easier to
read this way.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.210
Everybody has a different way
to do that menu population,

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.690
and it's interesting to see
how you've done it.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.850
NICK JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.755
For me, this corresponds more
closely to what actually pops

00:10:10.755 --> 00:10:13.190
up, but I guess that would be
different for everyone.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.210
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And you're also
using separators to clean

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.320
up your UI a little bit.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.800
I think that's a trick that a
lot of folks may not know of.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.360
But if you pass in Null into a
menu object instead of a Name

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.730
and Function Name property,
you'll actually get a nice

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.640
clean separator.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.160
And I've seen some people
actually use hyphens and

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.570
dashes to clean up menus,
but we actually have a

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.422
nice trick for that.

00:10:36.422 --> 00:10:38.260
NICK JOHNSON: I'll go back
to the script now.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.420
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Now so far,
you've shown the API

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.640
parameters to English literal
mapping and how the

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.630
menus are set up.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.930
Where is some of the
magic happening?

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.740
NICK JOHNSON: Just a little
bit more magic, Uninstall,

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.930
which just triggers the menu to
appear should you install--

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.840
ARUN NAGARAJAN: From
the Gallery, yeah.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.640
NICK JOHNSON: From
the Gallery.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.940
And then we have a whole bunch
of utility methods which

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.510
create dates.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.600
And then these are the methods
which actually create the

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.930
default reports.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:12.360
A couple of little total and
average things there.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.170
And actually, I'm going to do
this sort of upside down.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.670
ARUN NAGARAJAN: A lot
of code in there.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.250
NICK JOHNSON: It's
a big script.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.130
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Magic
is not easy.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.010
NICK JOHNSON: Actually, I'll
show you there right at the

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.150
bottom, we have the Get
Help method here.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.400
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's a nice
trick as well for our viewers

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.840
that may want to do something
that's spreadsheet-based, and

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.370
if you're just distributing
all the content through a

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.760
script, it's a great way,
I think, to show Help.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.840
NICK JOHNSON: So this literally
just creates a new

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.980
spreadsheet, uses the list which
you saw and map you saw

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.430
right at the top, and populates
the spreadsheet

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.780
using those.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.520
There's nothing super clever
happening there.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.300
And then the actual magic, as
such, the bit that my manager

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.370
would describe sneeringly as
magic, the bit that pulls out

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.920
the column names is here,
and it's fairly simple.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.130
We just iterate along the top
row of the spreadsheet using

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:12.580
the data range and then look for
the right edge, which I'll

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.180
come back to.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:18.060
And then every value it finds,
it replaces spaces with

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.560
underscores and converts it to
uppercase, which lets you

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.180
choose your own capitalization
as long as it's in about the

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.500
right form for the--

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So that
essentially normalizes the

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.910
headers into something
that's more systemic.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.485
NICK JOHNSON: And then we
attempt to find an entry in

00:12:35.485 --> 00:12:38.780
either the list of metrics or
dimensions up at the top, and

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.180
if we find one, then we turn
that into a request, which is

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.630
made to the API.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.290
And if we don't, we do something
else, which I'll

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.610
just demonstrate.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:55.380
So if I type something which is
not a dimension or metric

00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:01.600
here and then refresh the
report, it turns red

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.540
because that it--

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.240
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Could you zoom
in a little bit, Nick?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.580
It's actually kind
of cool, too.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.390
So that's a nice way to not
block the user, but you just

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.060
tell them that I did not
populate this column.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.620
NICK JOHNSON: Precisely.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.390
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:14.985
That's great.

00:13:14.985 --> 00:13:17.060
NICK JOHNSON: So I'll go
back to the code now.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.760
And then having iterated through
those, we've already

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.660
gathered through that what the
right hand edge of the actual

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.500
column you just entered was,
so then we look along the

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:34.200
right edge for the words Start
Date and End Date and use the

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.920
cells to the right of those
to pull those numbers out.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.780
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And that could
have been a pop up.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.870
In this case, it's
non-obtrusive to

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.150
have it in a cell.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.800
NICK JOHNSON: Yeah, it was
more magic, essentially.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.330
ARUN NAGARAJAN: How
does it know?

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.860
NICK JOHNSON: Magic Spreadsheet
was the code name

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.390
if this had one.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's funny.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.510
NICK JOHNSON: And then if
I can actually find

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.820
this in my own code.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.370
Why don't I take advantage--

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.700
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Of the
new search features.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.940
NICK JOHNSON: --of that.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.190
Find the wrong thing.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.570
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's also harder
to navigate at that

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.560
zoom level that you have.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.990
One of the things, as Nick is
finding that, I'll talk about

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.540
is the reason some of this
data makes sense in

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.860
spreadsheets is that
it gives you an

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.130
immediate charting interface.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.800
So a lot of folks take this
tabular data and are able to

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.920
build line graphs and pie charts
and other scatter plots

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.940
that may make sense, based on
the data that they care for.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.720
So it's actually interesting
that it's not just the data

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.940
you're able to acquire, but
some intelligence from

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.140
viewing that data.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.020
You could archive it, you
could have it published

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.650
automatically to a Google site
or an internal portal.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.190
So there's a lot of nice things
that you can do once

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.190
you get it into a spreadsheet
or hook into

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.440
it with Apps Script.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.210
NICK JOHNSON: And the final
bit of magic happens here

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:15.250
where it drops the data it gets
from AdSense right back

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.030
into the report.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.565
There's a little bit of
cleverness here and there, but

00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:21.420
nothing really special.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.680
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.940
So one thing that we failed to
mention earlier was the way

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.820
you get access to the AdSense
API is by enabling external

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.220
Google APIs.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.000
We're not actually going to show
that panel because that

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.670
contains the API key that we use
for this demo, but if you

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.710
could just quickly show where
in the menu it is.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.490
And also, there's a really good
tutorial that we have

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.540
which walks you through a
lot of details on how do

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.680
you set this up.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.730
In this case, it shows you how
the charts work as well.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.350
And this actually is a different
set of code and all

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.100
about automation versus some
of the stuff that Nick is

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.220
showing here, which is about
dynamically populating a

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.110
spreadsheet with parameters that
are purely column header

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.450
based, rather than you knowing
what the API is all about and

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.340
all the details about it.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.400
So this spreadsheet you could
put in front of a business

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.680
user that's used to various
reporting solution, doesn't

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.050
know what API stands for, and
they're able to use this.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.610
NICK JOHNSON: Yeah, the whole
idea behind this example was

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.030
something simple that your
average, ordinary AdSense user

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.240
could very easily just sit down,
plug data into, and have

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.480
their data just pop up
in a spreadsheet.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.780
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.430
Can you pull up the tutorial
again that's there today?

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.260
Yeah, this is it.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.290
So in this tutorial, there are
a couple of sections that are

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.510
really important.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.880
One is the getting an API key.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.510
So you need to go to what we
call the Developer Console.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.240
And it's actually a really
straightforward process.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.090
The reason we need this is to
track the utilization of the

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.940
API against your account, just
to make sure that no one

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.530
person is disproportionately
using the API and affecting

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.910
other users.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.900
So we can't show you the console
because that reveals

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.700
our API key, so you'd want to
track your own and keep it

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.089
safe as well.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.970
But it's actually really
straightforward.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.240
And if you just follow the
tutorial that we have today

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.680
under our Tutorial section, that
will show you a lot of

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.514
the details on how do you
get an API key and where

00:17:14.514 --> 00:17:15.490
do you paste it.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.790
AdSense is one of those special
Google APIs that you

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.069
see under, I believe it's
Tools, Use Google APIs.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.410
And you get a pop up, and you're
able to toggle on the

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.869
right APIs you care for.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.860
Once you do that, autocomplete
will now have AdSense dot, and

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.320
then all the class names.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.570
What is probably the most
important AdSense class that

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.180
someone needs to know
about, or method?

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.080
NICK JOHNSON: Probably--

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.530
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Let's take a
look at the screen here again.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.570
NICK JOHNSON: If I just flip
back to the documentation.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:45.070
ARUN NAGARAJAN: The
documentation, that's a great

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.620
way to show that.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.640
NICK JOHNSON: I can actually
just talk a little bit about

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.110
each of the concepts
we have here.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.430
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Sure.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.650
That will be really helpful.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.400
NICK JOHNSON: So I
mentioned before,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.720
Inventory and Reporting.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.310
So we've only really talked
about Reporting here, but

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:01.140
something also important which
feeds into that is what we

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.270
call Ads Inventory.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.530
So you have Ad Clients, which
are essentially the

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.060
products you use.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.650
So if you have a blog, that's
called AdSense For Content.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.420
You could also monetize a search
engine on your blog.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.205
This is AdSense For Search.

00:18:14.205 --> 00:18:16.520
There's AdSense For Mobile
Search, AdSense For Video,

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.150
AdSense For Games.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.870
There are a bunch of these.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.610
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So no
content left behind.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.380
NICK JOHNSON: No one.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.170
Below each of those, you have
a set of Ad Units, which are

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.030
your actual ads.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.510
These are the server side
association to the actual code

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.970
you put on your page.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.740
You have Custom Channels, which
you see here, which are

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.190
essentially--

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.960
I've heard them called Tracking
Codes or Labels.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.200
You might use these to organize

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.460
categories on your site.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.770
So if you have a cooking
site, you might have

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.710
pizza, pasta, haggis.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.020
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And those
are all the tags?

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.090
NICK JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:51.620
These are custom channels.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.970
And then lastly, you have URL
Channels, which are sort of

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:55.870
what they sound like.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.200
They allow you to group your
content to different URLs.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:58.920
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Got it.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.990
And this mirrors the existing
AdSense Management API.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.950
NICK JOHNSON: Yes.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.250
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So if someone is
used to calling the AdSense

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.630
Management API via REST,
then this will seem

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:09.850
very natural to them.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.930
NICK JOHNSON: It's almost
identical, and even more so,

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.750
it mirrors the terminology
from the

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.080
AdSense front end itself.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.370
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.330
NICK JOHNSON: So if you're an
AdSense publisher and you use

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.130
the front end, all these
terms should be

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.240
reasonably familiar to you.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.210
And if you're a developer, they
should be familiar to

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.215
your users.

00:19:24.215 --> 00:19:24.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Got it.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.200
NICK JOHNSON: And then lastly,
you have the Reports

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.050
Collection, which the Reports
Collection here and the

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.770
Reports Generate Response.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.330
These are almost certainly the
most important and useful

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.720
classes and objects
which are in this.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.560
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Excellent.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.520
NICK JOHNSON: So if I go to the
Reports Collection, you'll

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.270
see the Reports Generate Method,
the only method.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.900
ARUN NAGARAJAN: With really
good samples, too, I see.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.000
NICK JOHNSON: Yes.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.250
Silvano did a fantastic job
building the tutorials and

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.510
samples for these.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.760
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Who's now
at the Google+ Team.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.230
That's great.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.580
So the reason that I wanted to
point this out is that this

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.360
API, if you're using AdSense
today using our REST APIs and

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.590
you're running it on App Engine
or your own local

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.310
desktop, Apps Script provides
a cloud-based environment

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.900
where you're able to plug in
pure JavaScript and then

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.530
automate that reporting
aspect of it.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.730
And it's easy to get started.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:25.100
Go to script.google.com, and
anyone with a Gmail account or

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.140
Google Apps For Business account
can start this, and

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.690
you're able to very
easily get going.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.630
So definitely check out the
documentation, a lot of good

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.060
details in there.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.440
Check out the tutorial that
Silvano wrote that talks about

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.600
the automation aspect
of AdSense.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.250
And then we hope soon to share
this magic spreadsheet and all

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.280
the code associated with it
so that it acts as a great

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.730
resource for the community
out there.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.430
Anything that we missed?

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.670
I think we covered all the
things that we wanted to.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.740
NICK JOHNSON: Yeah, I think we
covered all the major points.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.560
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah, so we're
super excited to have Nick and

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.400
show all the cool stuff that
he's built, this magic.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.010
And we hope to share the code
with you very soon, as soon as

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.940
that's ready and fit for
sharing, and as soon as

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.670
there's a way to publish
it as well.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.990
And we're really excited to
see what the community can

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.650
build with it.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.900
I think this, along with a lot
of different analytics, APIs

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.600
that we have, you can actually
take spreadsheets and act as

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.260
both input and output mechanism
for analytics

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:19.780
information.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.500
Because it's so data rich and
information heavy that showing

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.320
it as a chart or showing it as
some other alerting based

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.240
interface, I think is
really valuable.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.580
So thank you very much for
joining, and thank you Nick

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.670
for joining us as well.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.680
NICK JOHNSON: Thank you very
much for having me.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yep,
absolutely See you.
