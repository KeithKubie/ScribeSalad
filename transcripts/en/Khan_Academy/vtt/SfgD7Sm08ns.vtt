00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.860
- There were some gorillas
lifting weights in the gym.

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:08.312
Then, three more gorillas
came and started running.

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.392
Now, 17 gorillas are in the gym.

00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:16.078
How many gorillas were lifting weights?

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:17.359
So, that's the number of gorillas

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.687
that were originally in the gym,

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:20.322
the gorillas lifting weights.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.825
So, how many gorillas
were lifting weights?

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:23.971
They have this diagram for us.

00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:25.180
Let's see, what is this
diagram telling us?

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.673
How many squares are there?

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:28.724
There's one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.917
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:35.471
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 squares.

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:37.555
So, this 17, this is how many gorillas

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:39.617
there are now in the gym.

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:42.364
So, this is the 17 right over here.

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:43.848
How many gorillas,

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:46.665
how many gorillas there
are now in the gym.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.402
How many gorillas there
are now in the gym,

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:50.722
that's the 17.

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:52.589
Now, there are some gorillas in the gym.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.682
Three more came and started running.

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:56.629
So, maybe these are the three

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.885
that came in and started running.

00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:02.422
So, one, two, three.

00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:05.003
So, how many were there to begin with?

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:06.831
How many there were there lifting weights?

00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:08.338
So, all the rest of these must have

00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:09.613
been there lifting weights.

00:01:09.614 --> 00:01:11.220
So, that is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.718
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:18.018
seven, eight, nine,

00:01:18.018 --> 00:01:22.642
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:25.116
So, 14 gorillas were lifting weights.

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:26.419
That's the ones where I wrote the numbers

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.469
in this, in this purplish color.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.315
Then, three more came
in and started running

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:32.575
and now, there are 17.

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:33.698
You see the 17 blocks.

00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:35.830
So, how many gorillas were
lifting weights to begin with?

00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:37.414
Well, that's the 14.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:42.167
That is, that is the 14.

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:44.075
Now, there's other ways that
you could have done this.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.753
You could have said, okay, there were

00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:47.400
some number of gorillas that were

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.948
lifting weights in the gym.

00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:51.524
Now, three more gorillas walk in.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.042
Three more gorillas walk in
and now they're going to be,

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:58.294
they are now going to be 17 gorillas.

00:01:58.294 --> 00:02:01.591
So, you could say okay,
something + 3 is 17

00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:05.169
or you could say 17 - 3,

00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:07.732
minus the three that walked in,

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.991
well that's going to give you
how many you originally had.

00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:12.780
How many you originally had

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.013
and either way you think about it,

00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:17.331
you're gonna get to, you
are going to get to 14.

00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:20.923
17 - 3, you can view that as well,

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:23.674
this 17 is one 10 and seven ones.

00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:25.382
So, you take away three ones.

00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:30.275
7 - 3 is four. So, 17 - 3 is gonna be 14.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.573
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:33.571
This is more of what you
might see on Khan Academy

00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:36.681
and it's good to just know
what they're asking for.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.261
So, this says, I bought a bag

00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:42.511
of 13 mini chocolate chip cookies.

00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:47.640
My sister ate some of them
and I was left with 8 cookies.

00:02:47.947 --> 00:02:50.773
And I was left with 8 cookies.

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:53.775
How many cookies did my sister eat?

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:56.338
So, I had a bag of 13 cookies.

00:02:56.338 --> 00:02:58.392
I had a bag of 13 cookies.

00:02:58.392 --> 00:02:59.769
My sister ate some of them.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.442
So, those cookies are going away.

00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:03.478
So, I'm gonna subtract those cookies.

00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:05.693
So, my sister ate some of them.

00:03:05.693 --> 00:03:07.190
So, that's the question mark.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.715
How many cookies did my sister eat?

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:12.482
She ate some of them and then
I was left with 8 cookies.

00:03:12.774 --> 00:03:15.641
Then, I was left with 8 cookies.

00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:19.260
So, 13 - something is = 8.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.247
Or you could view this as,

00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:22.955
you wanna solve for the something,

00:03:22.955 --> 00:03:24.537
you could say that 13 and you,

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.871
some of you might just say okay,

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.319
I know 13 - 5 = 8, so you would know that

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.370
the question mark is equal to five.

00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:33.138
Or you could say that 13,

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.105
13 - 8,

00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:40.487
minus 8 is equal to ?.

00:03:40.994 --> 00:03:43.496
Is equal to ?

00:03:43.496 --> 00:03:47.434
Or, you could even say, well
if I was left with 8 cookies,

00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:49.997
you could say if I was left with 8 cookies

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:52.125
and my sister ate some of them.

00:03:52.554 --> 00:03:53.959
So, this is what I'm left with

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.855
plus the ones that my sister ate,

00:03:55.855 --> 00:03:58.814
that must be how many
cookies I originally had.

00:03:58.814 --> 00:04:02.001
That must be the number of
cookies I originally had.

00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:03.591
So, any way you do it, you get

00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:05.946
your question mark is equal to five.

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:07.716
Sister ate 5 cookies.

00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:08.693
Now they ask us

00:04:08.693 --> 00:04:11.229
which choices can help
you solve the problem?

00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:14.296
Well, all of these, this is,

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.365
now you know the question mark is five.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:20.188
We know that 13 - 5 is equal to 8.

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:21.509
So, let me write that down.

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.950
We know that, actually
let me just replace this.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.236
Let me just replace this with a 5.

00:04:27.237 --> 00:04:29.227
So, 13 - 5 = 8.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.328
Well, that's a true statement

00:04:30.328 --> 00:04:32.215
that's describing what just happened here.

00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.081
So, this could help me.

00:04:34.327 --> 00:04:36.359
Actually, not that one. That's 13 + 5.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.592
13 - 5 = 8, that's this right over here.

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:42.684
And that is a useful thing
to know because look,

00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:45.873
if I started with 13 cookies,
my sister ate 5 of em,

00:04:45.873 --> 00:04:47.492
I'd be left with 8.

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:49.381
Now, what about this one over here.

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:52.801
13 - 8, well we know this
would be equal to 5 now.

00:04:52.802 --> 00:04:54.664
They don't have a 13 - 8 = 5,

00:04:54.664 --> 00:04:56.411
so we don't have to select that.

00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:58.373
Then here, we now know
the question mark is 5.

00:04:58.373 --> 00:05:01.325
So, 8 + 5 is 13.

00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:03.824
8 + 5 = 13, that's useful too.

00:05:03.824 --> 00:05:05.597
'Cause we know 8 + 5 is 13,

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.019
then we know what I'm left with

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:08.967
plus what my sister ate is 5,

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:11.222
is going to be the 13 that I started with.

00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:14.429
13 + 5 = 18, not so useful.

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:16.083
18 has nothing to do with the problem.

00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.561
There weren't, ya know, somehow,

00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:20.462
it's not like my sister
somehow baked five more cookies

00:05:20.463 --> 00:05:22.820
and added them and now
I'm left with 18 cookies.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.509
I'm left with eight cookies now

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.269
and so I didn't add the
5. She ate those cookies.

00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:29.468
So, I would subtract them.
