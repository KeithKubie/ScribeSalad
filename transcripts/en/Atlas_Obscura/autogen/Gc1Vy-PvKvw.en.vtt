species list right now but we preserve

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
species list right now but we preserve
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.999
species list right now but we preserve
them in alcohol because that allows us

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009
them in alcohol because that allows us
 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.460

by the collector because you have to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
by the collector because you have to
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350
by the collector because you have to
preserve them right away basically you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
preserve them right away basically you
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.200
preserve them right away basically you
can't put them in your suitcase and ship

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210

preserved specimen so they should go

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
preserved specimen so they should go
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.890
preserved specimen so they should go
into alcohol very much right away

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900
into alcohol very much right away
 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.400
into alcohol very much right away
