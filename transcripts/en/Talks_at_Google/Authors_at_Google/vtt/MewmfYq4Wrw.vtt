PING: Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.220
My name is Ping and I'm an
engineer at google.org, where

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.110
we spend quite a bit of time as
a team thinking about how

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.340
to have a positive impact
on the world.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.200
And if you're attending this
talk, it's likely that you

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.230
also have a strong personal
interest in using your own

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.580
abilities and resources
to make the world a

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.140
better place, as I do.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.220
And I'm therefore thrilled that
we are so fortunate and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.890
honored to have Peter Singer
with us today, a person who

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.830
has devoted his life to the
rational study of what it

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.259
means to do good.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.330
Professor Singer is one of
the most influential

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.120
philosophers alive.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.310
He's the author of "Animal
Liberation," which is a

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.983
landmark of the animal rights
movement, and also the author

00:00:40.983 --> 00:00:42.680
of "Practical Ethics,"
the classic

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.550
work on applied ethics.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.470
He was appointed the Companion
in the Order of Australia last

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.150
year, and he's personally
motivated countless people to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.030
give to charity.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.740
I attribute my own approach
to charitable giving

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.150
in part to his work.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.930
His most recent book, "The Life
You Can Save," has led to

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.070
the creation of an organization
by the same name,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.060
and we're going to be hearing
a little bit more about that

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.379
from him today.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.510
"The Life You Can Save," the
book, is going to be available

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.040
after the talk.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.577
So let's all give Peter
a very warm welcome.

00:01:11.577 --> 00:01:17.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.950
PETER SINGER: Thank
you very much.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.370
Thanks, Ping, for the
introduction and for arranging

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.860
this, and thank you
all for coming.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.100
And of course, that includes
the people in the other

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.600
offices around the country.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.470
So this talk is really going
to do two things.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.370
Firstly, I'm going to give you
a condensed version of the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.940
argument of the book that Ping
just mentioned, of "The Life

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.190
You Can Save." And it's the
premise behind the argument

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.340
for what we ought to be doing
to do the most good at the

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.670
moment, and why we ought
to be doing it.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.670
And then before I finish, I
want to talk a little bit

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.970
about the organization, because
to be transparent, one

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.750
of the reasons that I'm here is
that I do think that there

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.280
are people in the room with
skills and resources that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.880
could certainly benefit
the organization.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.650
And if you're interested in
doing something for us in that

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.010
way, that would be terrific.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.280
And I also want to leave plenty
of time for discussion,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.310
so I won't speak for too long,
so that we will have a lot of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.590
time

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.890
for Q&amp;A. OK.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.690
So let's start with the
basic argument.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.850
And I noticed, as we were
walking back from lunch in the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.820
cafeteria with Ping, that we
crossed a bridge over what

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.080
looked like a pretty shallow
meandering stream.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.160
So that'll do for the purpose
of my example.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.690
Imagine that you're walking over
that bridge and you see

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.800
that a small child has fallen
into the stream.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.160
And this child is too small to
either stand up in that stream

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.980
or to swim.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.850
You, on the other hand, could
easily wade in, and I assume

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.750
that that stream is not
more than waist-deep.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.810
So you see the child
in the stream.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.360
Your first thought, perhaps,
is where the parents who

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.770
brought this child here,
or the babysitter,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.160
or whoever it is?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.320
Why aren't they pulling
out the child?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.230
But you look around and it's one
of those unusual moments,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.460
perhaps, on a Google
campus where

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.710
there's nobody else there.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.990
Just you and the child.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.800
So what do you do?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.350
Your next thought is,
well, I could easily

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.440
jump into that stream.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.330
No danger to me.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.740
Pull out the child.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.880
If I don't do that, the child
will probably drown.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.830
Great.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.540
But wait a minute.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.720
What about the clothes
you're wearing?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.915
You just put on some of your
most expensive shoes, let's

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.890
say, today and you don't have
time to get them off, or a

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.990
really nice suit.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.610
They're going to get ruined by
jumping into that stream.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.630
Is that a reason why, something
that would justify

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.280
you in saying, well,
look, it's not

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.730
really any of my business.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.160
It's not my child.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.370
I certainly didn't push the
child in the stream or

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.440
anything like that, so
I'm not responsible.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.840
So rather than ruin my fancy
shoes, why don't I

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.020
just go on my way?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.740
If you think about that, I hope
that you'd agree with me

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.459
that that would be wrong.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.040
That if you did think that way
and did go on your way, and

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.230
maybe later you heard, oh, did
you hear that a small child

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.090
drowned in the stream?

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.350
That you would have done
something seriously wrong.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.810
Some people would use stronger
language than that and say

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.520
that's what you'd done was
really outrageous or inhuman.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.760
But let's just settle for you've
done something wrong.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.510
That's most people's reaction
to that example.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.520
And I think clearly it's the
right reaction to have.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.140
And I think probably most of us,
maybe everybody here would

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.100
have actually saved that child
in those circumstances.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.560
But before you give yourself too
much credit for saying I

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.840
would've saved such a child,
think about the global

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.590
situation that we're in.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.270
We're in a situation where
there are over a billion

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.630
people living in extreme
poverty, as defined by the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.740
World Bank, which is living on
less than $1.25 per day.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.070
That needs to be a bit adjusted
for inflation.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.525
It's also a purchasing power
parity figure, so it needs to

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.990
be adjusted in the other
direction, generally, for

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.430
currency conversion costs.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.410
But let's say, and I suppose
you said $2 a day, today's

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.810
currency, you'd be
pretty safe.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.530
And one result of that kind
of extreme poverty is that

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.780
children die.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.210
UNICEF, in its most recent
report, said the number of

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.770
children dying from preventable
poverty-related

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.940
diseases in 2011 was
6.9 million.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.290
Now UNICEF said, this is really
good news, because in

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.300
1990, it was 12 million.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.660
And even as recently as 2008,
when the book, "The Life You

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.420
Can Save" in its original
hardback version went to

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.620
press, the figure I
quote there is,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.570
I think, 9.8 million.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.610
So it is a figure that's coming
down, and it's actually

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.660
coming down more quickly
even in recent years.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.590
And that's very good news.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:39.730
But 6.9 million a year is
almost 19,000 per day.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.500
So about 19,000 children are
dying every day from

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.170
preventable causes.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.390
Now these causes are things
like malaria, measles,

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.500
diarrhea, pneumonia.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.790
We can prevent malaria
by providing

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.510
insecticide-treated bed nets.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.930
We can prevent measles
by immunization.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.500
We can prevent diarrhea by
providing sanitation.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.570
Or we can prevent deaths from
diarrhea by very simple oral

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.640
rehydration therapy.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.870
So these are things that with
more resources going into this

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.130
area, we can prevent.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.160
And yet we don't.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.930
Though we are clearly, from what
I said, to some extent,

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.615
we are preventing it.

00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:31.600
But we are still allowing 19,000
children to die every

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.330
day from these causes.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.050
And those of us living in
affluent nations and who are

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:47.050
not right at the bottom of
the economic hierarchy in

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.810
developing nations have enough,
more than enough, to

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:57.570
meet all of our basic needs,
and beyond that to live an

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.520
enjoyable, pleasant quality of
life, and still have money

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.900
that is over for things that by
no stretch of imagination

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.020
are necessities.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.820
Things like buying a fancy,
expensive pair of shoes when

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.330
you could be quite comfortable
in a less expensive pair.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.650
Or if shoes are not your thing,
maybe it's going on an

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.100
exotic holiday overseas.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.080
Maybe it's buying a fancy car.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.800
Maybe it's, people here, it's
a lot of high-tech gadgets

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.700
that you don't really
need for your work.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.879
You can pick your own luxury,
but I'm sure that

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:37.020
you can find one.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:42.690
And so that gives you the
opportunity to save lives.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.090
For instance, you could donate
to the Against Malaria

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.740
Foundation, which is
a charity that has

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.700
been rated by GiveWell--

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.610
I'll say a bit more about
GiveWell in a moment--

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.770
as the most highly effective
organization in the

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.620
anti-poverty,

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.130
anti-international-poverty field.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.280
And they will use that money to
buy bed nets and distribute

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.220
them, which is a proven way of
reducing malaria, saving the

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.340
lives of children.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.010
Also reducing the number of
cases of people who get very

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.470
sick from malaria, which is a
pretty unpleasant disease,

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.420
even if eventually
they recover.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:31.230
So the question I want you to
think about is, if I agreed

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.320
that it would be wrong not to
jump into that stream to save

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.480
the child, isn't it also wrong
not to be doing something

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.830
significant to save the children
who are dying further

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.100
away from us?

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.030
Not so visible to us, but
when we know we have

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.340
the means to do so.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.110
Because I don't think the
distinction between being

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.390
close at hand and being far
away is really a morally

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.970
relevant distinction.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:09.420
And I'm sure you'll agree with
me that the fact that maybe

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.980
one child is an American and the
other child is an Indian

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.190
or a Ghanaian or whatever else
it might be is not going to be

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.640
a morally relevant
distinction.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.850
So what is supposed to
make the difference?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.230
There are a few things that you
might think of, and like I

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.680
say, we'll leave time for
questions, for your favorite

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.340
objection if I don't
mention it.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.800
But I mean, some people say
things like, well, what can I

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.260
do, though, about 19,000
children dying every day?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.520
I could save that one child
in the stream, no problem.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.380
I can't save 19,000 children.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.080
Even Bill Gates, who's been
putting many billions into it,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.680
and Warren Buffett have not been
able to stop that, though

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.930
they may well have
contributed.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.980
In fact, I believe they have
contributed to that reduction

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.220
that I mentioned before.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.750
But whatever I do, there's
still going to be roughly

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.790
19,000 children dying.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.860
But that, I think, is surely the
wrong way to look at it.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.360
It's not whether you can
solve the entire

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.910
problem that is important.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:25.330
It's whether you can do
something that is highly

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:32.350
significant, highly important,
like saving a child's life, as

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.260
compared with what you
will have to give up

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.980
in order to do that.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.510
And the fact that there will be
other children still dying

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.920
even if you do that is
tragic, certainly.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.370
But it doesn't detract
from the importance

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.590
of what you've done.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.560
You have saved a child's
life by a donation.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.390
Or if you give more, maybe
you've saved several

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.780
children's lives.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.100
And that surely is
what's important.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.000
And the underlying principle,
I think, is if we can do

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.430
something, that is as important,
prevent something

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:15.980
as bad happening as a child
losing her life at a pretty

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:21.150
minimal cost to ourselves,
then I think

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.770
we ought to do that.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:32.160
So that seems to me to be the
most important point about it.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.800
Now, some of you might also
say, well, how can I be

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.040
confident that I really
can do that?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.610
Unlike the case of the child.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.310
How can I be confident that my
money will be well used?

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:50.950
A lot of people believe that
giving to NGOs is not a very

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.040
effective thing to do,
because they take a

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.420
cynical view of NGOs.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:01.270
They think that NGOs typically
are bureaucratic, inefficient,

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.920
spend a lot of money on their
administration or on

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:11.170
fundraising, and not very much
gets to the program, that is,

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.760
that needs it.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.530
Well, no doubt there are some
organizations like that.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:22.940
But there are a lot of NGOs, and
we shouldn't be interested

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.740
in what the worst NGOs are like,
or even what the average

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.970
NGOs are like.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.410
What we should be interested
in is, can we identify some

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.000
really good, effective NGOs
and contribute to them?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.410
And the answer to that is yes,
and it doesn't even require a

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.390
huge amount of time and
effort on your part.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:52.100
I mentioned this organization,
GiveWell, givewell.org, which

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.180
was set up a few years ago
specifically to do this by a

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.890
couple of guys who were working
for a hedge fund,

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.240
making a lot of money.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.410
Decided that they wanted to
give some of it away but

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.120
didn't know who to give it to.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.670
Contacted some charities and
said, tell us what you would

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.130
do if we gave you a significant
sum of money.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.190
And found that what
they got back was

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.500
unsatisfactory, basically.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.100
It was vague.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.130
Glossy brochures with photos of
smiling kids, but not very

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.160
much hard data.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.640
Since these were people who
were in the business of

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.380
analyzing companies for their
hedge fund, they wanted

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.660
something more specific.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.000
So they decided to go with that
more systematically, and

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.280
eventually, a couple of
them left the hedge

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.920
fund and set up GiveWell.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.100
And they've been looking very
rigorously at organizations.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.040
Some people think, in fact,
their standards are too tough,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.250
that it doesn't allow
some really good

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.890
organizations to qualify.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.560
But what they've got at the
moment on the website, they've

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.430
screened hundreds of
organizations, and they've

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.350
got, actually, just three that
they're recommending.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.920
And the Against Malaria
Foundation is one of them.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.960
So they regard that as a
suitably transparent

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.670
organization that has
demonstrable,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.690
scientifically-based
evidence of the

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.810
good that it's achieving.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.840
And they're recommending that
as one of the organizations.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.390
So we can just take that
as an example.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.050
And if that exists, and there
is scope for more funding--

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.880
and there is, because that's
one of the things that

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.820
GiveWell looks at--

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.350
then that's something
that gives you

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.440
the means to do this.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.480
So I think that the case for
saying that we ought to be

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.460
doing something like this, as
an ethical case, is really

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.830
very strong.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.770
Again, you can present
objections or reasons if you

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.730
think that it's not.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.050
I've heard a few over the
years that I've been

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.170
presenting this case, and I
haven't really seen anything

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.860
that's convinced me
that there's a

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.850
serious hole in the argument.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.390
What is true, I think, is
that the argument has a

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.320
psychological difficulty in
motivating people to give, or

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:16.680
motivating some people to give,
because we, I think,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.990
have evolved to respond to
individuals close to us.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.080
Because that, after
all, was the

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.630
situation in which we evolved.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.230
Most of our evolutionary
history, we could help people

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.230
in our own small group,
and we did that.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.300
But we couldn't really help
strangers, or it wasn't

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.590
advantageous to do
so, so we didn't.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.220
And now we live in a different
world, where we easily can

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:45.220
help strangers, and we can know
about strangers in need.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.790
And so that situation has
changed, but we have not

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.750
changed in an emotional way.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.650
That's, I think, true
and unfortunate.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.800
But we don't have to only be
guided by that instinctive

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.640
emotional response here.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.220
And I'm sure people in this room
and in the other offices

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.780
are particularly used to
thinking in other terms, to

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.520
reasoning your way to
conclusions, to analyzing

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.980
information.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.660
And I think we should regard
this as a combination of the

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:27.599
head and the heart, so that we
have some empathy with people.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.980
We can understand the idea
of helping strangers.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.460
And with our head, we can
appreciate that they are

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.960
people whose lives matter, that
they are people who have

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.280
interests like we do, who
want to go on living.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.880
Parents who want their
children to

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.840
survive and be well.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.370
And people who can suffer as we
can, and that that matters

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.400
just as much as our
own suffering.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.130
There's nothing especially
privileged about us, from a

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.070
broader moral point of view,
that means that our suffering

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.280
matters and somebody else's
suffering doesn't matter.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.330
So I think we can use our
capacity to reason and argue

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.900
to reach the conclusion that
there is something that we

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.805
ought to be doing about this.

00:18:14.805 --> 00:18:20.340
And in fact, that we have the
opportunity to do it.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.120
So that's really the essential
argument of the book.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.050
It also then raises the
question, so how

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.740
much should I be doing?

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.580
Does this mean that I should not
spend anything on anything

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.942
that's a luxury or not something
that I really need?

00:18:38.942 --> 00:18:43.130
And the answer to that question,
I think, is sort of,

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.470
actually, a difficult one.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.580
In one sense, I'm tempted
to say, yes, really,

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.550
that is what it means.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.700
And to the extent that you're
not doing that, you are doing

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.090
something wrong.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.520
But at the same time, I know
that I'm not living according

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.250
to such a demanding standard,
and I think very, very few

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.880
people actually are saintly
enough to do that.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.710
So I think we can, in a way,
take a somewhat more relaxed

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:15.660
standard and say, look, let
me do something reasonably

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.620
significant.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.790
And perhaps if I get comfortable
with that, work up

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:25.220
to a higher standard
more gradually.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.360
But as long as I feel I'm
doing something quite

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.850
significant, if I'm doing--

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.970
perhaps one way that some people
look at it to say,

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.920
suppose that others
in my situation

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.540
were giving this much.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.560
Would that be enough to really
deal with this problem of the

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.560
19,000 children dying every
day unnecessarily?

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.560
That's one way you can try
to work out a figure.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.870
So what I, in the end, in the
book, and on the website,

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.670
thelifeyoucansave.org, I've
got a scale which is

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.990
progressive that starts off
quite low, at around 1% of

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.690
your income.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:05.920
Gets up to around 5% when you
get to around $100,000 US

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.870
dollars, for people living
in this country.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:13.700
And it moves up, it actually
tops out at about a third for

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.910
people who are earning over
$1 million a year.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.770
And that seems to me the scale
which on the one hand, doesn't

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.510
really impose any great
hardship on anyone.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.940
At the lower levels, you're
giving quite little, and at

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.140
the upper level, if you are
earning a million dollars a

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.950
year, I don't think it's
any hardship to give

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.340
away $300-odd thousand.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.500
You've still got plenty left.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.990
And yet if you do try to work
out the sums of what would

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.780
this amount to, if everybody in
the affluent world were to

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.980
give, then it does look like we
would really have enough to

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.610
virtually eliminate extreme
poverty in the world.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.050
You're never going to completely
eliminate it.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.640
There'll be places you can't
really be effective in, places

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.730
with such corrupt or oppressive
governments, you

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.520
can't make changes or there'll
be situations of civil war.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.420
But you could change the world
so that there are no longer

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.970
over a billion people living
in extreme poverty, and so

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.190
that the number of children
dying from these preventable

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:17.660
causes would drop to, let's say,
a few hundred thousand.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.300
I think that is a real
possibility over the next

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.570
decade or two.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.680
So that would be a reasonable
way, perhaps, of calculating,

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.020
if you're not a saint, what
might be enough to be able to

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.260
feel good about what you're
doing, and to have some

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.240
reasonable self-esteem based
on what you're giving.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.580
And also, and I think this is
part of it, to feel that

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.065
you've done something meaningful
and significant

00:21:44.065 --> 00:21:45.100
with your life.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.320
I think that's--

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.130
looking at people who do this,
that's something that I've

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:56.440
found that I've felt myself,
that it's easy in a society

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.910
like this to get sucked into
a lifestyle where you earn

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.730
money, you buy consumer goods
with it, you enjoy using them

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.640
and spending them, but
then that's all over.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.840
And what are you going
to do next?

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.370
Well, you can earn more and you
can buy even more consumer

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.510
goods, and then you can do the
same, and it goes on and on.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.840
But in the end, it's not
truly satisfying.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.420
I think that's a phenomenon
that a lot of people feel.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.920
Whereas if you're contributing
to something really important

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.280
that is making a permanent
difference in the world, a

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.390
permanent difference for good,
obviously, you can end up with

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.380
a more meaningful, more
fulfilled, and

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.190
more satisfied life.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.760
There is some research that
suggests that people giving to

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.500
charity does improve their
own satisfaction

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.460
with their life, too.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.650
So that's really the thrust of
what I want to say to you

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.670
about the argument.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.570
Now in terms of what
we're doing here--

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.150
and when I say we--

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:07.410
so I published the book
a few years ago.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.720
I had a friend who had a bit of
knowledge about setting up

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.040
websites, and she said, we
should build a website that

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.690
goes with the book.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:20.000
Not just to promote sales of
the book, but to spread the

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.440
message of the book and to get
people to pledge to give,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.810
according to the scale that you
suggest in the book, to

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.180
give them information about
that, to provide them with

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.980
regularly updated information
about what are organizations

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.400
that are worth giving to, and
generally to build a community

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.440
of people who share this idea.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:44.430
And to try to change the culture
on a larger scale, so

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:49.105
that giving to reduce global
poverty, to help those who are

00:23:49.105 --> 00:23:54.790
so much less fortunate than we
are, becomes an accepted part

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.540
of what it is just to
be a decent person.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.890
Live an ethical life.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:05.310
And so with her help, I got
the website set up.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.530
And then more people came, and
people did pledge to give

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.380
according to that scale.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.430
And quite a few of them gave
us contact details.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.220
And so we built up a community
of people supportive of this.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.180
And now, more recently, other
people have said, well, we

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.570
need to go further.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.250
Not just have this website,
but actually use this

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.070
information to build an
organization to do more in the

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:35.920
way of spreading the message,
marketing through social media

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.520
and in whatever other
opportunities we have, to get

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.500
this idea as essentially a way
of living, or alternative to

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.250
the consumer society, to get
this out there and get this

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.480
better known.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.220
So one of these people is in the
audience, Charlie Bresler

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.330
here, who has a lot of
experience in marketing.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.190
He has a Ph.D. in social
psychology, but then went into

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.950
the menswear industry and spent
some time as president

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.640
of a major national
menswear chain.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.450
And is now helping me
and some others--

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.550
international people,
in England, too--

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.740
to set this organization up to
get a 501(c)(3) status in this

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.220
country so that it becomes a
tax-deductible organization.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.890
And we want to grow it, as fast
as we can and as much as

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.160
we can, to be an effective
organization for spreading

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.940
information of the sort I've
been giving you, encouraging

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.940
people to give, and trying to
change that culture so that

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.170
this becomes a more normal and
accepted and widely understood

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.320
thing to do.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.420
So that's one of the reasons
why I was excited when Ping

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.820
set up this opportunity
to speak to you.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:57.307
Because I'm hopeful that people
will want to join in

00:25:57.307 --> 00:26:01.290
this effort, will
want to help us.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.680
Either with money-- we do need
to raise some money for the

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.800
organization, although as I've
been saying, of course, I

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.840
think it's terrifically
important to give directly to

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.190
these organizations, and if
that's what you want to do,

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:13.980
that's absolutely fine.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.880
But we could use
a small amount.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.680
Charlie's put some in.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.680
I've put some in.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.310
We could use a small amount to
get the organization up.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:28.030
Or if you have skills that will
help us in a variety of

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:32.870
ways, spreading our message
through ways that

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:33.830
I'm sure you know--

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.520
some of you know a lot more
about it than I do--

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.800
we're certainly interested
in that as well.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.300
And then before you go,
I've got some sheets.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.310
If you are interested in that
way, you could put your name

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.310
and email address.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.800
And I'll leave them
at the front here.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.190
You can sign them.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.210
And for those of you who are
not here in this room, you

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.435
could email us or you
could email Charlie.

00:26:59.435 --> 00:27:01.110
He's offered to take
the names.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.815
So his email is charlie.bresler@

00:27:02.815 --> 00:27:04.065
thelifeyoucansave.com.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.980
And we'd be very happy
to hear from you.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.460
I'll stop at that point.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.310
And as I said, we'll have time
for questions and discussion.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.316
I look forward to hearing
from you.

00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:28.064
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.400
PING: Thank you.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.600
I should just make a comment.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.710
Really, the credit for setting
up this whole talk goes to

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.160
Pablo Cohn.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.085
I just stepped in at the last
moment to do the introduction

00:27:41.085 --> 00:27:44.050
and to have the pleasure of
meeting Peter Singer, here,

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.100
but we should thank Pablo
for setting this up.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.530
AUDIENCE: There are a lot of
good causes out there.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.180
There's poverty, there's
fighting cancer, finding a

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.670
cure for Alzheimer's, reducing
animal suffering in factory

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.230
farms, what have you.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.540
And there are many ways to
go about fighting them.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.450
If your interest is in poverty,
you could be donating

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.275
your time, volunteering at a
soup kitchen or what have you.

00:28:08.275 --> 00:28:10.270
You can give away money.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.646
Maybe you should buy that
expensive clothing.

00:28:13.646 --> 00:28:17.260
It's produced in Indonesia, say,
and it allows people in

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.220
Indonesia to have a good job and
increase their standard of

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.660
living and bring themselves
out of poverty.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.460
You could go on the trip, have
that safari, perhaps, in

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:29.740
Africa, and spend money in the
local economy and increase the

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.890
level of income there.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.135
You could stay at work and build
technology like we're

00:28:35.135 --> 00:28:37.710
all doing, which is the real
creator of wealth.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.486
Why this cause and this
way of fighting it?

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:42.052
Why is that the best?

00:28:42.052 --> 00:28:42.940
PETER SINGER: Good, thank you.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.830
So in a way, there's two
different questions in there.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.770
One is a question about
why this cause

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.170
rather than other causes.

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.350
And the other is a question
about whether giving money to

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.190
the NGOs that I was talking
about is better and more

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.830
effective than buying an
expensive Indonesian-made suit

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.720
or going on the safari
in Africa.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:10.820
So on the, why this cause rather
than others, for some

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.210
other causes, I would
say, fine.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.520
I don't have any real basis
for saying this cause is

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:16.970
better than that.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:21.300
So if you said, for instance,
I think climate change is

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:25.010
going to be a disaster for the
planet, for the poor as well

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.680
as for the better off, and I'm
going to devote my energy to

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.610
trying to get the United States
to adopt sensible

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.700
climate change policies, and I
have this strategy where I

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.800
think I can make
a difference--

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.830
if you thought that out and
you're serious about doing

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:45.800
that, I'm not going to try to
dissuade you from doing that.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.290
You also mentioned
reducing animal

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.880
suffering in factory farms.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.590
That's something that I've been
concerned about for a

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.250
very long time.

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.970
And again, it's very difficult
to compare

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.100
human and animal suffering.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.740
But you might say humans suffer
more, but then there's

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.970
far more animals in factory
farms than there are humans on

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:03.450
the planet.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:08.430
And so yes, that's another
possibility.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.700
But you mentioned something
like say working in soup

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.910
kitchens, which really means
you're working about domestic

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.450
poverty in the United States.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:19.090
And I think while I sympathize
with those who are in poverty

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.500
in the United States, it's
simply a lot more

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.110
cost-effective to work for
those in extreme poverty

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.210
elsewhere in the world.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:32.170
And that's the reason why
GiveWell really only evaluates

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.330
international aid programs,
because it looked at,

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:39.695
initially when it set up, one's
domestic help for the

00:30:39.695 --> 00:30:41.430
poor, and it just found
that it didn't

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:42.930
really compare at all.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.400
I mean, one way in which you can
see this is to say, well,

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.270
the World Bank's definition of
extreme poverty is $1.25 a

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.570
day, or say $2 a day,
$700 a year.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.070
In the United States, the
poverty line, I think, for a

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.290
family of four is $22,000.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:07.690
So to make a difference to
someone who's on $700 a year

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.530
given the marginal value of
money, it's much easier than

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.790
to make a difference
to somebody who's

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.090
on $22,000 a year.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.540
Another form of comparison that
I owe to a guy called

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.900
Toby Ord, who has another
organization called Giving

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.150
What We Can.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:28.910
Take, for example, a charity
that is providing guide dogs

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.990
for blind people in
the United States.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.200
That's a good thing to do.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.630
It's good that blind people
have guide dogs.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:39.470
Well, it costs about $40,000 to
produce and train a guide

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:43.280
dog for a blind person in the
United States and to train the

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.770
recipient to use it.

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:50.430
It costs about $20 to treat
someone in a developing

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.740
country who is blind because
they have trachoma, and to

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.810
cure them of blindness.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.510
So you can do the math.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.370
One guide dog for one person
in the United States versus

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:04.550
2,000 people with trachoma
cured of blindness.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:09.230
I think it's clear why I'm
focusing on international

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.710
problems rather than
domestic ones.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.780
You also said, well, how do I
know that this is not going to

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.980
be better than simply buying
things that are

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.290
made in poor countries.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:22.840
I think the point is that with
the NGOs, you're really

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.490
focusing on the people
at the bottom.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.920
You're focusing on the people
in extreme poverty.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.760
With the expensive suit or the
safari, a lot of what you're

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.270
paying is actually going to
people who are already quite

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.410
comfortably off.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:39.340
I mean, some of it, of course,
will go to the retailers here,

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.990
or the tour operators,
the travel agents.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.970
Some of it may get
to the people in

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.310
the developing country.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.620
Probably not to the people
who are really worse off.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.930
So again, I don't think it
really uses the resources as

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:58.430
effectively as giving to these
effective organizations.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.050
AUDIENCE: But I'm getting
a suit, in that case.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:01.050
I mean, there's--

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.010
sorry.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.150
OK.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:05.930
I'm getting some return on what
I'm giving, so it's not

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.730
just giving it away.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.890
PETER SINGER: Well, I want to
suggest you're getting a

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:10.670
return on what you're giving
when you give to the other

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:11.270
organizations.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.780
It's just not a material
return.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:16.560
But in terms of your own
well-being, I think it may be

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.620
an even more important one.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.500
AUDIENCE: OK, but like maybe
if someone were up here

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.390
promoting the values of
globalization and pointing out

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.090
that global poverty has been
reduced, cut in half,

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.170
essentially, due to
globalization, maybe I would

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.060
feel good about buying that
expensive clothing.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.350
Not only because I get clothing,
but because I know

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.240
it's improving the conditions of
someone in the Third World.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.910
PETER SINGER: So I mean, there's
a complicated debate

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.140
about globalization and
its effect on the

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.180
really poorest people.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.230
There's no doubt that it's
lifted some people out of

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.180
pretty low levels of income,
lifted them up.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.490
But has it helped the poor
people who are really in the

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.140
bottom 10%?

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.740
There are a lot of development
economists who

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.590
think that it hasn't.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:02.090
But even if it is, I would say
there is still plenty of scope

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:07.160
for more direct, more effective
aid that is making a

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.255
bigger difference and a quicker
difference to those at

00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:09.719
the bottom.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.870
AUDIENCE: I was going to ask,
essentially, about why global

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:19.230
poverty, instead of human
rights or environmental

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.130
protection, but I think you did
a good job answering that

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:22.730
question already.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.409
But I was going to also allude
to animal suffering, and just

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:27.710
throw out this statistic.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.150
I think if there are tens
of thousands of children

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.070
suffering and dying per day,
there are probably tens of

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.090
millions of animals, or
something like that.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.620
So there would be a question
about how much could you do

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.260
with a given dollar in terms
of reducing that.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.550
However, instead of going down
that road, I was just going to

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.750
respond to your thought
experiment.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.380
Because it seemed to me that
one of the differences you

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.130
didn't point out is, I think
in the set-up, you said,

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:55.510
there's one child drowning in
the stream and you're alone

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.280
and no one else is around.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.760
It seems like it's easier to
feel moral obligation if

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.980
you're the only person
who can help.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:06.100
If there were 19,000 children
dying in the stream and 7.5

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.590
billion people crossing
the bridge,

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.240
it might feel different.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.180
What do you think about that?

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.120
PETER SINGER: It's undoubtedly
would feel different.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.980
I think about that in something
like the way that I

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.880
responded to the opposite kind
of objection, that I can save

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.190
the one child and solve
the problem, but I

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.360
can't save the 19,000.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.680
So you're looking at it rather
from the number of people who

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.430
could help save, and that does
give us this feeling of

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.340
diffusion of responsibility.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.395
Psychologists study it.

00:35:40.395 --> 00:35:42.436
It's called the bystander
effect.

00:35:42.436 --> 00:35:44.510
If you know there's a lot of
other people who could help

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:49.490
and you see that they're not
helping, it does mean actually

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:50.920
that people are less
likely to help.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.290
But I think that's also a
psychological fact about us,

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.780
not a moral justification
for not helping.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.210
I mean, if you knew that because
of these other people,

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.790
all of those who needed rescuing
would get help, fine.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:06.850
Then you could sit and relax and
watch them save everybody.

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.760
But you know that's not the
case, at the moment, anyway.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.110
AUDIENCE: And I also think
that, and I'll hand the

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.920
microphone off after saying
this, but I also think it's

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.880
another psychological fact about
us, of course, that we

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.850
think that the suffering and
death of a child might be as

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.760
bad or worse than the suffering
and death of a

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.590
million chickens.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.420
Yeah.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:27.730
Right.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.330
Well, I won't disagree
about that one.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.510
PING: I see a question
from a remote office.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.960
Could we unmute that feed?

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.460
AUDIENCE: Can you hear me?

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.120
PING: Yes, we can hear you.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.220
Go ahead.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.090
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.900
It sounded like you were
suggesting somewhat of a

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:52.020
utilitarian calculation for
domestic versus foreign aid.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.170
My question has to do with
the metric used.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:37:00.630
Lives saved, for example, from
people dying from malaria.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.060
In places where you might die
of malaria and you don't die

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:09.300
of malaria, you might, the next
day, die of being shot or

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.930
being hungry.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:17.110
And I wasn't sure how that
kind of compound problem

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.210
factors in your calculation.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.940
So for example, in the United
States, it costs $100 to save

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.250
someone from a disease, but then
after that, they have a

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.450
job and they have society to
integrate with, versus in

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.670
another country, where solving
a particular problem, you

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:34.440
might make good progress, but
there is a huge ecosystem

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.860
problem to face.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.500
What are your thoughts
on that?

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.970
PETER SINGER: So firstly, you're
right that the ethic

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:46.210
that I'm talking about
is consistent with

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.080
utilitarianism, anyway.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.780
I don't think that one has to
be a utilitarian to accept

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:52.720
what I've been talking about.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.020
But yeah, it certainly
follows from that.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.210
Secondly, you're right to say
that if, in fact, the child

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.160
you save dies tomorrow, then in
my view, you haven't really

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.270
done much good at all.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.500
That's true.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:16.920
But I think the calculations
that, for instance, GiveWell

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.010
does about the effectiveness
of organizations does take

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:27.490
into account evidence not just
about lives saved but about

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.750
life years that are saved.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:33.340
In other words, how many years
of life are you extending?

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.570
That's a metric that
is in common use on

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:37.810
global health issues.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.470
And certainly, that's what
you want to use.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.000
Now there's two questions
there.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.870
One is, if you say a child from
malaria, what are the

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.120
chances the child will die
quite soon anyway?

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.780
I think the answer is
not very great.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.540
That after all, as I said, we
are reducing the number of

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.510
deaths of children under five.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.930
That's what's been
coming down.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:05.770
So I think children do die of
various diseases, but that

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.260
doesn't mean that their lives
are so fragile that if they

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.340
don't die of one thing, they'll
die of another.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:16.330
And once they get beyond five,
their life expectancy goes up

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.600
quite dramatically.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.190
So that's one issue.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.540
Then you also raised
questions about the

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.980
quality of life, I suppose.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.080
You might say, well, their lives
are still not going to

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:24.780
be very good.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.990
They're going to be
pretty miserable.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.910
I don't think that's
really true either.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.950
I think that people who live
in conditions that we can't

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:38.100
perhaps imagine enjoying their
lives in can still quite often

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.020
have lives that are fulfilling
and enjoyable,

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.360
worthwhile for them.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.540
And so I think we should accept
that, that we are doing

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.540
good in that way.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:53.310
And life, even in a high degree
of poverty, if you can

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:57.860
survive a few obstacles, is
definitely still worth living,

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.430
even though we could certainly
make it better and we should

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:02.490
try to make it better.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.490
But it's still something that's
very much worth doing.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.180
AUDIENCE: I encountered your
ideas years ago and was very

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.990
affected by them.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.940
Although maybe not in
the way you wanted.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.140
I'd always given a lot to
charity, and I still do.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:23.050
But I've been a lot less happy
about the rest of my life.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.930
Because you argue that somebody
who cares more about

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:31.370
their good shoes than saving the
life of a child is really

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.850
effective about donation,
but that goes with

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.520
every luxury I have.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.530
What sort of person am I if I
go out to dinner or buy a

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:44.500
present for my niece when that
money could be used to improve

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.170
a child's life?

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.940
I've even wondered whether I'm
worth more dead or alive,

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.820
comparing the value of my Google
life insurance to my

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.230
Google stock options, if you
want to take utilitarianism

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.390
all the way.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.630
So I think the only part of
your argument that isn't

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.310
rigorous is that we can stop
at a certain percent.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:08.380
So how can I accept
your argument and

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:13.080
feel good about luxuries?

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.700
PETER SINGER: Yeah, that
is a good point.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:20.260
And you're right, that there is
no really rigorous argument

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.010
for a particular
stopping place.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.340
What I think there is a good
argument for, though, is not

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:33.610
torturing yourself with guilt
about this, but getting on,

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:38.010
basically, with living and being
effective and trying to

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.040
encourage other people to
give and to do the same.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.250
And I assume that you will
actually maximize good if you

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:49.400
continue to live, you continue
to work at Google, and you

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.190
continue to earn money which
will enable you to give more.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.490
And hopefully, your Google stock
options will appreciate

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:58.670
as well, so you'll still have
more to give at the end.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:02.620
But I mean, I wrestle with this
same problem myself, and

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.960
it may be, to some extent,
a matter of temperament.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.750
I don't agonize over it every
day, or with every purchase,

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.300
or with this birthday present
for my niece, or

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.550
whatever it might be.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:18.730
I accept, as I said to you, that
I'm not a [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:22.590
that there's a kind of normal
family life that I take part

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:27.270
in, that that's important to me,
that that's part of what

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:31.430
it is for me to be
psychologically well, I

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.720
suppose you could say, and
that's necessary for me to

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.800
function well.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.550
And so I know that I'm giving
quite substantially.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.380
I know that I could give more,
but I don't dwell on that.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.770
And I think insofar as I can
justify that at all, it's

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.750
because it enables me to get
on with my life without too

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.510
much agonizing.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.920
AUDIENCE: Giving is really a
very difficult and interesting

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.930
optimization problem of sorts.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.670
And once you've determined
that if you earn a good

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.000
salary, maybe your time is
better spent doing your normal

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.950
job and then giving
away money.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:13.080
And once you've determined
that you can maximize the

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.620
marginal benefit of whatever
you're giving by giving to the

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.070
more poor part of the world,
it's still extremely difficult

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:21.850
to find a good charity.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:26.400
And you've mentioned GiveWell,
and there are other sites like

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.940
this, like Charity Navigator
and a few like this.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:35.700
And if you look at what they do,
in many cases, they look

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.610
whether or not the charity is
well managed, and whether it

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:43.540
uses a lot of money on
advertising and the salaries

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.065
of the CEO and all that.

00:43:45.065 --> 00:43:46.330
PETER SINGER: Can I
just interrupt?

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:47.890
That's not what GiveWell does.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:49.170
You mentioned Charity
Navigator.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.320
They've been there for years.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.600
That's all they do.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.550
I think it's completely useless,
or 90% useless.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:55.820
GiveWell does not do that.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:00.380
GiveWell looks for evidence that
the program is helping.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:04.810
It doesn't focus on just
the management of the

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:05.540
organization.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.730
It looks for evidence that what
they're doing is saving

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:13.280
lives, or bringing people out
of poverty, or improving

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.630
school scores, or whatever
else it might be.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.090
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.670
So maybe I need to look
into GiveWell more.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:21.980
But I mean, in general, it looks
like no one really--

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.465
it's a very difficult problem,
but no one really has a model

00:44:24.465 --> 00:44:29.300
of figuring out where money
should go and where it could

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.660
have the maximum marginal
benefits.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:37.020
And so I wonder if you recommend
other good books

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.250
about it, or any other websites

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:39.790
that you can recommend?

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.705
So GiveWell seems to be one?

00:44:41.705 --> 00:44:43.190
PETER SINGER: Yes.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.410
AUDIENCE: Anything else?

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.420
PETER SINGER: Well, I mean,
GiveWell is certainly the only

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.050
one in this country that's
a website that evaluates

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:53.110
charitable organizations
in this way.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.960
But there is other
work going on.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.030
In particular, there's two
academic units that are worth

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.810
looking at.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:03.220
One is called Innovations
for Policy Action.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.100
I think I've got that right.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.510
IPA.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:06.350
Poverty Action, sorry.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:07.340
Yes.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:11.890
Which is at Yale, associated
with Dean Karlan, I think, is

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:15.890
the economist's name.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:19.560
And they are studying which
particular programs can be

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.160
demonstrated to be effective.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.630
The other one is the Poverty
Action Lab at MIT, run by

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:30.890
Esther Duflo and Abhijit
Banerjee, that is particularly

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:34.840
looking at ways of evaluating
projects, trying to do

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.290
randomized controlled trials
of different approaches in

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.600
different areas.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.580
So there is academic work
going on, but they are

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.080
looking, more or less, at the
project level rather than the

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.560
organization level.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.810
AUDIENCE: And a related
follow-up there is how do you

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:55.630
differentiate between options
that have immediate benefit.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.880
Like take for example Heifer
International.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.840
You can get a goat that will
immediately provide milk for

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.270
some children, versus the same
amount of money that you could

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:07.020
have them plant trees, which
will have a much longer-term,

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.570
not-immediate benefit.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.970
But the goats may also erode
the landscape, and that's a

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.650
short-term solution versus
a longer-term solution.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.630
And so how do you ethically
weigh those sort of choices,

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.550
even with a good charity?

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.330
PETER SINGER: I mean, if you
have the information, then I

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:25.030
think we ought to take
a long-term view.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.820
We don't want to just make
people better off

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.990
in the short term.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.000
The difficulty is, and I just
mentioned briefly in passing,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.090
that some people think
that GiveWell is

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.220
actually too tough.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.570
Because they don't really have
a handle on how to evaluate

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:42.450
the difference that growing
trees makes.

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:44.830
Say, they can look at the goats
and they can measure the

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:49.240
benefit in children's health,
but they don't have the

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.770
information about the erosion
of the landscape that the

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.820
goats cause.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:58.570
And so it tends to mean that
they focus on things that do

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:03.710
have measurable outputs, like
anti-malaria nets or deworming

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:08.900
children, and it's harder for
them to take account of some

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.520
of these other long-term goods,
like reforestation.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.570
So I think what that shows is
that there may well be other

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:19.500
things that need to be
looked at, that we

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.340
don't really know about.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.480
And you might like to look at
particular organizations and

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.340
say, well, I think in the long
run, this may do even more

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.280
good than anti-malaria nets.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:32.540
So that's a judgment call, and
I don't really know anybody

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:37.022
who can put that on a rigorous
basis, at this stage.

00:47:37.022 --> 00:47:38.320
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Dr. Singer.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.080
I hope I have an easy
question for you.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.450
On your website, you ask people
to give a pledge, and

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.000
you just talked about it a
second ago, a certain percent

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.210
of their income.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.835
And it was like 1% for under
100 grand, and 5%

00:47:49.835 --> 00:47:50.740
for the next one.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.010
How did you pick
those numbers?

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.700
PETER SINGER: So I picked
those numbers--

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.840
firstly, the income levels
relate to tax brackets.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:03.160
And I had that information from
a couple of economists

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.920
who provided information on a
website about how many people

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.850
are in each of these
tax brackets--

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:15.250
so the top 10%, the top 1%,
the top 0.1%, and so on--

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:19.060
and what their average
income was.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:22.810
So that gave me a basis of
calculating how much money

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:25.160
would actually be raised if
all of the people in that

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.880
income bracket were to give at a
particular percentage level.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.300
And therefore, I had a way of
trying to work out what the

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.540
total sum would be raised
from the United States.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:39.360
And then taking United States
as a percentage of the

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.120
economies of the affluent
nations, if that

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.380
were repeated globally.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.780
And what I wanted to do was to
get at a total figure which

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.790
would be in excess of what
some economists--

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.210
Jeffrey Sachs among others--

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.260
calculate would be needed
to virtually

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.800
eliminate global poverty.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.080
So it was a way, if you like, of
saying if we raise this, we

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.930
could deal with this problem
pretty effectively.

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:06.430
And here would be a fair way
of breaking it up, that sum

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:08.420
that we have to raise,
among people of a

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.670
certain level of affluence.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:18.920
AUDIENCE: If years of life
lived is a good metric to

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.900
maximize, might it be more
cost-effective to encourage

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.770
more children to be born rather
than to try to save the

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.780
lives of those who
already exist?

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:32.380
PETER SINGER: Well, that's a
very interesting and much

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.060
discussed philosophical
question, in fact, and people

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.360
have very different intuitions
about it.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.750
And it's really hard to resolve
the difference.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:45.490
A lot of people think that
bringing more people into the

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:47.940
world is not something that
is good in itself.

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.710
Even apart from the population
problem, right?

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.260
Even if we imagine the world
were not overpopulated.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.120
Say the world had a population
of 500 million.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.470
Would it then be a good thing
if we increased that

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:00.420
population to one billion,
assuming that the standard of

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.910
living did not decline?

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.340
Some people think yeah,
that would be great.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.480
We would have twice as
many happy people.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.230
Other people think, no, they
wouldn't have existed at all.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.270
They would never have missed
out on anything,

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:14.100
so it doesn't matter.

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:17.870
So I guess the answer is it
doesn't follow from saying

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:22.190
that given that a person exists,
we want them to have

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:24.370
as many life years as possible,
and we want the

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.965
quality of those life years to
be as high as possible, it

00:50:26.965 --> 00:50:29.530
doesn't follow from that to say,
therefore, it's good to

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.830
bring more people into existence
if they'll have that

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:33.060
quality of life.

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:38.140
But one could take that view.

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.980
Of course, I think you can only
take that view if you

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.280
think that the world has the
capacity to give a high

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.430
quality of life to more people,
and if you don't think

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:49.190
that adding more people will
bring down the quality of life

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:51.886
and even increase poverty
for some.

00:50:51.886 --> 00:50:54.590
And I would say, in the state
of the world at the moment,

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:58.080
that would be a dubious
assumption to make, that we

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.550
could actually manage to have
more people and to maintain

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.970
the quality of life.

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.850
AUDIENCE: I have a question
that's been related to kind of

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:05.670
some of the other questions.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.830
But it's basically the question
of unintended

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:09.770
consequences.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:11.800
If you're looking to reduce
suffering or if you're looking

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.710
to increase the number of life
years, that's basically a

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:17.470
consequentialist view.

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.920
And any action that you take
has a large range of

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.440
consequences.

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.800
And it's pretty much
impossible to

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.230
predict all of them.

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:29.540
For instance, after the Haiti
earthquake, lots of aid

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.880
workers went in, and I guess
the UN peacekeeping force

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.550
brought cholera with
them and created a

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.990
large cholera epidemic.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:39.140
There's been lots
of other cases.

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.330
Giving to refugees in Rwanda
actually fed some of the

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:46.570
Rwandan soldiers that were
responsible for the genocide.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.640
You could even say giving
malaria nets might free up

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.400
money from some governments,
from having to pay for health

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.850
services, and instead, they
might use that money for war

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.160
or something.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.070
So what is your advice, in terms
of finding the right

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:05.560
charities to give and minimizing
those unintended

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.180
consequences, so that you can be
relatively sure that you're

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.300
having a positive impact.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.320
PETER SINGER: Yeah, you're
right, of course, about the

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.470
cases you mentioned.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.200
At least, certainly,
the first two.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.850
And you're right that we can
never be completely sure that

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:23.450
we won't have unintended
consequences.

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.750
We can only learn
from mistakes.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:32.190
I think the Haiti case, there
is a general problem with

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:35.780
disaster relief, particularly
where it's a well-publicized

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.960
case, where a lot of
money comes in.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.620
And I don't really encourage
people to give in those

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.350
circumstances.

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:47.190
I mean, the Haiti case was one
which because it was close to

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:49.750
the United States and there are
a lot of Haitians here,

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:53.160
really more money came in than
could be usefully used.

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.940
And in addition, there was the
cholera that you mentioned.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:01.160
The Asian tsunami was a little
bit like that as well.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.410
And of course, the actual
domestic ones of Hurricane

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:06.190
Katrina and 9/11 were also cases
where more money was

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:09.140
donated than really could
be usefully used.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.530
You get, I think, much better
cost-effectiveness, in terms

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:15.380
of long-term development then
with those disasters.

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.720
But even there, yes.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.260
Things can go wrong,
certainly.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.170
I'm not aware of cases where
because NGOs provided bed

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.940
nets, governments had
more money for war.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:34.130
I think that's probably somewhat
far-fetched, because

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:36.300
the governments probably would
not have provided the bed nets

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.420
if the NGOs hadn't been there
in the first place.

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:43.990
But you really just have to do
the best you can, and you can

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:45.000
never be completely sure.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.890
But I think you also shouldn't
be paralyzed by the fact that

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:49.000
you might make a mistake.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.220
Because the result of that would
be that you don't do any

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.760
of these good things, and in
many of the cases, you would

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.580
have done very good things
without any of these

00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:01.830
unintended consequences, or any
seriously adverse ones.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.370
AUDIENCE: Professor Singer,
thanks for coming.

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:07.270
I've always found your
work inspirational.

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:08.760
You sort of--

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.220
I mean, with her earlier
question, you alluded to--

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.090
you allowed us to sort of
give only what we're

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:16.500
psychologically prepared
to give.

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.370
I mean, you know, to give a
lot but not everything.

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:21.320
We don't have become
St. Francis.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.320
But why--

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.760
I mean, as she said, rigorously,
your philosophy

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.050
does seem to suggest that we
should give everything.

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:32.200
So why give us a psychological
break on what we're prepared

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.590
to do when you don't give us a
psychological break of saying,

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:40.630
well, this kid is here now, and
I see him, as opposed to

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.740
the people who are far remote,
psychologically, I don't care

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:44.290
about them.

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:47.640
You said that logically we
should, and I agree.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.560
But you understand
my question?

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.240
PETER SINGER: Yeah, I understand
the question.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:58.730
So I suppose I give you a
psychological break because I

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:03.570
want to develop and advocate a
morality for real human beings

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.980
and not for a population
of St. Francises.

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:11.720
And so I think that's why we
need that kind of morality.

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.710
Now in terms of saying, why
don't you give us a

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.880
psychological break in terms of
our greater predisposition

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.920
to save the child in the pond?

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.510
If in some way that were a
choice, and people were

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:28.215
saying, look, I can pull out one
child every day from the

00:55:28.215 --> 00:55:30.610
pond, or I can save ten children
elsewhere, and I'm

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:35.250
busy pulling out the child from
the pond, maybe then OK.

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:36.900
But in fact, the child
in the pond is a

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.430
hypothetical example--

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:40.730
not totally hypothetical.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:43.020
Every now and again, somebody
sends me a news clipping and

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.800
says, hey, did you see this
child fell into a pond and

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.400
somebody rescued them,
or whatever.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.450
But for most of us, we've never
had the opportunity to

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.590
easily rescue a small
drowning child.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.130
So giving us that psychological
break and

00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:58.520
saying, you don't have to
worry about the distant

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.455
strangers would effectively
be saying you

00:56:00.455 --> 00:56:02.220
don't have to do anything.

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.860
AUDIENCE: I like your story
about the pond, and actually,

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.220
I hear another one.

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.310
Sometimes we're overwhelmed
when there's so

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.650
many people in need.

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:12.800
And I heard that one time in a
beach, there was a little boy

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.620
throwing starfishes
into the water.

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.210
And someone said, you're
crazy, there's so many.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:18.550
You're not going to
save them all.

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:22.170
And he said, yeah, that's right,
but this one will live.

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.290
And then he will continue.

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.850
And so even if we impact one,
two, or three, those are real

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:27.900
lives that we're saving.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:32.030
And so I don't have a real
question, but to end, I just

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:36.340
want to encourage all of us not
to be intimidated by that

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:40.550
daunting task, but encouraging
each of us to do one thing in

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:41.730
something that we're
passionate.

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:45.080
Even if it's technology,
education, some disease, or

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.300
whatever it is.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.090
And then if we donate through
let's say Google or another

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:52.040
company, $1 that you donate
gets matched.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.960
And then if you can bring
someone else in a company like

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.195
that, then you are quadrupling
your contribution.

00:56:58.195 --> 00:57:01.880
So I want to thank you for
your time and I hope that

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:05.410
everyone gets encouraged
by your speech.

00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:05.880
PETER SINGER: Thank
you very much.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.500
And thank you for the starfish
illustration.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.360
It does make the point well.

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, that is
a great way to wrap up our

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.540
presentation with Dr. Singer.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.790
I want to thank you very
much for coming.

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:16.480
PETER SINGER: Thank
you very much.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.310
And may I remind you that if
you do you feel you have

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:23.860
something to help in some way
with The Life You Can Save, we

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.930
have the sign-up sheets
over there.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:29.500
And for those of you watching
elsewhere, if you would email

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.450
charlie.bresler@
thelifeyoucansave.com, we'd be

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:33.530
very happy to hear from you.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:34.780
Thank you.
