00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.830
We're on problem 81.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:13.810
They give us this equation, y
is equal to 248 minus 398x.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.340
Which of the following values of
x gives the greatest value

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.990
of y in the equation above?

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.440
To get as large a possible y,
y is 248 minus this thing.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.860
So what we want to do is, since
we're subtracting this

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.300
from 248, we want to
minimize this.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.890
As small as this can be.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.010
And even if we can make what
we're subtracting negative,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.450
that'd be awesome, because when
you subtract a negative,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.590
then that'll get us above 248.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.510
And actually, if we look at all
of the choices, they have

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.670
one negative number there.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.350
You might say if we put
a 0 here, then y

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.220
is going to be 248.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.270
But what if we put a negative
number in for x, they have as

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.350
choice E, negative 1.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.060
What happens when we put
negative 1 there?

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.900
Then y is equal to 248 minus
negative 1 times 398, so it's

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.715
minus minus negative 398,
which is the same

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:10.980
thing as plus 398.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.510
So that's actually the maximum
point, because we're

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.180
subtracting a negative.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.830
That's even better than
subtracting 0, and it's way

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.610
better than subtracting a
positive, if we're trying to

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.930
maximize y.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.180
So the choice is E.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.140
82.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.630
Machine A produces bolts at a
uniform rate of 120 bolts

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.130
every 40 seconds.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.230
So that's the same as-- 120
bolts every 40 seconds is the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.205
same thing as 3 bolts
per second.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.630
OK, that's A.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.820
Let me write that
down, that's A.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.680
Machine B produces bolts at a
uniform rate of, so this is B,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.020
of 120 bolts every 20 seconds.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.290
Well that's equal to
5 bolts per second.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.410
If the two machines run
simultaneously, how many

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.330
seconds will it take for
them to produce a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.940
total of 200 bolts?

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.450
So if you're running
simultaneously, what's your

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.290
speed per second?

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.350
This one's going to do 3 per
second, this one's going to do

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.830
5 per second.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.030
So if they run simultaneously,
you're going to be producing 8

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.390
per second, 3 plus 5.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.570
So 8 bolts per second is
their combined rate.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.180
And we want to know how
many seconds will it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.100
take to do 200 bolts.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.990
So we just take 200 bolts
divided by 8 seconds.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.370
Another way with distance,
distance is equal to rate

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.110
times time, I guess you could
view this as production is

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.700
equal to rate times time.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.610
Normally rate is how fast you're
moving per second, now

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.860
it's how much you're producing
per second, so your total

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.440
production is going to be your
rate times time, and then your

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.790
time is going to be
the production

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.780
divided by the rate.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.090
But sometimes when you think too
much in terms of formulas,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.970
you lose the intuition.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.720
But I just wanted to show you
that there is a formula for

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.000
it, if you need one.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.440
But the easiest way to think
it, I have to produce 200

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.320
bolts, if I said I produce
100 every second,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.610
it'll take me 2 seconds.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.030
So if I have to produce 8
every second, I take 200

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.280
divided by 8.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.890
And I can even do the units, 200
bolts divided by 8 bolts

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.530
per second.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.640
That's equal to 200 over 8 times
bolts times-- if this

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.790
isn't the denominator, you just
inverse it when you go

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.100
out-- seconds per bolt, the
bolts can't [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.470
So you know you got the units
right, so to some degree that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.560
should give you conviction
that you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.730
got the formula right.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.310
And 200 divided by 8 is 25.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.440
So it's 25 seconds.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.070
It's choice B.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.310
Problem 83.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.285
What is the decimal equivalent
of 1/5 to the fifth power?

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:04.770
So let's think about this.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.710
Let's write 1/5 as a decimal,
that's 0.2.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.110
So it's 0.2 to the 5th power.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.980
Let's just multiply it out.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.940
0.2 times 0.2 is
equal to what?

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.200
2 times 2, and we have
two digits behind the

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.000
decimal, so it's 0.04.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.870
And you multiply
that times 0.2.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.460
2 times 4 is 8, and now we have
three numbers behind the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.660
decimal point, that's
going to be equal to

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.450
0.008 One, two, three.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.180
Three numbers behind
the decimal.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.820
So this is 2 to the third.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.650
And then 0.008 times 0.2,
let me write this is

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.180
to the third power.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.340
That's equal to 2 times 8 is 16,
and then how many numbers

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.090
do we have behind the
decimal point?

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.390
One, two, three, four.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.110
So we're going to have point
one, two, three, four.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.840
So that's to the 4th power.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.460
We have one left, so 0.0016
times 0.2 is equal to,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.400
2 times 16 is 32.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.700
And now we have one, two, three,
four, five numbers

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.660
behind the decimal point.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.930
So one, two, three,
four, five.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.375
That's the answer, and
that is choice A.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.970
Actually the easiest way to
think about it is, without

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.280
even having to do this, you
could've said, what's 2 to the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.630
fifth power?

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.740
2 to the fifth power is 32.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.360
And actually that alone, because
there's only one

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.650
choice that even has a 32 behind
the decimal point.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.470
And you can say, every time I
take to a power, I'm adding

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.100
one digit behind the decimal
point, so it's going to be 32,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.630
but it's going to have five
numbers behind the decimal

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.870
point, so point one, two,
three, four, five.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.420
I did it the slow way.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.390
Next question, 84.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:08.240
90 minus 8 times 20-- I'll write
it the way they did-- 20

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.265
divided by 4, all of
that over 1/2.

00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:14.420
This is just a fast
simplification problem.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.720
That becomes 90 minus-- what's
20 divided by 4?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.900
20 by 4 is 5.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.160
5 times 8 is 40, all
that over 1/2.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.030
That becomes 50 over 1/2, which
is the same thing as 50

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.190
times 2 over 1, which
is equal to 100.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.470
That's choice C.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.090
That's just one you just have
to do quickly and not make a

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.340
careless mistake.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.210
I did it quickly, I don't know
if I did a careless mistake.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.580
Let's see, 85.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.690
A dealer originally bought 100
identical batteries at a total

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.460
cost of q dollars.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.750
So q is equal to
100 batteries.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.620
If each battery was sold at 50%
above the original cost,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.050
so b is the cost each battery
was sold at, so b is going to

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.060
be 50% above the original cost.
So it's going to be 1.5

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.610
times the original cost. This is
50% above the original cost

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.570
per battery.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.600
Then in terms of q, for
how many dollars was

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.090
each battery sold?

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.600
A dealer originally bought 100
identical batteries at a total

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.730
cost of q dollars.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.330
If each battery was sold--
oh I'm sorry.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:48.310
So this is the cost. So q is
equal to 100 times what the

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.100
dealer paid for it.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.510
A dealer originally bought 100
identical batteries at the

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.480
total cost of q dollars.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.750
If each battery was sold at 50%
above the original cost

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:05.900
per battery, this is the
original cost, is equal to 1.5

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:12.170
times the cost. In terms of q,
for how many dollars was each

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.440
battery sold?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.740
So let's write q in terms of the
cost. So cost is equal to

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.785
q divided by 100.

00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:20.380
Just divided both sides of
that equation by 100.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.600
And then we could just
substitute c, or the cost

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.960
here, the selling price
is 150% of this.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.000
So selling price is equal
to 1.5 times c,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.600
which is q over a 100.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.640
And let's see how they did it.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.780
So selling price is equal
to 1.5q over 100.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.080
I don't expect to see
that as a choice.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:50.250
But if we multiply the top and
the bottom by 2, that equals

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:55.960
3q over 200.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.220
That's choice A.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.690
Just need to make sure you
get your variables

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.260
right on that one.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:08.350
Problem 86.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.620
In an increasing sequence of ten
consecutive integers, the

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.160
sum of the first five
integers is 560.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.840
What is the sum of the last five
integers in the sequence?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.070
OK, ten consecutive integers.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:26.220
So x plus 1 plus x plus-- let me
write it this way-- x plus

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.490
1 plus x plus 2, well actually
the first one, let's call it

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:36.470
x, x plus 3, x plus 4.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.890
This right here is going to be
the first five consecutive

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.560
integers if we start at x.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.180
When you take the sum of those--
well the sum of those

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.270
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5x.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:54.060
Let's see, 1 plus 2 is 3, 3 plus
3 is 6, 6 plus 4 is 10.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:01.970
5x plus 10 is going to
be equal to 560.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:02.470
Fair enough.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.390
Or we could say 5x
is equal to 550.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.010
I think we can use
that information.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.540
Now what is the next five
integers going to be?

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:18.420
It's going to be x plus 5, x
plus 6, x plus 7, x plus 8,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.830
and x plus 9.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.960
These are five, and what
do those add up to be.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:29.520
That's 5x plus-- 5 plus 6
is 11 plus 7 is 18 plus

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.120
8 is 26 plus 9.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.440
26 plus 9 is 35.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.200
So that's 5x plus 35.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.710
And they want to know what
this is equal to.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.130
That's the next five.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.930
Well we know what 5x
is, it's equal 550.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.200
From this set up, so it's going
to be equal to 550 plus

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:58.990
35, which is equal to 35
plus 550, which is 585.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.070
That's choice A.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.260
And the trick here to being able
to do it fast is just to

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.910
recognize that you didn't have
to solve all the way for x.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.150
That you could reuse this
5x when you took the

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.820
sum of the next five.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.730
And I'm all out of time, see
you in the next video.
