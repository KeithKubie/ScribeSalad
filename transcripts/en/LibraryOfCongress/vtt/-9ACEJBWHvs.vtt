&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Hello.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.880
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.900
I'm Stephanie Merry,
the Book World Editor

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.290
at the Washington Post.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.520
Which is a charter sponsor of
the National Book Festival.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.410
First, a word of thanks to the
Co-Chairman of the festival,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.870
David Rubenstein and the
other generous sponsors,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.540
who've made this event possible.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.510
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.900
please note the information
in your program.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.690
We'll have some time, after the
presentation, for questions.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.700
And I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.750
to the microphone, you will
be included in the video tape

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.630
of this event, which may be

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.470
Our guest this afternoon
is Christopher Paul Curtis.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.770
Whoa! [applause].

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.070
Yes, indeed.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.370
Lots of fans.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.420
A native of Flint, Michigan,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.770
Christopher began his
writing career as a way

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.240
to pass the time, when he was
working on an assembly line

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.120
at a General Motors
Facility after high school.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.400
He followed up his first
book, "The Watsons go

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.490
to Birmingham -1963",
with "Bud, Not Buddy,"

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.280
an instant classic [applause].

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.540
An instant classic about
a boy, also from Flint,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.780
who hits the road in
search of his father.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.830
It won the Newbery Medal and
the Coretta Scott King Award.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.470
His most recent book is the
journey of little Charlie.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.650
A moving novel about an
overgrown 12-year-old,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.790
who finds himself in
a moral crossroads,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.810
shortly after his
father's death.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.110
It's my extreme pleasure

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.510
to welcome Christopher
Paul Curtis to the stage.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.510
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis:
Thank you, very much.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.720
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.020
Thank you, very much.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.120
It's a great honor to be here
at the National Book Festival.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.720
I was at the first one.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.210
And now 18 years later,
it's great to be back.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.200
Last night was a
wonderful evening.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.680
I got to hear a hero
of mine speak,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.980
Jaqueline Woodson [applause].

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.210
And Jackie has always
been very special to me.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.690
And 2018 has been a
great year for Jackie.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.930
She was named the Ambassador
for Children's Literature.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.010
She also won the Astrid
Lindgren Memorial Award

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.070
for Lifetime Achievement.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.800
Now, the Astrid Lindgren
Memorial part is cool,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.190
but the award part
is unbelievable.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.100
The amount of money that she won
with that was just mindboggling.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.380
And nobody deserved it
more than Jacqueline.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.250
I'm so proud to know her.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.960
She wrote a blurb for "The
Watsons Go to Birmingham."

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.280
She was one of the
first people to read it.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.760
And she was involved in one of
the first appearances I did.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.420
I was going to -- soon
after "The Watsons Go

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.370
to Birmingham" was published,
the publishers called me

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.150
and said, "Would you
like to go to California

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.720
to speak in San Diego?"

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.170
And I said, "Of course."

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.110
So, I flew out to San Diego.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.090
I didn't understand
how things worked.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.390
I was broke.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.100
I had like $40 and
I was going to be

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.830
in San Diego for four days.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.720
So, I was trying to
figure out how I was going

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.290
to ration this to buy my meals.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.030
We're driving in
from the airport.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.090
And the cab driver
said this is the hotel.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.900
It was on one side
of the expressway.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.530
On the other side of the
expressway was a Denny's.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.610
And this was back when
Denny's had the $1.99,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.350
Are You Out of Your
Mind, promo going on.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.150
And I thought, halleluiah,
Denny's.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.100
So, I go in, in this
beautiful room.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.560
I'm in there, but I'm hungry.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.430
So, I decide to go to Denny's.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.900
I walk out, there's
about a two-mile run

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.200
of expressway this way.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.140
A two-mile run of
expressway that way.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.070
So, I decide I'm going
to cross the expressway.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.230
And if any of you have ever
seen the movie "Bowfinger,"

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.250
I'm pretty sure that
was based on me.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.080
Where Eddie Murphy's trying
to run across the expressway.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.310
So, anyway, I ran
across East bound.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.220
I ran across West bound.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.520
I got to Denny's.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.170
I had my $1.99 meal.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.490
I ran across West bound.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.840
I ran across East
bound, came back.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.790
And then I had the
chance to meet Jackie.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.600
And we talked for a while.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.710
And I said to her, "How do you
-- you travel a lot, don't you?"

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.050
And she told me she does.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.670
And I said, "How do
you afford this?"

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.090
And she said, "What
do you mean?"

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.680
I said, "Doesn't it
get expensive eating

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.170
out all the time?"

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.610
And then she said, Jaqueline
Woodson has said two things

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.990
to me that are just
emblazoned in my mind

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.510
that I remember forever.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.880
And she said, "No, no, no, the
publisher pays for everything."

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.310
And the words she says
that I remember forever,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.920
"They don't even care if you eat
the peanuts out of the minibar."

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.470
So, I was very grateful
to Jackie.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.770
I said, "You know what, Jackie,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.440
is there anything I can
do for you, anything?"

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.700
And the second thing that
Jackie said to me was

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.800
and this is emblazoned
word for word too.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.400
She said, "Look, why
don't we make a pact."

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.010
"Let's say that you win
some great award with a lot

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.440
of money attached to it or I
win some great award with a lot

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.740
of money attached to it."

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.090
"Let's agree to divide it
50/50 [brief laughter].

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.730
Jackie was notified
of the award in March.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.150
By the time May came around,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.170
I was wondering why I
wasn't getting any calls

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.470
or e-mails or anything.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.480
So, if any of you know Jackie,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.630
please let her know
that I'm waiting.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.390
It's a real pleasure to
be here in many ways.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.700
One of the reasons, I am the
father of a seven-year-old girl,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.900
a six-year-old girl
and four-year-old boy.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.890
And the noise they
make is unbelievable.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.170
And it was nice to be in a room
last night and not to hear,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.480
you know, wake up every second
with a child in your face.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.040
My seven-year-old -- first,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.650
are there any Somalis
in the audience?

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.490
Anybody speak Somali?

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.560
Great. My seven-year
old's name is Ayaan.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.730
My six-year old's
name is Ebyaan.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.740
My four-year old's
name is Libaan.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.580
And in Somali tradition,
names are very important.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.390
It's something that the
child's going to have

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.740
for the rest of their life.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.460
So, it's got to be something
that's very important.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.960
So, I did a lot of
research on the names.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.650
And the name Ayaan, I discovered
means, and I get this confused,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.530
daughter of the handsomest,
kindest, most intelligent,

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.400
most charming man in the clan.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.930
Ebyaan means another daughter
of the handsomest, kindest.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.370
And Libaan, who we call "our
little surprise," is a prayer.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.850
And the prayer is, oh, God,
let this be the last child

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.010
of the handsomest, kindest,
most loving man in the clan.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:27.410
Yeah, a lot of times I'm asked,
how did you become an author?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.800
Well, that's one of those
questions that there are

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.040
so many variables that
come into it that it's hard

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.680
to pinpoint exactly what it was.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.440
For 13 years after high school,
I worked in Fisher Body Plant

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.770
in Flint, Michigan,
putting doors on Buicks.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.600
I hated this job.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.720
And after 13 years, I
got the courage to quit.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.600
It was a scary thing.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.860
I was thrown into the
world of menial jobs.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.230
I worked as a garbage man.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.240
I worked as a maintenance
man in an apartment complex.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.770
I hit bottom when I was actually
the coal campaign chairman

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.630
for United States
Senator for a year.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.830
But I finally moved
to Windsor, Ontario.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.970
And got a job just
outside of Detroit

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.490
at a check writing place.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.320
And I was the lowest
paid person in the place.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.400
I was making $7.00 an hour.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.550
This was through man power.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.570
And I found out they were
paying man power $17.00 an hour.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.850
And I was getting $7.00 of it.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.130
It doesn't make you want
to be a happy employee.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.320
But I was happy to have the job.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.300
And I was eventually
hired fulltime.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.540
So, I got raise to
$7.50 [brief laughter].

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.170
An opening came up
in consumer --

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.320
customer service representative.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.860
So, I applied for it.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.430
And I knew the two women
who ran the customer

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.850
service representatives.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.570
So, I figured this was kind
of pretty much a slam dunk.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.610
I came to work that
day of the interview.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.910
I had my work clothes on.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.470
I did a half a day of work.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.770
I put my suit on,
I brought a suit.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.750
I walked in and as
soon as I walked

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.410
into the room, the
women laughed.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.790
And I though, oh, this
is not a good reaction.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.860
And they said, "Oh, you
didn't have to wear a suit."

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.810
And I thought, no, I'm
very serious about this.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.140
I want this to happen.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.620
And so, we talked for a while.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.460
And about a week later, the
Human Resources woman called

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.260
and I went into her office.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.980
And you could tell right away, I
mean, the air just wasn't right.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.030
And so, she said, "You did a
great job at the interview."

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.470
There were two or
three things like that.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.240
And then while I was
waiting for the but.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.540
And then the but came.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.790
And the but was,
she said, "Well,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.930
we don't think you're ready
to speak to the public yet."

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.230
I was crushed.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.000
I was absolutely crushed.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.480
So, I started looking
for other places to work.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.360
Something came up where I was
able to take a year off work.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.620
And then I'd get my job back,
when I came back after a year.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.270
So, I said to myself, I'm going
to take this year and I'm going

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.750
to take it very seriously.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.400
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.710
to go look for another job.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.710
But the main thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to try

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.060
to follow a dream that I have.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.220
I'm going to try
to write a book.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.190
So, every day I'd get up
and when the library opened,

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.490
I would be right there.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.380
I'd go in, I'd start writing.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.840
I was my own boss.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.700
I had to give myself the same
respect I gave my other bosses.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.810
Every day I went and did it
and ended up with a manuscript

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.590
that was 250 pages long.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.310
The next step was to
try to get it published.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.610
I sent to Little Brown.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.910
It was rejected.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.690
I sent it to Random
House, Wendy Lamb Books.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.990
It was rejected.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.290
But then she called and said

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.730
that they wanted to
publish it anyway.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.510
This was a cause for such
celebration in my house.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.190
You know what we did?

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.530
No, we didn't party.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.540
We went to Red Lobster
for dinner.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.300
Because I knew once
you publish a book,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.300
you're not a millionaire,
but you're filthy rich.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.190
The book came out,
did very well.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.250
Then -- what's -- the kind of
ironic thing is, when I was back

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.200
at work, I got a
call from a principal

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.860
of an elementary school
in Garden City, Michigan.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.110
And he said, "We've heard that
you've written a book and we'd

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.400
like you to come and
speak to our school."

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.380
And I said, "Sure,
I'd be happy to."

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.370
And he said, "We don't have
much money to give you,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.270
we can only give you $300."

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:18.180
I was making $280
a week for 40 hours

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.980
at the check writing place.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.790
I said, "Well, okay, this one
time, I'll do it for $300."

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.260
So, I did it for $300.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.560
The word got out.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.390
I just, I love talking
to young people.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.980
The word got out.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.290
And after a while, I was
able to quit the job.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.190
Not because of royalties
from the book,

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.340
but because I was getting enough
money from speaking engagements.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.780
So, it's kind of
ironic that I was able

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.540
to finally leave the place where
they didn't think I could speak

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.510
to the public, by
speaking to the public.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:54.350
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.650
Thank you.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.950
I felt the same way.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.330
I applauded a long
time [brief laughter].

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.310
The book I'd like
to talk about now is

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.180
"The Journey of Little Charlie."

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.430
This, of course,
everybody knows is Michigan.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.750
This is Michigan.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.830
And I'm from a city
right here called Flint.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.280
Right here is Detroit.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.070
About 40 miles inside
of Canada, over here,

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.590
is a little settlement
called Buxton, Ontario.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.150
And Buxton was started by
a Presbyterian minister.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.510
I believe he was from Kentucky,
whose wife inherited slaves.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.140
He felt it was immoral.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.920
So, he allowed the slaves
to work on the farms

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.800
around there and
keep their wages.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.200
He still thought
that was immoral.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.580
So, he bought this
land in Canada.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.010
It was three miles by six miles.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.870
And he used it as a
settlement for people

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.260
who have escaped from slavery.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.560
The cool thing was, this became
very well known throughout the

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.860
United States.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.160
And this is where
a lot of the people

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.600
from the underground
railroad ended up.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.480
I'd always wanted to write
a book about slavery.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.210
But I write first person
and it's difficult for me --

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.560
I like to put myself into
the mind of the character

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.860
that I'm writing about.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.160
And it's difficult for me

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.490
to imagine what it would
be like to be a slave.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.500
I had -- I don't think any
of you could imagine it.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.640
And I knew I couldn't imagine
what it would be like to have

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.050
to think of yourself
as an animal.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.550
And the worse thing I
thought is, is that you'd have

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.330
to think of your children.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.280
You'd have to teach your
children that they are animals,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.040
if you wanted them to live.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.300
If you wanted them to
survive as a slave.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.480
So, I knew I couldn't
write a story from first --

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.730
first person story from
the viewpoint of somebody

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.220
who had even escaped slavery.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.500
Because we understand so much
about post-traumatic stress.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.030
There must have been
post traumatic,

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.910
severe post-traumatic stress.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.700
So, I thought, okay, if
I write about Buxton,

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.230
I can write about the first
child who was born free there.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.010
So, I wrote Elijah Buxton.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.750
I'm asked a lot of
times by young people,

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.790
"What is your favorite book?"

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.090
And at author school, when
you go to author school,

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.350
they teach you a standard
answer to a lot of questions.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.650
That's not real.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.960
There's no such thing
as author school.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.330
They teach you standard answers.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.280
And the answer to that is you're
supposed to look very serious

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.480
and say -- when a child says,
"What is your favorite book?"

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.250
You're supposed to say, "Oh,
my books are like my children,

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.790
I don't have favorites."

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.660
I have favorite books and
I have favorite children

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.960
[brief laughter].

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.670
And since this is being recorded
and my children will see this,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.690
Ayaan is my favorite
seven-year-old.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.140
Ebyaan is my favorite
six-year-old.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.940
Libaan is my favorite
four-year-old.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:51.790
[ Applause ]

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.380
So, I wrote the story from
the point of view of Elijah.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.790
And I was able to do a
lot of research on Buxton.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.740
And there were just so
many beautiful stories

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.150
that came out of Buxton.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.930
One of them was the
story of a girl

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.470
from New Orleans, a slave girl.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.440
Who had been brought by
her enslaver's family

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.750
to Detroit as a servant.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:19.350
She was toy really, for
the slave family's child.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.350
Black children were done
-- used like this often.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.770
They were to be a
companion and a toy.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.070
So, she was a toy for this girl.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.370
She went to -- she was
about ten years old.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.760
She went to Detroit.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.720
She came back home.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.780
Her mother asked
her how things were?

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.080
What happened?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.180
And she told her mother, "I
was in Detroit and did you know

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.290
that I looked right across a
river and on the other side

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.840
of the river was Canada."

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.260
And the -- this was in
the records in Buxton.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.270
The mother slapped the girl.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.090
And the girl grabbed her
face and said, "Why?"

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.390
"Why did you slap me?"

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.380
And the mother said,
"You saw Canada

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.230
and you didn't do anything that
you could to try to get to it."

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.950
And the little girl said, "But
mommy, I'd never see you again."

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.340
And she slapped her again.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.000
And she said, "Do you know
what's waiting for you here?"

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.310
"Do you know I know what's
waiting for you here?"

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.360
"If that happens again,
you go do whatever you can

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.870
and you get across that river."

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.430
They took her again
and she escaped.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.430
She was one of the people
who grew up in Buxton.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:24.350
"The Journey of Little Charlie,"
which is the third of the books,

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.430
is the story of a boy named --

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.620
he was originally
called Chuckie Bobo.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.450
But see that -- and
the name was changed.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.980
And you -- writing to the
young people, my relationship

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.140
with my editors is a lot
like your relationship

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.450
with an English teacher.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.270
They know things
that you don't know.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.320
And if you're smart,
you listen to them.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.340
I listen to what my
editors have to say.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.450
And they didn't like
the name Chuckie Bobo.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.320
Because they said when you
say Chuckie, everybody thinks

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.960
of the little murderous doll.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.960
And so, I thought
about it and you know,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.550
you write the whole story.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.820
And I -- it was hard, but
I said, okay, I agree.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.490
So, we called the
book "Little Charlie,

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.160
The Journey of Little Charlie."

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.120
And little Charlie is a six
foot four, 12-year-old boy,

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.860
who is shanghaied
into going North

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.220
from Possum Moan,
South Carolina.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.290
He goes North to Detroit
to try to retrieve a family

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.060
that had run away years before.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.720
They finally were found.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.190
And the slave catcher took
Charlie with him to find them.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.830
The story goes into Canada.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.360
It touches on Buxton again.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:40.460
And it's called -- one of the
part of the "Buxton Chronicles."

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.600
I -- it's funny, as an author,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.690
the relationship you
have with a book.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.740
Because I didn't particularly
think it was a strong book.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.550
Even after we had worked
on it for a long time.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.620
And but it's been the
best reviewed book

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.630
that I've done, that
I've written.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.820
And I'm happy for that.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.690
But I'm beginning to
wonder if I can judge --

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:09.320
if I'm a bad judge
of my own books.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.220
My career, as a writer, has --

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.820
a lot of great things
have happened to me.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.790
One of the coolest things is
several years ago I got a call

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.270
to come to New York City because
somebody wanted to make a movie

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.390
out of "The Watsons
go to Birmingham."

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.420
So, I go to New York City
and I met Whoopi Goldberg.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.870
And she bought the
rights to make a movie.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.190
And that wasn't the cool thing.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:38.130
The cool thing was, Whoopi
brought a doll for my daughter.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.330
And it's a Whoopi doll.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.700
And I think Whoopi had some
bad ones she was trying

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.000
to get rid of.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.550
Because mine looks like
its got a sore neck.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.950
And its head is hanging
like this

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.140
and its dreads are
hanging down like that.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.070
And it's holding
something called Hi-Chew.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.850
And Hi-Chew was a
candy from Japan,

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.150
that the people weren't
eating right.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.260
They were chewing it and
spitting it out like gum.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.140
They wanted them to
chew it and swallow it.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.060
So, their solution
was to make this doll.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.620
So, I'm sitting at this
table and Whoopi --

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.320
there's Whoopi, there
her five assistants are.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.950
One of them reaches in the bag,
puts the doll on the table.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.670
And Whoopi claps her hands twice
and the doll starts to walk.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.010
And it walks like
Frankenstein, with a sore neck.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.260
But it also starts to talk and
it says over and over, "Chew,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.990
chew, swallow, chew,
chew, swallow."

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:27.270
I brought the doll home.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.890
The doll is still
under my bed in a bag.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.340
No one will ever see that doll.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.340
Anyway, we have time
for a few questions,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.970
if anybody has any
questions they'd like to ask.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.750
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.050
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: Hello.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.720
&gt;&gt; In your book, "The
Watsons Go to Birmingham,"

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.780
what was your inspiration
for the pet hospital?

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.080
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis: Ah.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.490
The world-famous
Watson pet hospital.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.070
As a writer -- are you a writer?

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.370
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.670
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis:
Okay, you're a writer.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.140
As a writer, we have a real
advantage over the readers,

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.440
in that we can take
things that happen to us.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.570
We can take things that
happen to other people.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.410
We can take our own
imagination and use it

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.200
to make the story interesting
and to make the story work.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.640
The pet hospital was
something that happened to me.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.480
I noticed that -- this was back

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.920
in the days before
dogs had diseases.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.220
I don't know, all of a sudden,

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.440
dogs now are getting every
disease you can think of.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.460
Back then, you got hit by a
car, you know, and that was it.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.170
And I noticed that if a dog
got sick or was hit by a car

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.810
or something, it always
would run behind the couch.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:42.980
And you'd come back the next
day and the dog was either gone

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.660
or the dog was sitting back
there, you know, getting better.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.470
And I, in my mind, I said well,

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.360
this must be like
a pet hospital.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.750
So, that is something that
really happened to me.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.040
I thought that the dogs
went behind the couch

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.780
and were either healed
or went to doggie heaven.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:03.010
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
part about writing books?

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.310
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis:

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.850
What's my favorite part
about writing books?

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.550
I love just about everything
about writing books.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.660
But the only thing I don't

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.560
like is getting my first
editorial letter from my editor.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.370
Because I know how they do it.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.920
The first three pages -- like
you get a 25-page letter.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.240
And the first three pages are
how wonderful this book is.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.540
And oh, it's a great book.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.090
And the last 22 pages are,

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.570
change this, do this
differently.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.830
We don't like this, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.740
So, when I get a letter like
that, I won't open the e-mail

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.020
for a week or so, before I
finally say, okay, let's do it.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.320
That's my least favorite part.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.940
My favorite part I think -- and
this has changed over the years,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.870
is the fact that I'm
able to give something

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.140
to today's students
that I didn't have.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.220
When I was younger, there
were no books for by

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.450
or about African American kids.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.310
And I have teachers come up to
me all the time now and say,

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.610
you know, thank you
for writing the book.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.330
And I think teachers are,
even though they're overpaid

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.630
and underworked [brief
laughter].

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.460
I think teachers are some of the
greatest people in our society.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.760
And the fact that [applause],

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.410
the fact that I could
do anything

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.840
that can make a teacher's
job easier, I think is great.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.410
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:30.710
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: Hello.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.550
&gt;&gt; Oh. I just want to say
my group read the book "Bud,

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:36.960
not Buddy," and we
really liked it.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.260
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: Well, thank you.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.630
&gt;&gt; And we were wondering if
you could make a second book?

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.930
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: About Bud?

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah [brief laughter].

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.930
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis: You
know, when you finish a book,

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.430
one of the things that happens
is the characters are gone.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.120
And it's almost like they die.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.860
Because when I write the book,
I go every day, I talk to Bud,

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.720
I talk to his friends.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.730
And Bud is gone.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.360
There's a little bit about Bud,
and I don't know if you've read

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.750
"The Mighty Miss Malone?"

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.600
There's a little
bit of Bud in there.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.080
But if I was to write a sequel
to Bud, I think I'd have

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.370
to be really desperate
to write a sequel.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:13.300
So, if you see a sequel and if
you see "Bud, Not Buddy Two,"

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.340
you can say, I know that author,
he's desperate [brief laughter].

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.990
&gt;&gt; If you want to make a
second "Bud, Not Buddy,"

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.380
what would it be about?

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.470
[brief laughter].

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.140
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis: If
I were to write a second "Bud,

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.370
Not Buddy," what
would it be about?

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.340
Ah, I don't know.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.130
I think that Bud became
a great saxophone player,

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:39.170
that he found happiness in life.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:45.840
Nah, that wouldn't be a
good book [brief laughter].

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.140
Yes?

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.370
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, my friends named
the whirlpool, the whirlpool.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.830
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: The Wool Pooh.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah [brief laughter].

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.700
And how do you make
that character?

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.000
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis: How?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.340
&gt;&gt; How do you make
the whirlpool?

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.640
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: The whirlpool?

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.940
The question is about
the whirlpool.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.940
That's the thing I get
most questions about.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.010
How Grandma Sands,
warns the boys not to go

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.810
down to the water,
they'll get caught up --

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.150
she's got a southern accent.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.930
You'll get caught
up in the Wool Pooh.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.860
And Kenny didn't understand
what she said so he asked Byron,

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.100
the 13-year-old juvenile
delinquent.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.860
And he said to Byron,
"What did she say?"

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.240
And he said, "You'll get
caught by the Wool Pooh.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.920
And he said, "What's
the Wool Pooh?"

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.170
And Byron told him,
"The Wool Pooh,

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:31.050
is Winnie-the-Pooh's evil
twin brother [brief laughter],

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.350
that nobody writes about.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:36.240
Because he sits in the water and
pulls kids down and drowns them.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.540
So, that's where that came from.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.840
Yes?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.500
&gt;&gt; How did you come up with the
inspiration for Dolly Peaches

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.150
from "The Mighty Miss Malone?"

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.770
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: The inspiration for?

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.380
&gt;&gt; Dolly Peaches.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.810
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: Dolly Peaches?

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.110
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.410
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis:

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.410
Every authors nightmare
[brief laughter].

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.450
I -- refresh my memory.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.250
I'm going to see if
you know about Dolly.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.080
Tell me a little bit about
Dolly Peaches [brief laughter].

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.440
&gt;&gt; He bullies Jimmie.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.740
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: He bullies?

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.040
&gt;&gt; Jimmie.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.340
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: Oh, oh, oh.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.780
It's just a bully.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.470
And I can't remember, there was
some reason I chose that name.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.140
I can't remember why, though.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.440
Thank you.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.740
Thank you.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.040
You did a very good job.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.840
I'm glad you were
paying attention.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.370
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:28.100
How many months does it
take to release a book?

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.400
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis: Wow.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.950
How old are you?

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.250
&gt;&gt; Seven.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.550
&gt;&gt; Seven. I have
a seven-year-old,

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.970
she wouldn't have asked me that.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.480
She would have asked
me something like,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.540
what's your favorite
unicorns name?

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.680
But how many months does
it take to release a book?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.060
That's a loaded question.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.360
It can take years.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.100
A minimum probably of two years,
from the time I finish it,

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.490
from the time I started,
to the time it comes out,

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.420
probably two to three years.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.090
Because it goes through
the publishing process.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:57.500
And that's very involved.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.890
The publisher's names on there.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.240
They don't want to
get embarrassed.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.540
My names on there.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.840
I don't want to get embarrassed.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.380
So, everybody is very
careful what they write.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.680
Very good question.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.010
&gt;&gt; Do you have a question?

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:15.110
&gt;&gt; Is there any pattern to when,
in "Watsons go to Birmingham,"

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.740
when Byron is being like
a nice friend to Kenny

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.370
and when he's playing tricks
and getting in trouble?

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.030
Like, he seems like a bad guy

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.080
and then he's super nice
and solving problems.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.380
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis:
I know this question.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.530
Is there any pattern to why
does Byron change so suddenly?

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.480
The book is narrated by Kenny.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.990
We're getting Kenny's
point of view.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.720
Do you have an older
brother or sister?

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.020
&gt;&gt; No.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.320
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul
Curtis: If you did,

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.770
you would think they were the
worst person in the world.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.130
And that's what Kenny
thought about Bryon.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.960
He thought he was the
worst person in the world.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.610
But if you read between
the lines,

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.790
you can see Byron's not a bad
a person as Kenny thought.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.680
And Kenny really started to
see what Byron was really like.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.210
Byron was really kind of
a sensitive, nice guys,

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.560
underneath all the bravado.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.860
Good question.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.160
Yes?

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.460
&gt;&gt; Hi, I teach.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.760
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis: Hi.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.060
What grade are you in?

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.360
[brief laughter].

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.660
&gt;&gt; Twelve point something
[brief laughter].

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.210
Twelve point something.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.990
Anyway, I used to teach

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.710
and I taught sixth
grade for a long time.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.310
So, I always -- I missed you

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.170
when you came the first
time, like 18 years ago.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:22.960
But I wanted to basically tell
you that any chance I got,

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.500
I taught English, Language Arts

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.100
and sometimes I taught
Geography.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.400
No matter which subject
I taught,

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.050
I always had them
read that book.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.460
And I have my copy still
that's underlined quite,

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.100
you know, just all throughout.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.960
But anyway, but basically, I
just wanted to let you know

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.100
that every time we got to
the whirlpool and we got

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.920
to the bombing, I cried.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.220
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis: Oh.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.520
&gt;&gt; Every single time.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.820
So, I just wanted
to let you know

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.160
that it always had
that effect on me.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.640
I came across you as an
author just by accident.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.840
But that is like one of my
absolute favorite books.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.710
I was not somebody who grew
up reading books for children.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.290
I started reading
them as an adult.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.830
And so, I absolutely love them.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.150
And I love everything
that you've written.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.450
Thank you.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:03.750
&gt;&gt; Christopher Paul Curtis:
Thank you, so much [applause].

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.260
Thank you.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.880
I'm getting the wrap it up sign.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.030
So, I'd like to say
thank you to all of you

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.540
for supporting me
through the years.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.790
And keep reading and
support your teachers

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.090
and your librarians.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.890
Thank you very much.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.500
