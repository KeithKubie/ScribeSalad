00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.260
Let's say that f of x is equal
to x squared plus x minus 6

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.470
over x minus 2.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.610
And we're curious about
what the limit of f

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.540
of x, as x approaches
2, is equal to.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.450
Now the first attempt
that you might

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.700
want to do right when you
see something like this, is

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.040
just see what happens
what is f of 2.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.760
Now this won't always be the
limit, even if it's defined,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.259
but it's a good
place to start, just

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.130
to see if it's something
reasonable could pop out.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.720
So looking at it this way,
if we just evaluate f of 2,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.570
on our numerator, we get
2 squared plus 2 minus 6.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.912
So it's going to be 4 plus
2, which is 6, minus 6,

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.620
so you're going to
get 0 in the numerator

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.310
and you're going to get
0 in the denominator.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.490
So we don't have, the
function is not defined,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.120
so not defined at x is equal 2.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.300
f not defined.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.810
So there's no
simple thing there.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.900
Even if this did evaluate, if
it was a continuous function,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.579
then the limit would be
whatever the function is,

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.370
but that doesn't
necessarily mean the case.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.331
But we see very clearly the
function is not defined here.

00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:11.830
So let's see if we
can simplify this

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.754
and also try to
graph it in some way.

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:15.920
So one thing that might
have jumped out at your head

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.906
is you might want to factor
this expression on top.

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.280
So if we want to
rewrite this, we

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.270
can rewrite the top expression.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.620
And this just goes back
to your algebra one,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.650
two numbers whose
product is negative 6,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.250
whose sum is positive 3,
well that could be positive 3

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.100
and negative 2.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.450
So this could be
x plus 3 times x

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.940
minus 2, all of
that over x minus 2.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.950
So as long as x
does not equal 2,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.460
these two things
will cancel out.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.140
So we could say this is equal
to x plus 3 for all X's except

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.330
for x is equal to 2.

00:01:57.976 --> 00:01:59.600
So that's another
way of looking at it.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.182
Another way we could
rewrite our f of x,

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:04.440
we'll do it in blue, just
to change the colors,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.230
we could rewrite f of x, this
is the exact same function,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.340
f of x is equal to x plus
3 when x does not equal 2.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.410
And we could even say it's
undefined when x is equal to 2.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.360
So given this definition,
it becomes much clearer

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.080
to us of how we can
actually graph f of x.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.860
So let's try to do it.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.870
So that is, that is
not anywhere near being

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.380
a straight line,
that is much better.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.510
So let's call this the y-axis
call it y equals f of x.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.430
And then let's,
over here, let me

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.670
make a horizontal line,
that is my x-axis.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.610
So defined this way, f of
x is equal to x plus 3.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.870
So if this is 1, 2, 3, we
have a y-intercept at 3

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.880
and then the slope is 1.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.770
And it's defined for all X's
except for x is equal to 2.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.900
So this is x is equal
to 1, x is equal to 2.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.394
So when x is equal
to 2 it is undefined.

00:03:07.394 --> 00:03:08.810
So let me make
sure I can, so it's

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.420
undefined right over there.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.500
So this is what f
of x looks like.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.190
Now given this, let's try
to answer our question.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.965
What is the limit of f
of x as x approaches 2.

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:30.330
Well, we can look
at this graphically.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.740
As x approaches 2 from
lower values in 2,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.220
so this right over here is x is
equal to 2, if we get to maybe,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.840
let's say this is 1.7,
we see that our f of x

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.270
is right over there.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.810
If we get to 1.9, our f
of x is right over there.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.000
So it seems to be approaching
this value right over there.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.220
Similarly, as we approach 2
from values greater than it,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.960
if we're at, I don't know,
this could be like 2.5,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.140
2.5 our f of x is
right over there.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.000
If we get even closer to 2,
our f of x is right over there.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.650
And once again, we look like
we are approaching this value.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.150
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.690
if we ride this line from
the positive direction,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.820
we seem to be approaching
this value for f

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.990
of x, if we write this line
from the negative direction,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.180
from values less than 2,
we seem to be approaching

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.880
this value right over here.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.310
And this is essentially
the value of x plus 3

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.440
if we set x is equal to 2.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.850
So this is essentially going to
be, this value right over here,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.920
is equal to 5.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.930
If we just look at it
visually, if we just

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.330
graphed a line with slope 1
with the y-intercept of 3,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.650
this value right over here is 5.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.750
Now we could also try to
do this it numerically,

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.350
so let's try to do that.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.240
So if this is our
function definition,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.330
completely identical to
our original definition,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.940
then we just try values as x
gets closer and closer to 2.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.850
So let's try values less than 2.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.980
So 1.9999, and this
is almost obvious.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.960
1.9999 plus 3, well, that gets
you pretty darn close to 5.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.230
If I put even more 9s
here, get even closer to 2,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.320
we'd get even closer to 5 here.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.590
If we approach 2 from
the positive direction,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.370
and then, we once again, we're
getting closer and closer

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.160
to 5 from the
positive direction.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.249
If we were even closer to
2, we'd be even closer to 5.

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.790
So whether we look
at it numerically,

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.660
or we look at it graphically,
it looks pretty clear

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.780
that the limit here is
going to be equal to five.
