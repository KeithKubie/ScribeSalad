one of those exciting things that's

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150
one of those exciting things that's
 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.940
one of those exciting things that's
going on at NASA right now is that we

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950
going on at NASA right now is that we
 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.830
going on at NASA right now is that we
have a probe that's actually orbiting

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840
have a probe that's actually orbiting
 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.350
have a probe that's actually orbiting
very close to the Sun and over the next

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360
very close to the Sun and over the next
 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.850
very close to the Sun and over the next
year's it's going to get closer and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860
year's it's going to get closer and
 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.920
year's it's going to get closer and
closer and closer it's called the Parker

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930
closer and closer it's called the Parker
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.020
closer and closer it's called the Parker
solar probe and the catch phrase sort of

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030
solar probe and the catch phrase sort of
 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.000
solar probe and the catch phrase sort of
the mission motto is a mission to touch

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010
the mission motto is a mission to touch
 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.400
the mission motto is a mission to touch
the Sun and that sounds incredibly

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410
the Sun and that sounds incredibly
 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.620
the Sun and that sounds incredibly
dramatic I should probably quantify that

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630
dramatic I should probably quantify that
 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.820
dramatic I should probably quantify that
a bit we're not actually touching the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830
a bit we're not actually touching the
 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.890
a bit we're not actually touching the
surface of the Sun but the Sun has an

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900
surface of the Sun but the Sun has an
 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.810
surface of the Sun but the Sun has an
atmosphere of gas around it I mean

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820
atmosphere of gas around it I mean
 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.979
atmosphere of gas around it I mean
almost like the earth has an atmosphere

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989
almost like the earth has an atmosphere
 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.650
almost like the earth has an atmosphere
it's called the corona and the corona

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660
it's called the corona and the corona
 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.050

the corona getting into a fairly close

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880
the corona getting into a fairly close
 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.790
the corona getting into a fairly close
part now that doesn't sound so close

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800
part now that doesn't sound so close

it's gonna get within about four million

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210
it's gonna get within about four million
 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.569
it's gonna get within about four million
miles away from the Sun but the Sun

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579
miles away from the Sun but the Sun
 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.510
miles away from the Sun but the Sun
itself is nearly a million miles across

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520
itself is nearly a million miles across
 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.540
itself is nearly a million miles across
about 900,000 miles across so this is

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550
about 900,000 miles across so this is
 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.069
about 900,000 miles across so this is
actually getting just about four times

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079
actually getting just about four times
 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.049
actually getting just about four times
the diameter of the Sun away which is

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059
the diameter of the Sun away which is
 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.940
the diameter of the Sun away which is
really pretty close it's by far the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950
really pretty close it's by far the
 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.649
really pretty close it's by far the
closest object that humanity has ever

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659
closest object that humanity has ever
 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.690

years is gonna orbit around 24 times and

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369
years is gonna orbit around 24 times and
 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.309
years is gonna orbit around 24 times and
each time it's gonna get a little bit

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:11.319
each time it's gonna get a little bit
 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.620
each time it's gonna get a little bit
closer to the Sun and in order to

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630
closer to the Sun and in order to
 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.910
closer to the Sun and in order to
survive that in order to have enough

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920
survive that in order to have enough
 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.770
survive that in order to have enough
speed to actually escape the Sun's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780
speed to actually escape the Sun's
 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.629
speed to actually escape the Sun's
gravity and come out again it's gonna go

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639
gravity and come out again it's gonna go
 

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.489
gravity and come out again it's gonna go
faster and faster all the time as well

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499
faster and faster all the time as well
 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.249
faster and faster all the time as well
so and it's fastest in a few years from

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259
so and it's fastest in a few years from
 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.019
so and it's fastest in a few years from
now the Parker Solar Probe will be going

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029
now the Parker Solar Probe will be going
 

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:28.379
now the Parker Solar Probe will be going
nearly 400,000 miles an hour as it loops

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389
nearly 400,000 miles an hour as it loops
 

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.059
nearly 400,000 miles an hour as it loops
around the Sun and then comes right back

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069
around the Sun and then comes right back
 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.399
around the Sun and then comes right back
out again that's by far the fastest

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409
out again that's by far the fastest
 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.230
out again that's by far the fastest
speed that any human-made spacecraft has

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240
speed that any human-made spacecraft has
 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.730
speed that any human-made spacecraft has
ever attained that's going to be very

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740
ever attained that's going to be very
 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.389
ever attained that's going to be very
exciting

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399
exciting
 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.999
exciting
so each perihelion is a little closer

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009
so each perihelion is a little closer
 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.399
so each perihelion is a little closer
and a little faster and then the orbit

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409
and a little faster and then the orbit
 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.050
and a little faster and then the orbit
takes it out close to the planet Venus

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060
takes it out close to the planet Venus
 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.239
takes it out close to the planet Venus
and the planet Venus actually helps

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249
and the planet Venus actually helps
 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.160
and the planet Venus actually helps
interestingly enough it helps Parker

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170
interestingly enough it helps Parker
 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.620
interestingly enough it helps Parker
lose energy in order to get closer and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630
lose energy in order to get closer and
 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.779
lose energy in order to get closer and
closer to the Sun Parker has to lose

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789
closer to the Sun Parker has to lose
 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.999
closer to the Sun Parker has to lose
some of its own rotational energy and

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009
some of its own rotational energy and
 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.279
some of its own rotational energy and
when it loses energy can drop in a

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289
when it loses energy can drop in a
 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.709
when it loses energy can drop in a
little closer all the time so over the

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719
little closer all the time so over the
 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.330
little closer all the time so over the
next year's you're going to see our

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340
next year's you're going to see our
 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.039
next year's you're going to see our
spacecraft get a little closer each time

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049
spacecraft get a little closer each time
 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.499
spacecraft get a little closer each time
and go a little faster each time it goes

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509
and go a little faster each time it goes
 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.959
and go a little faster each time it goes
around the Sun now what are we looking

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969
around the Sun now what are we looking
 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.790
around the Sun now what are we looking
for why are we actually flying a

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800
for why are we actually flying a
 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.430
for why are we actually flying a
spacecraft as close to the Sun well the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440
spacecraft as close to the Sun well the
 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.290
spacecraft as close to the Sun well the
corona the atmosphere around the Sun is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
corona the atmosphere around the Sun is
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.610
corona the atmosphere around the Sun is
actually one of the biggest mysteries in

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620
actually one of the biggest mysteries in
 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.790
actually one of the biggest mysteries in
our solar system it's extremely hot the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800
our solar system it's extremely hot the
 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.820
our solar system it's extremely hot the
gas around the Sun is

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830
gas around the Sun is
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.920
gas around the Sun is
millions of degrees and that's rather

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
millions of degrees and that's rather
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.690
millions of degrees and that's rather
strange because the surface of the Sun

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700
strange because the surface of the Sun
 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.540
strange because the surface of the Sun
itself is only about 10,000 degrees so

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550
itself is only about 10,000 degrees so
 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.820
itself is only about 10,000 degrees so
how can the gas above the surface be

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830
how can the gas above the surface be
 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.860
how can the gas above the surface be
that much hotter than the surface itself

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870
that much hotter than the surface itself
 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.530
that much hotter than the surface itself
kind of the analogy we use at NASA is

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540
kind of the analogy we use at NASA is
 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.210
kind of the analogy we use at NASA is
picture yourself around a campfire at

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220
picture yourself around a campfire at
 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.830
picture yourself around a campfire at
night and you're enjoying the warmth of

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840
night and you're enjoying the warmth of
 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.810
night and you're enjoying the warmth of
the campfire but then as you walk away

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820
the campfire but then as you walk away
 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.740
the campfire but then as you walk away
from the fire

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750
from the fire
 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.540
from the fire
it becomes hotter and hotter as you go

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550
it becomes hotter and hotter as you go
 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.640
it becomes hotter and hotter as you go
away and burns you to a crisp five miles

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650
away and burns you to a crisp five miles
 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.500
away and burns you to a crisp five miles
out you know that doesn't work it's a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510
out you know that doesn't work it's a
 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.700
out you know that doesn't work it's a
very strange way of thinking about

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710
very strange way of thinking about
 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.310
very strange way of thinking about
temperature so something's going on with

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320
temperature so something's going on with
 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.290
temperature so something's going on with
the corona it may have to do with the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300
the corona it may have to do with the
 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.910
the corona it may have to do with the
sun's complex magnetic field

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920
sun's complex magnetic field
 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.320
sun's complex magnetic field
maybe the magnetic field is shooting

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330
maybe the magnetic field is shooting
 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.450
maybe the magnetic field is shooting
particles up into it it may have to do

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460
particles up into it it may have to do
 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.850
particles up into it it may have to do
with shockwaves even the Sun vibrating

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860
with shockwaves even the Sun vibrating
 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.590
with shockwaves even the Sun vibrating
actually giving energy to the gas above

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600
actually giving energy to the gas above
 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.900
actually giving energy to the gas above
it there's many different ideas and

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910
it there's many different ideas and
 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.910
it there's many different ideas and
theories as to why the corona is so hot

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920
theories as to why the corona is so hot
 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.070
theories as to why the corona is so hot
but right now we don't have a great way

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080
but right now we don't have a great way
 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.510
but right now we don't have a great way
to tell which is right and which isn't

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520
to tell which is right and which isn't
 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.400
to tell which is right and which isn't
so when we're there and actually

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410
so when we're there and actually
 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.230
so when we're there and actually
measuring how fast the particles are

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240
measuring how fast the particles are
 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.000
measuring how fast the particles are
going you know the different particles

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010
going you know the different particles
 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.330
going you know the different particles
you find how dense or how rarefied that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340
you find how dense or how rarefied that
 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.160
you find how dense or how rarefied that
gases around the Sun we'll have a much

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170
gases around the Sun we'll have a much
 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.840
gases around the Sun we'll have a much
better idea which of those theories are

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850
better idea which of those theories are
 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.420
better idea which of those theories are
true the Parker Solar Probe to me is

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430
true the Parker Solar Probe to me is
 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.400
true the Parker Solar Probe to me is
also a marvel of modern engineering I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410
also a marvel of modern engineering I
 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.750
also a marvel of modern engineering I
mean think about how are you gonna get a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
mean think about how are you gonna get a
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.340
mean think about how are you gonna get a
spacecraft that close to the Sun and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350
spacecraft that close to the Sun and
 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.229
spacecraft that close to the Sun and
have it survive and not burn up well the

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239
have it survive and not burn up well the
 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.880

very thick it's actually only about six

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980
very thick it's actually only about six
 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.770
very thick it's actually only about six
inches thick and it's made of a carbon

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780
inches thick and it's made of a carbon

incredibly that heat shield is still
 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.900
incredibly that heat shield is still
gonna get up to about 2,500 degrees

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910
gonna get up to about 2,500 degrees
 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.940
gonna get up to about 2,500 degrees
Fahrenheit so it's gonna get very very

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950
Fahrenheit so it's gonna get very very
 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.310
Fahrenheit so it's gonna get very very
hot but that will protect the rest of

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320
hot but that will protect the rest of
 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.350
hot but that will protect the rest of
the spacecraft from the radiation coming

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360
the spacecraft from the radiation coming
 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.870

from the Sun and the angle has to be
 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.640
from the Sun and the angle has to be
just right you always have to have the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650
just right you always have to have the
 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.470
just right you always have to have the
heat shield right in between the Sun and

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480
heat shield right in between the Sun and
 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.970

the rest of the spacecraft the rest of
 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.320
the rest of the spacecraft the rest of
the spacecraft has to be in its shadow

the spacecraft has to be in its shadow
 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.140
the spacecraft has to be in its shadow
or it will fry and we actually can't

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150
or it will fry and we actually can't
 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.540
or it will fry and we actually can't
send commands up to Parker often enough

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550
send commands up to Parker often enough
 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.090
send commands up to Parker often enough
to make sure it's exactly lined up so

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100
to make sure it's exactly lined up so
 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.009
to make sure it's exactly lined up so
Parker is a very autonomous spacecraft

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019
Parker is a very autonomous spacecraft
 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.229
Parker is a very autonomous spacecraft
it's constantly detecting what its angle

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239
it's constantly detecting what its angle
 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.790
it's constantly detecting what its angle
is relative to the Sun and correcting

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800
is relative to the Sun and correcting
 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.620
is relative to the Sun and correcting
that so in some ways it's one of the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630
that so in some ways it's one of the
 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.719
that so in some ways it's one of the
most autonomous spacecraft yet launched

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729
most autonomous spacecraft yet launched
 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.460
most autonomous spacecraft yet launched
one of the things I think is kind of

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470
one of the things I think is kind of
 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.870
one of the things I think is kind of
funny about the design is it does use

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880
funny about the design is it does use
 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.729
funny about the design is it does use
solar power that makes sense you're very

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739
solar power that makes sense you're very
 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.409
solar power that makes sense you're very
close to the Sun but it has these really

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419
close to the Sun but it has these really
 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.270
close to the Sun but it has these really
really dinky little solar panels off to

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280
really dinky little solar panels off to
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.770
really dinky little solar panels off to
the side because when you're that close

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780
the side because when you're that close
 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.300
the side because when you're that close
to the Sun you don't need big solar

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310
to the Sun you don't need big solar
 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.969
to the Sun you don't need big solar
panels so at the end of Parker Solar

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979
panels so at the end of Parker Solar
 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.380
panels so at the end of Parker Solar
probes mission we will have this thing

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390
probes mission we will have this thing
 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.580
probes mission we will have this thing
orbiting closer to the Sun than we've

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590
orbiting closer to the Sun than we've
 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.350
orbiting closer to the Sun than we've
ever been before going faster than we

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360
ever been before going faster than we
 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.570
ever been before going faster than we
ever have before and maybe we'll finally

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580
ever have before and maybe we'll finally
 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.940
ever have before and maybe we'll finally
have some idea why this Corona this

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950
have some idea why this Corona this
 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.920
