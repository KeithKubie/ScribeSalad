Language: en

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.890
MALE SPEAKER: So welcome back.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.470
We're here at Devoxx with Seth
Ladd, and we're here to talk

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.310
about Dart.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.890
So welcome, Seth, to Devoxx.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.290
So this is your first time?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.870
SETH LADD: This is
awesome, yeah.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.760
Thanks for having me.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.970
MALE SPEAKER: Working
well for you?

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.570
So you just presented on Dart.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.060
So for those people that have
been living in a cave or under

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.780
a rock, can you give us a quick
intro on Dart and how

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.840
you call this a new language
for the web.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.180
And it's one thing that I found
interesting is that it's

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.080
meant to be enterprising.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.510
So if you can elaborate on that,
I'd love to hear you.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.460
SETH LADD: Well, sure.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.880
The quick version of Dart is--

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.000
one of our goals
is to help more

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
developers come to the Web.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.730
And you've got experienced
developers on platforms like

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.570
Java and ActionScript, C++,
C#, that really love the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.650
exciting power of HTML5 in the
modern browser, but would like

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.200
to build those apps in a
language and with a set of

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.200
tools that feels more familiar,
productive, and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.420
powerful to them.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.090
And so this is certainly what
attracted me as someone who's

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.489
come from a Java structured
background and moved to web

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.319
programming.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.792
I think it's going to attract
a lot of developers as well.

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:09.216
Yes.

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:11.860
MALE SPEAKER: So the language
part is meant to be

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.280
unsurprising, so do you
want to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.910
SETH LADD: Yeah.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.180
There's two main core tenets
of the Dart project.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.840
One is that it has to be
recognizable and familiar.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.940
The second is that it must
compile to logical and sane

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.540
JavaScript.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.890
But in terms of the language
being familiar, this is not

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.480
the opportunity to develop
the world's next

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.430
Haskell, for instance.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.820
This is an opportunity for us
to, again, reach out to the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.460
existing legions of developers
on all these different

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.730
platforms and say, here's
something that you can jump on

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.400
very easily, very quickly, you
feel safe and comfortable

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.770
with, and still deploy to the
modern web with HTML5.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.020
And so it was a critical
decision at the early parts of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.500
the project to make something
people can within an hour or

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.640
two get up and running.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.910
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.280
As people have understood,
I think, it's not just a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.870
language, it's a platform.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.320
So there's the language, there
are tools around it.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.130
There are testing tools.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.340
Can you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.650
SETH LADD: Certainly.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.070
You're absolutely right.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.750
It's much more than just the
language, although that's an

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.380
interesting part of it.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.690
But we also have things like
a full editor with code

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.930
completion, and refactoring,
and quick fixes, and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.230
debugging, and outlines--
again, trying to make a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.860
familiar tool ability story to
the developers out there.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.000
We also have a package manager,
Pub, so you can

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.290
discover and install and
update your third party

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.260
dependencies We have a wide
range of libraries that come

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.520
built into the SDK.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.770
Certainly, the core libraries
like collections, and dates,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.220
and stuff, but also the
libraries like unittesting,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.570
and mocks, and JSON.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.680
And the list goes on and on.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.860
So all this comes out
of the box as well.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.880
We also have a virtual machine,
so you can run Dart

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.480
programs natively on a Dart VM,
which is really important

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.810
when you do your development
cycle.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.960
You want to just write some code
and hit Reload, and it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.600
just pops right up
in your web page.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.950
This is the kind of experience
that web developers have had

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.940
since the beginning
of time and it's

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.920
fantastic for iteration.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.790
And then we also have a compiler
to JavaScript so that

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.020
when you're done testing your
app on the virtual machine and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.050
you're ready to ship to
production browsers that don't

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.160
Dart VM, you can run Dart
to JS, the compiler to

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.010
JavaScript, and then deploy that
out and actually run Dart

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.345
across the modern web on
modern web browsers.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:20.400
MALE SPEAKER: So if we step
back and we look at HTML5,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.040
which is this buzzword which
encompasses a lot of different

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.010
technologies and their
frameworks and JavaScript,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.090
such as Backbone.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.860
There are so many of them, and
Angular is probably a very

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.350
popular one.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.960
Can you try to position and
explain how they relate to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.640
Dart, to a platform like Dart?

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.520
SETH LADD: Well, sure.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.480
I think it's a really good
sign that the JavaScript

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.040
community is now embracing these
more structured ways to

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.280
build Web apps.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.910
As we need to continue to
innovate and deliver the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.420
really fantastic, high fidelity,
complex, silky

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.430
smooth experiences that
users demand,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.100
we need more structure.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.700
I think we need the frameworks
out there.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.360
So that's really cool.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.390
So you mentioned Backbone.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.110
Backbone is a simple
way to construct

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.500
your models and views.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.880
Angular puts a lot of the data
binding into your actual HTML,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.890
which is really cool.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.930
But ultimately, at the end of
the day, they're still running

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.600
on top of JavaScript,
which for a ton

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.830
of people is fantastic.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.120
But for developers familiar in
other languages, we want to

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.880
give them a fantastic web
development experience.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.370
And so we talked about
the language and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.209
libraries and tools.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.610
But we're also building to help
them actually use it to

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.089
build modern Web apps.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.810
We're building out
Web components--

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.930
capabilities.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.610
And this gives you the two
way data binding, the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.560
encapsulation of styles,
behavior, and structure, the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.760
ability for you to extend
HTML classes.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.020
Like, you can extend button
and create fancy button,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.000
create your own custom
elements.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.430
And this is all stuff being
baked into the web platform

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.440
today by the browser vendors.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.630
But we can use our compiler to
JavaScript to actually make

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.545
the future of web components
available today and deploy in

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:49.310
modern browsers today.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.310
So it's really, really cool.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.070
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.370
So talking about browsers and
maybe future browsers, when

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.180
can we expect something that
actually comes with a Dart VM?

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.340
Maybe performance that is
a great motivation.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.990
SETH LADD: Yeah.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.070
The VM is a great development
and debugging story.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.700
Very quick iterations, but
there's also a performance

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.630
story there as well.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.240
We use a system called
Snapshots, that have about of

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.460
10x performance increase for
start up time, because it

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.490
doesn't have to reparse
the source code.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.840
It can start from the binary,
serialized snapshot.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.320
But there's also a story
around just the raw

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.710
computation performance
of the Dart VM.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.880
We're already beating
V8 on a bunch of

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.270
different benchmarks, and--

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.350
MALE SPEAKER: You know a
thing or two about V8.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.370
It's the same people.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.930
SETH LADD: Yeah, that's the
really cool thing, right?

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.840
If anybody knows speed, it's
these original developers that

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.990
did V8 and Hotspot and now
they're working on Dart.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.150
I mean, that that's
a good sign.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.650
But it's super early there, but
we have optimistic about

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.610
the performance getting
better.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.630
And as far as actually landing
in browsers, we still have

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.200
work to do.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.630
We have a build of Chromium
with a Dart VM in it.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.720
So it all works today, but we
have more stability work to go

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.980
to prove to the Chrome guys
that his is something that

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.870
they want to put in.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.590
And then as far as the other
browsers, I think the

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.470
important thing to remember is
Dart's success is really tied

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.090
to developer success.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.130
So if developers using Dart
develop really awesome HTML5

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.370
modern apps and they're
compiling to JavaScript with

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.590
Dart, then that's a win.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.790
If Dart just brings in more
developers to the Web

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.700
platform, that's good
for everybody.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.120
MALE SPEAKER: So you mentioned
performance.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.260
Can you talk about maybe
adoption and where we are in

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.740
the road map and milestone
one [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.480
Does it mean the language
is actually

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.625
stable completely now?

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:31.000
SETH LADD: It's pretty stable.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.530
So about a year ago, we had a
technology preview, and we

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.690
listened to a lot of feedback.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.650
We love the community
feedback.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.820
And then we had the M1 launch,
which was our first public

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.440
beta of the SDK.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.880
And the language is
fairly stable.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.950
We don't anticipate any
backwards breaking changes

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.240
unless we run into
some massive bug.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.160
We do anticipate new language
features as long as they don't

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.810
break backwards compatibility.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.230
And then the future milestone
releases as we kind of march

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.420
towards a 1.0, we'll be working
on things like the

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.080
maturity of the platform, adding
in a couple of new

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.470
language features, better
performance, library

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.250
refactoring factoring.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.170
So we're not at 1.0 yet, but the
M1 was a great milestone.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.140
It's like, hey, developers,
you can now come check out

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.360
Dart, and we're not going to
rip up the language on you

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.790
underneath.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.420
MALE SPEAKER: So we're
looking at six-week

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.890
cycles, releasing updates?

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.570
SETH LADD: I'm not exactly sure
what we've committed to,

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.960
but it does look like that
we're going to have a

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.430
Chromesque or Firefoxesque fast
iteration cycle and get

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.840
these new releases out
to developers.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.300
We do push a new build every
week, which is really great.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.270
But I think the milestones are
going to come pretty quickly,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.860
which is nice.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.010
MALE SPEAKER: OK, great Any
final thoughts on what the

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.745
next year will look like and
what you want developers--

00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:42.770
other try Dart, what kind of
feedback you're looking for?

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.520
SETH LADD: We're really looking
for feedback on web

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.600
components.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.710
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
a good time.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.345
SETH LADD: Web components
is a big thing that

00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:48.110
we're working on.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.040
And again, this is going to
come down the web platform

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.340
anyway, but we're making this
available to developers.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.860
Thanks for your compiling
to JavaScript.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.990
And just keep working on
libraries that publish into

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.330
Pub or Package Manager.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.200
I mean, this has helped
really everyone get

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.490
up and running by--

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.090
I mean, what's the best
productivity enhancement?

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.560
That is not to write code.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.200
So if you can use other people's
code and use other

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.305
packages, it's fantastic.

00:08:08.305 --> 00:08:09.910
So give those a shot.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.220
Join us on the mailing list.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.950
We're on Google+.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.790
And we're an open source
project, and so you can jump

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.930
right into the issue tracker
and just file bugs.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.520
It's all good.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.100
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.000
Stack Overflow,
[? mailing list? ?]

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.270
SETH LADD: Stack Overflow
is really good.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.740
Stack Overflow I'd probably
prefer, but numerous ways to

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.750
get ahold of this.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.473
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
where people are.

00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:26.830
SETH LADD: We're very eager
to hear the feedback.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.430
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.670
Well, I guess that's all the
time we have for it.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.980
Thanks, Seth.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.700
Good luck for the rest.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.850
SETH LADD: Thank
you very much.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.100
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
