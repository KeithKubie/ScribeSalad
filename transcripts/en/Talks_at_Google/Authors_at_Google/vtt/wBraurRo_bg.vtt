00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:07.110
FRANK OSTASESKI:
Some of you know

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.930
that I helped to start a
program called the Zen Hospice

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.150
Project in San Francisco
many years ago now.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.482
And we didn't have
much of a plan for it.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.190
We just thought there
was a natural match

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.439
between people who were
cultivating what we might call

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.820
the listening mind through
meditation practice,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.395
or the listening
heart, and people

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:25.770
who needed to be heard at
least once in their life, folks

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.069
who were dying.

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.610
And we worked mostly with people
living on the streets of San

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.559
Francisco.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.350
And I'll tell you more
about that as we go.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.790
But I retired from that
some years ago now,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.360
and started another organization
called the Metta Institute.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.830
"Metta" is an old Buddhist word.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.650
It means loving-kindness
or friendliness.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.220
And because I couldn't
think of a quality

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.465
which was more necessary
at the time of dying--

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:51.090
for the person in
the bed or the person

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.230
making the bed than
loving-kindness, than love.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.400
So that's the sort of
background I come to you from.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.110
But what I want to start
by saying is, don't wait.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.720
Don't wait.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.520
Waiting is full of expectation.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.430
Waiting for the next moment
to come, we miss this one.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.930
I can't tell you
how many times I've

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.890
been with folks, family
members, people who are dying,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.640
who have said to me
in one way or another,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.765
when is Mom going to die?

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:24.370
In waiting for that moment,
they missed all the moments

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.630
in between.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.010
So don't wait.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.780
That's my first counsel.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.385
I was at the bedside of one of
our patients at the hospice.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:38.320
I turned him on his side,
and I was washing his back.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.260
And as I was washing his back,
he turned to me and he said,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.350
I never thought it
would be like this.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.310
And I said, what?

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.130
And he said, dying.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.220
And I said, well, what did
you think it would be like?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.730
And he said, I never
thought about it.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.390
And you see, in that
moment, that realization

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.220
was a cause of greater
suffering for him

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.990
than his terminal lung cancer.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.282
He'd been caught by
surprise by death, really.

00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:07.990
Death is the elephant
in the room, right?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.380
It's the thing we
all agree exists,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.540
but refuse to talk about.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.300
We project our
worst fears onto it.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.600
We do our best to use
euphemisms around it,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.416
or we try to avoid the
subject all together.

00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:25.967
Well, we can run,
but we cannot hide.

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:28.300
There's a beautiful, old
story, an old Babylonian myth--

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.550
some of you may know it--

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.550
about this merchant
who sends his servant

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.702
to the marketplace to get
the supplies for the house.

00:02:35.702 --> 00:02:37.830
And while the servant
is in the marketplace,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.440
he's moving through the crowds
and a woman bumps into him.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.480
And he turns.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.040
And he recognizes
that she's death.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.860
And so he gets really terrified.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.050
And he runs back home.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.180
And he tells the merchant.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.637
He said, I was in
the marketplace.

00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:54.470
This thing happened.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.511
I bumped into this woman.

00:02:55.511 --> 00:02:57.160
I recognized her as death.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.170
And she gave me this terrifying
look, this really threatening

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.760
look.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.220
And he said, so please,
lend me your horse,

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.900
so I can ride away from here
today and escape my fate.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.420
I will ride to Samarra.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.147
And there, death
will not find me.

00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:15.730
So the merchant says,
sure, of course.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.313
Take my horse.

00:03:16.313 --> 00:03:19.727
And the guy rides off in a fury.

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:22.060
Then later, the merchant
himself, he goes to the market.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.830
There, he runs into death.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.377
And he says, hey, how come you
scared my servant like that?

00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:27.710
That was a terrible thing to do.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.140
Why did you do that?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.940
Death says, oh, that wasn't
a threatening gesture.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.980
That was just a
look of surprise.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.249
I was astonished to
see him here in Baghdad

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.540
when I knew that tonight, I
had an appointment with him

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.170
in Samarra.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.270
We can run, but we cannot hide.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.060
So over the past 30
years or so, I've

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.760
spent a lot of time
sitting bedside with people

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.240
who are dying, probably a couple
of thousand of them, actually.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.570
And some of them died
full of disappointment.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.310
They turned toward the wall
in withdrawal and depression,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.250
and they never came back again.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.350
And some of them blossomed
and found kindness,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.340
and forgiveness, and
love that they had been

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.589
looking for their whole lives.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.370
Both of them were my teachers.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.029
Yeah.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.905
Both of them were my teachers.

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:23.780
And what seemed to really
make the difference

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.190
was the willingness to live
into what it means to be human,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.820
into the deeper dimensions
of what it means to be human.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.310
So today, I don't have a
PowerPoint presentation.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.600
I don't have the seven
steps to an easy death.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.270
But what I'd like to
do is kind of invite

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.570
us to sit down with death, and
have a cup of tea with her,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.850
and get to know her
really well, and see

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.640
how she might help
us understand how

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.620
to live a more
meaningful, purposeful,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.580
perhaps loving and wise life.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.410
I think we can learn
a lot of things

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.000
about living fully from
getting comfortable with death.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.060
Now, for me, death is the
kind of secret teacher

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.689
hiding in plain sight.

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.480
You know, we think
about death as something

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.610
that will happen at
the end of a long road.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.354
You know?

00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:15.770
But death is with
us all the time,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.380
in the marrow of every passing
moment, in this moment.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.550
And as a secret teacher,
she can show us,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.754
in a way, what matters most.

00:05:26.754 --> 00:05:28.170
And the good news
is we don't have

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.170
to wait until the time
of our dying to find out.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.670
Now, some of the
folks I work with,

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.539
they lived on the
edges of society.

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.080
They lived on the
margins of society.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.550
And they didn't trust much.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.490
And if I was going to
be of any value to them,

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.520
I had to be real.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.050
And that meant that I
had to do my homework.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.339
If you say to someone who tells
you that they're afraid and you

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.630
say, I understand, and you
haven't done your homework--

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.921
you don't know what happens
to you when you're afraid--

00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:59.370
then they will yell bullshit.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.070
And they will know that
you're just guessing.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.080
And they will sniff
out your sentimentality

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.910
and your insincerity.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.810
So some of the
folks I worked with,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.670
they came from cultures
that I didn't know,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.672
speaking languages that
I couldn't understand.

00:06:14.672 --> 00:06:16.380
There was this wonderful
man, I remember,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.110
[VIETNAMESE] a Vietnamese man.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.910
And he was really
scared of ghosts.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.040
He was so terrified of ghosts.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.000
And his roommate-- his
roommate's name was Isaiah.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.840
Isaiah was an
African-American man.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.180
And he was very comforted
by nightly visits

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.300
from his dead mother.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.190
Yeah?

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.665
And these guys were roommates.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.150
There was folks I worked
with in their 20s who barely

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.820
had started their
lives, and Elizabeth,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.300
who at 93 said to me, why has
death come for me so soon?

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.330
There was a man I worked with.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
He was a hemophiliac.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.440
And he worked in a
foundry in East Bay.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.240
And a tough guy, you know,
a real hard-nosed guy.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.240
And he contracted the HIV
virus from a blood transfusion.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.450
But what was really unusual
about his situation was

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.140
that six months before, when
his son called him to tell him

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.650
that he was gay and that he
was now infected with HIV,

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.065
the father hung up the phone.

00:07:18.065 --> 00:07:21.090
He wouldn't talk to him.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.210
And now, father and son
were in the same room

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.660
in twin beds being
cared for by Agnes,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.400
the son's mother and
the father's wife.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.660
There was a guy,
Alex, that I worked

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.230
with who got confused
with some dementia,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.917
and he climbed out
onto his fire escape,

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.250
and he froze to death one night.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.950
All these folks were
my teachers, yeah.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.690
Now in Zen, we have
this expression

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.440
that when your teacher's in
the room, it keeps you honest.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.170
And so I brought my
teachers with me.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.240
And so what I'd like
to do in just a moment

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.120
is I'm going to ask Van to
put up some photos of them

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.890
on the screens.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.050
And these are ordinary
folks, folks like you

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.727
and I, who have all died
now, people I looked after

00:08:10.727 --> 00:08:11.310
and cared for.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.226
These are my teachers.

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.730
And so if they're here in the
room, they really help me.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.938
They really support me a lot.

00:08:15.938 --> 00:08:18.390
And I think they might
be of value to you.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.327
Now, as you watch
these photos, I'd

00:08:22.327 --> 00:08:24.660
like to suggest that you watch
them in a particular way.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.680
This is not my deck.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.734
This is not a video
that we watch passively.

00:08:27.734 --> 00:08:29.400
These are real people
who have something

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.080
useful to share with you.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.140
And so in order to
really benefit from that,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.650
I think what would be
helpful is if you don't look

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.900
at them in an ordinary
way, that you don't

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.419
look at them in the way you
normally look at a screen,

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.960
but instead, you turn
inward a little bit more

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.360
and settle into your
body, heart, and mind,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.310
and see, as you look
at the slides, what's

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.942
happening in your body.

00:08:51.942 --> 00:08:54.150
What are the real sensations
that are going on there?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.690
And what are the honest
feelings in your heart

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.300
if you don't turn
away from anything?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.730
And what goes on in your mind?

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.550
If you walked into your mind and
looked at the activity there,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.480
what's happening in your mind as
you're looking at these slides?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.310
And then, two questions.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.360
What attracts you?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.220
And what causes
you to pull away?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.380
What attracts you and what
causes you to pull away?

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.840
That's the two most important
questions to answer.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.380
And that's about you.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.630
It's not about them.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.680
VAN: You want it now?

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.320
FRANK OSTASESKI: Just a minute.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.510
So yeah, let's put
them up now, Van.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.020
Let's put those slides up now.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.210
And we're just going to
leave them up on a loop

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.020
so that they just will move
as I'm speaking to you.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.400
And so they're going to teach,
and I'm going to translate, OK?

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.020
That's how it's going to work.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.450
So look and see.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.040
What attracts you or
causes you to pull away?

00:09:47.745 --> 00:09:49.120
You know, the
habits of our life,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.370
they have a very
strong momentum.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.080
And that momentum
carries through right

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.115
into the time of our dying.

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:56.740
So the question that
arises, of course,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.600
is, well, what habits
do we want to create?

00:10:03.595 --> 00:10:05.970
I worked with a lot of people
near the end of their life,

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.790
and many of them died
full of fear and distress.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.632
And I think we can do
something about that.

00:10:11.632 --> 00:10:13.090
And I think the
way we do something

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.970
about that is by really
looking at what's

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.930
inviting in the wisdom of
death to help us understand

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.790
how to live this life with
some degree of integrity.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.820
I mean, suppose we stopped
compartmentalizing death,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.070
cutting it off from life.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.980
I mean, imagine if
we regarded death

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.010
as the final stage
of growth instead

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.825
of a wasting-away experience.

00:10:39.825 --> 00:10:41.450
I mean, could we then
turn toward death

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.080
and say, how then shall I live?

00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:49.190
I think without a
reminder of death,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.610
we tend to take
life for granted.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.120
We get caught up in our
everyday preoccupations.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.030
But when we keep death
really close at hand

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.380
at our fingertips, I think
we don't hold on so tightly.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.480
I think we let go a
little bit more easily.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.820
I think we don't take ourselves
or our ideas so seriously.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.642
And I think this engenders
a certain kind of kindness

00:11:11.642 --> 00:11:14.100
for each other when we recognize
that we're all on the boat

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.599
together.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.870
But in this culture, we tend
to treat death predominantly

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.530
as a medical event, and we
turn it over to medicine.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.090
And I want good medicine.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.450
You know?

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.965
I want great pain control
and symptom management

00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:32.590
when I'm dying.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:37.237
But dying is too big for
the medical model alone.

00:11:37.237 --> 00:11:39.570
We need to bring the best of
what medicine has to offer,

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.620
but I'm not sure we should
let it drive the bus.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.810
I think the experience
of dying is so much more

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.660
profound that it dwarfs
all models, including

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.590
most religious models.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.800
Dying is inevitable
and intimate.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.730
Now, I said this.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.329
I was at a dinner party with a
bunch of Silicon Valley folks

00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:05.120
a little while ago.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.203
And I said that, dying is
inevitable and intimate.

00:12:07.203 --> 00:12:08.969
And a guy raised his
hand immediately.

00:12:08.969 --> 00:12:11.010
And he said, well, I don't
know about inevitable.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.590
He said, we're working on that.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.520
And I said, great.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.150
Fantastic.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.254
Thank you.

00:12:16.254 --> 00:12:17.670
But you know, let's
take death out

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.880
of the sentence for a minute.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.520
Let's just talk about endings.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.732
How do you mean endings?

00:12:21.732 --> 00:12:23.940
Like the endings in your
life, the end of a sentence,

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.137
the end of a meal, the
end of a relationship,

00:12:26.137 --> 00:12:26.970
the end of your day.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.649
How do you meet endings?

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:31.190
And I don't have some kind of
moral standard about how you're

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.380
supposed to do
that, but I do know

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.680
that the way in which we
meet endings to a large part

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.550
shapes the way the
next thing begins.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.330
And so by looking at the way
we meet endings, not only

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.620
do we understand something
about our day-to-day life,

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.310
but I think it becomes the
best preparation for dying.

00:12:51.087 --> 00:12:53.420
Regularly, I saw in the people
that I was working with--

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.320
and I changed diapers on park
benches behind City Hall.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.950
These folks who had supposedly
no inner life, you know?

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.290
They regularly
met the experience

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.920
of dying, which they felt was
unbearable and unimaginable

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.670
to them--

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:13.260
they regularly met it
in extraordinary ways.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.366
Now, sometimes
those turns happened

00:13:16.366 --> 00:13:18.240
in the final month of
life, or weeks of life,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.120
or sometimes even in the
final moments of life.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.170
Now, we might say too late.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.840
And I would agree,
it's too late, too

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.900
late to do that work at
the end of your life.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.550
But here's the thing.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.550
If that opportunity is
available to us then,

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.080
it's available to us now.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.680
And we don't need to
wait until that time.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.650
In fact, to imagine that
at the time of our death,

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.870
we will have the
physical strength,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.750
the emotional stability,
the mental clarity, to do

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.900
the work of a lifetime, is
a kind of ridiculous gamble,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.130
actually.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.690
It's not one I would advise.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.140
Rather, I think we can
harness an awareness of death

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.690
to help us appreciate the
fact that we're alive,

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:09.440
to encourage self-exploration,
to help us clarify our values,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.180
to find meaning to generate
positive action in the world.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.590
What becomes really
undeniable when

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.450
you sit with people
who are dying

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.260
is that fragility
and impermanence

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.000
are woven into the very
fabric of our existence.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.060
It's always coming together
and falling apart, and not

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.300
just at the time of our death.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.155
And it's possible to hold it
all with love and compassion.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.270
In my experience,
life's uncertainty

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.550
actually gives me perspective.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.250
As we come into contact with the
precariousness of this life--

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.740
it's absolutely precarious.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.160
Then, we also come into
contact with its preciousness.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.146
And then, we don't
want to waste a moment.

00:14:55.146 --> 00:14:57.270
Then, we want to jump into
our life with both feet.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.478
We want to tell the people
we love that we love them.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.170
We want to use our life
in a responsible way.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.190
So don't wait is a
pathway, I think,

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.650
to fulfillment and an
antidote to regret.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.800
And embracing the truth that
things inevitably will end

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.790
encourages us not to wait
in order to begin living.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.030
And instead of pinning our
hopes on some future outcome,

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.500
we focus more on the present
and being fully engaged

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.750
in our lives just as they are.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.140
Mostly, we imagine
death will come later.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.000
Right?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.240
Like, when I'm old.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:39.960
Well, I'm old.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.630
This idea of "later" gives
us this really comfortable,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.460
little illusion.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.400
Yeah.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.640
Death will come later.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.560
It's not going to come now.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.110
But change, constant
change is not later.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.640
Constant change is now.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.360
It's happening right now.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.270
Impermanence is the
essential truth woven

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.610
in every aspect of our life.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.800
Where is this
morning's breakfast?

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.180
Where is last
night's lovemaking?

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.060
Could someone please tell me,
where has my blond hair gone?

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.016
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:22.770
We know.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:23.610
Everybody knows.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.550
You know that one day, your
mother's treasured vase

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.470
is going to fall off
the shelf and break.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.850
It's going to happen.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.350
That your car's
going to break down.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:38.430
That someone we love will die.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.430
I think the challenge or
the encouragement that I'm

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.460
trying to offer is to move that
understanding from our heads

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.680
into our hearts.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.320
Impermanence isn't the
cause of suffering.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.120
We actually rely on change.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.950
We count on it.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.129
I mean, that cold you have
today, it won't last forever.

00:16:59.129 --> 00:17:00.920
That really boring
dinner party that you're

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.440
going to go to on Saturday
night, it will come to an end.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.109
Evil dictatorships will fall.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.869
Great trees will fall
and burn in our woods

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.250
to make room for new ones.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.250
Presidential terms
will come to an end.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.819
Without impermanence, we
couldn't lead our lives.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.430
Our son couldn't
take his first steps.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.650
Our daughter couldn't
grow up to be a scientist.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.860
You know, what's
kind of funny to me?

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.190
We pretty much all agree that
everything changes, right?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.570
Seasons come and go.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.740
Relationships come and go.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.230
We all agree, constant change.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.560
Everything is changing,
we think, except me.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.790
I'm the one thing, solid thing,
going through a changing world.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:48.290
Right?

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.664
I mean, I have friends that
come up to me and say, Frank,

00:17:50.664 --> 00:17:52.000
I haven't seen you in 20 years.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.083
You haven't changed a bit.

00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:55.204
And I'm really
insulted, you know?

00:17:55.204 --> 00:17:58.740
Things are changing
all the time.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.660
We tend to think of
ourself as some fixed

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.330
object going through life.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.760
But actually, we
are that change.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:12.858
We are like everything else,
at once here and disappearing.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:21.560
I was just in Japan for some
work and teaching there.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.465
And I happened to be there at
the height of cherry blossoms,

00:18:24.465 --> 00:18:30.150
the beautiful cherry blossoms
blooming everywhere, sakura.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.990
They're just gorgeous.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.940
And I'm going tomorrow
to Idaho, where

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.920
I teach in northern
Idaho, where there's

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.010
these little, tiny
blue flax flowers that

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.510
last for a single day.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.330
Tell me, what's so beautiful?

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.660
Why are those flowers, those
fragile cherry blossoms

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.770
and those so delicate
blue flax flowers,

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.900
why are they so much more
beautiful than plastic flowers?

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.760
I mean, isn't it their brevity
that is part of their beauty?

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.420
I mean, isn't the fact that we
know that they'll come and go,

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.416
doesn't that invite us into
wonder and to gratitude?

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.330
Death is not a stranger.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.200
It's always with us.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.840
This moment you're living
now, it will never come again.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.859
Never.

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:24.400
And no matter how
much you accomplish

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.690
or how many times
you do something,

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.023
there will come a time when
you do it for the last time.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.960
You have this one
opportunity to really fall

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.110
in love with existence.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.110
Why not really enjoy it?

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.500
I had a heart attack
a few years ago.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.800
I was teaching a retreat
for doctors and nurses

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.990
on compassion.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.990
And in the course of that
retreat, I had a heart attack.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.615
Actually, I didn't
have a heart attack.

00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:55.860
I had heart pain, which I
denied three times, actually.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.370
The first time, I thought
I had indigestion.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.037
I got some Tums.

00:19:59.037 --> 00:20:01.328
This is very common for people
who have a heart attack.

00:20:01.328 --> 00:20:03.770
The second time, I was
leading a guided meditation

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.453
on sensing the body.

00:20:05.453 --> 00:20:06.069
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.069 --> 00:20:08.610
And all these strong sensations
were moving through the body.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.943
And I thought, sensing, sensing.

00:20:12.107 --> 00:20:14.690
And the third time, I was in a
video conference with Ram Dass,

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:15.398
a friend of mine.

00:20:15.398 --> 00:20:17.370
He's an old, great
old spiritual teacher.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.870
And I love him.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.340
He's a very dear friend of mine.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.100
I was just with him last week.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.880
And I was getting a
little irritable with him,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.900
emotionally irritable.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.580
And it reminded me
of my wife when she

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.990
was giving birth to our son.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.573
She got a little
emotionally irritable

00:20:31.573 --> 00:20:34.610
when I started
suggesting things to her.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.560
And it was that
emotional irritability

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.030
that really got
my attention more

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.670
than the physical sensations.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.110
And I said to Ram
Dass, I'm sorry.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.610
I have to go now.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:44.570
You keep going.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:45.945
And they took me
to the hospital.

00:20:45.945 --> 00:20:47.630
And I had a heart
attack in the ER.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.140
I used to think I knew
something about dying,

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.224
and then I had a heart attack.

00:20:55.224 --> 00:20:57.140
And I realized I didn't
know very much at all.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.900
And that was a good thing.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.385
So now, I know a lot less,
and that's much more helpful.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.231
When I was recovering
from the surgery--

00:21:09.231 --> 00:21:10.980
and it took a long
time for me to recover,

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.410
about six months, because
they cut my phrenic nerve

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.170
by mistake, which meant
my diaphragm didn't work

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.827
and my lung didn't work.

00:21:20.827 --> 00:21:22.160
And so I was recovering at home.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.120
And a very famous Tibetan
teacher called me up, and--

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.220
I won't say who, but
this particular teacher

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.026
had trouble with his own heart.

00:21:31.026 --> 00:21:32.150
And so I thought, oh, good.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.930
He's going to know
what to do, right?

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.800
So I got him on the--
he called me up,

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.670
and I was on the phone with him.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.740
And I thought, he's going to
give me some esoteric practice

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.281
or something.

00:21:40.281 --> 00:21:41.990
It's going to be good, right?

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.835
And I said, how did
you deal with it?

00:21:44.835 --> 00:21:47.210
Like, all the depression which
is part of the experience,

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.530
and the feeling of helplessness,
and the sense of identity

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:52.550
just being wiped out.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.521
Like, how did you
deal with this?

00:21:55.521 --> 00:21:58.020
And there was this long pause
on the other end of the phone.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:05.930
And then he said, well, I think
it's good to have a heart.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.670
And then he said,
if you have a heart,

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.300
you should expect it
will have problems.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.300
And then he told me to
rest more and he hung up.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:13.970
That was it.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.500
I thought, no esoteric practice?

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.110
What?

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.360
But afterwards, I thought,
he's really right.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.270
If you have a heart, if
you have a human body,

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.730
you should expect it
will have problems.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.454
I mean, who said it
should be otherwise?

00:22:34.232 --> 00:22:36.440
If you have a heart, if you
have a human incarnation,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.060
a human life, you should
expect it will have problems.

00:22:45.046 --> 00:22:46.420
You know, there's
this phenomenon

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.060
that happens with
people who are diagnosed

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.730
with long-term
illnesses like cancer.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.795
A friend of mine calls
it a secret gratitude.

00:22:56.795 --> 00:22:59.439
It's really an interesting
phenomenon that happens.

00:22:59.439 --> 00:23:00.980
People with cancer
talk to each other

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.563
and they talk to me
about it, but they

00:23:02.563 --> 00:23:04.524
don't publicize it so much.

00:23:04.524 --> 00:23:06.190
And what they're
really talking about is

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:11.210
after the initial shock of
the diagnosis sort of settles,

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:16.650
there is this feeling of
quiet relief, actually.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.350
And the feeling is that they
gain a kind of perspective.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.327
And they say things
like, now, I can say no.

00:23:24.327 --> 00:23:26.660
I can say no to that dinner
party I don't want to go to.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.860
I can say no going to work.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.360
I don't want to go
to work anymore.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.860
Whereas before, I
always felt like I

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:37.158
had to say yes to everything.

00:23:37.158 --> 00:23:39.280
They say, now I
can finally rest.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.790
There was a woman that we
looked after in our hospice.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.740
Her name was Adele.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.276
And she was this very fierce
86-year-old Russian-Jewish

00:23:52.276 --> 00:23:53.650
lady, like as
tough as they come.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.105
Really tough as nails, you know?

00:23:55.105 --> 00:23:58.150
My kind of gal.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.992
And the night she was
dying, they called me up.

00:24:01.992 --> 00:24:02.700
And so I went in.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.409
I always went in when people
were dying to be with them.

00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:06.450
And I walked in the room.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.325
And Adele was sitting
on the edge of her bed,

00:24:08.325 --> 00:24:10.650
sort of with her
feet dangling off

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.556
the edge of the bed
in her bed clothes.

00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:14.930
And I went and
sat in the corner.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.590
That's my way.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.880
I sit in the corner and see,
is anything really needed

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.040
before I jump in to help?

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.890
And there was a really nice,
well-meaning attendant,

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.160
nurse's assistant
sitting next to her.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.310
And this attendant
turned to Adele,

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.200
and she said, Adele, honey,
you don't have to be scared.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.280
We're all right here with you.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.890
And Adele turned to
her and she said,

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.411
honey, if this was happening
to you, you'd be scared.

00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:42.910
Like that.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.290
So I stayed in the corner.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.540
And then, a little while
later, this very well-meaning

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.270
attendant said to her,
you look a little cold.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.930
Would you like a shawl or a
blanket around your shoulders?

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.430
And Adele said, of
course, I'm cold.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.510
I'm almost dead.

00:25:01.228 --> 00:25:02.590
Wow.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.584
I hope I have half of her
tenacity when I'm dying.

00:25:05.584 --> 00:25:08.330
But sitting there in the
corner, I noticed a few things.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.942
One was that Adele
wanted no nonsense.

00:25:11.942 --> 00:25:13.900
She didn't want to talk
about tunnels of light,

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.440
or bardos, or any
of these things.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.057
She just wanted real,
authentic relationship.

00:25:18.057 --> 00:25:20.140
And the second thing was
that there was suffering.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:20.932
There was struggle.

00:25:20.932 --> 00:25:22.848
There's a struggle in
dying, just like there's

00:25:22.848 --> 00:25:24.280
a struggle of getting born.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.234
In her case, it was
manifest in the breath,

00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:28.400
every in-breath struggle,
every out-breath struggle.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.775
And this despite
the fact we made

00:25:29.775 --> 00:25:33.242
all the right interventions of
oxygen and morphine, et cetera.

00:25:33.242 --> 00:25:34.730
There's still a struggle.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.270
There's a labor to dying.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.770
So I pulled my chair
up really close to her.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.800
And I looked her directly in
the eye and I said, Adele,

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.220
would you like to
suffer a little less?

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.020
Would you like to
struggle a little less?

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.740
And she said, yes.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.397
And I said, OK.

00:25:51.397 --> 00:25:52.230
I noticed something.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.990
I noticed that right there at
the end of your exhale, just

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.670
before the next inhale,
there's this little gap,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.980
this little pause.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.480
And I wondered what
it would be like

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.264
if you could put your attention
there just for a moment.

00:26:03.264 --> 00:26:06.080
I'll do it with you.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.720
Now, this is a Russian
Jewish lady, 86 years old.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.180
She doesn't care beans about
meditation, or Buddhism,

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.582
or mindfulness, or
any of these things.

00:26:13.582 --> 00:26:15.290
But she's highly
motivated in this moment

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.450
to be free of suffering.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.117
So she said, OK.

00:26:19.117 --> 00:26:20.033
And I said, all right.

00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:20.870
I'll do it with you.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.470
So she would breathe
in, I would breathe in.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.386
As she would breathe
out, I would breathe out.

00:26:24.386 --> 00:26:25.460
Just that simple.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.570
No special guidance.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.360
No California woo-woo energy
work, or anything like this.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.210
You know, just real.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.680
Just real.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.936
And I noticed that as we
were doing this together

00:26:37.936 --> 00:26:39.640
that she found
that sort of pause,

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.462
that gap between the
exhale and the next inhale.

00:26:43.462 --> 00:26:45.170
That's a really
interesting place for us.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.764
That's a place of fear or faith.

00:26:47.764 --> 00:26:49.680
Do you really trust the
next breath will come?

00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:54.140
And I noticed that as
she found this place,

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:59.240
the fear on her face,
it just drained away.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.484
And she had this kind of
look of relaxation about her.

00:27:02.484 --> 00:27:04.900
And she said, I think I want
to lie back on my pillow now.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:05.800
I said, great idea.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.299
Go ahead.

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:07.980
You do that.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.224
And a little while later,
she died very peacefully.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.100
Do we have to die before
we can rest in peace?

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.625
I think when we
embrace impermanence,

00:27:25.625 --> 00:27:29.120
when we embrace constant
change, a certain grace

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.200
enters our life that allows us
to treasure our experiences,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.740
to feel deeply, to do
it all without clinging.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.690
And we're free to savor
this life, the beauty

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.870
and the horror of it, actually.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.600
Everything can impress itself on
our soul, on our consciousness.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.360
And I think we can become
more appreciative about life.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.566
Abe Maslow, the great
humanist psychologist,

00:27:55.566 --> 00:27:56.690
he had a heart attack, too.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.800
When I had a heart
attack, by the way,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.060
I studied all the
famous people that

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.400
had heart attacks to see
if I could learn something.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.180
But Abe Maslow had
the best thing.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.740
He said, "Death and its
ever present possibility

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.860
makes love, passionate
love, more possible."

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.488
I thought that was beautiful.

00:28:15.488 --> 00:28:18.814
You know the two most important
questions that people ask me

00:28:18.814 --> 00:28:19.480
before they die?

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.230
It's not when am I
going to die, or what's

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.467
going to happen after I die.

00:28:24.467 --> 00:28:26.800
The two most important questions
that people ask me are,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.860
am I loved and did I love well?

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.760
Am I loved and did I love well?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.140
Everything else is extra.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.530
And if those are the most
important questions then,

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.613
why weren't they the most
important questions now?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.770
All of our relationships
will end in separation.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.920
The people we love will die.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.860
The question becomes, how do
I want to care for them now?

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.960
Don't wait.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.540
Don't wait.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.780
To be human, for me at least,
is much more than getting born,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.030
and getting a good
education, and getting

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:16.470
a great job at Google, or
a house on a nice street

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.389
so that we can go to bed and
sleep, wake up in the morning,

00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:20.430
and do it all over again.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:27.830
I think it's an invitation
to feel everything.

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.660
I think it's to come
into direct contact

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.000
with this strange, beautiful,
and sometimes perfectly

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.122
ordinary thing
that we call life.

00:29:35.122 --> 00:29:37.580
And I think it's an opportunity
to be conscious of the fact

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.916
that some of us will make
love while others make war,

00:29:41.916 --> 00:29:43.790
to recognize the truth
that there are babies,

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.820
like my granddaughter last
night, who was in our house

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:52.640
making a tent out of bed
sheets and couch pillows.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.010
And there are kids that are
screaming in Syrian refugee

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.510
camps.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:04.390
There are kids getting
shot in our schools.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:08.450
And there are others that
are speaking truth to power.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.290
There's devastation
and hopelessness.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.080
And there is the passion and
the holy commitment of creating

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.540
a better future for everyone.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.820
It is me speaking
and you listening,

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.465
and the sense of separation
that might exist.

00:30:24.465 --> 00:30:26.090
And then, there's
the unity that starts

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.399
to emerge as soon as we
realize, or as soon as we

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:29.440
start talking about love.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.621
Don't wait.

00:30:34.621 --> 00:30:36.200
Dying folks taught me that.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.700
Don't wait.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.100
So I thought what
we might do here

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.770
is just maybe engage together
in a bit of a dialog.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.450
Maybe there's something
about what I've said

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.880
that you want to chat about.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.110
Or maybe you don't
agree with any of it.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.610
That's OK.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:01.910
But I thought, let's
talk about this.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.830
And let's just
talk in a real way

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.230
about what actually matters.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.750
And so it's up for grabs.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:13.300
All questions or
comments are welcome.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.700
And you know, I'll vamp a
little bit here and maybe share

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.450
some more stories.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:18.408
We'll see what happens.

00:31:18.408 --> 00:31:20.760
So let me ask you a question.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.330
When you were looking at the
photos, what attracted you?

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.360
And what caused
you to pull away?

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.950
Anybody willing to say?

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.380
What attracted you and what
caused you to pull away?

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.550
AUDIENCE: Just the
smiles attracted.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.450
FRANK OSTASESKI: The
smiles attracted you.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.050
What caused you to pull away?

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.999
Even if only
slightly, what was--

00:31:38.999 --> 00:31:40.790
what maybe scared you,
or made you nervous,

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:44.474
or you didn't like?

00:31:44.474 --> 00:31:45.640
AUDIENCE: I didn't have any.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.750
FRANK OSTASESKI: You didn't
have anything like that?

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.110
Yeah.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.620
OK.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.520
All right, good.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.936
Let's hear from
some other people.

00:31:49.936 --> 00:31:56.310
I just really am curious to
know, what happened there?

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.760
You're wanting to say something.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.140
We'll get you a mic.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.320
AUDIENCE: I pulled away
from the cigarette.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:02.890
FRANK OSTASESKI:
From the cigarette.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.390
You saw people smoking.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.350
Did that happen for
anybody else in the room?

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.766
Yeah, you had the
same experience?

00:32:07.766 --> 00:32:09.340
Several people did.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.320
Yeah.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.510
You know, we had a hospice
at Laguna Honda Hospital,

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.970
which is the nation's largest
long-term care facility.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:17.680
We started there.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.930
We were given the basement
and back of a hospital

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.330
to start the hospice in.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.880
And in the old days, people
could smoke in their beds

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.910
in the hospital.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.450
But then, that kind
of got prohibited.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.630
And so we had to
create a smoker's room.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:38.200
So we put up pictures of famous
dead smokers in the smoker's

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.630
room, of Humphrey Bogart,
and Marlene Dietrich,

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:43.480
and all kinds of movie stars.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.010
And all the Buddhists who
were kind of closet smokers,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.610
they finally coped to it and
they would hang out there

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.140
with the patients.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:51.710
Yeah.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:58.100
Well, maybe if we've had someone
in our family who got sick or--

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.860
my mother died of emphysema,
so I have some reactivity

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.450
to cigarettes.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:01.950
Yeah.

00:33:04.144 --> 00:33:05.560
Let's go back to
this young woman.

00:33:08.597 --> 00:33:10.930
AUDIENCE: I didn't have any
problem with the cigarettes.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.030
It seemed to me like they
were enjoying themselves.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:13.750
FRANK OSTASESKI: Yeah.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.260
Yeah.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.880
So not everybody does,
but some people do.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.190
For some people, it's like,
might as well enjoy it, right?

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.170
But for others, if
we've had something

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.400
like that in our
families or our friends,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.504
it can cause some
reactivity for us.

00:33:27.504 --> 00:33:29.170
So that's one of the
challenges of being

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.253
with people who are dying.

00:33:30.253 --> 00:33:33.970
How do we see ourself in them?

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.130
Like when you looked
at these photos,

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:37.280
like I know these people.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.540
I could tell you all
their back story.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.110
I worked with all of them.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.270
But you don't know them, right?

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:46.270
So what do you see?

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.157
I mean, you know tarot cards?

00:33:48.157 --> 00:33:50.740
You know how tarot cards-- you
don't have to believe in tarot.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:57.572
But what tarot cards are
are archetypal images that

00:33:57.572 --> 00:33:58.780
are represented on the cards.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.180
And what these photos are
are kind of like tarot cards.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.280
The whole human
condition is here--

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.330
depression, happiness,
fatigue, fear.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:09.830
It's all here in these slides.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.060
Look at her.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.130
So when you look
at them, I think

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.050
what we're seeing is ourself.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.000
I think that we're seeing
our own hopes and fears.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.660
Now, if we understand
that, then it

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.440
takes the conversational
a little deeper.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.710
So what'd you see?

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.284
What'd you see?

00:34:29.284 --> 00:34:31.409
AUDIENCE: I don't know
which one is going to be me.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:32.710
FRANK OSTASESKI: I don't know
which one is going to be me.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:33.425
Yeah.

00:34:33.425 --> 00:34:35.550
Well, what did you see that
attracted you or caused

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.195
you to pull away?

00:34:37.195 --> 00:34:38.820
AUDIENCE: It feels
like you keep trying

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.489
to give us things other
than the grief that I always

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.540
see in the ending.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.360
It's like, no matter
what else we get out

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.610
of it, whatever
positives we find here,

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.100
whatever chance there is
to not have a cold anymore,

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.989
it's still a horrendous loss.

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.361
FRANK OSTASESKI: Yes.

00:34:53.361 --> 00:34:55.360
AUDIENCE: I don't want
to sugarcoat that at all.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:55.860
FRANK OSTASESKI: Absolutely.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.300
And I don't want to
sugarcoat it either.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.470
I have no interest in that.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.906
My interest is in being
deeply real with people.

00:35:00.906 --> 00:35:02.280
And there's no
question that when

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.029
we experience the loss
of someone we love,

00:35:04.029 --> 00:35:05.310
we're going to feel grief.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.770
And that grief is going to
show up in all kinds of ways.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.103
It's going to feel like sadness.

00:35:09.103 --> 00:35:11.580
And it's also going to show
up as anger and as fear

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.240
and sometimes like
numbness, or like you're

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.305
walking through molasses
and you can't find your way.

00:35:18.305 --> 00:35:18.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.250
I think the numb is
more what led me away.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.020
It's like, there's
a lot to take in.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.480
There's an
approach/retreat thing

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.040
I just have to do with it.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.780
FRANK OSTASESKI: Yeah.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:33.330
So what are the
experiences of grief?

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.000
You know, first of all,
there's a whole lot

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.697
of nonsense out there about
models of grief and timelines

00:35:39.697 --> 00:35:41.280
for how people should
move through it.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.238
And it's just nonsense.

00:35:42.238 --> 00:35:44.732
Grief is a totally
uncontrollable experience.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.090
And we usually enter
that experience feeling

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.160
very fragmented.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.510
But if we stay attentive
to that experience,

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.002
one of the things we start
to see is, oh, my god.

00:35:57.002 --> 00:35:58.460
That's the underground
river that's

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.400
moving through all our
lives that we rarely

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.840
talk about with each other.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.300
And so we begin to feel--

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.060
this fragmentation begins
to become something

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.000
more like connectedness
actually, more like wholeness.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.290
It doesn't start out that
way, but it frequently

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:18.040
develops into that
kind of understanding.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.030
AUDIENCE: Say just
a couple more words.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:22.520
What's the fragmentation that
develops in the wholeness?

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.790
How do things connect
or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:24.390
FRANK OSTASESKI:
In the beginning,

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.556
we feel fragmented because
we feel like our life has

00:36:26.556 --> 00:36:27.710
been shattered.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.890
All the ways that we
counted on it being

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:35.090
have been upset in
one way or another.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.410
Mom's going to be here.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.170
The people I love
are going to be here.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:44.540
Even if we know otherwise, we
believe that to be true often.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.310
And so part of what
happens in grief

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.810
is not just the
loss of that person,

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:52.569
but the loss of that particular
dream or of that belief.

00:36:52.569 --> 00:36:54.110
And when we can then
turn toward that

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.020
experience as opposed
to turning away from it.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.450
Always when we turn
toward suffering,

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.590
there we find the healing.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.406
The healing is always found in
the middle of the suffering.

00:37:05.406 --> 00:37:06.530
Let me give you an example.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.720
I was sitting in my office
one day when the phone rang.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.290
And it was a dad.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:20.460
And the dad said, we understand
that you could help keep

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.940
our son at home after he dies.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.480
And I said, yeah,
I could do that.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.690
They wanted to stay with their
son for a few days at home.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.990
And I said, yeah,
I could do that.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.100
I said, you just call
me when the time comes.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.516
He said, no, you
don't understand.

00:37:35.516 --> 00:37:37.610
It's just happened.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.290
And I said, OK,
I'll be right over.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.910
And I drove to their
house up in Sonoma County.

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:44.980
I walked in the house.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.063
I didn't know this family.

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.440
I never met them before.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.810
But I walked into the room.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.570
There was mom and dad, and a few
of the neighbors and friends.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:54.870
And there was this
seven-year-old boy in his bed,

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.267
dead.

00:37:57.267 --> 00:37:59.100
And I went over to this
little boy following

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.135
my intuition, which I trust.

00:38:01.135 --> 00:38:03.510
And I leaned over, and I kissed
him on the forehead, just

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.510
as a way of greeting him.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.412
And when I did this, the
whole room broke into tears.

00:38:08.412 --> 00:38:10.620
Because while they had cared
for him with great love,

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.900
nobody had touched
him since he died.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.892
That's the extent of
our fear around dying.

00:38:17.892 --> 00:38:19.350
So his mom and his
dad and I talked

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.430
about this process
of bathing the body

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.220
that's been done
in every culture,

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.152
every religious
tradition for millennium.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.430
And we talked about how they
might do it differently.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.930
And they were great gardeners,
so we went out to the garden,

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.330
and we got lemon geraniums,
and sage, and rosemary,

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.022
and rose petals.

00:38:37.022 --> 00:38:39.480
You know, we made a basin of
water of all these sweet herbs

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.080
and flowers.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.110
Then, we got
washcloths and towels.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.170
And then this mom and this
dad started this process

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:48.140
of bathing their son.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.200
I remember they started
at the top of his head

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.790
and they bathed down his back.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.390
And as they bathed
down his back,

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.170
his mom would stop at these
little nicks and scratches

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:05.430
and take care of them
with so much love.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.279
And sometimes, they would
have to stop and tell me

00:39:14.279 --> 00:39:15.820
a story about him
as a way of getting

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.550
current with the truth of
what was in front of them.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.950
Sometimes, it was
too hard for the dad.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.510
And he had to go
stand by the window

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:25.860
and look out to the garden.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.610
He couldn't do it.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.060
And this mom, I remember
she got to his toes

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.160
and she counted his toes.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.830
She said she had done
that when he was born.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.310
Are any of you
parents in the room?

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.680
Yeah, OK.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.320
I mean, it's impossible.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.350
It's an impossible situation.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.710
And there are no words that can
touch this kind of suffering.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.710
What you can do is bear
witness to the suffering

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.668
and stay in the room when
the going gets rough.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:02.650
So I said to her,
just keep going.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.280
And she looked at me with
these beseeching eyes like,

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.270
am I going to survive this?

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.700
Can any mother survive this?

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.550
And my job was to hand
her another washcloth

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.733
and orient her back
to the suffering.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.740
She kept bathing this boy.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.280
And by the time she
got to his face,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.130
it was so intimate
between this mom

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.170
and this seven-year-old boy.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.019
Really intimate.

00:40:31.019 --> 00:40:32.810
And she had burned
through a kind of grief.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:35.390
I don't mean her grief was
over, not by the long shot.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:36.320
It was just beginning.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.430
But the feeling of
separation, which

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.100
is part of the experience
of grief, at that moment

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.140
had melted.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.960
And this mom and this
boy were like one thing.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.982
Maybe like the moment in which--

00:40:48.982 --> 00:40:50.440
the women in this
room can tell you

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.180
what it's like when
you birth a child

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.480
and you feel like
you're one being.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.591
No separation.

00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:58.090
Or when you're
breastfeeding and you

00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.800
feel yourself to be one being.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.789
And the child knows
himself to be that, too.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.560
I remember that we dressed him
in his Mickey Mouse pajamas.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.726
And we invited his brothers
and sisters in the room.

00:41:14.726 --> 00:41:16.600
And I asked him what he
liked to do the most,

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.520
and he liked to make
model airplanes.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.242
So we got those model
airplanes, and we

00:41:20.242 --> 00:41:22.450
made a mobile out of them
so the brothers and sisters

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.680
could be part of this.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.959
And we hung the
mobile over his bed.

00:41:25.959 --> 00:41:28.000
I hung out with his younger
brothers and sisters.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.280
I came home that night.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.590
And my own son was seven
years old at the time.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.530
And I can tell you, I
held him really close.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.426
So no, I'm not
interested in Pollyanna.

00:41:43.426 --> 00:41:45.300
I'm not interested in
skipping over anything.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.740
But I am interested in changing
the dialog that we have

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:54.090
around death only being failure,
and only being a wasting away

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:54.590
experience.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.560
It's not my experience.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.310
It's my experience
that people frequently,

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:00.170
in the middle of
that, find resources

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.220
that they never knew
they had and discover

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.725
unbelievable capacity, actually.

00:42:05.725 --> 00:42:07.110
It doesn't happen every time.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.940
But most of the stories we
tell ourself about dying

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.240
are scary stories.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.460
And I think that
that doesn't help us

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.022
and that we need to see.

00:42:19.022 --> 00:42:21.480
Some of us have been in the
room with people who have died,

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.350
and it's been hard.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:23.725
And others have
been in the room,

00:42:23.725 --> 00:42:27.717
and it's been
unbelievably beautiful.

00:42:27.717 --> 00:42:28.300
Both are true.

00:42:31.037 --> 00:42:31.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:36.640
From the pictures, I
see mostly dying folks

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.550
that were fearful and painful.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.692
But I do see a few happy faces.

00:42:42.692 --> 00:42:43.900
FRANK OSTASESKI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.470
AUDIENCE: And I think
dying, if viewed

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.930
from an eternal
point of view, can

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.840
be viewed as a happy occasion.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.470
Because I remember
there's a song.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.760
The basis is-- I
forgot the title.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.460
It's through an open door, all
the burdens are laid aside.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.990
All the work done.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.860
My mother is there
waiting for me.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.920
My father is there, too.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.540
Lots of friends
are waiting for me.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.770
Very happy.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.990
Happy [INAUDIBLE] right?

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:17.470
I think if we have faith
that we-- in heaven,

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.670
we have eternal life.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.410
Then, our earthly
lives is very short.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.640
It could be 70
years or 80 years.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.980
As Moses said 3,000 years ago,
the length of life 70 years

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.955
is only a very short.

00:43:28.955 --> 00:43:32.700
The span of our life is
so quick, we'll fly away,

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.650
and we are gone.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.525
FRANK OSTASESKI: Yes.

00:43:34.525 --> 00:43:36.020
AUDIENCE: We'll fly away.

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.930
And our life is
like a flower field.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.700
The wind blows over
it, then it's gone.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.200
Even its place
remembers it no more.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.700
But for those people
who have faith,

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:50.890
I think the creator's
eternal love is on those.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.620
Their righteousness is on
their children's children.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:57.337
I found this kind of hope
and the eternal faith

00:43:57.337 --> 00:43:58.295
gives a lot of comfort.

00:43:58.295 --> 00:44:00.010
FRANK OSTASESKI: So that's
something you have confidence

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:01.260
in and you have real faith in.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:01.960
Beautiful.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.070
Beautiful for you.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.590
AUDIENCE: I lost two sisters
when I was a little kid.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.680
It was a very
traumatic experience.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.770
But then, I came--

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:12.960
my mom is 85 years old, and
she's really on that stage.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.670
But now, I have a lot
of peace because this is

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:16.930
going to happen to everybody.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.460
FRANK OSTASESKI: Yes.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.070
It is.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.426
And so awareness in a way--

00:44:23.426 --> 00:44:25.300
because some of you are
mindfulness students.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.720
We could say awareness
is totally undivided.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.170
And yet, it can
include division.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.400
It can include paradox.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.290
So I think that one
of the things that's

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.150
often true about
the dying process

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:40.810
is that it's hard, that it's
maybe the toughest work we'll

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:42.040
ever do in our lives.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.180
And being with someone we
love, also really difficult.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.260
But it isn't all that it is.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.710
It isn't all that it is.

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.810
Yeah.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:54.970
And if we don't start
including some other elements

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:56.830
of that conversation,
we will lean

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.410
into-- our default position
will always be it's miserable

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:00.490
and it's failure.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.410
And that's what we've been
taught for generations now.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.220
And I want to shift that dialog.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.720
Now for some people
like yourself,

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:14.110
who are people of great faith,
they have a sense of eternity

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.320
and that there is
a life after death.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.900
Others don't have that
belief, and they still

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:24.040
have graceful deaths.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:29.780
It's not a prerequisite
for a fearless death.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:34.240
In fact, I often ask
people when they're dying,

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.060
what do you think is going
to happen after you die?

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.100
It's a really good
question to ask all of us.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.710
And you know, I
don't know, actually.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:42.970
I don't really know.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.030
I mean, when I find
out, I'll write.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:52.790
But what you think
about it matters.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.120
So for example, there was a
woman we were working with.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:59.140
She was a Christian Scientist.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.980
And she had deep faith, maybe
like yourself, deep faith.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.080
And she said to me, I
just want to put my head

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.130
in the lap of Jesus.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.640
And I said, OK, sounds good.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.840
And then, her daughter
came, granddaughter

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.150
rather, came to visit her.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:17.230
And her granddaughter said,
Grandma, I was reading a book.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.960
And in this book, it
says that after you die,

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.750
everybody who's died before
you will be there to meet you,

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.360
so you don't have to be worried
about anything, Grandma.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.800
And Grandma became terrified.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.580
Yeah.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:31.390
You know why?

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:34.060
She confided in me that
Edgar, her husband,

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.120
had been beating her
most of her life.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.070
And the idea of spending
eternity with Edgar

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.320
was terrifying to her.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.780
So I don't impose my idea.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.470
Even those that I have faith in,
I don't impose those on others.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.350
But rather, I try and discover
from the other person,

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.591
what is it that really
is truthful to you?

00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:54.090
So there was a guy, Jackie, in
the hospice, African-American

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.740
man, 30-year heroin user.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.910
He's at the Zen Hospice Project.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:02.250
And I said, Jackie, here
you are at the Zen Hospice.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:04.500
You think you're going
to get born again?

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.939
He said, yep.

00:47:05.939 --> 00:47:07.980
I said, well, what are
you going to come back as?

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.595
He said, Jackie.

00:47:09.595 --> 00:47:11.220
I said, what you want
to be Jackie for?

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:19.080
You could be a king, or a
queen, or the head of Google.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.600
And I said, in some
cultures, you could be a cow

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.200
and that would be very sacred.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.560
And he said, I'm not coming
back as no goddamn cow.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.550
And I said, well, why
you want to be Jackie?

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:36.190
He said, because next time,
I'm going to get it right.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.980
And you see, we're in a really
different conversation now.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.730
We're really in a conversation
about his current life.

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.540
So I don't impose
my ideas on anybody.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.780
I'm really curious.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.480
I like to discover with people.

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.075
I walk in the room
with a sense of wonder.

00:47:53.075 --> 00:47:56.170
There was a guy who was the
head of the California Atheist

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.840
Association who came to
die with us at Zen Hospice.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.670
I was very proud
of that, that he

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.544
didn't feel like anybody was
going to push any dogma on him.

00:48:04.544 --> 00:48:06.460
And so I sat down with
him and we talked a lot

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.240
about this question.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.580
And I said, what's going
to happen after you die?

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.910
He said, nothing.

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:11.422
I said, what do
you mean, nothing?

00:48:11.422 --> 00:48:12.130
He said, nothing.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.300
I said, will you smell things?

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.936
Will you hear things?

00:48:17.936 --> 00:48:19.060
No, you don't smell things.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:19.890
You don't have a nose.

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:20.806
You don't hear things.

00:48:20.806 --> 00:48:22.990
You don't have ears.

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.180
I said, well, what's it like?

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.350
There's nothing.

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:29.710
Is it like a dial tone?

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.600
And he said, no.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.844
He said, it's just
you become molecules.

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:36.010
And those molecules mix
with all the other molecules

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:37.120
in the universe.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.300
And you just become one with
all the other molecules.

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.430
I said, oh.

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:42.780
Oh, that kind of nothing.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.130
Oh, OK.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:51.050
So I don't have some idea
about how it's supposed to go.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:55.390
But I do think that the way
in which we think about what

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.130
happens after we die matters.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.547
It shapes the way
in which we die.

00:48:58.547 --> 00:49:00.838
And to some extent, the way
in which we live our lives,

00:49:00.838 --> 00:49:01.450
I think.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:04.330
So I think that your
comments are good ones.

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:09.640
We'll find out, right?

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.647
We'll find out.

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.230
What else is on your
hearts and minds?

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:14.770
Anything else?

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:15.650
Yeah, please.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:16.690
Over there.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.160
AUDIENCE: I really enjoyed
your podcast with Sam Harris,

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:19.660
by the way.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.560
FRANK OSTASESKI: Oh, yeah.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.518
Yeah, he's a great guy.

00:49:21.518 --> 00:49:24.250
You know, he's a bit of a
provocateur, Sam, you know?

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.740
And he was going to nail me
on my Buddhist stuff, I think.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.280
But I didn't bite.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.800
He's a really good guy.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.170
And he told me that it's one of
the most popular podcasts he's

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.220
ever had.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.660
AUDIENCE: So I had a question
about Eastern philosophy.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.750
So one of the pillars,
the foundation of Eastern

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.330
philosophy is the
sense of self that we

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:49.450
have is an illusion and
one of the foundations

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.050
of all suffering.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.140
So I kind of wanted
to ask you how

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.290
we can bring awareness
of death in trying

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.130
to understand that illusion?

00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:59.680
FRANK OSTASESKI:
Yeah, beautiful.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.054
So first of all, we've got to
distinguish between Eastern

00:50:02.054 --> 00:50:05.380
philosophy, because it's too
big a generalization, right?

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.310
Because what a Hindu belief is
and what a Buddhist belief is

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.754
can be quite different.

00:50:10.754 --> 00:50:12.170
And also, within
Buddhist schools,

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.253
there are many, many
distinctions and differences.

00:50:14.253 --> 00:50:16.870
Some Buddhist schools
don't ascribe to any notion

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:21.530
of rebirth, for example.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:27.160
So one way, in Buddhist
schools, at least

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.350
in the early
Theravadan schools, is

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.710
they think of us as what are
called a heap, or the five

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:33.240
heaps.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.100
We're a collection of things,
of seeing, of tasting,

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.944
of touching, of
smelling, these senses,

00:50:38.944 --> 00:50:40.360
and the sixth being
consciousness,

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:44.510
the ability to know
the experience.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:50.537
And in fact, in that
system, that's what we are.

00:50:50.537 --> 00:50:52.120
We are this collection
of things which

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.730
is constantly appearing and
disappearing, constantly

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:55.310
changing.

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.220
So when I said earlier,
we think of ourselves

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.320
as a solid thing going
through a changing world,

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.040
this is a kind of an illusion.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:06.370
And yet, there's also some
imprint, we could say,

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:13.970
that seems to continue and has
some kind of momentum to it.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:14.890
This is also true.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:18.170
In different cultures, in
some of the Vedanta cultures,

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:21.200
we would call that
Atman, the sense of soul.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.790
In the Buddhist cultures, we
speak about a consciousness

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:31.066
that can continue actually
and has a momentum to it that

00:51:31.066 --> 00:51:32.190
inclines it toward rebirth.

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:39.230
I think that really we don't
have to believe any of that.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.180
All we have to do
is look and see.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.140
This moment?

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.951
It just changed.

00:51:43.951 --> 00:51:45.450
It was here a moment
ago, wasn't it?

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:48.400
And now, it's not.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.510
And that's the truth
of our existence.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:55.140
Everything is coming
and going all the time.

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.810
I used to live in a
farmhouse in the countryside.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.900
And it was a
120-year-old farmhouse.

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.670
And the windows
in the farmhouse,

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:04.380
if you looked at them
really carefully,

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.500
they were thicker at the bottom
than they were at the top.

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.860
Because the glass,
although it seemed solid,

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.630
was actually a moving thing.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:13.620
Glass is liquid.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.150
It's always moving.

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:19.350
And so it settles down to
the bottom of the window.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.610
We're a bit like that.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:24.540
We're a moving thing that
looks kind of solid actually,

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:29.110
but we're not nearly so fixed
as we imagine ourselves to be.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:31.520
So suppose we embrace that.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.130
Suppose not just believed
it, but actually looked at it

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:39.551
and knew it intimately
and really, embodied it.

00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:40.050
Well, then.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:44.300
I think we would maybe not
be so afraid of change.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:49.120
And maybe our fear of death,
which is a pretty big change,

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.740
would just seem like yet another
part of that continuous flow

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:57.070
of impermanence.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:58.846
I think that's one of
things we could do.

00:52:58.846 --> 00:53:00.220
If you want to
find out about me,

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.050
you can go to
fiveinvitations.com.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.020
And there, there's
a series of events.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.720
And you can find out where
else I'm teaching and stuff.

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.730
You can also, obviously,
find the book there.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.146
And then I run an organization
called the Metta Institute,

00:53:12.146 --> 00:53:15.624
M-E-T-T-A. And there also, you
can find out about the programs

00:53:15.624 --> 00:53:16.790
and things that we're doing.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.940
So come play with us.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.360
This is too big a question to
be left until the final days

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.310
of your life.

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:25.910
Let's explore it now.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:26.920
So thank you very much.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.503
Thank you, everybody,
for inviting me.

00:53:28.503 --> 00:53:30.155
Thank you for those
folks that are here

00:53:30.155 --> 00:53:32.530
in the room and those that
have been watching the stream.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:34.540
Thank you, Karen, for
your kind introduction

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.760
and to Van and the whole
crew for everything

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.190
you did to make it
possible for me to be here.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:40.690
You're saying thank
you very much?

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:42.313
And Ben, thank you very much.

00:53:42.313 --> 00:53:43.220
Yeah.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:43.820
OK.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.528
Let's stop there.

00:53:44.528 --> 00:53:47.470
[APPLAUSE]
