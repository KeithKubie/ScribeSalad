00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.280
Let's take a look at the conference API class.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.300
This class defines the API that are exposed through endpoints.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.030
See this API annotation right here? This is what indicates

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.780
it. This class contains functions to be exposed through endpoints.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.670
There are rules around how you can name the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.600
API and one of the rules is that the API

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.550
name must start with a lowercase letter. So far this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.340
class contains a few methods. The one that we're going to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.740
be looking at in this lesson is save profile.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.010
Let's take a look at it. Here's the Save

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.210
Profile Method. You can see up here that we've

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.190
defined the @Api Method which indicates that this method

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.820
is going to be exposed through end points. So

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.270
let's look in to the saved profile method. You

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.290
see it defines a bunch of fields user ID,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.520
main email, display name, t-shirt size. For the display

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.670
name and the t-shirt size we've set some default values.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.330
And when you're working with your code you can change

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.150
these default values as you like. You'll see that the

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.420
code contains a bunch of to do's. You're going to be filling

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.190
in these to do's, and the numbers indicate the order

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.360
in which to do them. So obviously, you do to do

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.520
one before you do to do two. So the other

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.540
thing that this method does is it creates a new profile

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.820
object, passing in the user ID, the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.870
display name, main email, the t-shirt size. And

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.330
then it returns a profile. So at this point, it doesn't really do a whole lot

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.980
except create and return a Profile object. So let's take a quick look at the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.800
Profile class. Here's the Profile class in an

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.510
editor. And not surprisingly, it takes displayName, mainEmail,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.620
teeShirtSize. These are the fields that get passed

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.670
in to it. When it's constructed and the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.480
constructor just takes the values that are passed

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.620
in and puts them into appropriate fields. The class

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.800
also contains getter methods for these fields, it

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.340
doesn't contain setter methods, because we only want the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.770
values to be set at construction time. So

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.850
now let's run the app and see what happens.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.360
So, we're going to deploy to local host. Okay

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.330
and while the deployment is going on, you'll see a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.890
bunch of messages. And at the end you should see

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.380
this INFO: Dev App Server is now running. So, now

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.500
let's go to the browser and see what we can

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.250
see. So we want to look at the app in

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.020
the APIs explorer. So you go to the local host

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.880
colon, what ever your port number is, in my case

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.740
is 8080 and then is _ah/api/explorer. And then,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.030
you see the API explorer, and you see the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.040
conference API, so we can drill down into

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.640
it, couple methods. We haven't done anything with the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.510
other method. We'll just look at save profile.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.800
Let's see what happens if we execute save profile

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.320
function. Just go ahead and execute it. And

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.300
we didn't provide any input parameters so we just

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.170
go the default response. So, which is a profile object containing the display

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.870
name, that the default that we set and the t-shirt size. Doesn't know what

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.200
the t-shirt size is yet because you haven't told it. So go ahead

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.360
and post a video if you like and try this out for yourself now.
