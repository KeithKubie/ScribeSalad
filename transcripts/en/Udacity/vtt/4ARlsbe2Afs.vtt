00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.638
The answer is, there shouldn't be, if price is less or equal to 100. This

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:09.706
condition doesn't change the execution. But it adds unnecessary code, and

00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:13.050
opportunities for bugs. We could later decide that we want to change the

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.632
threshold of 100. And then we would have to remember to change it in both

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:23.320
places. We're creating extra work and unnecessary complexity for ourselves by

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.021
adding unnecessary code.
