00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.020
 this capture we'll see the concept of 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.830
 networks of artificial neurons in 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.830
 machine learning 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 so we just saw that the gatehouse 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.430
 collector was allowed to take a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.250
 model that were trying to make a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.080
 linear classification so learn 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.019
 a linear decision area between 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.119
 the two classes we are trying to separate 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.449
 in this illustration the points 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.149
 blacks and blue dots we saw 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.559
 also the logistic regression and the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 logistic regression also goes 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 learn a hyper plan that separates 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.200
 two classes the class of wheel the class 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.300
 1 that will be linear so the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.190
 perceptor benefits have same thing 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.070
 for logistics relegation is that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.039
 we do not have to remember the whole 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.140
 training examples keeps them in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.789
 memory once the tax collector has it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.989
 logistic regression ended his 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.440
 training everything you need 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.010
 it's the vector w to be able to do 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.990
 a prediction on new examples 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 the opposite we saw the deco booth more 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.400
 close neighbor and in physics one illustrates 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.320
 here is the decision surface 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.570
 associated with the nearest neighbor cases so 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.490
 we remember that the kop 3 1 for 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 classify for example this example ci 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.810
 could look at the two points the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.509
 closer so that's maybe the one 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.390
 there is this one here 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.790
 and then she's going to determine the class of 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.790
 point to predict from the label 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.619
 of his neighbors so in this case too he 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.060
 would be classified black because the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.460
 birds are dead and so because of that 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.960
 lacker deco nearest neighbor him his 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.170
 surface of decisions she is actually 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.110
 nonlinear so we see so any 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.659
 this region here here and here too 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.390
 all the regions that contain 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.149
 points that would be classified as 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.219
 being black dots and all the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.020
 region in white here that would be the region 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.869
 where to go points would be classified according to 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.819
 the class associated with the white point so 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.770
 we see that the surface between the two 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.350
 which separates these two regions there actually 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.150
 it's delimited by a surface 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.780
 which non linear which is not a straight 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.520
 hockey and because of that it makes that the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.380
 war will break down closer neighbor and 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.880
 more powerful ie able to 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.770
 solve problems that are polite 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.350
 nerves by cons we remember that 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.750
 the Algerian deco nearest neighbor him 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.430
 more expensive in memory then hear 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.930
 calculation if we have accents 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.460
 which are very serious 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.370
 because we should be remembered 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.710
 all the training examples and one 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.110
 must see we will have to go get 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.590
 closest neighbors for each 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.790
 new entry that must be classified this 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.470
 which would be nice to have some 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.570
 thing against both that is that 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.370
 which would not exist to keep all in 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.350
 memory but who will be able to have a 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.810
 function of so a decision surface 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.090
 which will not be linear that will be no 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.040
 linear and so that's what we will have 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.060
 in fact with a grog network that's what 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.510
 motivated me among others the use 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.310
 networks does not make so here we go 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.700
 see an example in fact of problems that 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.700
 is not 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.590
 it's by amine hermes did it so 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.330
 general the majority in problems 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.970
 classifications are not linear 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.140
 not linearly his parents and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.970
 finally we'll see an example that is 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.860
 super simple then we could have thought 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.740
 that because it was a simple example 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.270
 it should be easy class finally 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.400
 so it's going to be separable number itself 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.080
 not the case 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.470
 imagine a classification problem 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.680
 where we have in trip 2 bits x1 x2 so the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.330
 dimension of the doctors in three x 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.630
 it's going to be a time vector and 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.360
 only 2 so if we look by 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.950
 example is a yes it's its x1 editors 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.140
 the two different years correspond to 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.390
 beats 0 1 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.300
 so if we wanted to learn enough 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.450
 function end so the operator and this 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.860
 xperia x2 ben we are con it would be 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.370
 able to take it with a 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.330
 classifiable actually the point 0 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.330
 001 and 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:22.389
 12 01 savoie 6 016 makes this point here 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.610
 then 1 06 point here these three points 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.800
 their are associated with the zero class 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.449
 while this point here very closely associated 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.360
 to class 1 since both inputs 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.270
 on a flat exit of the operator and on 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.530
 the beats to re-register 1 so we see 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.290
 that in this case if we are able to 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.449
 move a straight line between the examples of 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.090
 the class of euros it is the example of 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.760
 same classification for the function to 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.260
 both the operator or because if the 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.419
 point if the point becomes the 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.389
 class 1 night rest of class 1 and 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.500
 him from the a-40 is still able to 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.360
 go right between the two classes 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.100
 on the other hand soria does not work 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.930
 really more complicated than the function 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:07.449
 so export a function that returns 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.910
 who will return 0.6 both goals are 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.100
 zero or both goals are a dish that 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.740
 will go back so one of the two quickly and 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.610
 an island of zero as is the case here 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.560
 and here 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.080
 so what if we will not be able to 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.860
 to pass a straight line that would allow 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.160
 separate on one side the points associated with 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.660
 ranking of enough class points then 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.630
 how exactly do we solve 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:36.970
 this problem no and well what we 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.729
 could do in fact it's transformed 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:43.330
 the entrance to get a new 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.340
 representation or in this space there to 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.620
 the data will be linearly its 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.030
 parents in that function etc be in 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.479
 son we could have done is 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.560
 replace x1 by the operator is 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.150
 applied on the former listener then there 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.870
 the excision input by replace it with 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.910
 the operator 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:06.820
 point therefore applied to the input x1 x2 if 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:10.090
 we do here so we have our problem 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.479
 represented by x1 and x2 on my two 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.860
 axes and that I replace problem where 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.919
 the x-axis must be the operator 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.400
 historic belt access them there 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:25.180
 maybe the operator applied on 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.169
 the operator or applied on mx1 mx2 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.520
 because if in fact this point go 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.300
 become that point there in the new 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.030
 representation 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.479
 so actually if I apply the 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:41.410
 function is about 1 1 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:44.229
 I get as helmsman 1 then 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.940
 I apply the function or on point 1 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:49.000
 1 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.560
 I also get for this point there 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.740
 this new coordinate system is going 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.110
 to be represented by will be here 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.630
 in the new the new 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.720
 nancy representation I do the same 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.560
 thing with xperia 0,10 of gas 0 I get 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.050
 found 1,100 also and then if I 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.750
 take these two points here so 1 0 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.080
 and 0,1 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.500
 the value for the operator or vote is 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.630
 from 1 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.280
 but the value for the operator he is going 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.620
 to be zero so these two points there 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.120
 will end up here we notice in 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.660
 this new representation loeb I 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.180
 am able to actually separate but 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.330
 two classes we also notice that we have 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.270
 seen that the operator or then the operator 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.330
 and it's your operator that we could 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.949
 learn with a linear model 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.050
 for example we could take it with 

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:43.539
 a logistic regression which is so 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:46.210
 Spirulina is it so it suggests 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:50.970
 that if I would like if I wanted 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:52.870
 learn by whose function xo-1 

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.820
 because I could actually 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.949
 firstly to take a regression 

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.690
 logistics for the function or a 

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:02.110
 logistic regression for function 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:04.570
 and then give yourself the exit 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.669
 marie gassion logistics input 

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.070
 to another logistic regression that 

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:13.690
 she will learn what's left to 

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:16.330
 do that ie the export function and 

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.860
 so basically the induction behind 

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.740
 the usefulness of neural networks 

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:23.470
 artificial 

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:26.110
 so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.990
 learn the weights of a classified 

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.370
 linear but it's classy to come 

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.039
 she will apply on a 

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.140
 transformation of the input that will make 

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.570
 the problem 

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:41.250
 herman his parents so we're going to have in 

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:44.670
 made several logistic regression that 

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:46.440
 are going to be a dc by the industry so here 

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.860
 I would have another logistic aggression 

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:54.480
 who would be connected with my entries 

00:08:49.860 --> 00:09:02.850
 but even between here and it would be j - 

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:04.260
 years I'll have another here for d + 1 

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.810
 so I'll have many like that 

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.760
 are they going to be connected with a 

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.070
 other logistic regression but which is going 

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:14.100
 take as input these calculated values 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:17.490
 at the logistic regression output of the 

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:20.790
 previous layer of regression 

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:22.530
 logistics and if we actually see each 

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.990
 of those logistic regression there as a 

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.360
 kind of neurons where there are forces 

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.860
 connections between neurons there and 

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.960
 neurons of a previous layer 

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.480
 but under this representation there 

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.360
 can interpret the kind of calculation done 

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.560
 by this model there as a calculation done by 

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.090
 a neural network but that is 

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.940
 artificial so with neurons 

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.490
 artificial 

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.470
 so that's our it's an example of 

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.970
 neural networks but also here we have 

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.910
 a single layer we will say that this 

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.980
 left there she is hidden so here all 

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.270
 the neurons we will find here all 

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.340
 logistic regressions we will find 

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.560
 here did that going to match a 

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.210
 layer of neurons that are said to hide 

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.520
 because we do not know exactly 

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.290
 value that must be modeled when 

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.490
 training to do everything we go 

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.020
 to be able to give as sign to 

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.830
 training is what values ​​we 

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.110
 would like to have 

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:13.110
 at the exit of the network therefore does not render to the 

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:17.160
 any end of the calculation here we will want 

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:19.860
 that h2x acquired the output of this wall to our 

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.620
 price calculations say well the target there 

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.270
 associate with my input x and for his 

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.610
 neurons did it we want it 

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.800
 discover a representation and we 

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.590
 past the sheath we go to those two 

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.210
 found with the descent of gasa we went 

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.670
 found the representation too that is going 

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.460
 to facilitate problems 

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.800
 make here this regression of 

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:44.240
 logistic regression ci that will tempt 

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.240
 she to predict iker 

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:49.970
 so yes that actually prevents us 

00:10:47.869 --> 00:10:51.350
 to have several coaches hidden in one 

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.600
 example here we would have a first 

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.189
 layer hidden here a second layer 

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.639
 hidden here then finally we would have a 

00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:59.930
 exit those who would try to predict there 

00:10:57.639 --> 00:11:01.850
 I will use the notation in the 

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:04.069
 book of abductees go each 

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.670
 neurons that is in the silk 

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:10.220
 the layer here that we will call the layer 

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:12.170
 entrance so we do that it's okay 

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:15.559
 to correspond ex françois caron 

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:18.949
 correspond to x2 so its neurons 

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:20.509
 their are going to be clues and with the same 

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:22.100
 age index that neurons the first 

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:23.720
 mowing hide the second hidden layer 

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.559
 of the third and one goes one city hall 

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.449
 like that 1 2 3 4 5 6 is so of the 

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:34.459
 entrance layer until the race 

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:37.369
 will call the output layer then we 

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:39.949
 will note acts as being the activity of the 

00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:41.600
 I like to go to our network and that 

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:44.389
 it's going to be like the 

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.869
 input and output neurons and between 

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:50.720
 others we will see that to vote galaxy 

00:11:47.869 --> 00:11:54.429
 so at 1 is equal to sixteen then to 2t 

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:57.319
 gala x2 I also noted 

00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:59.540
 indjic as being the activity of the gym 

00:11:57.319 --> 00:12:00.529
 neurons but at 20 non-linearity 

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.769
 logistics 

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:06.529
 so i'm going to have that hadji is equal to 

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:09.199
 the logistic or sigmoid function 

00:12:06.529 --> 00:12:10.970
 applied on the variable that I call 

00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:15.110
 angie then in j make it worth 

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:19.370
 simply corresponds to the products of 

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:21.769
 connections between neurons j with the 

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:25.939
 neurons from the previous layer 1 from here 

00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:26.899
 paris x the activity of neurons in the 

00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:30.589
 previous layer 

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:33.259
 so the neurons at there is so what we 

00:12:30.589 --> 00:12:34.939
 going to have here actually is that according 

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:37.730
 this notation there if there is no 

00:12:34.939 --> 00:12:40.299
 connections between neurons neurology on 

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:43.819
 will assume that w yj is equal to zero 

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:48.339
 so we observe here that w13 is the 

00:12:43.819 --> 00:12:50.779
 connection weight between a1 and a3 

00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:53.600
 since art is equal to aix france and the 

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:57.410
 correction between the first entry and 

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.279
 the neuron hidden here w14 it's going to be the 

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:04.129
 selection to 

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:06.829
 between 1 and 4 and a website so w500 

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:08.600
 with the neural collection to the one who 

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:12.220
 is in the second layer hide and the 

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:14.839
 output neuron that we will note at a 

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.600
 forgiveness incident is also attentive to this 

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:19.100
 that if your correspondents our h2x and 

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.540
 the prediction we will make for our 

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:25.370
 entrance then this is the description of 

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.610
 of the neural network model 

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.610
 artificial
