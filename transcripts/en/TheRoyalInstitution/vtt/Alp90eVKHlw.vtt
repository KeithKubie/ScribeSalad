00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.300
I have here a very very interesting
little book, it's a very thin book

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.120
It's the telephone directory
for London for 1880.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.200
It's worth looking at the first page
because it acknowledges

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.260
the fact that it uses patents
by Bell, Edison and Crossley.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.780
Do you know there isn't a single
Roberts in this telephone directory.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.660
There's only one Jones,
and there are four Smiths.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.480
Most of the companies involved
are railway companies,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.700
because the telegraph
obviously started along railways,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.760
and they quickly cottoned on
to the use of the telephone as well.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.380
Another interesting feature is that the
phone numbers are listed numerically,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.580
So we have number one two three four,
all the way down.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.640
The very first number
is Harvey Brand &amp; Company,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.160
they had the number 1
in the telephone book.
