00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:03.984
- The first thing I
learned to play was a flam.

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:06.098
You start putting them
together, getting the flam

00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:08.756
with a triplet, the flam accent.

00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:10.195
Then it turns into a different rudiment.

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:12.487
You put a diddle, which is
the double note on one hand

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:16.258
on the flam, and that's called the cheese.

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:18.089
There's a lot of funny
names for percussion stuff.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.290
(percussive music)

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.422
There's always more room for improvement,

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:23.348
especially with my SAT scores.

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:25.979
Some people come in talented,
but that's not enough.

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:28.054
The more you do it, the
better you'll get at it.

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:30.682
You would say talent, and you
need hard work and practice.

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:32.407
- [Man] Hey, trumpets!

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.381
- Push it with the toe.

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:35.486
- [Man] Come back to the bandstand.

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:36.755
- The point of doing that is so your brain

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:39.258
has that muscle memory, that,

00:00:39.258 --> 00:00:41.381
like a second nature kind of thing.

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:42.934
There's no better feeling than practicing

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:45.528
that same, let's say, two measures

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:47.024
(percussive band music)

00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:48.996
and finally getting perfect

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:49.974
like finally, I got it.

00:00:49.974 --> 00:00:51.809
I can move on, this is
gonna sound amazing.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.990
I know it's gonna sound amazing.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.573
(exiting percussive music)
