&gt;&gt; Hello, YouTube.
I'm Ann Veneman, Executive Director of UNICEF.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.770
It's great to be back with YouTube at Davos
for the second year in a

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.940
row.
The topic that's being discussed here at Davos

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.690
this year is a focus on
the economic crisis around the world.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.220
And as we look at the economic crisis, it's
very important not to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.050
forget the world's most vulnerable, those
who live on less than a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.470
dollar a day, particularly those women and
children whose lives are at

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.739
risk, who may not have enough nutrition, food,
may not have access to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.050
essential medicines or the opportunity for
education.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.449
And so as we look at our own economic difficulties,
remember that those

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.299
who are most vulnerable are likely to be impacted
in the greatest ways

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.780
as we suffer from this economic downturn.
Thank you very much.
