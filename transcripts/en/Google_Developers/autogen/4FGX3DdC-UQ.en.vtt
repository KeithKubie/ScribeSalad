this masked information which Brian was

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010
this masked information which Brian was
 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.760
this masked information which Brian was
showing on on the screen which has the

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770
showing on on the screen which has the
 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.560
showing on on the screen which has the
users address also the last four digits

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570

of their backing card and then when the
user confirm it that is when a full

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310
user confirm it that is when a full
 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.920

wallet request is made from within the

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930
wallet request is made from within the
 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.530
wallet request is made from within the
app which gets the proxy card which is a

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540
app which gets the proxy card which is a
 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.050
app which gets the proxy card which is a
one-time use card not exact not the card

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060
one-time use card not exact not the card
 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.400
one-time use card not exact not the card
that the users have in the abalan but a

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410
that the users have in the abalan but a
 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.290
that the users have in the abalan but a
proxy to that which can then be used

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300
proxy to that which can then be used
 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.450
proxy to that which can then be used
from within the app to actually make the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460
from within the app to actually make the
 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.580
from within the app to actually make the
purchase or make the charge on it and so

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590
purchase or make the charge on it and so
 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.410
purchase or make the charge on it and so
this is a two-step very simple API we

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420
this is a two-step very simple API we
 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.730
this is a two-step very simple API we
were you first with a mass followed

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740
were you first with a mass followed
 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.230
were you first with a mass followed
request and then you do the full wallet

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240
request and then you do the full wallet
 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.910
request and then you do the full wallet
request and then the response you will

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920
request and then the response you will
 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.290
request and then the response you will
get what you need which is basically a

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300
get what you need which is basically a
 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.750
get what you need which is basically a
proxy card which you can then charge so

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760
proxy card which you can then charge so
 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.280
proxy card which you can then charge so
the benefit of this approach is that

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290
the benefit of this approach is that
 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.170
the benefit of this approach is that
once you have once you're set up for

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180
once you have once you're set up for
 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.970
once you have once you're set up for
let's say a credit card processing from

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980
let's say a credit card processing from
 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.160
let's say a credit card processing from
it in the app you're accepting users

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170
it in the app you're accepting users
 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.810
it in the app you're accepting users
entering their credit card you're pretty

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820
entering their credit card you're pretty
 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.250
entering their credit card you're pretty
much set up to use Google Wallet instant

much set up to use Google Wallet instant
 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.590
much set up to use Google Wallet instant
buy because you can use the same rails

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600
buy because you can use the same rails
 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.660
buy because you can use the same rails
you get the proxy card almost as if the

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670
you get the proxy card almost as if the
 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.610
you get the proxy card almost as if the
user had typed in their credit card and

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620
user had typed in their credit card and
 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.770
user had typed in their credit card and
then use use it to process the charge as

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780
then use use it to process the charge as
 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.240
then use use it to process the charge as
if you are doing the credit card process

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250
if you are doing the credit card process
 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.430
if you are doing the credit card process
so it's the idea behind this approach

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440
so it's the idea behind this approach
 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.220
so it's the idea behind this approach
was to limit the integration effort

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230
was to limit the integration effort
 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.310
was to limit the integration effort
there the developers will have to do not

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320
there the developers will have to do not
 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.720
there the developers will have to do not
only in the front end but also in the

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730
only in the front end but also in the
 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.680
only in the front end but also in the
back end which is probably more

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690
back end which is probably more
 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.120
back end which is probably more
significant because then they don't have

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130
significant because then they don't have
 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.650
significant because then they don't have
to really integrate anything in the back

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660
to really integrate anything in the back
 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.440
to really integrate anything in the back
end so let me ask you Brian what I just

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450
end so let me ask you Brian what I just
 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.030
end so let me ask you Brian what I just
mentioned it did you experience the same

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040
mentioned it did you experience the same
 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.740
mentioned it did you experience the same
thing did you feel that it was an easier

integration or what are your general
thoughts about integration experience oh

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850
thoughts about integration experience oh
 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.550
thoughts about integration experience oh
as far as the integration was the happy

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560
as far as the integration was the happy
 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.530
as far as the integration was the happy
pets where we just had to implement a

pets where we just had to implement a
 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.000
pets where we just had to implement a
very simple use case on the android app

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010
very simple use case on the android app
 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.820
very simple use case on the android app
side it was really straightforward right

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830
side it was really straightforward right
 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.550
side it was really straightforward right
idea at least the the hope that we had

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560
idea at least the the hope that we had
 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.310
idea at least the the hope that we had
viral we developed this api was to limit

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320
viral we developed this api was to limit
 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.290

the backend changes all together so is

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300
the backend changes all together so is
 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.660
the backend changes all together so is
that something that you also saw did you

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670
that something that you also saw did you
 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.740
that something that you also saw did you
have to make any changes in your

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750
have to make any changes in your
 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.290
have to make any changes in your
back-end right on payment processing

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300
back-end right on payment processing
 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.210
back-end right on payment processing
change usually is not really a simple

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220
change usually is not really a simple
 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.640
change usually is not really a simple
change but in this case the proxy card
