00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.390
We have looked at the request
and response cycle of HTTP,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.300
so now you have a solid
understanding on how HTTP works

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.289
and what a browser actually
does when you visit a website.

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.639
You know how metadata is
attached to both requests

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.550
and responses, and you know how
to request additional documents

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.970
using JavaScript.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.422
Next we'll take a closer
look at the HTTP protocol

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:19.879
and the actual
bytes that are being

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.320
sent back and forth between
the server and the browser.
