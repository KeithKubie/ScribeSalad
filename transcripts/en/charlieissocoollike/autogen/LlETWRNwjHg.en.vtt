and I was like whoa that sounds really

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
and I was like whoa that sounds really
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.429

I don't know but eventually I was like
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.900
I don't know but eventually I was like
okay let's do this I want to write a

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
okay let's do this I want to write a
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.120
okay let's do this I want to write a
science book which I think initially

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
science book which I think initially
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.889
science book which I think initially
they were a bit hesitant about because

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
they were a bit hesitant about because
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.860
they were a bit hesitant about because
science is a massive topic and a very

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
science is a massive topic and a very
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720
science is a massive topic and a very
big undertaking especially for my first

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
big undertaking especially for my first
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.850
big undertaking especially for my first
ever book but credit goes to them they

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
ever book but credit goes to them they
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619
ever book but credit goes to them they
were like okay let's let's give you a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
were like okay let's let's give you a
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.360
were like okay let's let's give you a
shot charlie let's see where this goes

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
shot charlie let's see where this goes
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250
shot charlie let's see where this goes
step one of actually making the thing

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
step one of actually making the thing
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.770
step one of actually making the thing
was figuring out the structure I wanted

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
was figuring out the structure I wanted
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.990
was figuring out the structure I wanted
to give people an overview of all of

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
to give people an overview of all of
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360
to give people an overview of all of
science so I figured it would be best to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
science so I figured it would be best to
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.920
science so I figured it would be best to
start with the very big stuff the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
start with the very big stuff the
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840
start with the very big stuff the
universe and then kind of work my way

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850
universe and then kind of work my way
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.220
universe and then kind of work my way
down from there and that's how I came up

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
down from there and that's how I came up
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.889
down from there and that's how I came up
with the 10 chapter headings I quickly

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
with the 10 chapter headings I quickly
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899
with the 10 chapter headings I quickly
learned that I am a bit of an over

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
learned that I am a bit of an over
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060
learned that I am a bit of an over
writer so the first chapter of the book

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
writer so the first chapter of the book
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.429
writer so the first chapter of the book
was initially 20,000 words long which is

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439
was initially 20,000 words long which is
 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.410
was initially 20,000 words long which is
if I'd gone along that track the whole

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
if I'd gone along that track the whole
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.760
if I'd gone along that track the whole
book would have been like that big

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
book would have been like that big
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.219
book would have been like that big
fortunately I had my editor Romilly who

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
fortunately I had my editor Romilly who
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200
fortunately I had my editor Romilly who
I think got rid of about half of that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
I think got rid of about half of that
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.210
I think got rid of about half of that
first chapter and then also had the very

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
first chapter and then also had the very
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160
first chapter and then also had the very
smart idea of making each chapter get

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
smart idea of making each chapter get
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.050
smart idea of making each chapter get
smaller and smaller as the topics

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
smaller and smaller as the topics
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.219
smaller and smaller as the topics
themselves were getting smaller to kind

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
themselves were getting smaller to kind
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.510
themselves were getting smaller to kind
of reflect the scale of the universe

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
of reflect the scale of the universe
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.289
of reflect the scale of the universe
which was a very smart way of her saying

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299
which was a very smart way of her saying
 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.819
which was a very smart way of her saying
please stop writing so much Charlie at

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
please stop writing so much Charlie at
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.740
please stop writing so much Charlie at
the same time that I was writing the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
the same time that I was writing the
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.539
the same time that I was writing the
book that stuff was getting sent over to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
book that stuff was getting sent over to
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.819
book that stuff was getting sent over to
fran and dave who were working on the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
fran and dave who were working on the
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740
fran and dave who were working on the
illustrations and design respectively

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
illustrations and design respectively
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.940
illustrations and design respectively
for some of the stuff in the book I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
for some of the stuff in the book I
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.260
for some of the stuff in the book I
wrote little notes about what

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
wrote little notes about what
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.330
wrote little notes about what
illustrations and graphics I wanted for

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
illustrations and graphics I wanted for
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609
illustrations and graphics I wanted for
example I asked for a personified

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
example I asked for a personified
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.950
example I asked for a personified
version of gravity that was also a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
version of gravity that was also a
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.950
version of gravity that was also a
hipster and that's what I got but there

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
hipster and that's what I got but there
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.270
hipster and that's what I got but there
was also a good amount of stuff that I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
was also a good amount of stuff that I
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219
was also a good amount of stuff that I
didn't ask for that they just put in

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
didn't ask for that they just put in
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.889
didn't ask for that they just put in
because they're great for example the we

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
because they're great for example the we
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
illustration which i think is probably
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.170

designed the cover of the book which was

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
designed the cover of the book which was
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.820
designed the cover of the book which was
kind of inspired by the index cards that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
kind of inspired by the index cards that
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.170
kind of inspired by the index cards that
I have in the background of some of my

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
I have in the background of some of my
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.030
I have in the background of some of my
videos that went through

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
videos that went through
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.979
videos that went through
of different iterations like different

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
of different iterations like different
 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.660
of different iterations like different

him my idea for what I thought the cover
 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.339
him my idea for what I thought the cover
should be that one didn't get approved

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349
should be that one didn't get approved
 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.890
should be that one didn't get approved
needless to say and now all it's

bloomin book although I really do hope

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
bloomin book although I really do hope
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.490
bloomin book although I really do hope
that people who are already science fans

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
that people who are already science fans
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.740
that people who are already science fans
will enjoy this book the reason I wrote

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
will enjoy this book the reason I wrote
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.750
will enjoy this book the reason I wrote
it is because I want to get to the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
it is because I want to get to the
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.670
it is because I want to get to the
people who aren't science fans yet I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
people who aren't science fans yet I
 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.380
people who aren't science fans yet I
want this book to be and kind of like an

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
want this book to be and kind of like an
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.140
want this book to be and kind of like an
in to the fandom of science and that's

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
in to the fandom of science and that's
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.430
in to the fandom of science and that's
why it was so important to me that it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
why it was so important to me that it
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280
why it was so important to me that it
feel like oh I could I could read this

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
