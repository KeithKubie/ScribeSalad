00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.420
&gt;&gt; So, great.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.480 position:59%
So, at this point, I'm very pleased to
be able to introduce Monica Mohindra.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.390 position:75%
Monica is head of program coordination and
communications for the Veteran's History Project

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.060 position:75%
at the Library of Congress, which I believe is
actually celebrating its 15th anniversary today.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.920 position:63%
In the ten years that Monica's been with
the project, she's been proud to serve

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.440
as the primary liaison responsible
for coordinating a range

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.380
of collaborative efforts involving
such projects and organizations

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.260 position:67%
as the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial, Princess
Cruises, PBS, Ken Burns Florentine Films,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.280
The History Channel, and the
Department of Veteran Affairs.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.360 position:72%
So, without further ado, I'm going to go
ahead and hand it over to Monica, and, Monica,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.160 position:66%
thank you for being here and take it away.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.830
&gt;&gt; Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.370
I'm very happy to be here, and,
Michael, you stole my thunder.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.650 position:64%
Yes. This is our 15th anniversary today,
and we're, it couldn't be a better moment

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.120
than to be here with you and
we appreciate the opportunity.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.910 position:64%
I'm going to get started with the slides,
and, so, what I want to do is just kind

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:43.960 position:69%
of outline what the plan is for my time
with you and assure you that there's plenty,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.960 position:63%
going to be plenty of time for questions
at the end, and I'll do any best

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.420 position:56%
to answer questions as they come up.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.020 position:70%
I see some familiar names participating, and,
so, I hope some of those folks will chime

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.460 position:72%
in with specifics because I know they've
participated with the project for a long time.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.640 position:58%
Like I see Byron Haldeman [phonetic].

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.680 position:66%
Hello. So, today, I'm going to start with
a brief introduction to the project itself

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.560
with the assumption that most
of you aren't super familiar

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.490
with the background of the project.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.810 position:73%
And then I'll go into two major ways of how
the project can be used in a classroom setting.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.390 position:72%
The first will be accessing and using existing
collections through a variety of means

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.620 position:69%
and with the resources that my colleagues
in, at outreach have created as well as some

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.880
that we've developed within the
project for use in the classroom,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.430
and then the second way is
working with your students

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.950 position:70%
to actually create primary source collections
through the Veteran's History Project.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.940 position:75%
So, I'll go into the specifics of both of those.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.640 position:70%
And I'll start with sort of how to get into
the existing collections because there's lots

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.640 position:63%
of different ways to do that and lots
of curated sections, and then as I said,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.770 position:69%
there will be time at the end for questions.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.880
So, a little bit about the
background about the project.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.000
As Michael said and as I said,
this is our 15th anniversary today.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.420
It was signed unanimously into
law by both Houses of Congress

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.740 position:75%
and by the time President Bill Clinton on this
day in 2000, and the idea was to get individuals

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.200 position:69%
around the country to interview the veterans
in their lives, in their communities,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.820 position:61%
and voluntarily submit those interviews
to the Veteran's History Project.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.770
So, that's the basis.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.400 position:70%
It was actually originally the Veteran's Oral
History Project but quickly realized the need

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.390 position:75%
to incorporate opportunities for other primary
sources that spoke to the first person narrative

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.570 position:70%
of veteran's experience to be more inclusive.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.120
At the time, the focus was on going

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.730
after the more senior veterans
first, so, at the time World War I.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.380
And at the time, we weren't yet
engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.980 position:70%
So, the idea was how to make sure that we can
get those more senior compelling first person

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.720
narratives before they were lost
and before the generations who have

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.210
that one-on-one experience were
not able to share them with us.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.710 position:59%
So, it expanded to include collections
of original photographs, letters,

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.730
documents that also share that
first person narrative, and, so,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.050 position:75%
that's really what makes the collection so rich.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.130
We're approaching, with insight,
is that important milestone

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:39.080 position:75%
of a hundred thousand veterans were very excited
about that, but it's a double edged sword

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.650 position:67%
because every veteran's story is important.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.360 position:72%
So, there's nothing more important about
those first 100,000 or about the next 100,000.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.340 position:63%
It's just nice to recognize that we have
reached a reference point, a milestone,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.580
that indicates a level of
inclusivity of the collections.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.840 position:59%
What you see here is our homepage and
is a great thing to keep returning to.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.610 position:59%
Just to point out a few things because
I know it's not always the easiest

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.930
to decipher right away.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.000 position:70%
Our 15 minute video is available up in the
right hand corner, and I definitely recommend

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.850 position:64%
that as a great way to just kind of get
started on how to create the collections.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.550 position:63%
And then we're going to be talking about
ways to access existing collections.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:32.190 position:75%
So, the first thing I'd like to point out is our
blog which is something we're increasingly using

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.430 position:69%
as a place to help share curated
collections appropriate for broad audiences.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.280
You'll see here the latest example.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.290 position:69%
We have two of our staff, one a reference
specialist and another a liaison specialist,

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:55.080 position:56%
who are working to really dig deep
and find elements in the collections

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.820 position:59%
that will be relevant to people across
all different kinds of audiences,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.030
whether we're talking just the
casual observer or students.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.440
The topics are as universal as we
did a whole series with several

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.340 position:63%
of our staff investigating different
collections last winter along with theme

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.660 position:75%
of missing home and being home for the holidays.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.490
And, so, you can dig into the
archive of the blog and find those,

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:31.420 position:69%
or as specific to military experience, but
as accessible and relatable as a few stories

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.500 position:72%
that talked about, you know, what was that
one food element that sort of gave you comfort

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.640
in the midst of all the conflict.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.780
And one of the things that we have
found that seemed to be the kind

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.900 position:56%
of elemental experience was peaches.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:52.300 position:75%
So, you have a really broad way of engaging with
the collections but finding very specific ones.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.660 position:72%
I'm going to jump back just really quick to
show you exactly where you can find that blog.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.980 position:56%
There is an orange button VHP blog
down in the bottom left hand corner,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.860 position:59%
and then that brings you to this page.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.880 position:69%
If you scroll down on this page, what
you'll find when you're on the live website,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:18.810 position:75%
not on this slide, what you'll find is a section
of tags, and if you want to get to all 67

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.000
of the currently curated sort
of blogs, what you'll get,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.610 position:66%
what you'll find is the Veteran's History
Project tag; and that'll get you to a page

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.980
with all of the different topics
that we've covered to this point.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.460 position:59%
We do answer questions pretty quickly.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.090
It's a great way to -- yes, Dinah.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.300 position:67%
I'll answer your question in just a second.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:50.350 position:73%
The comments in the blog are a great way to
interact and get questions answered right away,

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.180
but there are also a place we're
typically asking for participation.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.600 position:75%
You know, if there's a particular theme or topic
that you'd like to see explored on the blog.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.170
That's a great place to have that
featured and paid attention to

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.730
or have your students go ahead
and interact directly there.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.630
So, back to the homepage one more
time so that I can show that URL.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:22.360 position:64%
As Dinah asks for, it's www.loc.gov/vets,
as in V-E-T-S.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.050
Thanks, Wally.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.780
Can everyone see this?

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.280
On this side?

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:25.790
Great. Yeah.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.620
That's exactly it.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.520
That's the URL.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.230
Thank you.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.330
Fantastic.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:35.050 position:56%
Thanks for the question and thanks
for the help getting the answer out.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:40.340
So, the other place, and here, I'm
going to jump around a little bit.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.230 position:72%
I hope I'm not giving you, your eyes whiplash.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:50.230 position:75%
So, the other place that we find collections and
curated collections, if you look in the center,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:56.350 position:75%
right now we have a collection up called, this
is always our experiencing war section is always

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.850
where we have our online exhibits.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.110
The current one is end of World
War II, the 70th anniversary.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:07.290 position:72%
If you were to click on that on the live page,
what you would find is this wonderful display

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.890
with the collections that have
been curated to express that theme,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.370
and what's nice about this
is that we work really hard

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.330 position:58%
to show the diversity of our content.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.590 position:64%
It's particularly nice for situations
where you're having students try and come

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.530 position:66%
at the topics from a few different angles.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:31.180 position:72%
And when we talk about diversity, we're really
talking about not just ethnic and racial

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:36.820 position:67%
and background diversity, but from all
across the country, from branch of service,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.970 position:64%
from conflict, from every kind of way
you can slice it, even faith backgrounds.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:49.270 position:67%
So, we really try to focus that both for
our efforts in trying to accrue collections

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.530
but also specifically in
trying to highlight collections

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.370 position:63%
and bring them to the forefront for use.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:03.140 position:70%
So, on this page, what you'll want to do when
you get there is scroll again to the bottom

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:09.370 position:69%
of it, and what you'll find when you do that
is a section entitled "Stories by Theme";

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.120 position:66%
and you'll get to all of our
experiencing war releases listed by theme.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.280
I'm proud to say we're at 50 now
and 51 will be released next week

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.830 position:66%
in commemoration of that 15th anniversary.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:29.070 position:58%
So, here is a really great easy break
down of existing topics to explore.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.670 position:75%
Obviously, I shouldn't have favorites, but I do.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.410 position:67%
Some include chaplains on a divine mission.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:41.460 position:69%
We're really excited about our efforts which
began about four years ago, five years ago,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.820 position:69%
to try and capture the stories of
chaplains of all different faith backgrounds

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:51.460 position:72%
because we discovered that was a sort of
underrepresented population in our collections

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.980 position:59%
in terms of exploring that type of
service within the veteran experience.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:03.400 position:73%
And some of the others that are really fun are
stories from the stacks, staff picks, but also,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.470 position:59%
you can find ones that have curricular
ties or personal interests ties

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:15.770 position:67%
and hopefully share a slightly different
slice of specifically the human experience.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:22.620 position:61%
Our goal really is to look at this from
the perspective of the human experience

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:28.880 position:56%
as opposed to, you know, tell us the
narrative of a particular combat.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.590
We're looking for the personal
narrative in each veteran's story.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:42.570
So, again, to get to this next
page I'm going to show you.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.320
Go back to the homepage.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.300
I'm not going to whip through
that now, but that,

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.360
you would go back to the homepage
to get to how to participate.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.970 position:66%
And the reason I want to point this out
just quickly, I'll come back to this topic

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:04.100 position:66%
in greater depth, but this is an area that
we have specifically for helping students

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:10.240 position:70%
and educators in creating the primary source
of the Veteran's History Project collections.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.860 position:72%
And I'm going to make a real distinction here.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:17.960 position:64%
We're not just talking about oral
histories, particularly now with the ages

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.340 position:70%
of World War II veterans that we're working
with, you know, octogenarians, nonagenarians,

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.270
and also with the predominance
of World War I as a topic.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:32.300 position:67%
What we're finding is that people are
looking for what to do with the collections

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:38.360 position:63%
of photographs and letters and documents
that they're finding in their closets

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.770
and their attics and their garages
that will need a place to go,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.030
and this is a really great
way, also, to engage students

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.760 position:63%
in creating a primary source collection.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.710
And I'll get a little bit more
into that, but I wanted you to know

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.290
that this page exists for
your benefit and for theirs.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.020
Thanks, Kathleen.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.640
What about artistic expressions
as well as stories?

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:12.010 position:63%
Yes. In fact, we're about to have an
onsite exhibit, a temporary exhibit here

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:17.140 position:58%
in the coming weeks, about
portraits that were taken during war.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.060
We also accept elements of
poetry, that sort of thing,

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:27.030 position:56%
as long as it is that first person
descriptive narrative of the veteran

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.840 position:56%
and conducted from that perspective.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.030
If you're looking, Kathleen,
specifically for some great ones,

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.180
Joseph Farris who unfortunately I
just learned passed away this year.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:44.350 position:73%
Farris, F-A-R-R-I-S, has a great collection, so
does Mimi Lester and there are several others.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.220 position:59%
I can certainly send you more
information about artistic expressions

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.900
in the existing stories on
a later date or offline.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:14:01.540
So, when we're talking about
ways to -- oh, dear.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:09.130
Oh. These slides are not loading.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.290
Oh, dear. Okay.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:20.080 position:72%
Well, I will describe this slide, and you will
help me with your prodigious imaginations.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.600
This is a primary source
analysis tool that my colleagues

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.130
in educational outreach have
available through their website,

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.970 position:73%
and we'll make sure that you get this URL also.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.440
I wanted to point it out because
what it does is it enables to you

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.170 position:64%
to choose oral history specifically, and
then there are several guiding questions.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.670
You can use it with your students.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.200
You can use it for yourself.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.080
You can hand it directly to them.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.290
There are three sections.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:52.040 position:72%
So, observation, reflection, and questions,
and in each section, there's a pull down menu.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.990 position:64%
You can either have them do it themselves
or you can use the pull down menu

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.800 position:73%
with selected prompts to help them get through.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.680 position:58%
And what I particularly like about
it, and I think is useful when trying

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.140
to pair our resources with the
tools that they've provided,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:12.280 position:63%
is that you can do further
investigation with these primary sources

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.480
in the Veteran's History Project by
choosing oral history or documents.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.800
There's different ways to do it.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.770 position:72%
And it really points out to me the easy ways
you can use primary sources to engage students

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.110 position:58%
and develop critical thinking skills.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:35.320 position:66%
A big part for us about why world history
is important and why specifically thinking

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:42.080 position:69%
about oral history as important as a primary
resource is the authentic voice verses the,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.380 position:58%
quote unquote, "authoritative voice".

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:51.190 position:69%
And from our purposes, as I mentioned, that
we work really hard to have the diversity --

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:55.910
thank you, Michael -- to
have the diversity expressed.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.510
We really feel it also helps
give a real democratized voice.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:07.090 position:61%
You can have students specifically look
for veterans from their particular area

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.210
of the country, from their
particular background, and, so,

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:15.660 position:64%
you're getting that authentic perspective
to investigate a topic further;

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.090 position:73%
but you're able to refine the lens to something

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.250
that may be extremely approachable
to your students.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:29.830 position:59%
The next slide, it was an example of a
letter that was being used by students

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.840
that they described their
reaction to in this slide.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.720
It's a wonderful primary
source of a letter that goes on

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:43.250
and on in a prose that's
just a gorgeous 1944 prose.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.150 position:59%
Bear with my sick cold infected voice.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.940
I'll read just a few lines
so you get a sense of it.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.640 position:70%
"My darling Jamie, hope this gets out to you.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.420
It will be the last note
from me for a long time.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.800
Don't worry, angel.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.380 position:72%
I'll get in touch with you first chance I get.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.680 position:69%
Believe me, darling, I'm feeling
wonderfully well and absolutely squared away

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.620
for anything that can come my way."

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:14.000 position:67%
And I think what's so wonderful about these
documents and the opportunity to see them

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.140 position:66%
in their handwriting and in their entirety

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:27.040 position:72%
for the students is it really personalizes the
experience that lets them see beyond their,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.920
it lets them expand past their
presumptions as you can see

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.010
as they're reflecting here
in these student blog pieces.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.620 position:73%
The other thing that's really wonderful about
it, and not necessarily reflected in this blog,

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.580 position:59%
but I think is easy to incorporate in
a classroom setting is the opportunity

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:50.720 position:75%
to think about, in this particular case, is this
incredibly, it's a love note that's going on

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.230 position:56%
and on in this gorgeous handwriting,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:59.950 position:63%
and the questions that arise immediately
are what does this veteran talk about?

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.530
What doesn't he talk about?

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:07.040 position:56%
And why? This happens to be a letter
that doesn't have anything redacted.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:15.670 position:66%
And, so, I know that that was a big issue
to be talking about, for lots of veterans,

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:19.150
they wanted to make sure that
when their letters arrived home,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:24.670 position:63%
they were visually an expression of, you
know, them thinking about their families

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.830 position:69%
and they didn't want all the black lines all
across their letters for their redaction.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.670 position:63%
So, that sends you in a couple different
directions and gives lots of opportunity

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.800 position:58%
for the students for personal impact.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:44.780 position:70%
We, just another quick example, we had a
group of students in, oh, probably about five

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:52.660 position:63%
or six years ago, and we always, when
students come in to present collections,

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.960 position:59%
we talked to them about the
experience, what it was like for them.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.590 position:63%
We try and hear what they're reflections
are having created the primary source.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.730
So, I do my best to put a
few of them on the spot,

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.160 position:70%
especially when they're high school students.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.820
That's pretty fun.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:13.270
And they always come up with
these really fantastic answers.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:18.170 position:66%
One thing that has always struck out to
me is this one student's answer which was,

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:23.890 position:75%
that she was so excited to do this project
after, she was trepidatious at first but excited

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:29.220 position:66%
to do this project with her father because
he had served in the Persian Gulf War.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:36.220 position:73%
And, you know, at the time, we were deeply
involved in Iraq and Afghanistan, and she said,

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.510
"You know, I didn't even know
that the Persian Gulf War existed.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:46.670
I hadn't heard the term until I
did this project with my dad."

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.660 position:64%
And it just really struck me at the time.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.420
I couldn't believe she hadn't
even heard of the term.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:56.900 position:69%
So, I went and I looked at the textbook that
she was used that apparently at the time,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.760
lots of social studies teachers
were using around the country,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.220 position:58%
and there was literally one
paragraph about the Persian Gulf War.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:12.970 position:66%
And, so, this opportunity gave her a
chance not only to know her father better,

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.930 position:64%
but to understand the connections between
all the conflicts and our shared history

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:23.730
as a result, an opportunity
to dig deeper, which she did.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:30.490 position:73%
She then went on to look at other collections
out of personal interest about the Persian Gulf

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.900
in our collections and apparently
found it quite gratifying.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:41.750 position:69%
The other things that we've seen teachers
do really successfully to capture and expand

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.390
on student reflections include
creating Wiki's with them.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.260
As you see here, blogs.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:55.510 position:73%
One really creative exercise that I saw was the
students actually wrote letters to the veterans

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:00.180
or the family members of the
collections that they were viewing.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.360
They didn't know them.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.530 position:72%
They hadn't created the interviews themselves.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:09.660 position:69%
They were simply write heartfelt letters
about their experience back to the veterans,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.470 position:61%
and having it be targeted towards them,

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:18.750 position:61%
I think really illuminated a human
connection you might not otherwise see.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.110
Just another point on that.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.810 position:66%
Once a student does, I just gave the
example of the student who went and looked

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:30.370 position:73%
at other Persian Gulf collections, once a
student or a classroom or a project is targeted

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.860 position:56%
around a specific kind of collection
or a specific kind of experience,

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.140
it's also really cool to have them
have the opportunity to go back

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:46.970 position:70%
through the digitized collections and look
for others from the veterans who maybe served

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:52.540 position:64%
from a similar battle or in the same
unit or from the same town or background.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.670 position:69%
What I like about that and what I take every
opportunity to do to share with students is

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:04.780 position:58%
to talk a little bit about that work
is very similar to what we see happen

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:09.420
with researchers every week
here in our collections.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:17.420 position:73%
So, going back in and looking for corroborating
or validating other stories that relate

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.450
to the one that they've experienced
is exactly what researchers like.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:28.370 position:58%
That everyone from folks from the
DPMO who are looking to find POW/MIAs

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:37.730 position:70%
and using our collections to help identify
ways to do that to people looking to make PBS

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.850
or HBO sets more authentic by
having better images on the walls

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.790 position:56%
to authors of fiction or nonfiction.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.320
That's the kind of work those
people are doing, and, so,

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.690 position:75%
these students are engaged in that similar work.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:54.010 position:72%
It's always really exciting to share that with
them, especially when they are able to come

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.980 position:59%
to the building, but also just when
they can see it for themselves online.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:07.420 position:75%
Our colleagues in, at outreach have also created
with us a couple of curated primary source sets

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:12.820 position:63%
with attendant tools to help make them
a little easier to use in the classroom.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.110 position:56%
The nice thing about these is that
they have been specifically selected

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.110 position:73%
to not be offensive for a wide variety of ages.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:26.780 position:72%
It's a great way participation for the project
is really limited to tenth grade and above,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.900 position:70%
but use of the project, we're really trying
to make it as broadly accessible as possible.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:37.970 position:70%
What you see here is the teacher page from
which you can get to the primary source sets.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:51.280
Which are here, and what you'll see
on these is the veteran's stories,

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:59.790 position:69%
the Veteran's History Project, and
veteran's story struggles for participation.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:04.920 position:72%
Both primary source that have several specific
collections, and then there are tools;

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.210
how to put those straight
into a classroom setting.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:13.960 position:66%
Here's an example of what that looks like.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.100
So, you see that there are
analysis tools and guides and a PDF

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.970
and you get a really broad range
of different kinds of experiences.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:48.730 position:70%
One of the tools that's available is
analyzing oral histories, and it's something,

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:53.030 position:63%
this is also where you get that analysis
tool that I had mentioned earlier.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.950
And this is really great.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:03.070 position:69%
All of these resources are shared so far are
really helpful for taking what's existing

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.110 position:75%
and using it in a variety of classroom settings.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.190
But the other way to participate
with our collections is actually

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:15.970
to generate the primary source,
is actually to create an interview

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.940
or to pull together a collection
of original materials.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:29.650 position:69%
And one of the fantastic benefits of that is
having the students work together in teams

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:35.320 position:70%
or individually with a veteran, each to bring
a story to the surface and give it life.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.020
There's something extremely
empowering about that experience,

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.010 position:67%
both for the students and for the veterans.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:49.500 position:70%
They co-create something which lasts for
posterity is saved for history at the Library

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.010
of Congress, and there's something
about creating that primary source

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:58.440 position:59%
and having it preserved at the Library
of Congress that is super validating

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:04.090
for both people or the team of
people engaged in that effort,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:10.260 position:69%
to know that that collection is resident in
the place, you know, with the baseball cards

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.590 position:67%
from the Negro leagues, if that's important
to you, or to presidential personal papers.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:22.090 position:67%
To have it be taken that seriously and have
it count towards the larger picture is,

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:29.140 position:59%
I know that that's fuzzy curriculum,
but we see that it makes broad impacts

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:35.370
for more specific curriculum
goals and objectives.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:40.680 position:58%
Somebody mentioned earlier, I think
it was Kathleen, about creative works

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:47.260
in the existing collections,
but the other aspect of this is

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.760 position:63%
that not only does creating this primary
source, if you engage your students

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:59.310 position:72%
with the actual collections in terms of
creating it, not only is there the opportunity

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.870
for getting them to help pull
those together and talking

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:09.470 position:69%
about how those artistic works can be part
of the larger story of a personal narrative,

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:14.440 position:56%
but one thing that we're seeing more
and more of is classroom projects

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:20.590
that take the existing oral history
and turn it into something else.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.360
A starting off point for
creating works themselves.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.580
There have been a couple of
fantastic examples of that.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:32.810 position:61%
In just a minute I'm going to play this
clip, but I want to give a few examples

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.920
so that you have a sense
of what I'm talking about.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.510
Several years ago, there was
a group of students working

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:46.000 position:66%
on the Philadelphia Student Mural Project,
and they had previously done some murals

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.650 position:70%
with some veterans and there was an effort to
specifically do a mural with Tuskegee Airmen.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:55.960 position:56%
And we got connected to them through
a variety of different sources

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.340 position:70%
and were able to provide for them a workshop.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:06.300 position:63%
And what they did was they did, targeted
oral histories with Tuskegee Airmen,

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.040
and then did the mural, and
about the airmen's experience.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.760 position:61%
And what we heard from all participants
from all sides, including the artists,

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.560
the teaching artists that
helped them create the mural,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.240 position:70%
was that it was a much more engaged in-depth.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.250
And every step of the process, it
was essentially a better product,

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:32.140 position:73%
whether you were looking at it from an artistic
standard or from meeting curricular objectives

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:38.200 position:66%
or from connecting people in communities
that it, by using the oral history process

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.820 position:63%
through the Veteran's History Project as
a vehicle for deriving greater meaning,

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.410 position:73%
they were able to far exceed their expectations

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.590
for what they were trying
to accomplish artistically.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:52.370
And it's just really cool
to hear all about that.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.360 position:64%
This is another great example, and we're
going to try our best to play it for you,

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:03.720
is this three minute clip of one of
two of the honorable mention videos

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.070 position:67%
that were awarded honorable mentions in the
White House Film Festival this past year

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:14.210
who showcased the student works
showcasing their VHP activity.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:18.980 position:67%
So, it's a great example not of how
students can turn this into something else,

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.750
but what the impact is for the
students and for the community.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.950
So, bear with me.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.730
I'm going to try and play this.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.840
&gt;&gt; Dear students, thank you
for your kindness to Ed.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.880
Thank you for the grand Veteran's
Day card that you sent him.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.220
I'm looking at it right now.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.430
I've placed it with Ed's high
school graduation picture.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.580
The flag that was on his coffin
in a photo of him in the service.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.880
Thank you for letting Ed be a part

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.220
of the Veteran's History Project
at the Library of Congress.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.980 position:58%
Ed enjoyed so very much when he would
meet and speak with you young people.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.950
It was an honor for him.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:55.290 position:59%
Ed passed away on December 20th, 2012.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:59.770 position:70%
He had a rough year health-wise, but the best
occasions he attended were those involving

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:00.980
young people.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.500
Very truly yours, Adele S. Fabish.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.180
&gt;&gt; I admire this boy because he's
got his future to look forward to.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.480
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name's Ty.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.420 position:61%
I'm part of the Harlem Veteran Project.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.880
I currently have a question
on what type of aircraft were

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.140
on his carrier during World War II.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.510 position:59%
So, I'm going to be heading over to
his place, see if he can identify some

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:30.330 position:73%
of the aircraft I'm going to print out for him.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:48.980 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Mr. Terreberry, what does it mean
to you knowing that Ty's working on it,

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:59.000 position:61%
knowing that he hopes to get into the
Navy, or is heading down into the Navy?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.990
&gt;&gt; I admire Ty for what he's doing.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:11.270 position:58%
&gt;&gt; I honestly think I don't deserve
some of the things that he just said.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:15.740
It's, I just feel like that I'm
just a regular high school student

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.760
that has so many big aspirations.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.290
&gt;&gt; No, you're not.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:19.570
&gt;&gt; And --

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.810
&gt;&gt; No, you're not.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:22.660
No, you're not.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:30.980 position:75%
You're an exceptionally young man with a future,
and we need more people, more people like you.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.070
&gt;&gt; The Crabb family.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:39.250
I worked on Mr. Crabb's documentary
last year, and unfortunately,

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.240 position:59%
he passed away around three weeks ago.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:48.390
In lieu of flowers or any other
sort of donations to the family,

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.310 position:64%
they decided to donate it to the project.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.950 position:58%
So, I'm going right now to personally
thank them not only for that,

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.300
but for all of the other
contributions in my life.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:54.780
&gt;&gt; These are his shirts.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.770 position:69%
&gt;&gt; He wore black jeans and flannel shirts --

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:56.340
&gt;&gt; Every day of his life.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:56.910
&gt;&gt; Every day of his life.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:57.570
&gt;&gt; So, we thought it'd be good.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.610 position:69%
&gt;&gt; I think for any student going through
this project, there are certain life lessons

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:00.450
that you don't get out of a book.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.220
&gt;&gt; Both of my grandparents have
been a huge part of my kid's lives,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.720
and my daughter is only four
years old and my son is two.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.160
So, the memories that they have
with him will fade over time.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.110 position:63%
At his visitation, to hear his voice
playing in the background just showed me

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.160 position:64%
that he's just still here with all of us.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.230 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Dear veterans, I write this letter in hopes
that someone somewhere will hear this call.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.360 position:64%
Students from Harlem High School will
continue to hear and record your stories.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.760 position:72%
For one of the greatest accomplishments a high
school student can have is documenting our

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.150
hero's history.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.280 position:72%
Lastly, know that as long as you bravely
serve our nation, we will always be listening.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.510
Yours truly, Michael Fenters.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:25.200
[ Music ]

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.630 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Thanks for bearing with me, everyone.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.600
I hope that you feel as I
do that it was worth it.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.860 position:66%
I just think that's a really great example

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:37.590 position:56%
of the students really pouring their
personal energy into this effort.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:43.520 position:66%
That particular program is both happening
in the classroom an as an extracurricular,

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.130
which is a model we've seen in lots
of classrooms across the country.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:55.420 position:70%
Either examples include schools where they're
doing it almost like a yearbook model.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.120
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.800
It's nice to see the feedback.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.110
Thanks, Cindy and Christina.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:06.630 position:66%
They're doing models very similar to that
where there's a portion of it that happens

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.700
in a classroom setting and
then it's an afterschool club,

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.730 position:58%
almost like a yearbook would be where
they produce a coffee table book

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.060 position:67%
that then goes out to the entire community.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:23.580 position:64%
I've seen other examples where they do it
similar to a big read where, at the end,

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:30.630 position:69%
everyone gets an opportunity to select a
vignette, and then they create a documentary

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:34.110
that the whole community watches
through a series of events.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:40.420 position:72%
Somebody earlier talked about teachers looking
for ways to connect students with curriculum

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.460
and build the skill sets
needed for real world tasks.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:49.680 position:63%
What we're seeing with these kinds of
outputs is the ability to take advantage

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.210
of using authentic material
primary sources to engage with them

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.900 position:73%
on exactly that, on these kinds of rural tasks.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.350
So, one of the things that we
wanted to be able to -- oh, yeah.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.630 position:64%
It is similar to the Paper Clips Project.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.960
That's true.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.170
One of the things that we
just were able to produce

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:19.400 position:66%
with the Oral History Association is they,
in their wonderful way, call it a pamphlet

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:26.090 position:70%
which I just love because it's 95 pages long,
but there is, and you can get this for $15

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.200
on Amazon and on Barnes and Noble.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.830 position:66%
It's called "Doing Veterans Oral History".

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:37.290 position:69%
But there is an entire chapter, about 30
pages, devoted to educators and to students,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:42.110 position:69%
if you want something a little bit more than
what we have available through our field kit

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.460 position:61%
on our website and our 15 minute video.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:50.740 position:73%
This gives you the opportunity to go through it
or hand it to your students with that scholarly

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.550
or academic lens of the best
practices of oral history.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.320
That section that's geared
just towards educators,

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.690
I'm able to provide for you
as a text PDF for free.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.220 position:56%
You don't have to purchase the
whole book, but if you're interested

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.600 position:58%
in the whole book, it is really nice.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:13.690 position:75%
And like I said, you can purchase that on Amazon
or Barnes and Noble, or if you would like,

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:19.010 position:64%
you can get it from us, just the
educator's portion, and we'll be offering

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:23.200
that in a few different packages
in a coming year.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.840
But that's something I can offer to
you for participating in this now.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.620 position:72%
And, again, it's a student resource, in a way,

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.320
to add on to the existing
resources we have on our website.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.640 position:58%
Just wanted to point that out to you.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:42.680 position:64%
You can also find that information about
it on Oral History Association's website.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.830 position:64%
The other thing that we have started this
year through a generous gift from Bill

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:54.880 position:58%
and Buffy Cafritz's Family Foundation
is a campaign specifically aimed

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:01.680 position:73%
at recording the stories of World War II
veterans from the Washington Metropolitan area.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.830
Bill Cafritz passed away last year,
and he had served in World War II

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:12.730 position:59%
and had been awarded a Purple Heart;
but it turned out that very few people

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.390 position:56%
in his life actually knew about that
because he didn't talk about it.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:24.510 position:73%
And, so, it was just sort of a wonderful
cinergy of things come together for making sure

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.970 position:56%
that DC World War II veterans
understood we wanted them to be part

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:32.180 position:75%
of this historic milestone of the first 100,000.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.520 position:61%
Get your stories in there before you're
not part of that first milestone.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.180 position:64%
The reason I'm sharing it here is because
we're hoping to turn this into a template

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.290
that other communities could
use, and we'll have elements

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:50.340 position:63%
of it available for people to customize.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.840 position:70%
So, in a situation like the Harlem Veteran's
History Project, it might make a lot of sense

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.930 position:72%
for them to sort of plug and play and use some
of the tools that we're creating around this.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.470
So, I just kind of wanted to
bring that to your attention.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:05.940
We're also finding that the whole
notion of our history's future is

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:12.390 position:63%
in your hands is something that's really
resonating with high school students

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.230
who have seen this campaign
and images from this campaign.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:23.960
So, I think I'm right in time to
leave plenty of time for questions.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.900
So, please, fire away.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.650
&gt;&gt; Okay. Monica, I've also received
a couple questions separately.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:35.720 position:61%
So, I'll ask you the first couple
while other people ask their questions.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.180
You ready?

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:45.610 position:69%
So, first question is: Are there particular
resources from the Veteran's History Project

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:50.220
that appear to be, you know, more
proper downloads by teachers?

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.820 position:61%
Are you able to see any patterns there?

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.980
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:03.600 position:59%
I think historically across the
board, World War II has been something

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.300 position:64%
that folks are really gravitating
towards, but in the past couple of years,

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.430 position:63%
we've seen a real shift towards Vietnam.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:15.230 position:72%
We're actually the centerpiece of the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial Foundation Curriculum Guide.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:20.640 position:61%
They offer lots of tools in general for
teaching Vietnam, and we're used as,

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.790
what I believe to be really
essential, enriching part of that.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:31.040 position:66%
So, I know that that's a broad brush
stroke, but that's what we've seen so far.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.160
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.320 position:66%
And that is Christina also has a question.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.440
She asks: Can you walk us
through teachers/students,

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.400 position:58%
what they would actually submit
interviews and other primary sources?

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:50.290 position:61%
In other words, how would they go about
sort of participating in the process?

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.870
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:59.780 position:66%
It's the "how to participate" page that I
showed you on that 15 minute video as well

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.460
as our field kit are really
essential in doing that,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:06.240
and you can find all of those
through the homepage.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.970 position:66%
But the process is pretty straightforward.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:15.140
If you're going to do an interview,
you simply use the required forms.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.430 position:58%
You set up the conversation with the
veteran, and you record an interview.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:24.010
One interview per recordable
media, 30 minutes or longer.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:30.180 position:64%
And with all the forms packaged together,
each recording with each set of forms,

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.980 position:73%
and you submit them to the Library of Congress.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:39.180 position:64%
I'm going to keep it broad there because
those resources are wildly accessible off

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:39.940
the homepage.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.200
But, Christina, if you have any
specific questions beyond that,

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.630
I'd be happy to answer them.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:53.300
I see that Cindy Witch asks:
Are the collections growing,

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.140 position:59%
and do you find the veterans are
willing to share their personal items?

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.250
Really great question, Cindy.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.040
The collections are growing.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.400
We get about 100 collections
per week on average.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:11.190
More when you might expect teachers
to be sending us troves of them.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:17.250 position:61%
Unless when there's lulls in schedules,
but on average, about 100 per week.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:21.970
And veterans are willing to
share their personal items,

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.410
especially when they know they're
coming to the Library of Congress.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.910
It can be daunting to face
the whole original question.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:34.320 position:72%
You know, why do they need our originals, but,
you know, there are floods, fires, I mean,

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.370 position:72%
I hate to go to the super dramatic right
away, but there are lots of reasons that we're

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.380 position:63%
in the business of protecting originals.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.520 position:69%
And what we've been finding is that families
actually really appreciate the opportunity

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.910 position:58%
to know that the originals are here
and being used for research purposes.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:57.370
Sorry. I just want to try and
read through the questions.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:57.780
[inaudible] Go for it.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.600
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.870
I had one more question for you.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:01.460 position:59%
I'm getting some questions separately.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:06.790 position:75%
This is more of a personal one which is: How did
you get involved with Veteran's History Project?

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.270 position:75%
What is your kind of connection to this project?

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.980 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Man, I hated answering that question.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:20.040
I'm involved in the project,
really, I stumbled into it.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:27.730 position:73%
My work here started with a small project aimed
at illuminating the collections of the Library

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:33.860 position:75%
of Congress for K through 12 audiences, and
they needed someone to help do that specifically

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.240
with the Veteran's History
Project as it was growing in 2005.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.450
And, so, I was moved over to
work on that and then never left.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.370
My husband is a veteran.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.770
His family members are veterans.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.660
My background, I am half Indian.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:55.350 position:59%
I was born in India, and I don't have
a connection sort of through my family

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.800 position:66%
of origin, but my adopted family for sure.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:06.130 position:66%
And just got really engaged with the whole
notion of why oral history is important

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:11.780
and how it connects people to
the real sources of information

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:20.050 position:69%
and how it is magically gives voice to every
perspective, validating every perspective.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:21.870
So, I'll leave it there.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.530
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:27.500
Linda also asks a question.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:34.410 position:72%
Can family members access recordings and other
artifacts after they are submitted, and if so,

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:39.080 position:59%
how long a turnaround would they
expect before they would be available?

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.290 position:69%
&gt;&gt; After long work days in the middle of the
week, I'm so impressed with these questions.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.120
It's really great.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.070 position:72%
Yes. Family members can access the recordings.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.160
Anyone can access them.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:59.960 position:67%
About over 15,000 of our over 98,000
collections are available digitized online.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.580
For the rest of those collections
that we haven't yet been able

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.600 position:70%
to digitize, and that will be a long process.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.670
I'm certainly not promising that
all of them will be digitized,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:16.590 position:67%
but family members can come here to the
Library of Congress and they can view them.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:22.890 position:73%
In fact, we have a couple of families that do
that on an annual basis to celebrate birthdays,

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:26.590 position:59%
they come, and sometimes they
continue to contribute to a collection

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:30.920 position:70%
as they find more letters or more
photographs and they turn that into an event,

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.440 position:59%
which is really a lovely thing to see.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:40.690 position:75%
The turnaround for processing a collection that
is sent in, and I'll just put in a plug here not

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.640
to send collections via the USPS.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.320 position:58%
We can't take collections through the
postal service because they get fried

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.200
by the specific screening process,

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:57.040 position:69%
but collections that are sent here typically
get processed within four to six weeks

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:04.420 position:72%
for acknowledgment of receipt and then between
four and six months for actually being able

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:10.060 position:59%
to come and see it and do research,
essentially, or to use the collection.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:15.250 position:59%
If a large family, you know, more than
two or three people is going to come,

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:21.360 position:75%
which we do have happen, the appointment is made
in our information center, or if it's for more

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.330 position:58%
of a research use, the appointment
is made with our reference specialist

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.090 position:73%
for the American Folk Life Center reading room.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.930 position:75%
And that's where they get served the collection.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:33.090 position:59%
And as I mentioned before, researchers
use these collections every week.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.390 position:56%
We're serving them to serious
researchers and family members alike

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.840
in the American Folk Life
Center reading room and also

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.450
in the Veteran's History
Project information center.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:49.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay. We probably have time for
one more question before we wrap up,

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.640 position:64%
and I've got another one for you, Monica.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:59.180 position:63%
In terms of teacher use, you know, the
question about access raising, you know,

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.020
copyright issues, are all these
resources that you find online?

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:07.270
Are these, you know, generally
free for teachers to use and,

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:11.030
or do they have to worry
about copyrighting issues?

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:14.670
&gt;&gt; Copyright is not an issue
for teachers to use.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:21.170 position:69%
The veterans and the interviewers actually
retain copyright based on our release forms.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.580 position:61%
However, our release forms are specific

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:28.200
to us sharing the collections
for educational purposes.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.130 position:64%
So, if you're going to, you know, turn it
into the latest blockbuster HBO script,

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.850
it's incumbent upon you to go
ahead and get if copyright.

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:42.510
We don't adjudicate that, but it
is up to you to make that happen.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:44.690
But for teachers, there are
no copyright problems,

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:49.950
and teachers all across the country
use the collections all the time.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.270
&gt;&gt; Monica, that's great.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.810 position:75%
We're just about bumping up on ten minutes till.

00:45:54.810 --> 00:46:00.130 position:61%
Do you have any final words for us, or
do you want, should we just wrap it up?

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:07.350 position:73%
&gt;&gt; Actually, I would say just one point to
consider when you're looking at this collection

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.760 position:58%
when you're thinking about the
Veteran's History Project is that 60,

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.490 position:56%
according to a peer research survey,

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:18.140 position:56%
62 percent of the American public
is immediately related to a veteran.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:23.790
That's, and they define that as
spouse, parent, sibling, or child.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.410
That doesn't include grandparents,
aunts and uncles, or cousins.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:32.320 position:70%
And, so, if that's the number for 62 percent,
if you expand that to that level of family

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.730
or to how we make our families
today, I think we get lost

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.400 position:72%
in the numbers about the 1 percent that serve.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.140 position:72%
That may be true for the current conflict, but
when you think about the divide and the gap

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.980 position:59%
between the veterans and the veteran
population and the general population,

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.130
that divides actually much smaller.

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:51.400 position:59%
So, I just implore you to think about,
as we're headed into Veteran's Day,

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.830 position:58%
as we're headed into the holidays,
think about the veteran in your life,

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:56.920 position:66%
think about the veteran in your community.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.570 position:75%
This is something you can do with your students.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:04.940 position:75%
This is also something you can do to enrich your
personal experience, and I hereby deputize all

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.270 position:58%
of you as ambassadors of the project.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.330
Thanks so much for your time today.

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:11.840
&gt;&gt; Monica, thank you so much.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.820
I can see all these thank
you's pouring in the chat.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.030
Add my thank you to that.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.170
It was a wonderful session.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.800 position:64%
Very informative and very moving as well.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.000
For everybody on the call,
thank you for joining us.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.060
If you look up at the screen, there
are some final information for you.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.690
We'd love to have your feedback
on these sessions.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:30.690
So, there's a link there.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:34.570
You can click right on that link
and take a quick survey for us.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.790
The feedback really helps us
to just kind of get better

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.760 position:72%
and serve you teachers, serve you as teachers.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:46.550 position:59%
Also, for those wanting a certificate,
you are eligible to get a certificate

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:48.800 position:69%
for one instructional hour for this session.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:55.730 position:75%
You will receive an e-mail within five business
days with directions to access that certificate.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:59.040
Finally, as we've mentioned several
times, this session was recorded,

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.120 position:59%
so you can go back and watch it again.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.670
You will see it online.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:09.140 position:73%
Please tell your colleagues, your family
members, to go on and watch it as well because,

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:14.240
you know, we can sort of spread the
world beyond this particular group.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.890
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.970
