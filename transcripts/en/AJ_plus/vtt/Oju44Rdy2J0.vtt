00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.120
In Hawaii, Native students are dropping out at an alarming rate.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.560
Only 4 out of 5 finish high school, and only 2 of those will earn a college degree.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.200
And in Waianae, Hawaii, the problem is even worse.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.440
This coast has the highest concentration of Indigenous Hawaiians.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.200
It is also one of the poorest regions in the state.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.520
Only 14% of the people here hold a college degree.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.560
But one farm is working to solve this education crisis

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.720
by combining modern agriculture and ancestral Hawaiian practices.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.640
MA'O farms in Waianae, Hawaii pays for Native youth to go to college,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.920
and teaches them how to run it based on Indigenous principles.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.280
Cheryse Sana, also known as Kaui, manages MA‘O Organic Farms.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.720
Ten years ago, she participated in their internship program.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.880
Today, she is leading it.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.520
Every morning, before we start the day here at MA'O,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.520
we come together in a big circle and we do an Oli.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.400
“E ho mai” is a chant that we do to ground ourselves,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.360
to start the day “pono,” or in balance.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.720
The work that we do is sacred.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.800
It’s probably about 5:15ish right now at the farm.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.280
We’re harvesting curly kale for our order today.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.320
Maybe close to 200 pounds of this today, which is actually kind of a small order for us.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.000
Most of this kale will be going to restaurants here on Oahu.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.080
When I graduated high school, I was just this quiet little thing.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.240
I couldn’t even have eye contact with anybody at the farm.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.760
As I got connected more with the farm and I got to taste food,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.400
I got to see food grow. I got to feed my family.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.880
I got to feed others in the community.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.320
I really started to feel like I was a part of something that was beyond me.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.120
In Waianae, college tuition remains unaffordable for many.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.760
But at MA‘O Farms, young people can work the land

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.200
in exchange for college scholarships and a monthly stipend.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.720
This is our sassy salad mix:

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.120
salad with a kick, salad with some spice - salad with some attitude.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.520
Cheryse has lived in Waianae her whole life.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.240
Growing up, I always felt really lucky because I always got to go to the beach every day.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.680
I got to see these beautiful mountains. As I got older, I started to hear all these stereotypes

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.760
about my community, and that kinda said that it was directly about me.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.640
When I got accepted into UH Manoa, I didn’t have the money for it.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.520
I didn’t want to get into debt, and I didn’t want to ask my parents for money,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.680
because I’m the oldest of seven.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.200
One of my teachers recommended me to do this program.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.520
I found a family that I never knew I needed.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.120
MA‘O paid her tuition and allowed her to get a degree in Hawaiian studies.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.480
When I first came to the farm, I never thought I’d be a farmer.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.080
I just wanted to use this as a platform for me to get my degree, which I did,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.080
and I ended up falling in love with land, and with farming and with food.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.880
And it’s the same thing with some of these guys ...

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.240
When I heard about MA'O and the things they do,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.040
it connected more to what I wanted to do as a person.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.880
Waking up at 5 a.m. is kinda rough for me.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.760
But then I just think of when you can actually hear nature –

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.920
and then you see the sun rise and everything.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.400
it’s a good start for my day, actually.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.400
They’re probably not going to be farmers, but if these guys end up

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.960
becoming doctors or social workers or teachers in our community,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.120
I think it’s super critical for them now, that they’re in their program -

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.560
they can bring these values to their workspace and to their families.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.920
My passion is working on the land.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.240
It’s very challenging to balance school and work, but the best way to better yourself

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.360
is to get out of that comfort zone, and I think it’s the perfect opportunity for me to do that.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.880
One of our biggest philosophies here is to harvest the same day that it's delivered.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.160
So, everything you see here is harvested this morning.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.000
Young people in Waianae face high levels of drug addiction,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.800
domestic violence, and a lack of access to healthy food.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.640
But not here on the farm.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.320
Hokulani Kepo’o Florence plans to continue farming here for at least her four years of college.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.760
I became a mom at 20 years old.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.640
They’re always telling me, “Hoku, you’re doing awesome.”

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.000
It's just, those words, like,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.920
I kinda go back home to my son feeling good.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.600
Monday, I thought, went really good with the outside crew.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.560
We’re going to try to do more planting today, so just be ready.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.680
Cheryse and her colleagues at MA'O Farms believe that reconnecting with the life ways

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.680
of their ancestors is essential to the development of young leaders.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.360
85% of their student cohort is indigenous Hawaiian.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.840
In ancient Hawaiian times, land stewardship meant to take care of the land,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.880
from the mountains to the ocean.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.040
You only take what you need.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.920
When you take care of the land, the land takes care of you.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.040
It totally starts to change the dynamic of how we connect with food and with each other.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.840
"There are a whole bunch of other people doing good jobs ..."

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.640
Kamu Enos joined the farm over 10 years ago.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.760
He leads the social enterprise of MA'O Farms, integrating the twin pillars

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.640
of modern economics with traditional relationship with the land.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.600
I’m actually really interested in the idea of indigenizing.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.000
Indigenizing to me means that you look at the structures that were thrust upon you -

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.200
whether it's economic, social, or whatnot - and how do you repurpose these structures

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.920
to be vehicles for ancestral responsibilities.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.800
So it means you have to have a dual fluency – you have to have

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.080
a fluency in your ancestry and fluency in contemporary spaces.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.720
We’re not just providing empowerment, like,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.320
we have bottom lines we have to hit on a daily basis.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.000
To take that kind of risk with them was a huge gamble.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.080
One of the first interns we took it with was Kaui.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.240
At 27, Kaui is an elder already.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.720
MA‘O Farms has grown into the largest organic farm on the island of Oahu.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.600
And over 300 students have participated in their internship program.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.280
Every Saturday morning, Cheryse and her students travel to Honolulu

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.720
to sell their vegetables at a local farmer's market, and engage with the larger community.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.600
So you can just measure them out by your hand, like a nice big bunch,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.760
because we only sell these for a dollars anyway, yeah?

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.600
Curly kale on sale!

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.920
The knowledges and the practices that people are calling

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.400
new and sustainable - it's not new, you know. It's "knew" with a silent "k."

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.160
Like, we've known this. Our ancestors [have] known this.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.720
I just want to continue to do more for the people of Waianae,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.520
and evidently the world, because we are all connected.
