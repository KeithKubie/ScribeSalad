00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.920
We've done a lot of
work with two

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.400
equations and two unknowns.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.330
And where each equation
and two variables

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.190
represents a line.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.970
So you're just finding the
intersection of a line.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.950
But what happens when you start
having three variables

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.840
in a linear equation?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.550
So for example, let's say I had
x plus 4y plus z is equal

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.450
to, I don't know.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.300
Let's say it's equal to 8.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.910
So how do we think about this?

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.190
How do we think about it
visually, first of all?

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.910
Let's see if I can graph this.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.980
So I like to draw my x- and
y-axes in the traditional

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.560
manner, then have the z-axis
popping in and out.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.700
You'll see what I mean.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.540
So that's my y-axis.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.320
That is my x-axis.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.250
And now my z-axis--
I can't make it.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.140
Since this is a two-dimensional
format, it's

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.970
hard to do it, but I'll draw it
with a little perspective--

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.730
the z-axis, this is the back.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.020
You can imagine this is
behind your screen.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.570
And now I'm going in front of
our screen, or above our

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.530
screen, depending on how
you're viewing it.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.830
So that's the z-axis.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.690
That is the x-axis, and
that is the y-axis.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.280
So you could almost view this
as a traditional x and y.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.720
Now z tells us how-- if this was
your piece of paper-- how

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.670
much above the piece of paper we
are and how much behind the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.300
piece of paper we are.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.890
So we're now dealing in
three dimensions.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.510
And now something to think
about-- and I'll answer it for

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.470
you in about two seconds-- is,
what does this represent in

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.970
three dimensions?

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.890
Does it represent a line
in three dimensions?

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.530
Or something else?

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.710
Well it turns out
that it actually

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.320
represents something else.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.550
It represents a surface.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.450
It represents-- and since the
coefficients are linear and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.906
the-- not the coefficients--
since the variables are

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:50.460
linear, it represents a plane.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.570
It would represent this big
curvy surface, if we had

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.920
squares in here and
all of that.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.880
But we're dealing with
three-dimensional linear

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.610
equations, so this is just
going to be a plane.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.920
And let's see if we
can visualize it.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.250
The easiest way to draw this is
to figure out the various

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.840
intercepts, the various
axis intercepts.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.009
So the x-intercept, the
y-intercept and now the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.259
z-intercept.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.850
Let's do the z-intercept first.
The z-intercept is when

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.720
x is equal to 0, y
is equal to 0.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.200
What is z?

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.650
So if this is 0, this is
0, the z is equal to 8.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.970
So that's this point
right here.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.360
z is equal to 8.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.570
Now what is the y-intercept?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.570
That's when x is 0 and z is 0.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.710
So if this is 0 and this
is 0, what's y?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.780
4y is equal to 8, so y
would be equal to 2.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.120
That would be right here.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.890
That's 0, 2, 0.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.330
0, 2, and then, no
z, 0 right there.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.370
And then, finally, let's figure
out the x-intercept.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.990
So y is 0 and z is 0, so if this
is 0 and this is 0, x is

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.200
going to be equal to 8.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.120
So that is this right here.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.930
Now, we could draw a line
connecting these.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.520
And this wouldn't be necessarily
the graph, but

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.010
it'll help you visualize
the graph of the plane,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.160
represented by this three
variable linear equation.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.950
So let me do it in a really
light color, just so it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.570
doesn't-- So up there.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.940
And in most classes your teacher
will often view this

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.060
as the graph.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.050
But you could kind of view
this-- this will be-- Let me

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.990
see if I can draw a little
bit of, just to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.880
hit the point home.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.310
This is a surface.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.920
So if that's our surface, so
it would be the plane that

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.780
connects these three points.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.830
And these lines right here, you
can kind of view them as

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.680
where this plane is intersecting
with this-- not

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.980
quadrant-- octant.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.100
Because we have four cubic areas
in the back, you could

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.530
kind of say behind the page.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.530
And we have four quadrants
above the page.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.690
You can view it that way.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.560
And so this is kind of the
intersection of this plane

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.660
with this top, right,
up octant.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.730
Hopefully that doesn't
confuse you.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.940
But it's important to keep
in mind that the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.340
plane just keeps going.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.260
And a plane in 3 dimensions is
defined by three points.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.750
So that's why it's useful
to draw those three.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.395
But this plane just keeps
going in each direction.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.310
And this is the best that we
humans can do at graphing a

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.980
three variable linear equation
on a piece of paper.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.780
I mean, it's a lot easier if you
could do it on a computer,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.910
then you could rotate it, and
you could see it a lot better.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.330
So what does it mean if you
have-- let's say you had two

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.220
equations like this.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.860
Let's say you had this equation,
and then you had

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.960
let's say another equation.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:17.040
Let's say you had, I don't
know, x plus y plus 3z is

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.330
equal to, I don't know,
is equal to 3.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.030
So that graph, let's see, the
x-intercept, would be here.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.800
It's going to be really
messy now.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.540
The x-intercept is there at 3.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.230
The y-intercept is at 3.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.640
And then the z-intercept,
3z is equal to 3.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.680
So the z-intercept's
going to be 1.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.170
So if I were to attempt to draw
that plane-- at least in

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.830
this octant that I'm
participating in, and this

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.585
where it gets messy-- that plane
would look like that.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.930
And it goes off in
every direction.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.020
And now, if I had these two
equations, and I have three

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.550
unknowns, what is
the intersection

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.900
of these two equations?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.010
Or what variables satisfy
these two equations?

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.910
So I hope you can
visualize it.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.340
The intersection between this
green plane-- which represents

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.930
by this-- and our original
plane up here, is

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.930
going to be a line.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.290
And that line is going to look
something like this.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.465
They're going to intersect
right there.

00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:22.910
There's going to be a line that
is in common between this

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.550
green plane and between
this blue equation,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.040
or that blue plane.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.970
And that might be really hard
to visualize, so don't worry

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.640
about it too much if you
find that confusing.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.960
But this is the best
that I can do.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.120
So as we can see, if we have
two equations and three

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.110
unknowns, the solution
is a line.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.560
And a line has an infinite
number of points on it, so it

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.280
still doesn't help us much.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.430
But it turns out, if we were to
throw in a third plane in

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.250
there, or a third equation.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.930
And I don't know, maybe it's
minus x minus y minus z is

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.410
equal to 0.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.330
That's going to be
something else.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.400
It's going to be
harder to draw.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.955
But now, this plane is going
to intersect this line.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.560
Assuming it's not parallel to
one of the other two planes,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.120
or it's not equal to one of
the other two planes, this

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.420
plane is going to intersect
the line that is the

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.190
intersection of this and this
plane, exactly one point.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.830
So that's just a long winded
way of saying that three

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.060
planes that aren't the same
plane, and that aren't

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.960
parallel to each other,
will intersect

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.680
in exactly one point.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.700
Or another way to put it, if
you want to solve for you a

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.100
unique x, y and z, your
constraints have to be three

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.450
variables, and three unknowns--
sorry-- three

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.870
equations with three unknowns.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.800
So let's do one of them.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.000
Let's see.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.030
Image.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.480
Actually, we're already
pushing eight minutes.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.220
This video will be about
visualizing.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.990
And then the next video, I'm
going to actually solve one.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.940
I'll see you in the
next video.
