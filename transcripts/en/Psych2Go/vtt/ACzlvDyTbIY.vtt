00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
[Music]

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.580
How many times have you received a
compliment and later doubted whether or not

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.650
it was truly sincere?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.780
It's always good to assume that people have
good intentions, but the sad reality is that

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.410
this isn't always the case.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.630
Sometimes, people are just pretending to be
nice to us, and it's a point to know the telltale

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.140
signs of this behavior.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.160
Are you wondering whether or not the people
around you are genuinely kind?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.170
Here are 10 signs of fake nice people.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.610
Humble bragging; humble bragging is a relatively
new term, but it's been around for ages.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.210
This is when people exhibit false modesty.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.190
They pretend to downplay their own accomplishments
while sully bragging about them at the same

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.190
time.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.740
An example would be someone who says "I hate
being beautiful because people flirt with

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.820
me all the time".

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.720
According to psychological studies, it's actually
better if you go ahead and fully brag in these

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.630
situations, people like genuine bragging way
more than humble bragging.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.409
Passive-aggressive behavior; you'd be surprised
how easy it is for some people to be extremely

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.249
aggressive while maintaining a guise of positive
and nice behavior.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:28.259
This is known as "passive-aggressive behavior"
and it's one of the big signs of a fake nice

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.439
person.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.770
According to research, this behavior is common
with people who have suppressed their rage

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.310
and want to maintain civility and sophistication.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.149
When they do let their anger out however,
they can only do so by being passive-aggressive.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.009
For example, someone might give you a compliment
but it seems rather sarcastic and backhanded.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.670
Ghosting; another big sign of fake nice people
is ghosting.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.420
This is when people completely fall off the
radar, refusing to answer your calls or reply

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.040
to your text.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.289
Ghosting often occurs right after the relationship
is seemingly going pretty well.

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.150
The other person might even seem nice and
polite, then all of a sudden, they completely

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.470
cut you out of their lives.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.200
At this point, it becomes obvious that their
nice behavior was just a big act.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.010
Crocodile tears; the phrase "crocodile tears"
is used to describe people who fake emotions;

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.440
usually, sadness or remorse.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.830
We see it all the time with politicians and
well-known public figures.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.420
So, how do you spot crocodile tears?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.790
Research has shown that people faking emotions
like remorse and sadness tend to exaggerate

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.790
these emotions.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.100
They also show a wide range of different emotions
which don't always make sense.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.230
For example, they might switch suddenly from
being sad to being hopeful.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.570
How to spot a fake smile; fake nice people
are obviously very likely to show off a fake

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.090
smile.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.400
But how do you tell the difference between
their smiles and real smiles from genuine

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.740
happy and nice people?

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.200
According to psychologists, real smiles almost
always use more facial muscles.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.110
Specifically, you should be on the lookout
for wrinkles around the eyes.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.550
These are key signs of a real smile.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.460
Fake nice people can't listen; genuinely nice
people are always ready to lend an ear.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.680
No matter what you're going through, they
can sit and listen to what you have to say.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.200
Fake nice people might have a hard time doing
this however because they're usually very

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.940
self-centered people.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.410
To put it simply, it's all about them.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.660
Fake nice people might act the part, but they'll
try their best to sway the conversation towards

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.750
topics that involved them, not you.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.510
For example, you might be explaining struggles
you have at school or work, and then someone

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.850
cuts in and starts giving you a long story
about their personal experiences in that area.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:07.210
They always seem to want something; there's
usually a reason behind why fake nice people

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.510
are acting so kind and considerate.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.510
In most cases, it's because they want something
from you.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.739
This might not be immediately obvious, but
eventually they'll start slowly, steering

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.740
the conversation to their needs and desires.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:26.200
Usually, they'll ask you to do something or
you'll discover that you have something they

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.500
want.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.740
They're only nice to people who have power;
another big sign of a fake nice person is

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.900
that they only act in a positive way towards
those with power.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.630
It's always good to judge people based on
how they treat people who are less fortunate

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.310
or less powerful than themselves.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.910
If their nice behavior seems directed solely
towards those with power, then that nice behavior

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.680
probably isn't genuine.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.560
They like to gossip and criticize others;
it's always easy to laugh at other peoples

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.020
expense, and you might even be fooled into
thinking that nice people do this as well.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.250
But, if someone is bringing other people down
in an effort to get close to you, then you

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.680
know that deep inside they're not very nice
people.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.460
Fake nice people love to gossip and they might
do so in a way that seems nice.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.990
They might act with a false sense of concern
over other people's misfortune.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.690
For example, they might talk about someone
else's substance issues with a gossipy and

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.520
unsympathetic tone, while pretending to be
concerned.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.320
Sometimes, it's hard to spot this behavior,
but it's a big sign of fake niceness.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.750
Fake nice people are actually pretty rare;
although there are many signs of fake nice

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.370
people, they're actually not very common.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.740
For the most part, when someone is acting
nice towards you, they really mean it.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.570
In fact, people have a tendency to view themselves
as less likeable than others see them.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.780
Fake nice people do exist, but people probably
like you a lot more than you think.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.570
That's why it's always a good idea to assume
the best in people, because you might be irrationally

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.860
fearing the worst.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.690

people?
