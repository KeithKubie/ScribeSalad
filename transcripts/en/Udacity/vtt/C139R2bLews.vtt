00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.070
Karl Lieberherr has developed the Law of Demeter,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.170
which suggest limits on the classes that can be refered to by a given method.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.440
Imagine that you are writing code for a method m of an object o.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.110
Your code can refer to features of other objects or

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.250
features, either in attribute or a method.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.180
The question is, what other objects is it reasonable for you to refer to?

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.760
Answering everything can lead to typely, tightly coupled systems.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.120
Instead of everything,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.390
Lieberherr proposed some limits to the objects that can be referred to.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.990
You can refer to features in O itself.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.040
You can refer to features.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.580
In classes that are the, the classes for the parameters that go to the MethodM.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.450
You can refer to any objects created or instantiated within M, and you can

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.770
refer to the objects O's direct component objects, that is, its attributes.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.430
Obeying the Law of Demeter reduces coupling, but

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.670
sometimes requires introduction of extra wrapper classes.
