00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.740
Hi, I’m John Green. This is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.440
about World War II. Finally, a war with some
color film! So, here at Crash Course we try to make

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.360
history reasonably entertaining, and fortunately,
World War II was hilarious...said no one ever.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.830
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Is this, like, gonna
be one of the unfunny ones where you build

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.160
to the big melodramatic conclusion about how
I have to imagine the world more complexly?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.740
Me from the Past, as long as you have that
eighth rate soup-strainer, I’m not even

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.720
going to acknowledge your existence.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.680
[theme music]

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.660
Right, so you’ve probably heard a lot about
World War II from movies and books, The History

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.550
Channel, before it decided that Swamp People
were History, the incessant droning of your

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.969
grandparents, etc. We’re not gonna try to
give you a detailed synopsis of the war today.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.270
Instead, we’re going to try to give a bit
of perspective on how the most destructive

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.129
war in human history happened, and why it
still matters globally.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.760
So one of the reasons history classes tend
to be really into wars is that they’re easy

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
to put on tests. They start on one day and
they end on another day. And they’re caused

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.909
by social, political, and economic conditions
that can be examined in a multiple choice

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.909
kind of manner. Except, not really.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.000
Like, when did World War II start? In September
1939, when the Nazis invaded Poland? I’d

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.180
say no - it actually started when Japan invaded
Manchuria in 1931, or at the very latest when

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.540
the Japanese invaded China in 1937, because
they didn’t stop fighting until 1945. Then again,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.220
you could also argue 1933, when Hitler took power, or
1941, when America started fighting. It’s complicated.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.440
But anyway, in China the fighting was very
brutal, as exemplified by the infamous rape

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.770
of Nanking, which featured the slaughter of
hundreds of thousands of Chinese people and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.689
is still so controversial today that:
1. It affects relations between Japan &amp; China

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.670
and
2. Even though I have not described it in

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.580
detail, you can rest assured that there will be angry
comments about my use of the word “slaughter.”

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.259
But the World War II we know the most about
from movies and TV is primarily the war in

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.360
the European theater, the one that Adolf Hitler
started. Hitler is the rare individual who

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.079
really did make history - specifically he
made it worse - and if he hadn’t existed,

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.559
it’s very unlikely that World War II would’ve
ever happened. But he did exist, and after

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:14.059
coming to power in 1933, with the standard
revolutionary promises to return the homeland

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.480
to its former glory, infused with quite a
bit of paranoia and anti-Semitism, Germany

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.319
saw rapid re-militarization and eventually,
inevitably, war.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.349
In the beginning, it was characterized by
a new style of combat made possible by the

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.689
mechanized technology of tanks, airplanes,
and especially, trucks. This was the Blitzkrieg,

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:37.760
a devastating tactic combining quick movement
of troops, tanks, and massive use of air power

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.269
to support infantry movements. And in the
very early years of the war, it was extremely

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.960
effective. The Nazis were able to roll over
Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.680
and then all of France, all within about 9 months
between the fall of 1939 and the summer of 1940.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.559
So after knocking out most of central Europe,
the Nazis set their sights on Great Britain,

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:01.180
but they didn’t invade the island, choosing
instead to attack it with massive air strikes.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.659
I mean, you look at this poster and think,
“Man, the Queen wants me to finish my term

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.449
paper, so I can do it,” but when this poster
was first produced in 1939, it was to quell

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.749
terror in the face of bombardment.

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.589
The Battle of Britain was a duel between the
Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe, and while

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:21.279
the RAF denied the Nazis total control of
British airspace, the Nazis were still able

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.549
to bomb Great Britain over and over again
in what’s known as the Blitz. STAN, NO.

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.359
NO JOKES this time. Yes, the Blitz.

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.879
Meanwhile, Europeans were also fighting each
other in North Africa. The Desert campaigns

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.549
started in 1940 and lasted through 1942 - this
is where British general “Monty” Montgomery

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.049
outfoxed German general Irwin “the Desert
Fox” Rommel. It’s also the place where

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.959
Americans first fought Nazis in large numbers.
But most importantly, it’s where Indiana

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.930
Jones discovered the Ark of the Covenant.
Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.829
1941 was a big year for World War II. First,
the Nazis invaded Russia, breaking a non-aggression

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.949
pact that the two powers had signed in 1939.
This hugely escalated the war, and also made

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:02.849
allies of the most powerful capitalist countries
and the most powerful communist one, an alliance

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.239
that would stand the test of time and never end... until
like three seconds after the defeat of the Nazis.

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.169
The Nazi invasion of Russia opened the war
up on the so-called Eastern Front, although

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.979
if you were Russian, it was the Western Front,
and it led to millions of deaths, mostly Russian.

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.590
Also, 1941 saw a day that would "live in infamy"
when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, hoping

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.520
that such an audacious attack would frighten
the United States into staying neutral, which

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.159
was a pretty stupid gamble because:
1. The U.S. was already giving massive aid

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.229
to the Allies and was hardly neutral and
2. The United States is not exactly famed

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.639
for its pacifism or political neutrality.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.500
1941 also saw Japan invading much of Southeast
Asia, which made Australia and New Zealand

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.400
understandably nervous. As part of the British
commonwealth, they were already involved in

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.509
the war, but now they could fight the Japanese
closer to home. And shut up about how I never

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.020
talk about you Australians. I just gave you
1.5 sentences.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.810
But by the time the Americans and Australians
started fighting the Japanese, it was already

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.949
a World War. Sometimes this meant fighting
or starving or being bombed; other times,

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.490
it meant production for the war - you don’t
think of Argentina as being a World War II

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.000
powerhouse, for instance, but they were vital
to the Allies, supplying 40% of British meat

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.120
during World War II. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.990
So, not to sound jingoistic, but the entry
of the U.S. into the war really did change

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.340
everything, although I doubt the Nazis could’ve
taken Russia regardless. No one conquers Russia

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.759
in the wintertime, unless you are - wait for
it - the Mongols.

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:34.310
Okay, we’re going to skip most of the big
battles of 1942 - like the Battle of Midway,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.930
which effectively ended Japan’s chance of
winning the war - and focus on the Battle

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.080
of Stalingrad. The German attack on Stalingrad,
now known as Volgograd because Stalin sucks,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.930
was one of the bloodiest battles in the history
of war, with more than two million dead. The

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.740
Germans began by dropping more than 1,000
tons of bombs on Stalingrad, and then the

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.150
Russians responded by “hugging” the Germans,
staying as close to their front lines as possible

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.680
so that German air support would kill Germans
and Russians alike.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.289
This kind of worked, although the Germans
still took most of the city. But then, a Soviet

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.189
counterattack left the sixth army of the Nazis
completely cut off. And after that, due partly

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:12.919
to Hitler’s overreaching megalomania and
partly to lots of people being scared of him,

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.020
the sixth army slowly froze and starved to
death before finally surrendering. And of

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.550
the 91,000 Axis POWs from Stalingrad, only
about 6,000 ever returned home.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.330
Stalingrad turned the war in Europe and by
1944, the American strategy of “island hopping”

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.710
in the Pacific was taking GIs closer and closer
to Japan. Rome was liberated in June by Americans

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.499
and Canadians; and the successful British,
Canadian, and American D-Day invasion of Normandy

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:44.509
was the beginning of the end for the Nazis.
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.400
An Open Letter to Canada. But first, let’s
see what’s in the secret compartment today.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.120
Oh, it’s Canadian mittens. I wanna thank
the Canadian Crash Course fans, who sent us

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.569
these mittens. Canadians are just so nice,
Stan. Like, all we ever do on this show is

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.729
make fun of them, and they’re just like, “It’s so
kind of you to mention us. Here’s some mittens!”

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:07.340
Dear Canada, We’re not always nice to you here on
Crash Course, but you are awesome. I’m pointing,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.819
but you can’t tell because I’m wearing
mittens. 45,000 Canadians died fighting for

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.300
the Allies in World War II, which means that, per capita,
Canada lost more people than the United States.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.629
You fought with the Royal Air Force to defend
Great Britain from the beginning of the war

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:24.110
and you were there on D-Day, successfully
invading Juno Beach. And, as many of you have

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.699
pointed out in comments, you defeated the
United States in the War of 1812, meaning

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:31.610
that, arguably, Canada, you are the greater
military power.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:37.439
Plus, you have lumberjacks, and excellent
beer, and hockey, and universal healthcare,

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:43.519
and Justin Bieber. I’m jealous! That's what
it is - I'm jealous!

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.240
Best Wishes, John Green.

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:49.879
So, by the end of 1944, the Allies were advancing
from the West and the Russian Red Army was

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:54.439
advancing from the East and then, the last-ditch
German offensive at the battle of the Bulge

00:07:54.439 --> 00:08:00.979
in the winter of 1944-1945 failed. Mussolini
was executed in April of 1945. Hitler committed

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:06.430
suicide at the end of that month. And, on
May 8, 1945 the Allies declared victory in

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.370
Europe after Germany surrendered unconditionally.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.129
Three months later, the United States dropped
the only two nuclear weapons ever deployed

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:16.539
in war, Japan surrendered, and World War II
was over.

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:22.379
The war had a definite cause: unbridled military
expansion by Germany, Japan, and, to a small

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:26.180
extent, Italy. Now, it’s easy to claim that
Hitler was crazy or evil, and, in fact, he

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.490
was certainly both, but that doesn’t explain
the Nazis decision to invade Russia, and it

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.990
sure doesn’t explain Japan’s decision
to bomb Pearl Harbor.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.620
And there are many possible explanations beyond
mere evil; but the most interesting one, to

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.419
me, involves food. Hitler had a number of
reasons for wanting to expand Germany’s

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:46.000
territory, but he often talked about Lebensraum
or living space for the German people. German

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.060
agriculture was really inefficiently organized
into lots of small farms, and that meant that

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.430
Germany needed a lot of land in order to be
self-sufficient in food production.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.430
The plan was to take Poland, the Ukraine,
and Eastern Russia, and then resettle that

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.850
land with lots of Germans, so that it could
feed German people. This was called the Hunger

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.380
Plan because the plan called for 20 million
people to starve to death. Many would be the

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.220
Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians who’d previously
lived on the land. The rest would be Europe’s

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.269
Jews, who would be worked to death.

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:18.880
Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis,
many by starvation, but many through a chillingly

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.320
planned effort of extermination in death camps.
These death camps can be distinguished from

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.279
concentration camps or labor camps in that
their primary purpose was extermination of

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:33.440
Jews, Roma people, communists, homosexuals,
disabled people, and others that the Nazis

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.660
deemed unfit. Some historians believe that
the Nazis opened the death camps because the

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.070
Jews weren’t dying as fast as The Hunger
Plan had intended.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.760
This was a sickening plan, but it made a kind
of demented sense. Rather than becoming more

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.910
involved in global trade, as the British had,
the Germans would feed themselves by taking

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.089
land and killing the people who’d previously
lived there.

00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:57.990
Similarly, Japan, at the beginning of the
war, was suffering from an acute fear of food

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.130
shortage because its agricultural sector was
having trouble keeping up with population

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.050
growth. And the Japanese too, sought to expand
their agricultural holdings by, for instance,

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.500
resettling farmers in Korea.

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:11.690
So while it’s tempting to say that World
War II was about the Allies fighting for democratic

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:17.509
ideals against the totalitarian militaristic
imperialism of the fascist Axis powers, it

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:22.509
just doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. For instance,
a hugely important Allied power, Stalin’s

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:27.339
Soviet Union, was, like, the least democratic
place, ever. Stan just said that was hyperbole,

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:32.209
but it’s not. Stalin’s Soviet Union is
tied with all of the other completely undemocratic

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:37.290
countries for last place on the democracy
scale. It’s a big community there, at last

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.070
place, but they’re definitely in there somewhere.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.399
And, by far, the biggest imperialists of the
war were the British. They couldn’t have

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:48.470
fed or clothed themselves - or resisted the
Nazis - without their colonies and commonwealth.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.980
So, why is World War II so important? Well
first, it proved the old Roman adage homo homini

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.920
lupus: Man is a wolf to man. This is seen most clearly
in the Holocaust, but all the statistics are staggering.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.440
More than a million Indian British subjects
died, mainly due to famine that could have

00:11:04.449 --> 00:11:08.820
been avoided if the British had redistributed
food. And their failure to do so helped convince

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.589
Indians that the so-called superior civilization
of the British was a sham. More than a million

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:19.870
Vietnamese died, mainly due to famine. 418,000
Americans. More than a million noncombatants

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:26.250
in both Germany and Japan. And 20 million
people in the Soviet Union, most of them civilians.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.519
These civilians were targeted because they
helped sustain the war, mostly through industrial

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:35.500
and agricultural production. In a total war,
when a nation is at war, not just its army,

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.470
there is no such thing as a non-military target.
From the firebombing of Dresden to Tokyo to

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.430
Hiroshima, the line between soldier and civilian
blurred.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.170
And then, of course, there is the Holocaust,
which horrifies us because the elements of

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:55.029
Western progress - record-keeping, industrial
production, technology - were used to slaughter

00:11:55.029 --> 00:12:00.199
millions. World War II saw modern industrial
nations, which represented the best of the

00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:05.889
Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution,
descend into once unimaginable cruelty.

00:12:05.889 --> 00:12:10.759
And what makes World War II such a historical
watershed is that in its wake, all of us - in

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:16.399
the West or otherwise - were forced to question
whether Western dominance of this planet could,

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:18.939
or should, be considered progress.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.359
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.440
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:29.389
Danko. Our associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:32.850
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself. And our
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.810
Last week’s phrase of the week was “an
end to history.” If you want to guess at

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.920
this week’s phrase of the week or suggest
future ones, you can do so in comments, where

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.740
you can also ask questions about today’s
video that will be answered by our team of historians.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.300
If you enjoy Crash Course, make sure you’re
subscribed. Thanks for watching, and as we

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.860
say in my hometown, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.
