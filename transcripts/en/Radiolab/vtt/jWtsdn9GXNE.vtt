00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.120
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.690
Yeah, go down 13. You're going to see this.

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:11.370
You're going to see the store on the right hand side.

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.880
You'll see liquor store on right hand side. You make a,

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.410
you're gonna make a left. That's bears. Actually this bears beets

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.260
<v 1>and this, oh, it's called Bauer speech is your porter and lots of knots. Okay.</v>

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.090
Okay. I'm going to go to, you don't want to go further.

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.520
So three years ago,

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.370
three or four years ago,

10
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.580
I taken the bus down to Delaware and I stayed in this crappy hotel and then woke

11
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:38.330
up super early, like 5:00 AM still dark out to hop in this camp.

12
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.600
<v 0>You're going to see a horse. Oh, I'm, you have got me really excited.</v>

13
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:43.434
Let me tell her.

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.160
<v 1>Just started working at Radiolab. This was like my first, uh,</v>

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.070
first time I'd been sent out to like to just go out and get tape.

16
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.530
<v 0>You talked to anybody or they'll tell you,</v>

17
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:54.380
anybody that lives on that beach would be glad to talk to you. Awesome.

18
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.430
<v 1>Awesome.</v>

19
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.430
And the whole reason why I was headed down to this beach was to record myself

20
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.870
<v 2>communing with a horseshoe crab.</v>

21
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.890
Have you ever held one Lexus? Have you ever, I've never had one in my hands.

22
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:15.460
I would love to hold one in my hand. Yeah. Robert, you sound very far away.

23
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.940
I know it's [inaudible] just to explain,

24
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.040
we sent Latif down to that beach

25
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.330
because a few weeks earlier. All right, everybody say something. Who Do? Hello.

26
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.620
Hello. Robert and I had sort of fallen into this rabbit hole. Hello? Uh,

27
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.060
we'd spoken with a guy named Alexis Madrigal. Yup.

28
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.600
Who is a staff writer at the Atlantic. How did you get onto Horseshoe Krebs?

29
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.000
Where did that start for you? Um, I, it was

30
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.030
late@nightandiwasreadingthroughthesitewhereallthesecrazypressreleasesarepublishedcalledeurekaalert.com.

31
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.890
And I happened to see this really tiny study which had the unpromising name sub

32
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:59.011
lethal behavior and physiological effects of the biomedical bleeding process on

33
00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:02.560
the American horseshoe crab Limulus Pala FEMAs.

34
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.760
And I thought this is going to be my big story this year.

35
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.590
And then I went, um, and I did that thing that we do now, you know,

36
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:15.460
horseshoe crab and then Google images and uh,

37
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.350
they're on the screen. According to Alexis,

38
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:22.351
he saw these pictures of a bunch of horseshoe crabs kind of propped up on these

39
00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:27.550
metal racks and they were all Kinda tied in place and they were all in a row and

40
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:31.960
they all had these thin little plastic tubes coming out of their shells,

41
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.090
all of them. And underneath them are what look like kind of a two liter

42
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.080
<v 3>bottle and</v>

43
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.900
<v 2>there's blue blood in it,</v>

44
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.683
<v 3>blue</v>

45
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.050
<v 2>like baby blue blood. And,</v>

46
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.990
and what was just so fascinating is the strange blood.

47
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.050
It turns out to be the least interesting part of the story. Like at some level,

48
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.200
like it's just the visual that draws you in because inside there strange the

49
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:02.140
horseshoe crabs have a kind of superpower.

50
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.120
It's one that has helped them survive hundreds of millions of years as the earth

51
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.850
has changed, as other species have come and gone.

52
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.310
And it hasn't just been saving their butts.

53
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.130
It's been saving ours for decades.

54
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.670
Nearly all of modern medicine would not be possible without this special little

55
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.110
thing in their blood. But

56
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.650
it might all be about to change.

57
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.130
<v 4>Oh Wow. Oh No. Even over there. Yeah. Right. Yourselves in the puddle. Yep.</v>

58
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.210
<v 2>The love plateau. Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.210
One thing that it does that is really cool is it like has a, a prom,

60
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.330
the sex prom every spring. Oh, you know, we should do,

61
00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:44.930
we should all go together. Oh isn't it like it's your money. It's the, it's,

62
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.520
it's in June and it's on the first one. She of June. Alexis, you want to go?

63
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.370
I do want to go, let's go.

64
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.180
<v 1>Which is where I come in. Test, test, test, test, test.</v>

65
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.630
<v 2>Right. Cause it ended up being that Robert and Alexis and I actually couldn't go</v>

66
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.140
<v 1>and then it was like, okay, then send the 10 the new guy.</v>

67
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.360
<v 2>Yeah. No,</v>

68
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.220
I mean at the time it was like you were just milling around the office and you

69
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:11.650
look like maybe you need an adventure. So we were like, Hey,

70
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.290
do you want to go see these crabs? Like see the sex bro?

71
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.880
<v 4>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Business in front of me in the back.</v>

72
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.050
<v 1>So anyway, so I go, and then when I got there, it was still pretty early,</v>

73
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.040
like maybe six, seven in the morning. It was a little bit rainy,

74
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.970
but when you walked down the beach, it was just littered in,

75
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.070
in probably thousands of horseshoe crap. This is what a horseshoe

76
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.183
<v 3>grab down like</v>

77
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.760
<v 4>yeah, there's, there's kind of no way to hear it.</v>

78
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.400
<v 2>We just said we get a visual, like what does a horseshoe crab look like?</v>

79
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.530
That's kind of like a family circle.

80
00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:54.470
And then there's kind of like this French shielding part and then there's the

81
00:04:54.471 --> 00:04:59.210
tail and a, um, I would call it a scuttling catcher's Mitt.

82
00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:00.990
Yeah. Yeah. Not Bad.

83
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.380
<v 1>So there were these hordes of Scott Catcher's Mitts, uh, you know,</v>

84
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.460
scuttling around and uh, they, they actually move really slowly.

85
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.480
A lot of them had been knocked upside down by the waves and you could see their

86
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:18.100
soft underbelly. They have these 10 lobster like legs and,

87
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.100
and then walking around them were

88
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.360
<v 4>Compton. Anyone want NYCLA called? It's funny phrase. Then a bunch of people</v>

89
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.920
<v 3>is stepping on a horseshoe crab. Was that one day.</v>

90
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.880
<v 1>Many of them were from a big pharmaceutical company,</v>

91
00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:33.530
which will make sense in a second.

92
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.100
But I'm glad my guide for this morning on the beach was a guy named Glenn.

93
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.580
Nice to meet you. Glen. Go very thin guy. Short hair, uh,

94
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.310
wearing socks and sandals. Yeah.

95
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.550
<v 4>Um, and I'm the founder and director of the ecological research and development</v>

96
00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:53.070
group. And also, is it true, I thought,

97
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:56.970
I think I saw on your resume that you in the air force I was a,

98
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.130
was I was an air traffic

99
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.570
<v 5>controller and a,</v>

100
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:04.571
the first time I saw horseshoe crabs was in 1969 when I was stationed at Dover

101
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.150
Air Force Base,

102
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.210
which is right in your Bot being a young guy and cut it down to the beach

103
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.090
looking for something that might be going on. And I saw horseshoe crabs. Wow.

104
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.300
It wasn't until many years later that I kind of looped around into this thing,

105
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.890
but that was the first time I saw them

106
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.890
<v 1>sort of saw some horseshoe crabs and kind of weirdly fell in love with them and</v>

107
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.130
became really their like champion.

108
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.330
<v 5>Oh, they're not all that attractive unless you've been around them a while.</v>

109
00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:29.470
I find them quite beautiful.

110
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.910
<v 1>Glenn now leads these, you know, educational tours of horseshoe crabs,</v>

111
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.550
especially at this time of the year. And he walked me up and down the beach, uh,

112
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.000
painstakingly explaining to me the rules of the, you know, of this x Prom.

113
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.700
The larger ones are females as a male.

114
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.450
At one point he pointed out two crabs that were stuck together.

115
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.380
<v 5>So that guy that's attached to that female, yeah, that's his gal now</v>

116
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.200
<v 1>they were like locked to one another stuck upside down,</v>

117
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.300
<v 5>which makes it harder for them to write themselves. Like right now,</v>

118
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.550
this surface rough enough where if they were separate,

119
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.880
there's a good chance it would flip them over and they'd be okay.

120
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.250
But because he's hanging in there,

121
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.200
the likelihood of that happening becomes more remote. But he'll die with her.

122
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.690
Like this is like a blockbuster Ronette here. This is like, yeah, I mean,

123
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:23.170
I don't, you know, you had to go back to remember Burt Lancaster on the beach.

124
00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:23.441
You know,

125
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:28.441
I forget what movie that was where the waves are crashing over and that was

126
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:32.080
symbolic of the romance and they were both in Baden suits, you know,

127
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:36.850
embracing one another. Nobody.

128
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.680
So we, we've got a got a, an animal world version of that going on in the beach.

129
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.310
Right.

130
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.900
<v 1>And Glenn's Romantic,</v>

131
00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:48.901
I just painted this sex orgy as a beautiful flowering,

132
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:53.590
like a mating season, like spring and nature. Kind of a beautiful thing.

133
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.810
<v 3>Oh my God for that</v>

134
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.360
<v 1>realize really quickly was like what is it? Are those like Max?</v>

135
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.070
<v 3>Oh that's gross.</v>

136
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.400
<v 1>The reality of it was kind of more fun. Get a three.</v>

137
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.840
There'd be like piles of crabs trying to have sex with each other. Yes,

138
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:12.770
exactly.

139
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.610
Trains have them all hooked together and they would be like going in the wrong

140
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:18.830
direction all the time. Like what is going on here?

141
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.540
You'd see like one crab in the middle, like a female, like a bigger one.

142
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.510
It's got this clause gripping and then three or four males like all trying to

143
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:31.760
mate with this one crowd at the same time.

144
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.860
And then when you look even closer nail, it turned out the female crab

145
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.290
was dead.

146
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:42.840
<v 3>Roads</v>

147
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.430
<v 1>like this weird like necrophiliac foursome of crabs.</v>

148
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.060
Uh, it was, it was, it was Kinda Raunchy actually.

149
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:53.620
<v 3>Well my glasses</v>

150
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.220
<v 1>are getting all, uh, I'll talk to my,</v>

151
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.170
but while I was standing watching all this, you know, hurly burly of crab sex,

152
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.330
I was struck by what I think is one of the central questions of this story

153
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.650
because it's almost impossible not to notice that I look like there's pieces.

154
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.010
Oh. And won them all. Yeah. But he's a lot,

155
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.820
a lot of these horseshoe crabs are really banged up.

156
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.050
Oh yeah. Goes right through. Like chunks of their shells are missing,

157
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.190
their eyes are missing.

158
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:25.770
You would think if someone had a hole in their head that size,

159
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.000
you're walking around big deal. But yeah, some of them,

160
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:34.170
they have holes that you could see their legs underneath that in the night and

161
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:37.170
they're all just fine. They just have all these kind of crazy,

162
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.480
what would seem to be fatal injuries,

163
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:41.850
but they're all just kind of walking around like it's no big deal.

164
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.480
Just consider it on the species level. So like,

165
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.860
like here's a creature that is lasted hundreds of millions of years.

166
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:53.370
It outlasted the dinosaurs and the asteroid that killed them,

167
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.500
it outlasted freezing oceans.

168
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:58.950
It's so far has survived the industrial age of humans.

169
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.150
And you look at it and you're like, how, what's it secret?

170
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.820
And it turns out that part of the answer to that has to do with that baby blue

171
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:13.560
blood. This is Alexis Madrigal again.

172
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.220
So our blood is red because hemoglobin is rich in iron, right?

173
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:20.100
And their blood is blue because it's rich in copper.

174
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:24.780
So their molecule that carries oxygen for them, it's called hemo Sinan.

175
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.850
But what's really interesting about this blood is this chemical system of

176
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:31.500
slowing down bacteria.

177
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:36.570
So say you're a horseshoe crab and in your blood there's a little bit of

178
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:40.410
bacteria maybe got through in a crack in your shell anyway,

179
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.200
in your blood. Are these cells called Amoeba site?

180
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.940
He's oval cells that are sort of on patrol in the bloodstream.

181
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.110
And when they encounter a particular kind of bacteria,

182
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.200
the Amoeba sites,

183
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:59.450
these oval cells excrete this substance called Coagula Gin,

184
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.710
which does exactly what it sounds like.

185
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:05.630
The area around where the intruders are. Just like Mu

186
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.480
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

187
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.900
<v 1>turns into this like jelly stuff,</v>

188
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.340
that bacteria that snuck in and traps them like a grape trapped in a bowl of

189
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:19.930
Jello. Wow. And that crack in the shell, the Amoeba sites seal that off too.

190
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.660
And what does it do with the Gel then? Is it poop it out or something then?

191
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.910
Then it can actually attack the sails once they've been flowed down. Oh. So it,

192
00:11:27.911 --> 00:11:31.000
it, it blobs the invader and then mobilize it.

193
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.200
And then some other uh, defense defenders come in and they can take it out,

194
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.530
take it out. And this super power fighting.

195
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.730
It's tiny battles in the bodies of these rather plain looking creatures.

196
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.810
You touch one of these guys before no first time. How does it feel?

197
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.500
Is the reason why people from pharmaceutical companies were on the beach that

198
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:51.160
day?

199
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.160
It's like you live your life and you have new idea with you.

200
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.360
This thing that's been playing out for literally millions of years. One day,

201
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:03.580
humans started to catch on to this

202
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.540
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

203
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.800
<v 1>and one human in particular morning. To explain.</v>

204
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.430
We're going to leave the horseshoe crab just for a minute and talk a little bit

205
00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:20.540
about injectable drugs that scientist and innovator, James Cooper,

206
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.450
any relation to James Fenimore Cooper of uh,

207
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.900
like the last of the Mohicans Guy Google, she's name is James Fenimore Cooper.

208
00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:31.070
He was named after James Fenimore Cooper and his son is also named James

209
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.410
Fenimore Cooper. Wow. Um, but anyway, but anyway,

210
00:12:33.411 --> 00:12:37.310
this James Fenimore Cooper told us that while it was a total miracle,

211
00:12:37.311 --> 00:12:40.970
when injectable drugs like morphine came onto the scene,

212
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.650
it was also a bit of a nightmare because they didn't know about bacteria.

213
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.670
Occasionally the fluids they were injecting would become contaminated as soon as

214
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.440
they inject this materials that patients get infections and develop terrible

215
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.090
fevers or even die, that can be incredibly dangerous to us.

216
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.600
And so to make sure these drugs were free of bacteria that caused fevers,

217
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.140
they didn't just, you know, try it on a person and see if they died.

218
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.360
They checked it on a rabbit and they would have like,

219
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.110
like racks and racks of rabbits, like 24 rabbits in Iraq.

220
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.750
They are restrained by the neck rather loosely.

221
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.470
I mean like a pilgrim being punished in the town square. Exactly right.

222
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.010
And then they'd take a little sample of the thing they wanted to inject into a

223
00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:28.280
person and then he would inject that into the rabbits year.

224
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.140
And if there's certain kinds of bacteria present, the rabbits will get a fever,

225
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.420
their temperature will go up.

226
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.830
And the way they measured their temperature was with these electric thermometers

227
00:13:39.831 --> 00:13:43.910
up there. Bums. So if the rabbits temperature goes up,

228
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.980
we know we shouldn't put this drug inside a person,

229
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.930
but if there's no temperature spike,

230
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.550
this solution is safe to inject into Matt man or woman or children or really

231
00:13:52.551 --> 00:13:55.670
anyone. So that's how crude it was. And it turns out this test,

232
00:13:55.671 --> 00:13:59.660
it wasn't really that reliable either because rabbits are like pretty sensitive.

233
00:13:59.661 --> 00:14:03.230
So even if sometimes they'll like see a new person and will get scared and then

234
00:14:03.231 --> 00:14:04.940
they'll just have a fever because of that.

235
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.150
So it was really, it was not a great test, not great for us,

236
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.760
especially not great for the rapids.

237
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.930
After they would go through a few tests, sometimes even after only one,

238
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.210
they just, they kill them.

239
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.883
<v 6>Um,</v>

240
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.530
<v 1>and to Rabbit Hall of Famer James Fenimore Cooper,</v>

241
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.840
my joke is that I love to talk to rabbits because they're all ears, you know.

242
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.940
Anyway, back in the late sixties,

243
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.630
Cooper was a Grad student at Johns Hopkins University and one day one of his

244
00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:40.470
professors came up to him in the, in the hall or wherever and kind of jokingly,

245
00:14:40.471 --> 00:14:43.850
maybe somewhat seriously as Cooper, if you want to get out of this, uh,

246
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.080
institution with your degree,

247
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.550
you're going to need to find a way to pest for pirates is by something other

248
00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:54.680
than the basically find a better way. That was sort of a joke,

249
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:58.760
although I think he met some of it lucky for Cooper. Around the same time,

250
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.430
this other professor at his university, Dr Levin,

251
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.600
had just come out with a paper on how horseshoe crab blood could theoretically

252
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.720
be used to test for bacteria in people

253
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.060
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

254
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.760
<v 1>and hearing Dr Levin present about it,</v>

255
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.660
Dr. Cooper sat back in his chair and was like, wait a second. Oh,

256
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.190
what if we use the horseshoe crab blood to test our drugs?

257
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.140
Would it be possible then to take this test and adapted to test drug products

258
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:29.950
and we wouldn't have to kill all of those rapids.

259
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.560
So they got together, made the test work,

260
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.860
and as soon as we made that publication in 71 than the pharmaceutical industry

261
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:41.390
jumped right on it.

262
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.820
And so this particular chemical substance,

263
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.990
it's Coagula gin in the horseshoe crab blood actually became a major part of the

264
00:15:51.991 --> 00:15:54.810
way that we test things that we're going to inject into our bodies.

265
00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:59.370
And every hospital, as you walked down the, uh, the Carter, you look in a room,

266
00:15:59.371 --> 00:16:02.490
there's an ivy bag hanging surgical instruments on a tray.

267
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.560
Injectables far pain infections, your dad's pacemaker, cancer,

268
00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:11.220
chemotherapy, your grandma's new hit your kids Epi,

269
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.040
pen immunization shots.

270
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.510
All of these things have been tested with this material, this,

271
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.240
this test that we're able to do using this chemical that we extract from

272
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:28.650
horseshoe crabs,

273
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.870
this 450 million year old species.

274
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:42.070
Yeah. But in order to do all of that, in order to actually, you know,

275
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.440
keep our medicines safe,

276
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.130
they actually have to go out every year and,

277
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.070
and drain horseshoe crab blood seriously.

278
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.220
They have to keep doing this all every year. Yeah. They go out,

279
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:56.140
they get the crabs every year.

280
00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:59.920
They drain their blood and then they go put them back out into the ocean.

281
00:16:59.921 --> 00:17:03.740
It's like a like a, like a, like a horseshoe crab blood drive and the whole,

282
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.930
the whole, I mean it's,

283
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.240
there are a bunch of companies that do this and the whole industry is worth,

284
00:17:07.241 --> 00:17:09.340
you know, like tens of millions of dollars.

285
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.140
<v 7>Oh Wow. Really,</v>

286
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:16.770
really wanted to see this all in action.

287
00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:20.460
Like I wanted to go to one of these bleeding facilities after the break.

288
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.910
A lot diff and a very special guest will do just that.

289
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.490
They will infiltrate so to speak,

290
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.560
one of these bleeding facilities and witness the baby blue blood drive

291
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.320
firsthand. That's coming up.

<v 10>hi, I'm Tracy and I'm a reporter here at radio lab.</v>

297
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.640
I wanted to take a quick second to tell you about something that I think is

298
00:18:00.641 --> 00:18:02.830
pretty cool that we make here at the show.

299
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:08.430
Besides the show we have a newsletter and I can already hear you say big deal.

300
00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:11.650
Everybody has a newsletter but ours is really,

301
00:18:11.651 --> 00:18:16.000
really good and worth your time and probably more worth your time than other

302
00:18:16.001 --> 00:18:19.210
people's newsletters. So here it is.

303
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.590
First of all it lets you know when to release a new episode and secondly there's

304
00:18:23.591 --> 00:18:28.510
this whole other section of our staff picks and that's just a list of things

305
00:18:28.511 --> 00:18:31.990
that the Radiolab team have come across that were just really excited about.

306
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.010
And it could be something like, you know, Rachel Sake, our producer, you know,

307
00:18:36.011 --> 00:18:41.011
she just worked on goon ads and she found out about this really cool frozen zoo.

308
00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.560
And then there's our other producer Andy McCune, and she kinda tells,

309
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.330
told everybody to Google horse mustaches and it is definitely worth your time to

310
00:18:49.331 --> 00:18:54.160
Google that. So go do that right now. Or it'll be me talking about,

311
00:18:54.161 --> 00:18:58.480
you know, the joys are rewatching like my favorite TV show, living single.

312
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.220
So I hope you'll sign up. It takes about 30 seconds and it's free.

313
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:08.460
So go to radiolab.org back slash newsletter or you can text RL news as in a

314
00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.550
Radiolab news two seven zero one zero one that's r l news two seven zero one

315
00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.350
zero one and thanks.

316
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:24.210
<v 9>But who is this personality who has gone so far as to imagine that narrator to</v>

317
00:19:26.001 --> 00:19:30.560
keep him company announcing the events of his life as if he were the star of

318
00:19:30.561 --> 00:19:34.130
screen stage, all stolen card. You make me sound like such a freak.

319
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:37.400
Everyone should have a narrator thank you. Don't call in the air.

320
00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:44.530
<v 11>Step right in to the orbiting human circus of the air with Wny c studios,</v>

321
00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:47.680
special edition of orbiting human circus. Season one,

322
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.090
listen now, wherever you get your podcasts,

323
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.331
<v 1>this is Radiolab.</v>

324
00:20:01.331 --> 00:20:06.331
We're back with lots of Nasser reporting on horseshoe crabs and the scientists

325
00:20:06.761 --> 00:20:08.020
who love them, or at least love,

326
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.590
they're a very valuable blood and maybe them too, but mostly their blood.

327
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.420
And therein lies are up.

328
00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:17.470
So they're basically like I think four or five companies that go out and find

329
00:20:17.471 --> 00:20:20.500
horseshoe crabs and then extract their blood.

330
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.170
And I wanted to see like what does it look like?

331
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.700
So I sent out a few emails and then I was emailing these companies for like

332
00:20:27.701 --> 00:20:31.600
three years and nobody ever returned my emails. I don't know why.

333
00:20:31.601 --> 00:20:34.270
Maybe they didn't want bad press or I don't know,

334
00:20:34.271 --> 00:20:36.100
maybe they weren't bleeding that year or whatever.

335
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.150
And so I'd basically given up on this story, but then this year,

336
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.530
these folks at one of the companies called Charles River laboratories and were

337
00:20:44.531 --> 00:20:46.900
like, hey, why don't you just come down to Charleston south

338
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.960
<v 10>and watch what we do here? So I went, you're just rolling. I'm rolling.</v>

339
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.740
You're rolling. Let me double check. And along with me I brought yes, dust,

340
00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.130
Dust Lulu. Hey, how's it going? Lulu Miller,

341
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.400
you guys shine the horseshoe crabs signal on the moon.

342
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.970
And I come around in a little.

343
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.750
Miller is a former radio lab staff or actually she is the first radio lab staff

344
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:14.610
member. Uh, besides myself and Robert and Ellen. And uh,

345
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:19.210
she is a cocreator of NPRs. Invisibilia we're, how did you get in on this?

346
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.420
I weirdly have had affection for these creatures my whole life.

347
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.000
I like grew up with them there. Some of my first memories.

348
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.690
What do you remember seeing? I remember seeing what I thought was a crab.

349
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:33.691
I was like probably three or four on the beach with my parents in Cape Cod where

350
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.500
we've gone my whole life. And,

351
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.900
and I just remember walking on the beach and seeing this like massive crab,

352
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.050
you know, a third of the size of my body basically.

353
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.740
And I remember kind of jumping back and my dad's saying, oh, take it up,

354
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.300
poke at it, you know, interact.

355
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:53.170
And so I kinda turned it over and I saw all those claws and I got scared and

356
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:56.290
then he, you know, he showed me it wasn't alive, it was a mold. Oh.

357
00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.810
And he explained what a mold was,

358
00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:02.470
that there had been a crab in there and it slid out and now was this perfectly

359
00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:05.170
intact skin of what it used to be.

360
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.210
And you're wonder like, well where is it now and what's it doing now?

361
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:12.190
And do I ever leave a self behind? I don't know.

362
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:13.790
It was just little and I thought it was cool and we,

363
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.430
we brought it back to our porch.

364
00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:20.320
I remember that it sat on our porch for years and like the dog would sniff at it

365
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.213
where

366
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.840
there's just ever since then there's just been a like mild poetic fascination

367
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.790
visitors report to build the building. See, I think that's, and Lulu,

368
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:34.690
did you have a feeling about this business of any sort before you've written

369
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:37.240
visited? Yeah, there's a part of me that wondered like,

370
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.450
Oh I totally love these creatures is this big bad company.

371
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:43.180
Just exploiting it for their blood. And you know,

372
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:47.440
I went with a little skepticism. Great, thanks. You know,

373
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.780
an eyebrow down and scrunch to the bleeding.

374
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:54.730
Fertility was just in this kind of under stated nondescript office park land.

375
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.180
There's like people in Capri pants and sandals basically from the outside it

376
00:22:58.181 --> 00:23:00.600
looks like every other one story brick building.

377
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.110
<v 4>Whew. But then when you go on the inside, suddenly you're hit with this.</v>

378
00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:08.910
Like I can smell it. Wash have a smell of crabs. Hey,

379
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.630
wow, that's now. How would you describe that smell? Kinda crab myth.

380
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.450
Yeah. It's a high ceiling,

381
00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:18.420
brightly lit room with industrial things along one wall,

382
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.570
these shiny metal operating trays on wheels. So,

383
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:27.680
and no matter where we were standing, we just sort of managed to beat like,

384
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.600
exactly, oh, you need us out of the way. In a way,

385
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.710
be in your way though of all of these busy people rushing around a barn lab

386
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.840
coats, they're wearing hair nets, gloves on,

387
00:23:36.841 --> 00:23:40.950
and they're pushing around these big gray bins on wheels. An inside.

388
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.850
Each bin

389
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:48.470
are the horseshoe crabs twist and turn in a little wave in their tail,

390
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.100
all heaped on top of each other, about 20 per Ben flex in their claws.

391
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.870
So, uh, we have our crabs coming in from our suppliers. That's Brad parish,

392
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:03.260
our guide. He explained to us that there are two parts to the blood donation.

393
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.710
We start by washing the animals, scrub the shell off the Barnum football.

394
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.450
They spray it, dunk it,

395
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.400
Lafayette and the it of which you speak are living animals. Yeah.

396
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.110
Like one at a time. These smooth shells are passed person to person,

397
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:18.380
rinsed and shining like Wonka land for crabs in here.

398
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:22.850
It's like a whole world. Yeah. In a way.

399
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.840
Here we're in the way, once they're washed the rack of one, two, three, four,

400
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:30.700
five, it's time for the bleeding. 16 crabs wheeled over going to go in,

401
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.170
crabs are taken out of their bins folded in half.

402
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:37.070
So their tails are kind of underneath and they're put on these racks where

403
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:39.350
they're strapped down with a bungee cord to hold them in place.

404
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.090
<v 1>And then they're wheeled into this tent,</v>

405
00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.050
which is like a clean room zone that's like,

406
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.020
like got these sort of like plastic curtains all around.

407
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.830
<v 4>Can we go, can we go in? We cannot go. Oh, we can't go in. Okay. Got It.</v>

408
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.930
<v 1>And they didn't let us go in there because as regular bacteria carrying humans,</v>

409
00:24:56.931 --> 00:24:59.090
we were far too dirty to enter this super, super clean room.

410
00:24:59.091 --> 00:25:01.550
But we can peak right in. And when we did,

411
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.510
we saw that right at that fold in the crabs body

412
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.590
<v 10>right at that hinge, there's like a little opening and the needle goes in</v>

413
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.680
<v 1>there and it was from that needle that this blood,</v>

414
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.780
<v 10>it's like brilliance. Yeah.</v>

415
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.050
Kind of Saifai sky blue blood

416
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.950
<v 1>slowly dripping into these things.</v>

417
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:25.060
<v 4>The glass bottle and the McRavs are kind of like, their little claws are going,</v>

418
00:25:25.061 --> 00:25:27.820
but they've just kind of looked like they're sitting there and they're draining

419
00:25:27.821 --> 00:25:29.380
them of about a third of their blood.

420
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.660
<v 1>What is your, uh, emotional sense of this scene?</v>

421
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:39.950
<v 10>Like it was kind of this, uh, feeling some sort of like,</v>

422
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:43.140
what we're doing here is weird and

423
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.100
<v 1>kind of</v>

424
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.920
<v 10>Vampirey. I don't know what it was like. We're sucking their blood.</v>

425
00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.160
So that's a little, it was a little creepy

426
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.030
like when, so lots of like,

427
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.260
I feel like when we were in there, hmm.

428
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.450
<v 4>There's like so many, we were in the factory,</v>

429
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.480
dozens and dozens of boxes filled each with like 10 huge crabs.

430
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.310
<v 10>And we, we are in the, yeah, in that processing zone.</v>

431
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.150
And before we went and saw the blood, this like may sound cheesy,

432
00:26:19.151 --> 00:26:21.730
but it was actually profound and I keep thinking about it.

433
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.140
There was this moment,

434
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.280
<v 4>okay, so here we go. Okay. What are we looking at?</v>

435
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.680
Can I touch her when one of the guys in the factory, Oh,

436
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:30.050
you're sure he can had pulled out from these bins.

437
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:34.550
This big female horseshoe crab. Okay. Oh yeah, yeah,

438
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.990
yeah, I do. And he's just sort of holding her by the shell. Hi. Whoa.

439
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.840
The tail is really coming right at me here. Yeah.

440
00:26:42.841 --> 00:26:47.841
So little herd of the claws are going up and her tails kind of waving around.

441
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.720
Right. So there's a lot of uh, yeah. Club activity. Exactly.

442
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:56.040
And so we'll take these calls and he like turned her over so she's upside down.

443
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.180
And then he took his hand and just let her claws kind of grab his hand.

444
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.380
And so that there's sort of pinching my hands here, but it doesn't hurt.

445
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.640
There's not much power to them.

446
00:27:05.641 --> 00:27:08.580
They're just using that to sort of grab the food and I try and get into their

447
00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:10.550
mouth that I get a little pin. Okay. Yup.

448
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.470
And so I just kinda slowly stuck my hand out toward her claws.

449
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.860
Oh. And her closet like engulfed my hand. Oh, here. Oh,

450
00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:26.490
they're very quiet. They're very, very clasby.

451
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.360
It wasn't a scrabbly kind of like foreign,

452
00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.313
a touch,

453
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.340
the all the clause clasped in unison really tight actually cut it out.

454
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.870
It's kind of a massage. So I am being like,

455
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.820
this horseshoe crab is holding my head. Wow.

456
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.230
To me. And of course this is just silly project.

457
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.820
<v 10>Dang. So I'm saying that, but like it felt like,</v>

458
00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.540
I know it wasn't, but it felt like a communication. Like,

459
00:27:59.541 --> 00:28:03.710
I'm in this Bin and these people are doing weird things and I want to be back in

460
00:28:03.711 --> 00:28:08.660
the sea and I'm upside down and I'm about to go into like have a sink, you know,

461
00:28:08.661 --> 00:28:10.030
one of those like shower heads,

462
00:28:10.031 --> 00:28:13.700
spray it all up in my under sides and then I'm going to be Bungee corded and

463
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.110
drained. Like it was almost, it wasn't like it was in pain,

464
00:28:18.111 --> 00:28:23.111
but I had this almost like primal creature to creature help me.

465
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.450
<v 13>Yeah. Like, I mean, part of me felt that too. Uh,</v>

466
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:33.250
but I mean on the other hand, like they, they do get to go home

467
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:34.610
<v 4>towards,</v>

468
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:39.610
so the same fishermen that bring the crabs to us are then going to deliver them

469
00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:42.600
back to the ocean and release them. They're set free,

470
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.800
straight back to the water.

471
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.520
<v 13>And how many crabs do they do this to? Every year? About 500,000.</v>

472
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.800
A horseshoe crabs every year kept bled.

473
00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.290
Do the crabs that get bled and then released, I mean,

474
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.700
did they just say swim away? Fine or today?

475
00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.480
So some of them do die after the bleeding. There's this a,

476
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.150
a small percentage,

477
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.390
like I think the conservative estimate is around like 10%. Um,

478
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.390
but that might be a high estimate or it might be a low S. I have no idea.

479
00:29:10.391 --> 00:29:14.360
I think it's 15, 15%. Okay. So let's say like 15%.

480
00:29:14.361 --> 00:29:19.361
So if you're talking about 500,000 crabs being bled every year,

481
00:29:19.461 --> 00:29:19.850
that that,

482
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.850
that means about 75,000 horseshoe crabs are dying because of bleeding every

483
00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.260
year. Eh, you know, they actually,

484
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.010
in that original paper that I looked at again, Alexis Madrigal,

485
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.380
they were actually able to see that a lot of the,

486
00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:39.410
the crabs don't have like bled crabs and non bled crabs,

487
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.910
like have slightly different movement. Um, and that's because, you know,

488
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:46.150
maybe one of them is missing 30% of its blood, but they needed to,

489
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.040
they needed to double check on that.

490
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:52.210
And so they did see that the [inaudible] animals appear more lethargic,

491
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:56.740
they move, you know, uh, more slowly and like imagine if,

492
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.730
imagine if you had to go like harvest deer and then bleed them of 30% of their

493
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:02.830
blood and then you'd like leave them back out in the forest.

494
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.290
Like there's something about that. That seems so bizarre.

495
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.640
It seems very medieval.

496
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.930
Is there any hope of getting out of this whole vampire relationship we have with

497
00:30:10.931 --> 00:30:13.990
the horseshoe crabs? Well perhaps,

498
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.560
and let me tell you a brief story about a bird smallish bird cinnamon in color

499
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.730
with a long bill. It's called a red non. Yup.

500
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.570
<v 1>The incredible thing about red knots is of all the birds in the world,</v>

501
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.270
the red knot makes it one of the longest migrations,

502
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.300
nearly 10,000 miles to go from the very southern tip of South America all the

503
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:41.260
way up to northern northern Canada up into the Arctic circle where they lay

504
00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:44.800
their eggs and the whole journey takes about five months.

505
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.150
And what happens is thousands of these red not birds will take off from South

506
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:49.720
America.

507
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.980
They'll fly like 4,000 miles north up to Brazil and they'll stop them for just

508
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:56.080
like a couple days rest up, eat some food,

509
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.260
and then the thousands of them take this guys again.

510
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.350
And they fly up along the eastern coast of South America,

511
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.280
over the Atlantic Ocean. But before they get to their final resting grounds,

512
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:11.170
they make one more stop. One pivotal, crucial rest up in

513
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:19.000
the Delaware Bay. Yeah. Dried up.

514
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.650
Now when I was in Delaware, there weren't like a ton of birds terror.

515
00:31:23.651 --> 00:31:26.350
But basically these birds, when they make this journey,

516
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:30.310
they rely on horseshoe crabs because I don't know if you've been noticing all

517
00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:34.540
the eggs they need to eat millions of horseshoe crab eggs to complete their

518
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:39.120
migration. Oh, this is an egg cluster right there. Oh Wow. Oh Wow.

519
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.460
Oh wait. Really careful where I sat down and this is the thing.

520
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.970
It's weirdly these birds that might actually free the horseshoe

521
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.390
<v 13>crabs from us. Yeah. Yep. And to explain, I got in touch with this guy.</v>

522
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.360
Uh, my name is Jay Bolden, a biologist in the global quality laboratory.

523
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.650
Is that Eli Lilly and company. So Eli Lilly and company,

524
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.560
it's this huge pharmaceutical companies that makes you know,

525
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.640
cancer drugs and antidepressants, a lot of insulin and things like that.

526
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.580
And real quick

527
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.400
<v 1>people are at the core of our commitment to manufacturing.</v>

528
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.890
Here's a message from an executive, I'm the driving force behind our innovation.

529
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.500
Radiolab is brought to you by anyway. Um,

530
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.520
one of the things that company has been helping innovate is horseshoe crab

531
00:32:20.521 --> 00:32:25.020
blood, a synthetic version of horseshoe crab line. Yeah. So, and you know,

532
00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.070
Jay explained to me,

533
00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:29.610
if you kinda like zoom out for a second and think about what it means to use

534
00:32:29.611 --> 00:32:32.970
horseshoe crab blood for this, you know, vital thing in medicine.

535
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.710
The problem is there needs to be a supply of horseshoe crabs and you know,

536
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:38.730
global warming,

537
00:32:38.731 --> 00:32:42.650
global climate change is real rising sea levels and habitat loss.

538
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.060
I could have some supply chain consequences, which isn't good. No.

539
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.310
<v 13>And so it was actually all the way back in 1997 some researchers out of the</v>

540
00:32:51.311 --> 00:32:55.210
University of Singapore cloned this, the factor see protein,

541
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:58.990
the essential factor. See Protein in horseshoe crab blood that goes

542
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.130
<v 10>blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue</v>

543
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.540
<v 13>around the bad bacteria.</v>

544
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.650
And now we can make the protein of interest instead of getting that directly

545
00:33:07.651 --> 00:33:11.970
from horseshoe crabs. Huh. So why aren't we already using that? Yeah,

546
00:33:11.971 --> 00:33:12.511
so the problem,

547
00:33:12.511 --> 00:33:15.360
well Jay explained that there's a whole bunch of different reasons,

548
00:33:15.361 --> 00:33:16.470
but one of the big ones,

549
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.160
it was that you already had an industry built on horseshoe crab blood.

550
00:33:20.161 --> 00:33:23.790
And so there was no real immediate incentive to change,

551
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.390
which is actually how we get back to,

552
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:31.450
<v 4>yeah, tell me. Good friends. The birds.</v>

553
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.720
<v 1>So turns out people like these birds a lot,</v>

554
00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:36.940
like actually way more than horseshoe crabs,

555
00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.600
but since the birds eat the horseshoe crab eggs,

556
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:44.440
their feet is kind of entwined. So like if the horseshoe crab is not doing well,

557
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:48.010
then the bird's not going to do well. And so Jay figured,

558
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.430
why don't I just go around to all the bird conservationists?

559
00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.840
They use some of their political power and contacts and it's only now that we're

560
00:33:55.841 --> 00:33:57.670
starting to come upon

561
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:00.743
<v 13>a new dawn</v>

562
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:04.203
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

563
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.220
<v 6>good afternoon everyone and</v>

564
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.400
<v 4>welcome here. This is a great place to be. Today</v>

565
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:16.570
<v 13>in May of 2018 Jay was standing on a stage along with some conservationists to</v>

566
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:21.290
announce that Eli Lilly would be one of the first companies to use synthetic

567
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:22.160
horseshoe crab blood.

568
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.910
<v 4>The big headline news here is that the pharmaceutical industry can actually</v>

569
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.120
replace probably up to 90% of the use of horseshoe crab blood without incurring

570
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.560
any major regulatory change

571
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:42.263
<v 6>[inaudible],</v>

572
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:47.920
<v 4>which means these horseshoe crabs can finally be freed up their servitude and</v>

573
00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:51.880
bondage to mankind and get back to doing, you've got a three song.

574
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.110
What is going on here? What they love

575
00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.133
[inaudible]

576
00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.920
<v 10>Whoa, but here's the weird thing.</v>

577
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.570
I think like if the synthetic comes through and we get it perfect and it works

578
00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.730
and we never have to drain another horseshoe crab,

579
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.530
then they just become these weird kind of sea spiders again and that that could

580
00:35:13.531 --> 00:35:17.700
be a really bad thing for them. Yeah, exactly.

581
00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.580
This is actually something that Alexis Madrigal all talks about too,

582
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.140
<v 13>because most of the other things that these horseshoe crabs have ever been used</v>

583
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:26.450
for it and the history of their encounter with humans,

584
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:30.500
that has resulted in the death of like large numbers of them because before we

585
00:35:30.501 --> 00:35:34.010
ever valued them for their blood, we basically did two things with them. Thing.

586
00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:36.650
One, we turned them into a fertilizer. We would catch them,

587
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.860
boil and grind them and then just stick them in the soil as a way of promoting

588
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:44.190
plant growth or thing too. We'd catch them,

589
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:46.380
cut them up and use them to like a,

590
00:35:46.381 --> 00:35:49.740
as bait to catch a more valuable species,

591
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:53.460
like a particular kinds of snails. Okay. So I have right here in front of me,

592
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:57.000
this comes from the Atlantic states marine fisheries commission,

593
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.160
which their numbers say that, you know,

594
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:04.610
as of the late nineties there were nearly 3 million horseshoe crabs being killed

595
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:08.040
every year for commercial fishing. 3 million. Wow.

596
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.370
But more recently we put restrictions on how many horseshoe crabs can be used

597
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:15.120
for commercial fishing, for Bait. Um, it's even like in a lot of states,

598
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:19.020
it's a crime to go to a beach and just take a, uh, you know,

599
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:22.980
a bunch of horseshoe crabs. Like in New Jersey, if you take a horseshoe crab,

600
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.590
you could get fined $10,000.

601
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.370
The thing that I've always wanted to keep in mind with this is like if you're

602
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:32.850
gonna have to be, you know, hooked up to some economic system,

603
00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:35.370
which most animals in our world are,

604
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:40.670
you kind of want to be hooked up to one that's super high value and that doesn't

605
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:41.694
kill you.

606
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.160
<v 10>And so the fear is if like,</v>

607
00:36:43.161 --> 00:36:46.880
if the synthetic works and we no longer need horseshoe crabs for their precious

608
00:36:46.881 --> 00:36:49.400
blood, then we just go back to chopping them up,

609
00:36:49.401 --> 00:36:51.620
putting them in the ground and using them for bait

610
00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.650
<v 13>because they live where we live.</v>

611
00:36:53.651 --> 00:36:58.651
They live along our most populous shore and they're right there for the taking.

612
00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.830
You know, they're not prepared for our murderer samples.

613
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.500
<v 4>Hi, I'm [inaudible] nice to meet you. Nice to meet. Thanks for having us here.</v>

614
00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:09.910
Yeah, I'm more than glad to,

615
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.360
<v 10>and there was this moment where everything just kind of flipped for me,</v>

616
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.051
you know,

617
00:37:15.051 --> 00:37:20.051
like where I realized that as cruel and kind of Grizzly as the draining of the

618
00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:25.271
blood themes that actually may be the best thing for these creatures.

619
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:30.290
Like our selfishness maybe protecting them.

620
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:34.200
<v 4>Oh, you want to see some more horseshoe crabs. Yes, yes, yes.</v>

621
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.900
<v 10>So this is our very last stop on our trip down to South Carolina and we met this</v>

622
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.750
fisherman named Jerry Gulp who is employed. Yeah,

623
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:46.040
<v 4>to collect the horseshoe crabs for the company. What a peaceful little spot.</v>

624
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.200
So we were in this forest. Yeah, I know.

625
00:37:48.201 --> 00:37:49.850
This feels like the most secluded place.

626
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.910
Nowhere with Jerry walking around this little pond.

627
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.600
I wore the exactly wrong shoes. I just scored the wrong thing.

628
00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.050
What's known as a holding pond where they put the crabs before they go off to

629
00:38:00.051 --> 00:38:04.070
the facility. And while we were down there, when he got there,

630
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.000
Jerry likes scooped some water out of the pond. That's just a bottle of water.

631
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.200
But then he held the bottle up to our faces, seeing the babies were there.

632
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.420
Oh, all of those. Every, oh wow. There's so many of them. How many of,

633
00:38:20.421 --> 00:38:25.190
yeah, they do 'em a hundred thousand eggs at a season.

634
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.890
Wow.

635
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.960
They're like the size of like a really round grain of rice or like pro cous.

636
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.100
Cous cous like are

637
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.780
<v 0>they, were they laying the eggs here or, or, or did you get the eggs from the,</v>

638
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:45.340
where you lay their eggs along the shore? Oh,

639
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.360
literally right here. Oh Wow.

640
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.440
I feel like we heard a tiny bit about, but what, what's the,

641
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:56.050
what's the story of how you went from,

642
00:38:56.051 --> 00:39:00.280
or your family went from being kind of seafood, uh, you know,

643
00:39:00.281 --> 00:39:05.020
fishermen to doing this kind of crazy different thing? Well,

644
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.800
we're just a bunch of fishermen and add, but Jerry told us, uh,

645
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.290
the gist of it is back when his dad was doing seafood fishing, you know,

646
00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.040
it was just a tight,

647
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.760
then it was in this seventies his dad was catching a lot of horseshoe crabs,

648
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:19.810
selling them off for bait.

649
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.450
And then one day this guy just showed up at his house suit and tie,

650
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.940
told him my dad did. If he would quit selling them for Bait, you know,

651
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.540
he'd make a deal for him. He would buy him, buy him for more money.

652
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.620
So Jerry's dad said, sure, we've been doing it ever since. And,

653
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:36.790
and I got something I want you guys to know as a fisherman,

654
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.010
I'm proud to be part of it. I find it to be,

655
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.370
I want to say it's the most noble thing I do because I get to touch every one of

656
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:49.380
you guys because it's used for making sure medication is safe for us and

657
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.580
can't say that about soft shell crabs or, or guru grouper,

658
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:01.960
you know, you touch everyone and then you touch it again and return it. Well,

659
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.320
I touched you indirectly. Indirectly.

660
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:08.020
I'm touching all of us here because we're all part of it.

661
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.490
So it's pretty neat thing.

662
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.800
If you had to describe your feelings for the crabs, for the horseshoe crabs,

663
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.610
uh, how do you feel about them? Well,

664
00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.360
I have a lot of respect for him and

665
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.720
I almost feel like it's, um, divine design.

666
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:36.020
Nowhere she crab is, you know, I've seen him fishing for them,

667
00:40:36.021 --> 00:40:36.440
you know,

668
00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.010
they're nuisance then and now I see him on this side where they're important to

669
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:43.310
human society. And, um,

670
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.820
I just draws me back to the idea that is was divine design.

671
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:50.750
They've been around for 400 million years. It took them,

672
00:40:50.751 --> 00:40:53.840
this took us this long to figure it out, I guess.

673
00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.180
<v 1>Out of curiosity, where did that, where did that leave the two of you? Well,</v>

674
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:08.290
well for me, I mean, Jerry the fisherman, he's, he's totally right. Like we,

675
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:10.820
we just figured this out.

676
00:41:10.821 --> 00:41:14.690
These crabs of being Clark canting us this whole time.

677
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.070
They have this hard one superpower that they've probably had since, you know,

678
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.920
before like three branches on our evolutionary tree. And,

679
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.860
and, and in evolutionary terms, like, like they're the winners. We're the,

680
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.760
we're, we're chumps, we're, we're baby chumps.

681
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.220
There's this like there something

682
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:38.300
<v 10>miraculous inside them. And, and in a certain way,</v>

683
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.220
it's easy to stand next to them and feel almost small like that.

684
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:45.890
We're not unlike an asteroid or just another thing,

685
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:50.891
they're probably going to endure like we are a blip to them and yet

686
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:57.680
where a dangerous blip and and in a weird way like people,

687
00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:01.040
the people we met down here, the people doing this work,

688
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:06.041
this blood harvesting work in a way came to represent the best way to treat the

689
00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:09.800
crabs. Exactly. Treating them like gangs.

690
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.980
There are these rules in place to make sure that the horseshoe crabs are only

691
00:42:12.981 --> 00:42:16.040
picked up by hand and you can't pick them up by the tail

692
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.870
<v 0>cause you can injure the muscle in the tail.</v>

693
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:20.970
We keep them covered when we transport them,

694
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.630
<v 10>like they're also on a time clock.</v>

695
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.930
<v 0>We've got to get them back as quick as possible.</v>

696
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.140
<v 10>They have to be back to the ocean within 24 hours. When they get to the lab,</v>

697
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.080
<v 0>we give it a manicure, pedicure.</v>

698
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.530
<v 10>Each one gets scrubbed clean by hand</v>

699
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.350
<v 0>and then they borrow some blood from it and bring it back and let it go.</v>

700
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.740
<v 10>And he showed us how he returns them to the water and he like,</v>

701
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:46.070
he built this fricking water slide slide to get down to do it more gently.

702
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:50.750
<v 0>No, now we pick them up, set them into this slide in the water,</v>

703
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:55.740
takes them to the river before we used to pick them up and toss them. Yeah,

704
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.970
I mean we've gotten away from tossing him. It's amazing.

705
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:00.750
I've got a slide on my dog,

706
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:05.210
200 foot long water slide where the rehydrate on their way to the river.

<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

708
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.610
<v 0>see how fair stake holders</v>

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:16.510
do you want to get your finger gun in here? They squeezer want to hold it?

710
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:21.370
Yeah, so this is the male, that's the male.

711
00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:25.780
Okay. Females, at least we just interrupted his embrace game.

712
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:28.650

733
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.370
That sugar is Michelle Harris. You would think I could,

734
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.383
could've done that better.

735
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.490
I've been working in radio for a decade and a half right by and this message,

736
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.793
<v 10>well known.</v>

737
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.500
[inaudible] known to made it from Lulu. Below.

738
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:19.303
<v 15>Yeah.</v>

739
00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.310
<v 10>Hello? Hello.</v>

740
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.540
They go in a pretty good, um,

741
00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:30.130
hang up the phone. You should still be there. Hi. Beautiful.

742
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.590
Um, so, uh,

743
00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.520
word on the street is you have a story to read.

744
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:42.220
I do. I do have a story. I think my levels are okay.

745
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:47.320
Um, I have a really weird horseshoe crab deep dive.

746
00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:52.590
So you have to pretend you have to like really channel me speaking like a kind

747
00:45:52.841 --> 00:45:53.860
of Jersey Dude.

748
00:45:53.861 --> 00:45:58.861
Like I picture that this voice is a good a jersey kind of Tony Soprano voice to

749
00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.920
try to imitate it. Okay. But like go there in your I will,

750
00:46:05.921 --> 00:46:10.570
I will be translating into that voice in my head. Okay. Okay.

751
00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.240
Alright. So it's called me and Jane

752
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.753
<v 15>[inaudible].</v>

753
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:21.090
<v 10>There is nothing finer than the feel of Jane suckling algae from my back.</v>

754
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.140
If that sounds gross, just imagine how it would feel for a moment.

755
00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:29.730
A fine horseshoe crab like Jane climbing up onto your shell,

756
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.620
nibbling and scraping around to remove this past week's failures and setbacks

757
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:35.520
and scabs.

758
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:41.280
A glittering cascade of unsexy cunning all over your shell. Flip sees,

759
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.690
she'd say when her work was complete. My turn. Sorry,

760
00:46:45.691 --> 00:46:48.690
I'm a short of breath. This is a pregnancy curse, but I'll just,

761
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.840
there might be some breaths you're going to have to take out or even notice

762
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:52.950
sounded great. Okay, good.

763
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.380
Flip sees she'd stay when her work was complete my turn and I'd climb back up

764
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.340
under her back two around a bit. Pop, a few barnacles off,

765
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:06.720
but I never really did that great of a job for two reasons. One,

766
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.360
I am a bit lazy too.

767
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.980
After years of being a bit lazy and allowing my Jane's Shell to become encrusted

768
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.610
and salt scabs, algae, barnacles, and more than a few muscles,

769
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.800
I've come to find it all quite beautiful.

770
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.240
The whole stinking mess is a topographical record of our history.

771
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.040
When I say this to Jane, she rolls all nine of her eyes, but I mean it.

772
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.440
That patch of black LG on her up,

773
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.890
the Malick Rouge that appeared the night last spring when we spawned under a new

774
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:38.710
moon, which is of course no moon at all.

775
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.390
That white gunk near her tail from a nap in the mud,

776
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.980
the actual remnant of a cuddle or those barnacles on her backside.

777
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.230
I know the very day they latched on,

778
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.530
it was on our trip up to Maine to see the tide pools.

779
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.700
Jane had been scared of going scared of black bears are humans are Yada, Yada,

780
00:47:57.701 --> 00:47:58.990
Yada. I cut in and told her.

781
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:03.580
Those were just myths perpetuated by fearful crabs with too much goddamn time on

782
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:05.470
their hands. Life is for living.

783
00:48:05.471 --> 00:48:09.700
I told her as I thrust her into the Gulf stream and boy what a time we had.

784
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.640
We soaked in tide pools. We lay out in the sun.

785
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.630
Jane picking away at my back while I walked her through my idea for a starfish

786
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:20.950
novel. The barnacles must have suction onto her somewhere between the boyhood

787
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.060
stargazing scene, spooky starfish, star resonance,

788
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.010
and the seagull attack scene.

789
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:31.450
Even if I hadn't been too exhausted from my fit of inspiration to work on her

790
00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:32.500
barnacles that night,

791
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.610
I doubt I would have been able to pry them off as they proved the next morning

792
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:41.380
under that glaring Maine Sun. They were as hard as rock. Oh, well.

793
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.970
Without these spots, I fear I'd forget that life would become a wash.

794
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.410
I whisper these kinds of things to Jane when she seems a shame of her little

795
00:48:50.411 --> 00:48:55.090
green beard or when she sluggish from her kelp tails pulling in the tide.

796
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.620
The Steans and scabs are the particulars of our experience.

797
00:48:59.621 --> 00:49:04.621
I tell her they are our memories made physical or record forged in desiccating

798
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:10.780
cease stink of our love. I mean,

799
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.840
it's not that I don't appreciate a smoother shell.

800
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:17.530
When I see one Jefferson's wife for example,

801
00:49:17.531 --> 00:49:22.531
it is hard not to notice her swimming by her shell turgid with the strain of

802
00:49:22.751 --> 00:49:27.751
perfection and if you happen to be onshore when she comes up for air watch out,

803
00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:33.040
it is almost like an optical illusion. Water on water,

804
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:36.130
a hump of liquid emerging from itself.

805
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.290
What I'd give to reach out with the tiny hairs in my most private of spots,

806
00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:45.100
my NAFO basis and run them along her shell. Oh,

807
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:51.340
but still you couldn't pay me to trade places with Jefferson while I'm off on a

808
00:49:51.341 --> 00:49:51.820
fish.

809
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.330
Kark has bender with the guys or having a quiet morning to myself going Mollis

810
00:49:55.331 --> 00:49:56.050
contin.

811
00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:01.050
Jefferson is at home in that same damn ditch tending to his wife all day long.

812
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:06.721
He picks and buffs and scrapes and scrubs washing away her every residue.

813
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.330
She won't even tolerate a bit of salt buildup.

814
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.520
It was a simpler existence with my Jane, my old barnacled Gal.

815
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.960
More free. Lately though, I have to admit,

816
00:50:19.961 --> 00:50:23.830
I've been feeling restless. We're not fighting at all.

817
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.740
We're still very much able to make each other laugh,

818
00:50:26.741 --> 00:50:31.370
but I feel as though big things within me are becoming uneasy.

819
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.810
I mentioned something along the lines of this to Jane about a week ago,

820
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:40.160
but she assured me it was nothing, just physical time to Molt,

821
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:42.560
but the moon proved her wrong.

822
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:46.940
The brightening moon and the descent of thousands of new horseshoe crabs on the

823
00:50:46.941 --> 00:50:49.760
cove. It's the spawn. Of course,

824
00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:54.290
the upcoming spawn must be what's triggering this uneasiness in my gut because

825
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:56.480
while the first part is lovely,

826
00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.890
there is nothing like the feel of your pet pops out in the ocean holding onto

827
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.900
the edge of Jane's Shell with your grippers,

828
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:05.780
10,000 other crabs clacking so hard around you.

829
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.090
It's sometimes induces a sea steam.

830
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.920
What happens afterwards is unsettling.

831
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.610
Something strange comes over everybody.

832
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.720
Jefferson is no longer high strung. Jefferson, his wife,

833
00:51:20.721 --> 00:51:25.100
no longer a prima Donna Frank who's always been kind of weird and lonely,

834
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:27.200
seems okay.

835
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:32.960
Everybody is lifted from theirselves or rather ourselves seem to lift from our

836
00:51:32.961 --> 00:51:34.280
bodies and leave us.

837
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:39.880
We become one without our peculiarities at giant 10,000 [inaudible].

838
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:43.220
As we fall asleep that night,

839
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.880
thousands of us sinking into the coal mud all at once.

840
00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:51.080
A kind of communal dream takes place and we awake United.

841
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.380
We share food, take turns guarding the eggs,

842
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.510
drop our suspicions of one another.

843
00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.180
We are an efficient machine of a species without the drag of the individual.

844
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.490
I think there could be a book in this,

845
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:09.230
a sort of anti hard Dinny and treatise the promise of the Commons.

846
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.130
Imagine a completely selfless species. What good we could do,

847
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:17.810
how quickly we could rise, but alas,

848
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.290
curse of us creatures unable to change a thing about ourselves.

849
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:22.490
Since the dinosaurs,

850
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:27.560
we can never get this elevated state to last any longer than a couple of weeks.

851
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:30.560
It ends instantaneously with the hatch.

852
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:35.660
Once we've watched as tiny versions of US smaller than clams with little button

853
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.030
tales disappear into the surf,

854
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.530
the collective conscious begins to decay ourselves,

855
00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:47.060
float back down into our shells and we feel that familiar itch again of

856
00:52:47.061 --> 00:52:51.920
loneliness, a self confined irrevocably to its own body.

857
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:56.690
That's when we become assholes again and dickheads and self serious

858
00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.780
know-it-alls. And so my hunch,

859
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.840
I tell Jane is that this strange gurgling in my gut is some kind of quantum

860
00:53:06.981 --> 00:53:10.880
vertigo. Yeah, that's it. Quantum Vertigo,

861
00:53:10.881 --> 00:53:15.881
myself longing to be set free into the ether where it can leap and spin and do

862
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:20.900
whatever it is selves do up there and dastardly old me.

863
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:25.920
This collection of hard shell and Claus desperate to keep it inside.

864
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.510
But no, Jane was right.

865
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.810
It was just time to molt. Huh?

866
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:38.220
She said after she heard the telltale rumble from underneath my prison, Oma,

867
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:43.590
poor old crab thinking he's the next political theorist stirring with ideas when

868
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:48.150
really it was just a case of skeletal indigestion. I whipped her with my tail,

869
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:51.300
shut up. She was about to respond,

870
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.450
but a clattery burp came out instead. Huh?

871
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.250
I said mutual mutual. Molting Jane side,

872
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.420
splendid. As we readied ourselves for the process.

873
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:07.590
There's not much you can do, but stand there and take it. I realized something.

874
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.380
What timing. I said to Jane,

875
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:15.030
we'll have fresh bodies just in time for the spawn pristine shells.

876
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:20.490
I thought you liked my encrustations, said Jane staring out at the sea.

877
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.540
I do. I gulped my darling. Of course I do.

878
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.020
It was right around then that she started to split.

879
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:33.360
Her head started craning forward and I watched nauseated and thrilled as a

880
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:36.930
bigger wetter version of her began sliding out.

881
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:42.750
It took hours, this arduous process of slipping out of yourself,

882
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.880
but when she finally emerged, she was a sight to behold like Jane,

883
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:52.740
but gleaming and massive. I better go. She said,

884
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.630
I know I whispered.

885
00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:59.400
The soft and jelly like knew Jane would need to find a secluded place to hide as

886
00:54:59.401 --> 00:55:03.690
her shell hardened, shall I find you in our spot. Sure.

887
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:07.950
She said and began to slowly, carefully step away.

888
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.460
I laid down next to her old body in the sand.

889
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.410
It was almost like laying with her any old day that trustee silence of her

890
00:55:16.411 --> 00:55:20.370
listening, but with her shell completely empty. Now,

891
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.750
that familiar pattern of barnacles took on a frightening weight.

892
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:30.180
Something about them made me feel very worried, but I couldn't tell you what.

893
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:36.270
Eventually I two found my shell splitting. It wasn't the easiest of molts.

894
00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:37.920
I'll spare you the gory details,

895
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:41.280
but let's just say the old meat didn't want to let the new me through and it

896
00:55:41.281 --> 00:55:44.280
made its reluctance known with a deep gash down my back.

897
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.120
But at last I emerged bloodied and gelatinous.

898
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:53.370
I limped to some bushes nearby there. I waited as my back began to harden

899
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:56.040
through the brambles.

900
00:55:56.041 --> 00:56:00.360
I had a good view of our old shells lying side by side in the sand.

901
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.000
Two little humps in front of the sea.

902
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:07.710
I gave that us for hours as the moon slid across the sky.

903
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.800
There was me, the old me,

904
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:16.110
a shiny little dome reflecting the Moon's journey in miniature and there was

905
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:18.660
Jane, the old Jane, a body,

906
00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:23.661
so carpeted and weeds and stone that she reflected only us.

907
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:31.120
I awakened to legs, human ones, swishing by my brambles.

908
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:36.340
The rubber pads on its feet make horrible squeaking noises. I get low,

909
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:41.230
the legs halt for a moment and then run over to the old Jane and the old me,

910
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:42.933
the creature,

911
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:47.470
a little one for a human yanks old me by the tail and brings me up to his head.

912
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:52.870
I watch as it studies my private underside then turns me over and places me back

913
00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:55.420
down. Thank God right where I had been in the sand.

914
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:59.350
It runs its strange hand along my smooth shell.

915
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:04.600
It turns to examine old Jane, her sweet fas, her barnacles,

916
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:08.920
our life, her shell cracks under the rubber pad of its foot.

917
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.290
Cracks into a thousand pieces.

918
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:16.930
Little bastard dares to pick old me up again and all I can do is watch from my

919
00:57:16.931 --> 00:57:21.931
brambles as it runs away with me as it runs away with my past self dragging it

920
00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.830
ruthlessly down the shore.

921
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:29.980
The spine has come and gone. I looked everywhere for Jane,

922
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.990
waiting by our spot, calling her name into the clacking shells, nothing.

923
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:40.630
Now I spend most evenings underwater with frank. Weird.

924
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:42.730
Frank awaiting her return.

925
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:46.330
The fish won't stop nibbling at my molting wound.

926
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.630
I can feel flatworms burrowing into my back.

927
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.120
I ask frank to help me clean it,

928
00:57:52.121 --> 00:57:55.000
but he spits muscles and tells me I've got to be kidding.

929
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:57.820
My Shell is growing itchy with grit.

930
00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:01.150
I don't know if it's sand or barnacles or what.

931
00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:07.380
This afternoon I simply stood before the undertow and called her name and to its

932
00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:08.830
haunting screams,

933
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:15.080
Jane Jay

934
00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:15.890
<v 16>[inaudible].</v>

935
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.920
<v 10>Frank tells me to shut up about my starfish novel.</v>

936
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:22.160
Everyone does a coming of age starfish novel. He says, I mean,

937
00:58:22.161 --> 00:58:25.910
write the damn thing. If you want, just please stop talking about it.

938
00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:30.110
As I sit with him, LG sprouting on my lip,

939
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:34.670
I rethink the value of a self screw. The promise of the collective.

940
00:58:34.671 --> 00:58:39.170
I think sometimes one self can be a pretty good thing. The self,

941
00:58:39.171 --> 00:58:41.150
like a gene for instance.

942
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.610
I keep getting hit with shards of grit that instead of bouncing off my shell,

943
00:58:46.611 --> 00:58:50.870
now get cut in my kelp tangles. I feel sluggish,

944
00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.840
unwieldy in constant pain.

945
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:57.620
I think on past selves that smooth old me.

946
00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:02.780
What is a self anyway? What endures with the soul.

947
00:59:02.781 --> 00:59:06.740
A thing of question and my body now long gone. I said,

948
00:59:06.741 --> 00:59:08.000
even continuous.

949
00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.620
I have the distinct sense though. Jane would tell me,

950
00:59:12.621 --> 00:59:17.030
this is magical thinking that the old me is off somewhere on the mainland near

951
00:59:17.031 --> 00:59:18.500
that little human creature.

952
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:23.600
I can picture that clean old shell of drying out near some flower pots being

953
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:28.400
occasionally sniffed up by an idiotic canine with a sloppy tongue. Yes,

954
00:59:28.401 --> 00:59:32.270
I'm sure of it though. Jane would scrunch up all nine of her eyes and say,

955
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:35.000
of course you're sure of it. You're making it up.

956
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:40.570
The old me is preserved in pristine form on the mainland while the smashed

957
00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:45.740
shards of my sweet old Jane and crusted in the very stuff of our love

958
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.780
disintegrate into the sea.

959
00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.840
Perhaps it's little bits of her that are sticking to me now.

960
00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:03.760
There's my horseshoe crabs. Oh, that's great. That's really nice.

961
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.260
Yeah, it was really nice to listen to while lying on the floor here. Oh, good.

962
01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:10.120
I'm glad. That's lovely.

963
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.450
<v 13>Um, I, I didn't, I had no idea.</v>

964
01:00:13.451 --> 01:00:17.860
You had such an affection for horseshoe crabs before all this began where the

965
01:00:17.861 --> 01:00:20.080
story began. The holding hand,

966
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:23.470
the holding hands scene makes a lot a lot of sense. I mean,

967
01:00:23.471 --> 01:00:27.190
it makes sense in the moment listening to, yeah. But even with this context,

968
01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:28.090
it makes more sense now.
