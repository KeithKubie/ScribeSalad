00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.980
For completeness we'll go ahead and

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.570
explore duality in the context of
a maximum flow problem as well.

00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:11.990
We can cast it as a linear programming
by letting fuv be the flow, and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.900
letting cuv be the capacity
along an edge u,v.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.350
Our goal is to maximize
the flow out of the source

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.520
subject to the conservation of flow
constraint and the capacity constraints.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.780
And of course flows must
be non negative as well.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.930
To express the dual, we'll use Yu for

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.690
the conservation constraints and
Yuv for the capacity constraints.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.270
Two subscripts mean
a capacity constraint,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.340
one subscript means
a conservation constraint.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.450
The dual problem is to minimize the sum
over all the edges of Yuv times Cuv.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.340
Note that the Yus have no role
in the objection function

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.770
because their coefficients are 0.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.774
The constraints for
the dual involve several cases.

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:04.800
We'll consider first those arising from
the objective function coefficients for

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.770
edges out of the source being 1.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.090
These flows appear once in
the capacity constraints, and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.950
once for the receiving vertex for
the flow in their conservation equation.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.830
The case for
edges going into the sync is analogous.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.230
The flow is present in
the capacity constraints and

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.220
in the conservation of flow
constraint for the sending vertex.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.170
For all other edges the flow
appears in the capacity constraint.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.640
And in the conservation equations for
both the sending and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.450
the receiving vertex.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.190
And of course these dual
variables have to be non-negative.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.660
The interpretation of these dual
variables can be a little tricky, so

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.130
I'm going to rearrange them to isolate
the two indexed variables, the ones

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.690
corresponding to edges and the ones
that appear in the objective function.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.280
On the left hand side.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.380
This makes it a little easier
to see what's going on.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.440
Actually, I think this
would make a good exercise.
