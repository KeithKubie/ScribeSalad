DHARSHINI DAVID: Thanks so much.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.360
Thank you, Rob, and thank
you for having me here today.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.180
I'm not quite sure how
I'm going to compete

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.370
with next week's program.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.920
Having said that, I've only
spoken at one OTHER Google

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.920
event, and that was at
Zeitgeist I said a few years ago

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.422
when I was basically chairing
the likes of Stephen Hawking.

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:27.630
David Attenborough was there.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.078
Mo Farah was leading
the morning run.

00:00:30.078 --> 00:00:32.369
So I'm not quite sure how to
compete with them, either.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.220
I can't really tell
you about the secrets

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.840
behind quantum physics.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.450
I'm not sure I'm going
to be much use in proving

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.710
your personal best
of 800 meters,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.960
and I have no idea what lies
beneath the ocean floor.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930
But instead, I'm going
to try and tell you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.490
in the space of
half an hour or so

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.340
a little bit about the
secrets of the global economy.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.710
What are those
economic forces that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.180
shift around all our fortunes?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.330
What lies beneath, and what
lies beneath that global power

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.090
base and the way it's changing?

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.220
All of that for the price of
a dollar-- a bit of a bargain

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.366
there for lunch time.

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.490
But "The Almighty Dollar"--

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.690
the book I've written--

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.390
is about more than
that, in fact.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.460
I was an economist at
the start of my career.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.190
I still am.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.260
But I made the worst economic
decision of my career

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.100
some years ago when I decided
to swap a trading floor

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.040
for the world of broadcasting.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.790
I thought it would mean pretty
decent money and better hours--

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.350
neither of those
two in case anybody

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.020
else is thinking of
making a similar move.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.090
But the reason I did it
above everything else

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.240
is because I was
frustrated at the way

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.580
that economics was
viewed as this--

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.520
not just the dismal science,
but the distant science

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.560
that people didn't understand.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.940
It didn't matter to them.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.250
It was too complicated.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.090
Why should we try
and explain it?

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.660
It was worthy, but
frankly dull, and I'm

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.115
afraid that image has continued.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.740
So in that sense, I
feel like I failed.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.182
I feel like the entire
world's media, frankly,

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:02.640
has failed, because this is
what we think about, of course.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.210
When we talk about economics,
we think about big players,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.430
big picture, big numbers.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.900
And I'm sure some
of you here would

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.160
have been at Davos
in recent years,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.151
so you could probably recognize
those two photos at the top

00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:16.650
there--

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.850
[INAUDIBLE] there this year.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.460
What really struck
me as at a time

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.920
when we're talking about
the rise of populism,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.820
about dissatisfaction amongst
people around the globe

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.070
about their lots in life--

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.950
what have we got?

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.360
We've got the world's political
leaders and financial leaders

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.870
wringing their hands over
the issues of inequality

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.130
and stagnant wages and
the rise of the right,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.357
all while sipping their 100
franc glasses of champagne,

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:45.940
dithering about
whether or not to have

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.290
a 50 franc croque
monsieur, and retiring

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.870
to their 1,000 franc
a night rooms--

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.120
none of which is
an exaggeration.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.382
It's not a cheap place to be.

00:02:56.382 --> 00:02:58.410
It's the highest town in Europe.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.400
It feels a long way from
many of the day to day issues

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.290
that affect people.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.810
But I have a strong feeling
that those forces shouldn't

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.550
be viewed in the
abstract like that.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.810
It isn't the case that the
big players actually debate

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.579
and determine our forces.

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.120
The other image, of
course, we always

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.180
talk about when we talk about
the world's financial systems--

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.250
markets, that opaque
thing, Wall Street,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.100
the bulls and the
bears, trillions

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.990
of dollars changing hands.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.030
Some of the products
even the people

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.230
there on the New York
Stock Exchange floor

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.230
don't understand what
they're all about.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.360
It's all beyond
our understanding.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.974
It's all beyond our
control, isn't it?

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:37.140
There's more to it, I think.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.030
Because even though
that's the big picture,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.430
I think ultimately what
we need to talk about

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.430
is the smallest forces.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.630
And that comes down to,
frankly, the individual dollar.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.584
And it is dollar.

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:51.000
Because even though we've got
all these currencies flowing

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.027
around the globe, it's
the dollar that's king.

00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:55.110
You call it what you like.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.190
You can call it
the dead president.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.540
You can call it a single.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.710
You can call it a greenback,
but it is the thing.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.930
As much as I studied this,
this is the thing really

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.250
that is driving all our forces.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.500
Why the dollar?

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.400
Well, it is international
currency of trade,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.090
and we can blame
history for that one.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.150
More on that in a second.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.940
It's also the security
blanket that governments

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.100
and central banks cling
to around the world.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.660
It's the world's
reserve currency.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.050
You have that stored away
in case there is a rainy day

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.240
as well as in case you need it
for trade and things like that.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.710
And again, there is a reason
why they cling to that dollar.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.520
It's seen as being stable.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.970
It's seen as being the globe's
common financial language.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.140
People will accept a
dollar in a way, of course,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.250
they wouldn't accept
a bitcoin just yet.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.860
And because of that image
of security and stability,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.530
the dollar is also a common way
of holding your debts as well--

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.800
loans made between countries,
loans made across borders,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.152
between companies as well.

00:04:51.152 --> 00:04:53.610
So a natural fact-- if you look
at the American population,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.810
it's what?

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.710
5% of the world total maximum?

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.260
But the dollar comes up
in 40% of transactions

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.590
around the world.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.770
It's also the currency in which
40% of loans are made as well,

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.041
so it's punching way
above its weight.

00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:13.579
A bit now about the history of
the dollar, though, because--

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.370
well, that's not the
history of the dollar.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.000
That's the world's common
language, isn't it?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.680
And really, it is
the common language

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.120
that is driving everything.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.610
But when you look at it,
it's had a little bit

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.020
of a checkered past.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.360
And let's just talk a bit
more about that history,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.400
then-- give you a bit
of a glimpse there.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.310
History of a greenback--
from Bohemia to the Bronx.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.930
Well, the dollar-- despite the
name and despite everything

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.360
we've heard about it--

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.734
isn't, in actual
fact, American at all.

00:05:41.734 --> 00:05:43.650
It's no more American
than I was to start with

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.370
to be honest, because
what you've got

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.390
there is originally what was
known as a "thaler"-- a thaler

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.530
coin.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.230
And those were
minted in Bohemia.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.620
That's an original one there.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.790
You can see there 1525, minted
in what was then Bohemia,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.339
now what we'd call
the Czech Republic.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.380
And those silver coins
were used, in actual fact,

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.520
across Europe for
hundreds of years.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.550
And if you look back
at popular culture,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.550
they crop up time
and time again.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.330
Shakespeare was quite fond of
actually talking about dollars.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.890
And it comes up--

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.070
I think it's the second
scene in "Macbeth."

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.610
They talk about $10,000,
which is a little bit

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.580
odd, because "Macbeth"--
for those who like theater--

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.740
was set in the 11th
century, so dollars

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.090
weren't even around back then.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.150
So bit of artistic
license there.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.370
Then, of course, we saw
the dollar being adopted

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.800
as the currency in the US.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.130
And again, we have a gentleman
over there, Alexander Hamilton,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.730
to thank-- again storming
Broadway and the West End

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.230
right now.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.730
So there's some
kind of connection--

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.960
though I'm not quite sure--
between the greenback

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.280
and the stage.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.040
But we have him to thank, and
that currency has endured.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.760
So for much that we talk about
the rise of, say, the RMB

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.210
or the euro or even
digital currencies,

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.210
the dollar somehow has
managed to keep its head

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.330
high across all those years.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.170
And in actual fact,
it's continuing.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.670
Having said that, there's been
various bumps in the road.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.460
This was something that none
of us are going to remember,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.959
of course.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:11.530
This was the Great
Depression, when

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.430
we saw the value
of shares dropping

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.752
by almost a quarter over the
course of four or five days.

00:07:17.752 --> 00:07:21.185
And once investors had
finished dumping their shares,

00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:22.060
what do they do next?

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.980
They started dumping
their dollars,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.100
exchanging them for gold
because they were so concerned

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.590
about the world's
most popular currency

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.040
as it was back then, which
meant a great demand for gold.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.870
The American Central
Bank got very worried

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.130
about the value of the dollar.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.430
So what does it do to try
and prop up that interest,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.510
keep investors
hanging on to them?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.469
It put up interest rates.

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:45.510
Of course, that's one way
of ensuring that people

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.600
want to buy your currency.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.520
They get a better return.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.500
Who pays the price for that?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.740
Well, this is what happens.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.340
You end up with 25%
of your working age

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.600
population out of work.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.660
The people who have got jobs
probably are underemployed,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.050
working part-time when they
want to work even longer hours.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.960
So that was the
Great Depression--

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.680
GDP output falling by up to
a third over that period,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.370
the economy scarred and damaged.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.620
Having said that,
there was actually

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.170
a light at the end of the
tunnel for the dollar.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.106
And this is something-- here
we go back to our dollar again.

00:08:20.106 --> 00:08:21.480
And I just want
to show you this.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.400
If you flip over a
dollar, and if you're ever

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.440
stuck in an immigration
queue at JFK,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.424
I find it's great
way to pass the time.

00:08:30.424 --> 00:08:31.840
There's a symbol
on the back there

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.600
which no one quite
knows the meaning of it.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.969
And if you look at it, that is
1935 that went on the dollar.

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:40.510
And many people
looking at are going,

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.912
that's a Masonic symbol, right?

00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:44.620
In actual fact, when
they looked into it,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.290
the engravers who put
it there weren't masons.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.720
So no one's quite sure what
it means or why it's there.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.011
But if you look at it in
detail, there's the eye of God

00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:52.630
up there.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.210
God favors [INAUDIBLE]
the taking.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.840
And at the bottom--

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.280
the new world order.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.380
And it was under FDR
that that was put on.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.510
And [INAUDIBLE] psychic.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.770
Nobody quite knows,
but it actually

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.172
was a quite an accurate
predictor of the way things

00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:09.130
were going to turn out.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.050
Because what happened
after the Second World

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.550
War is there was a conference
at a town called Bretton

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.280
Woods you've probably
heard of which

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.890
was set up to enable
there be lasting peace--

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.200
financial stability
around the globe.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.760
What came out of it
was, in many ways,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.880
the main vector of
the Second World War,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.930
and that was the dollar.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.640
It was cemented there as the
international currency of trade

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.150
and also that currency
of last resort--

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.180
that currency that was
being used primarily

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.452
for the bank's reserves.

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:39.910
It was linked to
the value of gold.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.880
It was referred to as
being as good as gold,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.680
and all the other
currencies in turn

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.800
had their values
actually linked to that.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.020
That particular
setup didn't last.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.427
But the legacy of all that
was that to this day--

00:09:52.427 --> 00:09:54.010
as I was saying a
little bit earlier--

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.160
we still do use the dollar as
the currency for doing trade

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.180
and also as that
security blanket.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.180
And what does that mean?

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.850
Well, ultimately,
whether we like it

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.260
or not, whether we're
using dollars every day,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.680
whether we're seeing them,
whether they electronic,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.770
it is touching all
our lives every day.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.110
And through the
choices we make, that

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.200
impacts on the economic forces
around the world and the way

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.630
that influence and
power shifts as well.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.520
So what I thought
I'd do was have

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.060
a look at the dollar and
its journey around the globe

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.520
and look at a sort
of series of episodes

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.020
of what might happen
if you followed

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.280
a dollar around the globe.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.460
What does that tell us
about the powers there?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.530
And it's not an unusual journey.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.960
There's 12 billion dollar notes
in circulation-- almost 12

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.920
billion.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.910
And about half of them
are outside of the US--

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.610
half of them, which
sounds extraordinary

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.640
when you put it that
way, but they are.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.445
So it's not an unusual
journey by any means.

00:10:51.445 --> 00:10:53.070
So in terms of looking
at that journey,

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.000
let's start in the home
of the big spender.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.400
Let's start in the US where one
in six of every dollars of GDP,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.610
output income, however you
would look at it each year

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.610
is generated in the form
of consumer spending.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.900
So it's a nation
of big shoppers.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.550
And even though that's
something that people look upon

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.780
as being a negative, it's a
very important thing indeed.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.340
And this particular
transaction--

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.730
we're going to look at something
that happens every day.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.140
We're going to look at a
shopper who does what many of us

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.880
do-- shopping trip--
end of it-- you just

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.251
chuck something in the trolley.

00:11:30.251 --> 00:11:31.250
Everyone's been to Ikea.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.560
You know exactly how this works.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.830
You come out spending
more than you

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.204
thought with things you think,
I didn't really need that,

00:11:36.204 --> 00:11:38.320
but it's in there anyway.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.000
My example-- I looked at a woman
who'd been in a Texan branch--

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.310
it doesn't have to be Texas--

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.710
of Walmart who puts a
radio into her trolley.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.244
It's cheap.

00:11:49.244 --> 00:11:51.410
It's going to give her some
enjoyment in the kitchen

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.690
while she's cooking
dinner that night.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.034
But the main thing is,
it's made in China.

00:11:57.034 --> 00:11:59.450
And that's something that is
a very important relationship

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.120
indeed, because Walmart--

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.660
it's all about piling it
high, selling it cheap.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.260
That's the logo it was basically
founded on many years ago.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.450
And to make that
happen, increasingly it

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.240
means turning to China
to supply the lines.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.840
You've got tens of
thousands of suppliers

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.350
in China just making
stuff for Walmart.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.691
Walmart actually buys more from
China than the whole of Germany

00:12:24.691 --> 00:12:25.190
does.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.130
That's how important
that relationship is.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.850
And between them
both, they've come up

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:34.430
with liners that can make the
journey across in five days--

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.850
which is, as you can imagine,
a pretty busy route right now.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.130
Of course, the ships
going back the other way

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.550
aren't nearly as
full, which adds up

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.315
to something quite different.

00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:47.940
This has quite a big
impact, of course,

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:48.939
on the American economy.

00:12:48.939 --> 00:12:51.380
I lived in New York
about a decade ago,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.640
and this bridge in New Jersey
in Trenton always fascinated me.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.510
It's Trenton Bridge.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.140
And it's lit up to say,
Trenton makes, the world takes.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.780
It's been there for 100 years.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.270
And 100 years ago that was true,
because, of course, what we

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.010
saw then was America very
much making what it consumed.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.970
If you bought a
radio back then, it

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.114
was likely to have been
built in that factory

00:13:13.114 --> 00:13:14.530
up there which is
in Pennsylvania.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.930
That's taken in 1925 just a
couple of hours down the road

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.820
from the Trenton bridge.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.560
But that's all
changed since then.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.060
If you're buying a
radio in America,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.390
chances are it's not
made in America at all.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.120
We've now got much cheaper
labor elsewhere, of course.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.550
If you look at the
size of the working age

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.270
population in China,
it's five times the size

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.740
of that in the US.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.560
So it's no wonder-- for
many other reasons as well--

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.616
that labor is a lot
cheaper over there.

00:13:42.616 --> 00:13:43.880
You've got cheaper labor.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.070
You've also got
various governments

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.420
around the world giving their
industries a helping hand.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.700
What does that add up to?

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.741
You've got things like
that like that steel plant

00:13:51.741 --> 00:13:55.110
at the bottom lying derelict.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.710
The Rust Belt has turned
very much to dust.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.380
So what is America
actually making?

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.680
It's making shoppers.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.880
It's making people who are
buying in goods from abroad,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.960
and that all adds up to a
massive, big trade deficit.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.701
I think it's at $566 billion.

00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:14.450
President Trump talked
about $800 billion.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.245
He actually got that wrong.

00:14:16.245 --> 00:14:17.870
That's the amount of
goods they buy in.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.160
This is the goods bought in
minus the goods going out.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.530
But what he has actually
touched a nerve with,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.080
obviously, is what this means
to the American economy--

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.660
the fact that if
America is not making,

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.930
if it's buying from elsewhere,
that does impact on incomes.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.590
It does impact on output.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.690
It impacts in jobs, hence
"make America great again."

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.000
It's not everything, though.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.030
There are some things that
America still excels in.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.700
Boeing is saying that over
the next couple of decades,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.840
it expects to get a trillion
dollars worth of orders

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.540
from China, which
is extraordinary

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.760
when you consider the way
Chinese manufacturing is

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.960
evolving.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.570
But that's because America
still excels in the higher tech

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.740
areas of manufacturing.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.910
It still has a specialty.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.575
It has a comparative advantage,
but you can't live off

00:15:06.575 --> 00:15:07.450
airplanes, of course.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.470
So we've now got this trade
war emerging on the other side

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.180
of the Atlantic.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.270
What does that mean?

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.247
Well, it means
that Trump puts up

00:15:17.247 --> 00:15:19.080
barriers and things
like steel and aluminum,

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.210
saying everybody else
is playing unfairly.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.210
This is putting my
manufacturers out of business.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.010
The likes of Europe
retaliate, saying, OK.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.093
We're going to put charge
on things that you still

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:32.490
make like Levi's jeans
and Harley-Davidsons.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.280
No one wins, of course, because
you end up with high prices.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.490
You end up with less business
being done, ultimately.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.810
You end up with less output.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.450
The cost of actually making
those things goes up as well.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.525
So in many ways,
it's the populations

00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:47.700
of both who are
loses, and that's

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.510
why we've seen trade wars coming
down rather than coming up

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.270
in the last few years.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.930
But what does this
mean for China?

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.520
Well, of course, if America
is taking, China's making.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.840
It's all happening there
in the Shenzhen factories.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.900
So many of them now--

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.505
20,000 suppliers there
grinding out stuff for Walmart.

00:16:07.505 --> 00:16:08.600
They're all together.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.120
You got the Pearl River
Delta, which is the biggest

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.920
megacity now on the planet.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.600
But what all those
producers have

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.510
in common is that they're
not allowed to hang

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.640
onto the dollars they make.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.760
Those dollars get funneled up
instead by the financial system

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.780
to the central bank, who's got
a very specific use in mind

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.060
for them.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.840
And all of that
is down to what's

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.290
dictated by the Chinese
government, of course,

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.340
in the Great Hall of the People
there on the edge of Tienanmen

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.260
Square.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.127
And for many years,
they've said, right.

00:16:41.127 --> 00:16:42.210
We're all about producing.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.680
We are going to become
the world's factories

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.460
and workshops.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.730
In recent years, the cracks have
started to show in that policy.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.160
Because you've got Vietnam--

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.170
wages are now a fifth of
what they are in China.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.409
So the likes of H&amp;M--

00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:55.950
they start to look
elsewhere and say,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.280
I'm going to buy my garments
from Vietnam instead.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.940
What does that mean for China?

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.490
Well, they also have to
contend with the aftermath

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:08.339
of the financial crisis when
world trade fell by over 15%

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.930
in the course of just months.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.967
So they know this
isn't a banker.

00:17:11.967 --> 00:17:13.550
They have to think
about diversifying,

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.079
so they're trying to create
also a nation of consumers.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.170
So no wonder that
Alibaba has overtaken

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.619
Walmart when it comes
to sales and is now

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.432
the biggest retailer on Earth.

00:17:24.432 --> 00:17:25.890
But back to what
the Chinese people

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:26.950
are doing with the dollar.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.324
This is a really
fascinating one,

00:17:28.324 --> 00:17:31.839
because it's got
all these dollars.

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:32.880
What do you do with them?

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.300
You can't stick them all under
the mattress by any means.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.380
One of the things, of course--
one of the reasons why China

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.060
has hung on so
tightly to dollars

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.650
is because it wants to
control its exchange rate.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.210
Why is that?

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.922
Well, the cheaper your exchange,
the lower your exchange rate,

00:17:47.922 --> 00:17:50.380
the cheaper your exports are,
the more attractive they are.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.930
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.360
we have seen all these
trade complaints coming up

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.320
in recent years.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.570
Also, of course, it's one
of the reasons why you never

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.710
hear the American
government talking

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.001
about wanting the dollar to
be stronger, because that's

00:18:01.001 --> 00:18:03.090
bad news for producers.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.924
So by keeping
control of the RMB,

00:18:05.924 --> 00:18:08.340
it puts the Chinese government
in a very strange position.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.894
Because if you're controlling
your exchange rate,

00:18:10.894 --> 00:18:12.810
you're controlling the
amount of your currency

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.980
that can flow around
the world, which

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.630
means that your
currency's not going

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.330
to be able to take on the dollar
when it comes to popularity

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.810
of use around the globe.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.050
So you're giving up some
power in that sense.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.550
What it does with
all these dollars,

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.925
though-- the
Chinese government's

00:18:24.925 --> 00:18:27.730
actually quite conservative
when it comes to investing.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.960
So they like to go out and
buy American government bonds.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.605
That's the form by which the
American government borrows.

00:18:34.605 --> 00:18:37.560
It issues these bonds at
quite a low rate of return,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.554
but it's a pretty stable one.

00:18:40.554 --> 00:18:41.970
The Chinese
government loves them,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.870
because they know that Uncle
Sam is good for the money.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.110
These are also what's
known as "liquid debt,"

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.780
so you can cash them
in quite easily.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.360
They're also what's known
as "deep assets," which

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.400
means that if you go
and buy some of them

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.070
or sell some of them, there are
so many of them around you're

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.390
not going to impact the price.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.364
There is a sense of
stability there as well,

00:19:03.364 --> 00:19:04.530
which makes it very popular.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.363
What does that mean for
the American people?

00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:09.000
Well, China own
some of its debt.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.550
So in theory you think
that means that China

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.110
could hold America to ransom.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.464
In practice, actually,
lots of other countries

00:19:15.464 --> 00:19:16.380
want these bonds, too.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.380
So there's always
a buyer for them.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.429
It does mean, however, that
because they're so popular,

00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:24.720
the American government can
borrow at very low interest

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.760
rate.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.140
And that means that in
turn, American people

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.600
can enjoy lower interest rates.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.440
So there's some payback there.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.320
There's also something else
that China uses its dollars for,

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.160
and that is to invest abroad--
something that has become

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.240
very popular in recent years.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.740
And for China, it
means that dollars

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.460
are the key to growing
its economic empire

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.332
beyond its shores.

00:19:45.332 --> 00:19:47.790
This is the old Silk Road--
which you won't remember unless

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.670
you were around in the
times of the Roman Empire--

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.930
originally used to bring--

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.013
well, this is the new one.

00:19:53.013 --> 00:19:55.470
But the old one was meant
to bring silk to Europe

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.680
and also brought things
like carrots the other way.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.950
Now the Chinese government
is investing billions--

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.050
trillions even--

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:10.080
in building a new maritime
and also the road--

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.780
Silk Road-- to try and
increase its trade passages

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.659
and also increase its
influence as well.

00:20:16.659 --> 00:20:18.575
All of this-- and you
add in all the companies

00:20:18.575 --> 00:20:20.680
and the mergers and
acquisitions going on as well.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.530
For the first time
in 2014, China

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.440
invested more money abroad than
was being invested in China.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.900
It's an interesting
switch of position there.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.400
Why?

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.820
Because China is thinking about
how it grows its influence

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.330
around the globe.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.840
And it's not just those routes
you can see there on the map.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.160
Because if you're
investing in dollar

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.400
as the Chinese government,
you might send it

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.030
somewhere like Nigeria, which
is what I looked at next.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.130
Why Nigeria?

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.120
Well, this is a very,
very strange one indeed--

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.660
because they're
building railroads.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.360
Why would you build a railroad
in Nigeria-- $12 billion

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.760
worth of railroad?

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.150
It goes from Calabar, which
is a port town, to Lagos,

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.770
the financial capital.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.000
It crosses some oil fields,
and that's the clue.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.530
China needs oil to develop.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.940
Nigeria has it.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.250
China wants to have influence
over these oil fields.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.440
It might want to get
some of those contracts.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.070
What better way than being a
friend of Nigeria's, exerting

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.780
some soft power--

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.970
that kind of economic diplomacy?

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.830
Building a railroad
there enables

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.260
people to get around
as well and for cargo

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.530
to get around in a country
where road journeys are

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.275
quite perilous and railroads are
currently very underdeveloped.

00:21:34.275 --> 00:21:35.650
Great news for
Nigeria, isn't it?

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.910
They get railroads.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.190
They get infrastructure.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.140
China get some jobs as
well for its workers.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.024
Nigeria get some jobs as well.

00:21:44.024 --> 00:21:45.440
But there's a
downside, of course,

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.740
because by ceding
some of your territory

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.480
there, by accepting China's
dollars, you're in actual fact,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.390
saying, well, we're giving
up some power as well.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.880
So that's one reason why
when we talk about the oil

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.530
wealth in Nigeria--

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.734
very, very little of it actually
passes into local hands.

00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:04.900
Because it's foreign
companies, foreign money that's

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.740
coming in and actually
paying into those things

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.337
and reaping the gains
at the same time.

00:22:11.337 --> 00:22:12.670
And it's more than that as well.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.050
That's the market in Lagos.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.840
Now, you can see there some
of the local cloth there being

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.840
sold-- a huge source of
income there, very popular.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.511
But now you tend to find--

00:22:21.511 --> 00:22:23.260
it's about $1 a yard,
I think, on average.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.860
But the Chinese imports
are undercutting that

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.400
substantially, so
what you're seeing

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.090
is local traders there
being put out of business.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.390
And what we've seen in
the last few years--

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:37.370
it's investment there
overcoming the level of aid

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.190
given to Nigeria,
which has thrown up

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.630
lots of questions about what
is the answer when you've

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.790
got-- as Nigeria has.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.330
Nigeria had huge problems with
a famine not that long ago

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.150
partly because of
conflict in the country.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.920
What do you do in a
situation like that?

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.820
Is it all about investment?

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.740
Is it about aid?

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.502
Well, both come with
strings attached

00:22:55.502 --> 00:22:56.460
seems to be the answer.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.500
Even aid nowadays--
there's all sorts

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.990
of concerns about the
right types of projects,

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.880
the right kind of
appropriation funds as well.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.144
So it's one of those
debates that keeps going on.

00:23:07.144 --> 00:23:08.310
And if you want to develop--

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.405
do you want infrastructure like
Nigeria's getting off China?

00:23:12.405 --> 00:23:13.780
If you get it from
China, there's

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.988
going to be strings attached.

00:23:14.988 --> 00:23:18.539
If you get it through aid as
well-- is that the answer?

00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:20.080
But the other thing
that, of course--

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.090
Nigeria also has to
import a lot of food.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.381
Because one of the problems
about being an economy that

00:23:27.381 --> 00:23:30.400
has been subject to so much
conflict as it has been

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.400
is that, in actual fact, your
national dish-- if it's rice

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.520
and you can't grow enough, it's
got to come from elsewhere.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.920
So I followed that
dollar to India next

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.160
to see exactly what would
happen if you then had

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.870
to buy your rice from India.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.870
And that's quite a popular
route in actual fact,

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.161
because even though we think
about individual countries

00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:53.440
producing commodities, that
money goes through a middleman.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.232
It goes through four or five
major commodities traders,

00:23:56.232 --> 00:23:58.690
and they trade in dollars,
which is why we're still talking

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.770
about dollars right now.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.720
So that brings us to India.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.790
And India is a really
interesting example here

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.400
of how you look at
growth and prosperity,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.640
because you've got the
rice bowl there of India--

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.940
over 165 million
tons of rice produced

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.680
by India last year, second
only to China in that regard.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.840
But on the other
hand, you've got

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.470
2/3 of the population
of working age in India

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.280
employed in agriculture.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.835
Most of them still
live in poverty.

00:24:31.835 --> 00:24:34.180
They're only about
10% as productive

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.340
as their American
counterparts, and that's

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.430
for a number of reasons.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.110
You've got things like tiny
farms, poor land rights,

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.684
poor use of machinery,
low levels of technology.

00:24:44.684 --> 00:24:46.600
And then on top of that,
your infrastructure's

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.180
so bad that even if you manage
to produce that kilo of rice,

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.040
up to half of it
might have gone off

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.964
by the time it gets to the
ports it was destined for.

00:24:53.964 --> 00:24:55.630
And then there's the
middle man as well.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.260
There's those big
commodities traders.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.770
So the average Indian
is not seeing very much

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.729
of the value of what they're
trying to produce there--

00:25:02.729 --> 00:25:04.270
and then that strange
situation where

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.290
the country can't feed
itself, and also many farmers

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.560
can't make a living.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.480
That's one side of
the Indian economy.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.900
We know it's the fastest
growing major economy right now.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.630
Why?

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.030
What do I need to tell you,
actually, in this room?

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.571
You probably know
the answer already.

00:25:17.571 --> 00:25:19.210
It's all to do with
tech and the fact

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.150
that 25 years ago we were
looking at a tech industry that

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.890
was worth about $2 billion-- now
well in excess of $100 billion,

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:27.405
of course.

00:25:27.405 --> 00:25:28.780
I won't go into
any more of that,

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.360
because you know all
about how successful that

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.310
has been in terms of
propelling the tech

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.591
industry around the globe.

00:25:35.591 --> 00:25:37.840
But it means that India has
taken a very strange route

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.980
to get there, because most
countries undergo an Industrial

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.369
Revolution.

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:43.910
India didn't.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.310
India kind of just jumped ahead.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.680
It went, I'm not doing
an Industrial Revolution.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.250
I'm not exporting-- like China
did-- manufactured goods.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.150
I'm going to go
straight to tech.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.420
Does it need to
have the middle man?

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.344
Probably, yes.

00:25:57.344 --> 00:25:59.010
If you look at what's
going on in India,

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.990
you've got 65 million
people living in slums--

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.740
people moving out from
rural areas saying,

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.440
I can't afford to live here.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.240
I'm moving to the cities,
but there's nothing for them.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.430
So the government's trying
to get a handle on that

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.150
by saying, well, we need to
think more about investing.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.108
They're trying to attract
foreign money-- which

00:26:14.108 --> 00:26:16.270
is quite a departure for
the Indian government--

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.660
and also trying to
involve more technology.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.230
They also tried this strange
experiment of doing away

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.320
with 500,000 rupee notes--

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.250
demonetization-- partly to
weed out the informal economy,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.210
tax evaders, dodgy activities.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.800
India is an unusually
cash-based economy.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.970
It didn't quite work,
because the people who

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.230
were professional enough
to be dodging taxes

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.140
and the big timers were
actually able to put their money

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.390
in some others things as well.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.010
Gold jewelers were
working through the night.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.593
The people who really suffered
in that kind of experiment were

00:26:50.593 --> 00:26:53.290
housewives-- the people who had
money hidden under the bed--

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.456
because they couldn't explain
where it came from, so

00:26:55.456 --> 00:26:58.050
they couldn't exchange
it for the new notes.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.300
So it didn't quite work there.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.966
But on the other hand,
one of the things

00:27:00.966 --> 00:27:03.940
that did happen, as you can see,
are greater growth of things

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.630
like--

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.715
well, digital banking
took off in a big way.

00:27:06.715 --> 00:27:08.715
And also you get things
like [INAUDIBLE] drivers

00:27:08.715 --> 00:27:11.440
who now accept digital
payments as well,

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.141
so it did have some impact.

00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:15.640
But really, the government--
when it's trying to modernize--

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.265
has to look at more
traditional routes.

00:27:17.265 --> 00:27:19.577
It has to look at
things like investing.

00:27:19.577 --> 00:27:21.160
It also has to look
at building roads.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.140
As I mentioned there,
an awful lot of produce

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.420
gets wasted simply
because India doesn't

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:31.270
have the roads to connect
its 650,000 villages.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.910
But it wants to change
that, so the government's

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.660
got a very ambitious
road building project.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.990
Depending on which estimate
they want to on which day,

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.232
it's either 20
kilometers or 25 miles.

00:27:42.232 --> 00:27:44.190
There's quite a big
difference between the two.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.720
We'll just accept that they're
trying to build more roads.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.900
But to build roads,
you need oil,

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.300
because oil is what
does into road surfaces

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.182
as well as into the cars and
trucks that drive on them.

00:27:59.182 --> 00:28:02.620
Where are you going to get
that oil from if you're India?

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.240
How about Iraq?

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.980
So let's follow that
dollar on to Iraq.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.610
And that is the
Missan oil fields.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.621
That's near Basra, and they
produce a very particular type

00:28:15.621 --> 00:28:16.120
of oil.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.530
Because even though we
talk about crude oil,

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:18.863
there's different grades of oil.

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:23.770
The stuff that goes into cars
is typically light, sweet oil.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:24.640
Don't drink it.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.150
It's just called that
because of the way it flows

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.100
and because of the
way it evaporates

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.960
as well if you spill.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.720
The stuff you use in roads
is the heavier grades--

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.320
the sour grades.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.570
It tends to be a
bit cheaper as well.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.364
And the oil filled
in Basra-- they

00:28:41.364 --> 00:28:43.030
realized that they
can actually get away

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.070
with splitting this
into the course stuff

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.990
and selling that
on at a discount.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:51.389
And India is quite
literally lapping that up.

00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:52.930
So you've got a
ready customer there.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:53.920
It's not just India.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.460
If you look across
the world, on average,

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.590
each man, woman, and
child uses the equivalent

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:03.017
of over two liters
of crude oil per day

00:29:03.017 --> 00:29:04.850
if you look at consumption
across the globe.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.599
That's going particularly
fast, of course,

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:08.630
in countries like
China and India.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.020
So there is a
steady demand there.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.110
You would think that
equals power, right?

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.010
Not necessarily.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.380
Having oil doesn't always
mean you have more power.

00:29:20.635 --> 00:29:23.067
Where there's oil,
there is dollars,

00:29:23.067 --> 00:29:24.900
and there's a very
specific reason for that.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.960
In the 1970s, Saudi
Arabia and the US

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.100
did a deal whereby the US said,
well, you can use our dollars.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.244
And in return you'll
have the protection

00:29:34.244 --> 00:29:35.160
of our foreign policy.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.060
You have our backing.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.450
And Saudi went,
thanks very much.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.110
That's great.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.651
And in return, we'll make sure
we have a special relationship

00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:43.080
with you, your big
gas guzzlers, and I'm

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.230
sure we can make this work.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.430
And it has worked ever since.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.700
But what Saudi has
found-- and of course,

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.610
last week we saw a great
delegation visiting 10

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.240
Downing Street
almost cap in hand,

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.500
because Saudi has
discovered that having oil

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.840
doesn't necessarily
equal riches forever.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.850
Even if demand is
going up, the price

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.580
can fluctuate from year
to year quite a bit.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.860
And those prices are
determined on global markets.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.860
And even though Saudi
Arabia and other countries

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.443
have got together
to form OPEC and try

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:15.810
to influence that price,
they don't have much impact.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.940
And it's got so bad
now that Saudi Arabia,

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.770
like many other
countries, can no longer

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.620
balance its books based on
the oil revenue it's getting.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.716
It's trying to diversify.

00:30:25.716 --> 00:30:27.090
Many countries
find that actually

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:30.592
having natural resources
like that can be what's

00:30:30.592 --> 00:30:31.800
called the paradox of plenty.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.360
You think you've
got this rich seam,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.810
but it can open up your economy
to all sorts of vulnerability.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.991
There is the
fluctuation in price.

00:30:39.991 --> 00:30:41.740
There's this thing
called "Dutch disease."

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.649
When they found oil
in the North Sea,

00:30:44.649 --> 00:30:45.940
the Netherlands thought, great.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.350
This is it.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.266
Our fortunes are made.

00:30:47.266 --> 00:30:49.500
In actual fact, because the
demand for their currency

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.140
was so great, the
exchange rate shot up.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.640
Other industries couldn't cope
with that, and what we saw

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.480
was unemployment
rising at a time

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.920
when it was selling a lot
of oil and the economy

00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.970
being in trouble.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.790
Also, if you're in
Nigeria or indeed, Iraq,

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.710
you'd know full well
that where there's oil,

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.200
there tends to be conflict.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.270
For IS, of course,
grabbing oil fields in Iraq

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.450
was a major source of
income for many years.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:16.035
And that means that the Iraqi
government-- although it's

00:31:16.035 --> 00:31:17.880
got many things, it
probably feels it could

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.046
be doing without oil income.

00:31:19.046 --> 00:31:21.540
It's very reliant
on oil income--

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:25.720
instead has to use part of it to
actually defend its oil fields.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.067
So what do you do with that?

00:31:28.067 --> 00:31:30.150
Well, we're going to go
over a well-worn path now,

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.930
because we're heading
off to Russia.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.890
A lot of arms that
you'll find-- and this

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.570
is true when IS ripped
open bombs dating back

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.810
to the times of Saddam Hussein
and stole weapons in Iraq.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.900
Many of them had basically made
in Russia or the equivalent

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.260
printed on the side.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.520
And there's a reason
for this as well--

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.310
the Cold War.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.800
And Russia, of
course, was obsessed

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.040
with churning out weaponry
to show that it could compete

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.917
with America-- so
much so that it

00:32:00.917 --> 00:32:03.000
neglected almost all other
forms of manufacturing.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.124
It was all about creating
the means of destruction.

00:32:05.124 --> 00:32:08.100
It was all very much along
Soviet planning lines.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.950
You had quotas for how much you
produced, how it was produced.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.230
Fathers followed.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.030
Their sons followed on.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.940
The factory dictated your every
way of life-- your housing,

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.110
what was in your houses.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.500
Those times are now
gone, but Russia then

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.870
found that this was still
its area of expertise.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.430
It's still very much
at the forefront.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.740
It's second only to America.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.577
And the way they sell as well--

00:32:30.577 --> 00:32:32.160
they sell to their
friends, so America

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.240
supplies the rest of NATO-- for
example, Saudi Arabia, Russia,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.506
a lot of the developing world.

00:32:37.506 --> 00:32:38.880
But again, Russia's
going to have

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.230
to think about how that
changes over the coming years,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.760
because China is saying, we
can make this stuff cheaper.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.390
And also, Russian soldiers
find themselves quite often

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.879
staring down the
barrel of guns that

00:32:53.879 --> 00:32:55.170
were designed in their country.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.820
Weapons fall into
the wrong hands.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.220
Now, that's before you
consider all the ethics

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.761
of the dark side of creating the
means of destruction as well.

00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:07.260
There's two things that Russia
is dependent on for the money

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.516
it gets-- its
weapons and also oil.

00:33:10.516 --> 00:33:12.390
Its economy overall has
been pretty unstable,

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.780
and that goes all the way back
to the times of the Cold War

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:16.894
and before.

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:18.435
So while Russia was
churning out arms

00:33:18.435 --> 00:33:21.397
to protect its
border, in its cities,

00:33:21.397 --> 00:33:22.980
America's currency
during the Cold War

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.590
was actually having a heyday.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.200
Everyone from hotels to
prostitutes in Moscow

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.531
were accepting dollars.

00:33:29.531 --> 00:33:30.030
Why?

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:33.450
Because you could use those to
spend in hard currency stores

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.520
which had stocks where
there were times when

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.060
shelves were empty elsewhere.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.680
And we may think of Russia
pulling the strings today

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.860
in terms of fixing
elections or fake news

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.780
or however you
want to look at it,

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.940
but America still holds
an economic power.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.550
And that's still
true for this day.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.050
Why?

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.160
Because it was all about trust.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.560
People don't trust the ruble,
and money is about trust.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.268
You've got to trust
its value-- that it's

00:34:00.268 --> 00:34:01.920
going to keep that
value, it's going

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.470
to be an acceptable
means of exchange,

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:07.230
and it's something you
can use to repay debt.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.980
The dollar fit the
bill a lot better

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.739
than the ruble
throughout the Cold War

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:11.823
and indeed since as well.

00:34:11.823 --> 00:34:14.489
A lot of the oligarchs-- if they
want to keep their money safe--

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.219
hold onto it in dollars.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:20.010
But the dollar comes with
some strange powers attached.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.449
The cartoon there--
that was in a newspaper

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:28.427
just after the raids on
FIFA's headquarters in Geneva

00:34:28.427 --> 00:34:30.260
which was all orchestrated
by the Americans.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.639
Why did the Americans care?

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.650
They don't even
care about football.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.260
They call it soccer.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.980
They did care, because the whole
bribery scandal had touched

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.320
the American financial system.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.580
It had touched the dollar.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.659
And anything that does
that means that America

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:48.070
has jurisdiction to go
out there and take action,

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.263
and that's exactly
what they did.

00:34:50.263 --> 00:34:51.679
Another way that
America has tried

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.184
to wield economic power--
along with Europe, of course--

00:34:54.184 --> 00:34:58.260
is sanctions after
Russia's actions in Ukraine

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.470
a few years ago.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.510
And that has driven the Russian
economy further to its knees

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.120
into recession and, of
course, also created

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.607
a bit of a crisis in
confidence in the ruble.

00:35:07.607 --> 00:35:09.440
And that, too, has been
good for the dollar.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.220
A lot of people who aren't
actually affected by sanctions

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.350
try and keep their
money in dollars,

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.350
and that's quite
often elsewhere.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.100
And if you're one of
these individuals who

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.740
has been affected by sanctions,
where might you put your money?

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.240
How about Germany?

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:25.960
Why Germany?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.460
Because partly of the
friendship between these two.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.720
And they didn't always
look so friendly.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.190
Apparently at their
first meeting,

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.860
Putin brought along
his black Labrador.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.660
Sounds like a
friendly thing to do,

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.880
but Angela Merkel
has a lifelong fear

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.010
of dogs after being bitten.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.106
So some saw that as her
being terrorized by him.

00:35:47.106 --> 00:35:48.480
But since then,
they seem to have

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.320
grown a warmer and
cozier relationship,

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.930
and that's a good
reason for that.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:55.920
40% of gas supplied to
Germany comes from Russia.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.020
So effectively, Russia
is keeping the lights

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.832
on in Germany over the winter.

00:36:00.832 --> 00:36:02.790
So Germany therefore has
been a little bit more

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.220
reticent about applying
sanctions on Russia.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.310
They've also been a little
more welcoming to money

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:12.480
coming in from Russia, and
Germany has a long history

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.660
of thriving on investment.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.600
The Marshall Plan was the
money that was-- again,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.300
it was the US
Treasury Secretary who

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:29.070
donated some dollars equivalent
of $140 billion in 2017 money

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.935
after the Second World
War to rebuilding Germany.

00:36:31.935 --> 00:36:33.670
It sounds very altruistic.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:37.770
But it also came about because
America was concerned otherwise

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.530
Germany would fall into
the hands of communists,

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.290
and therefore they'd be
facing another opponent.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.600
It also meant a ready
market for their goods.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.340
That was the idea--
instead of which

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.160
Germany grew into a massive
industrial superpower

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.570
and also created the
financial system that you need

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.820
to enable that kind of growth.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.600
Russia has a lot of money
in Germany today as well.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.640
That there is a
refinery invested

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.325
in by the Russian
energy supplies.

00:37:05.325 --> 00:37:07.590
In actual fact, Russian
energy suppliers

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.020
account for about half
of Russian money going

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.960
into Germany today.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.940
But it also means that it's an
attractive place, for example,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.690
for an arms dealer who's got
a dollar that you want to use

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.191
for your retirement plan.

00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:20.940
What could you do?

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:24.800
You could buy property
in Berlin,m for example.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.592
And that's the kind of example
I looked at in the book.

00:37:29.592 --> 00:37:31.050
All that money
plowing into Germany

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.850
means it's, of course, the
biggest economy in Europe now.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.880
It's been the architect
of the single market

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.251
and also the kingpin
behind the euro.

00:37:39.251 --> 00:37:41.500
Let's take a couple of minutes
to talk about the euro,

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.780
because the euro is
an interesting one.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.280
American bankers
were really scared

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.920
about the creation of the euro.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.860
They thought it would take over
from the dollar as the world's

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.830
leading currency-- the
most eminent currency.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.420
Hasn't quite happened.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.060
The euro's still there in
Central Bank's reserves.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.340
It's still seen as a
source of stability.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.600
But some say it with
a sense of suspicion,

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.030
partly because of the
way the euro came about.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.250
And that was because there
was various entry criteria.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.950
All the countries joining it
had to be basically driving

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.660
at the same speed in
the same direction.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.030
They fudged some of the rules
for that one for Germany

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:24.030
as much as for Greece,
so what you ended up with

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.180
was economies who very
quickly became quite clear

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.980
that one interest
rate wasn't going

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.325
to suit all their interests.

00:38:31.325 --> 00:38:33.200
That's quite different,
of course, to America

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.630
where you've got one currency,
one interest rate, and one

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.320
political system as well.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.430
And those cracks
became even clearer

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.410
during the time of
the financial crisis

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.960
when it became quite clear
that Greece, for example,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.040
was in all sorts of problems.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.730
And Germany wasn't that
keen on bailing out Greece.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.464
They were very
different economies.

00:38:52.464 --> 00:38:53.880
And because of
that, the questions

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:59.250
still being asked about
the future of the euro.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.190
And that is throwing its whole
credibility into question,

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:03.220
and it carries on.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.830
The UK, of course, decided
after several tests

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.761
not to join the euro.

00:39:08.761 --> 00:39:09.760
It looked at everything.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.330
It even looked at how
much Mars Bars costed

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:16.537
in each European country to
try and compare how convergent

00:39:16.537 --> 00:39:17.620
they were with each other.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.680
But it decided not to.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.150
And at the time, many thought
that was a huge mistake

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.300
and that what we'd find instead
was that Germany would be

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.650
the [INAUDIBLE] on the outside.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:30.030
In fact, it became the world's
largest financial center.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.610
Is that going to continue?

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.940
Well, who knows.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.020
Of course, the dollar
lies beneath a lot

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.400
of the financial crisis.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.880
But the UK being the financial
center of what we saw

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.390
was the crisis
starting in America--

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.664
homeowners who
couldn't repay loans,

00:39:47.664 --> 00:39:49.830
banks who had repackaged
those loans into investment

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.740
products they didn't really
understand-- those collapsed.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.890
Financial system over
here feels the wobbles.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.780
You get queues outside the
banks like Northern Rock.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.280
And then we get
quantitative easing.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.010
We get all that money
pumped in effectively

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.550
meant to create loans to be
doled out by institutions.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.717
Did that work?

00:40:06.717 --> 00:40:08.550
Well, the global economy
is back on its feet

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.480
again, so it seems
to have worked.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.449
On the other hand, when
you look at the evidence,

00:40:14.449 --> 00:40:15.990
only a small part
of that money seems

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.924
to have been filtering
through into consumption.

00:40:18.924 --> 00:40:21.090
Most of it seems to have
just bumped up asset prices

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:22.240
once again.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.710
Debt levels are now a point now
when people are worrying again

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.416
about the possibility of
another financial crisis.

00:40:29.416 --> 00:40:30.790
But one thing that
worries people

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.800
is whether or not we can
remain the financial capital.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.258
We've still got
the dollars flowing

00:40:34.258 --> 00:40:37.420
in-- partly a consequence
of location, language,

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.430
and, as we all know,
London's the best place

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.270
in the world to live.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.270
But the way the
conversations are going now

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.600
between the government
and the European Council--

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.360
that might be something
that's under jeopardy.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.580
And of course, so
many businesses

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.250
now are looking elsewhere
for trade deals.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.910
So I talk about the dollar
going back home, because you've

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.830
got a business person
there picking up

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.706
a dollar at the foreign exchange
bureau to go back to Houston

00:41:04.706 --> 00:41:08.500
and over in Houston pays it over
to the concierge of his hotel

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.200
who happens to be the woman
we see at the beginning buying

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.610
her radio.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.950
And that throws up questions
about whether America

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.780
can be made great again.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.300
And it also touches
on this disease--

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.920
this very real disease--

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.825
which is the
productivity puzzle.

00:41:22.825 --> 00:41:24.700
It's affecting the whole
of the Western world

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.690
at the moment which
is that, per hour,

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.850
we've not really seen
output increasing

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.440
at any great speed since
the financial crisis.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.060
Why is that?

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.291
We've had a lack of
investment, nerves, of course.

00:41:38.291 --> 00:41:39.790
There's also
technology and the fact

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:43.370
that we may not be measuring
these things properly.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.660
Whatever is going on there,
until we sort out that puzzle,

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.600
we're not going to be able
to compete with the emerging

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.250
globe.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.480
So looking at all these
journeys around the world,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.100
one thing becomes clear.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.870
It's the dollar that's keeping
globalization in business.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:00.400
And it's not the
big dollars, it's

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.350
the small dollars which add
up to a very big sum indeed.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:04.900
It's all those
individual decisions

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.570
people are taking
around the globe--

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.530
what kind of goods to buy,
where to buy their oil from,

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.890
where to invest their money.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.290
And that's how those
economic ties are turning.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:19.970
And as those tides turn, it's
creating a global shift as well

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.934
in power bases.

00:42:21.934 --> 00:42:23.350
What's keeping the
wheels turning?

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:26.410
It's not so much real
money, it's imaginary money.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.080
It's all that debt
we've created.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.070
And we've learned
a lot of lessons

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:33.240
since the financial crisis,
through central banks

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.049
don't want to know about it.

00:42:35.049 --> 00:42:36.340
Many of us don't know about it.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.950
It keeps our finances
going, but it's debt.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:41.329
That's the big
elephant in the room.

00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:42.620
What does the future look like?

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.560
Well, we could see the RMB--

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.650
if the Chinese government
changed their attitude a bit--

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:48.659
coming up the stakes.

00:42:48.659 --> 00:42:50.950
We could see the euro perhaps
looking a little bit more

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:51.872
solid.

00:42:51.872 --> 00:42:53.580
Digital currencies
might mean the future,

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.140
although at the moment
I think it's a bubble.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.117
But at the moment,
it's the dollar

00:42:58.117 --> 00:42:59.200
that still reigns supreme.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.673
Thank you.

00:43:00.673 --> 00:43:03.619
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.180
SPEAKER: Well, we have about
10 minutes for questions.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.680
We'll go with the hard half one
finish if you have meetings.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.020
I will kick off with a question.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.212
What is your
opinion on big tech?

00:43:17.212 --> 00:43:18.920
So if you think that
Amazon, for example,

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.230
is taking a huge amount
of consumer dollars,

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.300
what's your opinion on
that and perhaps where

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.097
that might lead
us in the future?

00:43:25.097 --> 00:43:27.263
And if you have a question,
please put your hand up.

00:43:27.263 --> 00:43:29.570
DHARSHINI DAVID: As in
whether it's a force for good?

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:33.380
SPEAKER: Yes, and perhaps
comparable to nation states,

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.140
for example, if you think
how much Amazon has compared

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.404
with smaller GDP countries.

00:43:38.404 --> 00:43:39.320
DHARSHINI DAVID: Sure.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.861
It's a bit like the
dollar, isn't it?

00:43:40.861 --> 00:43:43.370
It has traversed nation states.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.480
Is it a force for good?

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.460
Basically what it does
is epitomizes the way

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.510
our global economy
is changing, and it

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.330
epitomizes all these
forces of globalization.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:57.620
We're all using consumer power
to get the American dream

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.520
on the cheap, and
we all want that.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.690
What are you sacrificing?

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.660
You're sacrificing
perhaps the things

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.960
that we've come to hold
dear-- things like employment

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.290
practices and things like that.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:11.900
So I think if you're looking
at Amazon in particular,

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:12.942
there's pros and cons.

00:44:12.942 --> 00:44:15.150
It's a bit like making
America great again, isn't it?

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:16.816
You can buy cheap,
but there is a price.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.420
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask a question

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.715
about the choice of telling
a story about the dollar,

00:44:27.715 --> 00:44:29.340
because I imagine as
an economist you'd

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.740
have used lots of
mathematical models

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.777
to describe these phenomena.

00:44:34.777 --> 00:44:37.360
And I was just interested that
you've gone with this narrative

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.920
approach and whether you've
tried communicating with models

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.319
and failed.

00:44:41.319 --> 00:44:43.360
DHARSHINI DAVID: So if
I've tried communicating--

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.984
AUDIENCE: Those kinds of models
through journalism or whatever,

00:44:45.984 --> 00:44:47.595
and maybe it doesn't work?

00:44:47.595 --> 00:44:48.470
DHARSHINI DAVID: Yes.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:49.136
It doesn't work.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:57.150
People distrust models,
because they don't understand.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.870
We've heard recently
the news, of course,

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.411
this thing about
economic forecasters

00:45:00.411 --> 00:45:02.140
have no idea what
they're talking about.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.020
I used to be an economic
forecaster, and yeah.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:09.040
There are models, and
they're very good models.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.990
The treasury, for
example, in the UK

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:12.570
employs hundreds of people.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.695
They're programming and
coming up with these things

00:45:14.695 --> 00:45:16.820
and testing them and
constant;y changing them,

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.434
as does the Bank of England.

00:45:18.434 --> 00:45:21.100
But I also know-- having been an
economist and worked with these

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:21.880
models--

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.360
that what you get out
depends on what you put in.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.370
So you can make
various assumptions,

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.830
and that will impact
on what you get out.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:33.730
So I'm a little bit cautious
sometimes about extolling

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.510
the virtues of models too much.

00:45:37.371 --> 00:45:39.120
AUDIENCE: You painted
a very lucid picture

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.030
about how complicated
the global system is.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.076
But obviously, 2008, 2007
showed that economists

00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:46.200
don't have all the answers.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.630
Do you still trust economists--
macroeconomists specifically--

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.657
and a little bit
more information

00:45:51.657 --> 00:45:52.490
around those models?

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:53.690
And are we perhaps
measuring the right thing?

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:54.600
I can't remember off
the top of my head--

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.970
there was a conversation
recently about GDP

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.880
not measuring a certain aspect
of the productive economy

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.740
and incorporating
new things into it.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.323
I guess just your
thoughts around that

00:46:03.323 --> 00:46:04.560
would be interesting.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.250
DHARSHINI DAVID: Do
I trust economists?

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.440
Good question.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.270
I think it's a bit like being
an astrologer or a weather

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.330
forecaster, isn't it
to a certain point?

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.371
You get a lot of bad press
when you get it wrong,

00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:19.515
and it's easy to get it wrong.

00:46:19.515 --> 00:46:21.980
And there's all those jokes
about economists in a room,

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:25.230
and you get more views
than there are economists.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.319
I think in terms of
analyzing the facts--

00:46:27.319 --> 00:46:28.860
And I think an
economist's job should

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:33.020
be to pull apart the facts,
see the underlying picture.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.100
What we found in recent
years in particular

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.100
is that politics
personalities tend

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.920
to obscure those facts
and the underlying trends.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.420
I think economists
could do a better

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.130
job in bringing those to light.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:45.840
When it comes to
protecting things,

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.810
I think we got a little bit
too complacent about looking

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:49.960
at the past.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.930
And a lot of economists
who were working

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.510
around the time the financial
crisis quite honestly

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.516
had never seen a
proper recession.

00:46:57.516 --> 00:46:58.890
You'd have to go
back to the '70s

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:00.547
to see a really
sharp economic shock.

00:47:00.547 --> 00:47:02.880
They just weren't used to it,
and the models had kind of

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.460
got a bit complacent too.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.250
And you mentioned the GDP.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:09.690
This is a really
interesting point

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:12.290
about whether we measure
the world's well being

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.880
in forms of the amount of
income we can generate,

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.155
and there's much
more to the picture.

00:47:17.155 --> 00:47:18.780
That measurement of
income doesn't take

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.770
account of a lot of things.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.228
It doesn't take
account of the fact

00:47:21.228 --> 00:47:23.670
that you might go home
after a 12-hour day,

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.350
and you've still got a whole
lot of DIY to do or housework

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:26.850
or whatever.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.380
None of that counts.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.790
There's a famous example of
if you marry your cleaner,

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:35.040
you're reducing GDP.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.530
Because before that,
the cleaner's output

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:40.030
classed as part of GDP.

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:44.570
Marry the cleaner and it's just
counted as domestic work, which

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:45.840
doesn't show up.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.964
Also, GDP doesn't measure things
like environmental impact.

00:47:49.964 --> 00:47:52.380
Technological change-- which
is one of the things that was

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.790
written about recently--

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.460
is the fact that when
you look at GDP measures,

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.380
they haven't taken
account the way

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.614
that technology's
moved in recent years.

00:48:00.614 --> 00:48:02.030
And therefore, in
many ways, we're

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:05.180
underestimating the health
of the global economy.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.180
So there's a lot more
work to be done on that.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.970
And I think it's
something that now

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:12.990
we've got past the seismic
shocks of the financial crisis,

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.722
central banks are finally
waking up and paying attention.

00:48:19.539 --> 00:48:20.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.690
When you give out a loan, you
have some kind of expectation

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.310
that you get the money back.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:29.830
But given that countries
have such a big debt--

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:30.970
in particular, the US--

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.570
why does it not all collapse?

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:36.314
Is it feasible that you
can get the money back?

00:48:36.314 --> 00:48:37.855
DHARSHINI DAVID: I
don't know if it's

00:48:37.855 --> 00:48:40.179
feasible you can
get the money back.

00:48:40.179 --> 00:48:42.220
America's counting the
fact that everyone wants--

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.830
America in particular
is counting on the fact

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.480
that everyone wants dollars
to trade and to keep

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.730
in bank reserves, and that's
why it can sell those bonds.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.950
That's why it can
fund its deficits

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:57.490
and ultimately its debts.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:02.170
It means that America is seen
as being good for the money.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:06.040
If China and Japan got together
and said, what do you think.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.710
Should we ask for
our money back?

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:09.830
That could undermine
the economy.

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.610
It's one reason why the
yen has never taken off

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:16.480
in a big way as a
major reserve currency,

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.910
because investors
around the globe

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:23.050
have been so concerned about
the state of the amount of debt

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:27.220
Japan has that they don't see
as being a stable and therefore

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.820
ultimately attractive economy.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.450
But because the dollar has a
special status because it's

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.150
required for other
things, America

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:34.316
doesn't suffer that problem.

00:49:38.618 --> 00:49:41.300
SPEAKER: I'll go with one
more, and then we'll round off.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.360
What do you think--

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:46.691
so outside of Brexit, what's
perhaps the next big thing

00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:49.190
coming down the line that we
should be aware of that perhaps

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:50.260
people aren't?

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.010
Is it aging population?

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.160
Is it unforeseen tech--

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.220
AI [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:00.124
What's front of your mind that
we should be thinking about?

00:50:00.124 --> 00:50:01.040
DHARSHINI DAVID: Yeah.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.780
I had something up there
about aging population

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.238
which I didn't talk
about because I

00:50:04.238 --> 00:50:06.020
was conscious of time.

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.450
As we're talking right
here, Philip Hammond

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:10.900
is on his feet talking about
the state of public finances

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.587
here in the UK.

00:50:12.587 --> 00:50:14.420
He's talking about the
next couple of years.

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.720
But to me, the big problem
that's looming for all of us

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.540
is the fact that
populations are aging.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.870
And that puts a whole
different kind of emphasis

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.780
on the finances we have-- public
finances and private finances

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.960
and the way we live,
the way we work,

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.130
and the way we fund everything.

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:34.159
I don't think any
government has really

00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:35.200
thought that one through.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.850
And every time they try to,
they stick a toe in the water.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.010
Things like dementia
tax, of course--

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.150
hugely controversial.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.344
But there is a valid
issue hiding under all

00:50:45.344 --> 00:50:47.510
that-- that somehow we're
going to think of the fact

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:50.630
that the average person
who's over 64 costs

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.230
four times as much
in health care

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.256
as someone under the age of 16.

00:50:54.256 --> 00:50:56.130
And someone's going to
have to pay that bill.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:57.255
We're going to live longer.

00:50:57.255 --> 00:50:59.635
We're going to live better
and longer hopefully,

00:50:59.635 --> 00:51:00.805
but how do we pay for that?

00:51:00.805 --> 00:51:02.180
And I think that's
something that

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.770
has to be the subject
of much debate.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:06.228
And hopefully them at Davos
might get their heads around it

00:51:06.228 --> 00:51:06.894
as well.

00:51:06.894 --> 00:51:08.310
SPEAKER: With that,
please join me

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.185
in a massive round of
applause for Dharshini.

00:51:10.185 --> 00:51:12.510
[APPLAUSE]
