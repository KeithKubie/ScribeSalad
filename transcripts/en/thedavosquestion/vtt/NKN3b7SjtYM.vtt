[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.900
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: I'm losing track of
the days, and yet another

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.850
incredible day for female genital mutilation.
It's not often you hear that phrase.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.970
Melinda Gates, I managed to corner her as
she was leaving the building,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.740
had a very quick chat.
And she's also promised to follow up through

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.740
the Gates Foundation.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.780
&gt;&gt; Why don't you give us your card and see
if maybe Gabriel can make

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.100
sure we follow up?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.070
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: And our very own David
Cameron from the UK, the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.190
leader of the Conservative Party.
I was pleased to hear that he knew about it.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.160
&gt;&gt; It's something that actually is effecting,
you know, families and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.990
people in the UK as well as in parts of Africa
and elsewhere.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.710
So it is a subject we take extremely seriously.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:06.650
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: And a really important
meeting for me today was

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.470
very briefly to be introduced to the President
of Senegal.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.470
[PAUSE]

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Had a really great meeting
this morning with

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.800
Kathy Calvin from the UN Foundation.
This is a very specific foundation that looks

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.350
at women and child
health.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:35.950
&gt;&gt;It's time we really made this a high priority.
And help all those 140 million women who have

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.659
already been victims, and
change the culture for the girls in the future.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.350
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: We had a great meeting
with the Minister of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.210
Finance from Rwanda.
And it was very heartening to hear his words

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.890
about women's empowerment
and the role of women in his society.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.470
[PAUSE]

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.390
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: We also spoke with William
Haag.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.040
&gt;&gt; I think this is the way to do it, by the
way, what you're doing.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.840
Because you now can, through multi-media,
raise all kinds of issues that parliaments

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.560
haven't discussed adequately.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.530
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: The President of the
International Labor

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.530
Organization.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.190
&gt;&gt; Now, let me first congratulate you.
It's not easy to get here and to be understood

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.190
in terms of what you're
trying to do.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.130
I think that if any cause is legitimate it
is yours.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.560
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: You may remember I said
this issue has to move

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.860
out of the margins.
And what I feel today is that all these different

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.440
pieces are coming
together in a way that's really going to allow

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.422
me to follow up and
hopefully make sustainable change.

00:02:50.422 --> 00:02:50.430
