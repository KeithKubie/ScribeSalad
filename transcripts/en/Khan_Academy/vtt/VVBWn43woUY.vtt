00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.013 --> 00:00:03.250
we're going to dig a little
bit deeper into the notion

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.950
of perfectly competitive markets.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.000
So we're gonna think about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.170
under what scenarios a firm
would make an economic profit

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.830
or an economic loss in them.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.910
Now as a reminder, these
perfectly competitive markets

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.640
are something of a theoretical ideal.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.600
There's few markets in the real world

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.520
that are truly perfectly competitive.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.960
Some might get close,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.920
but most markets are
someplace in a spectrum

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.500
between perfectly competitive
and, at the other extreme,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.250
say, something like a monopoly.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.490
But here we're talking
about perfect competition.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.970
And perfect competition,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.550
the firm's products aren't differentiated.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.500
There's no barriers to entry or exit.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.900
And so in that situation,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.000
the market supply and demand curves

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.300
are going to define the
price in the market,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.800
which are also going to define

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.210
the marginal revenue for these firms.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.380
They're all going to be price-takers.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.890
They're going to be
passive in terms of price.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.760
Whatever the market price
is, that's the price

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.210
that they are going to
sell their products for.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.090
And their decision is
really what quantity does,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.750
to produce and sell and whether
to enter or exit the market.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.970
So let's look at that a little bit.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.360
So these are just your classic
and supply, demand curve,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.700
supply and demand curves
you might see for a market.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.130
The first few units in the market,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.080
there's a huge marginal benefit,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.800
so people are willing to pay a lot.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.420
But then each incremental unit,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.670
the marginal benefit's a
little bit lower and lower

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.080
and lower and lower, and
that's why we have those,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.040
that downward-sloping demand curve.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700
And then on the supply
curve, the first unit

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.860
in the market might be fairly
inexpensive to produce,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.260
but then the marginal cost gets higher

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.093
and higher and higher.

00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:36.360
And where they meet,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.990
where the supply and demand meet,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.000
that tells us the equilibrium price

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and equilibrium quantity in the market.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.810
And we can show that with that line,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.360
and let's just say that
equilibrium price is $10.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.660
And as I just mentioned,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.230
that's going to have to be the
price that all of the firms,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.330
and these might not be all
of the firms in the market,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.650
but all of the firms in the market,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.880
if we're talking about a
perfectly competitive market,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.610
would just have to take that price.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.027
So given that,

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:06.800
what quantity would firms
A, B, and C produce?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.330
And which of these firms
would be profitable or not&gt;

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.740
I encourage you to pause the video

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.310
and think about those two questions.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.450
If you could just answer,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.680
which of these firms would
be profitable or not?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.563
And we're talking about
economic profit in this context.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.730
All right, well let's
look at firm A first.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.350
Well, firm A, for any of them,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.040
it is not rational to produce a quantity

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.870
where the marginal cost is higher

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.110
than the marginal revenue
that the firm's getting.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.810
And remember, this line right over here,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.880
this line right here, which is
the price line, that's also,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.500
that is price, which is
equal to marginal revenue.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.910
And so for that extra unit,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.000
if you can't sell it for
more than you're producing,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.050
then you wouldn't produce that extra unit.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.950
So it's rational for them to
produce more and more and more.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.640
The marginal cost goes higher and higher

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.830
until right at the
point that marginal cost

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.550
is equal to marginal revenue,
which is equal to price,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.100
the market price, which
they're just going to take.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.260
So it's rational for this firm

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.240
to produce this quantity right over here.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.680
So I'll just go quantity,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.110
I'll say quantity for that firm.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.580
Now is this firm going
to be profitable or not?

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.510
Well, at this quantity,
what's its average total cost?

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.540
Well, its average total
cost is right over there.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.520
And so for every unit,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.100
it's going to make this difference

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.500
between the price or the
marginal revenue it's getting

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.460
and its average total cost.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.340
And so one way to think about
the profit of this firm is,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.400
and we're talking about economic profit,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.400
it's going to be the area of
this rectangle right over here.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.890
So let's say if the average
total cost at that quantity is,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.463
let's say that this is $8,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.200
then this height of the
rectangle is 10 minus eight.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.410
The height right over here,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.520
let me do this in a different color,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.810
this height right over here is $2.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.940
And then the width is going to
be the quantity of that firm.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.060
And so let's say the
quantity of that firm,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.470
let's say it's 10,000 units a year,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.860
10,000,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.800
10,000 units per year.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.190
And so the area right over
here would be $2 times 10,000.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.027
It would be $20,000,

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:27.200
$20,000 per time unit,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.410
per time unit if we're talking

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.370
all of this as, say, per year.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.670
Now let's go to firm B.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.990
Using that same analysis,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.940
is firm B making an economic profit

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.890
or is it not making an economic profit?

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.400
Well, firm B is once again
going to be a price-taker.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.130
And so the price right over here,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.660
the equilibrium price in the market,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.670
is going to be equal to the price

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.650
that that firm has to take,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.950
which is going to be its
marginal revenue curve.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.040
And that's why it's a flat
marginal revenue curve.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.660
Because no matter what
quantity they produce,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.640
they're gonna get that same price.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.540
And it wouldn't be rational
for them to produce a quantity

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.480
where marginal cost is
higher than marginal revenue,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.140
and so they would
produce right over there.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.883
Now what is their economic
profit at this quantity?

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.950
So this is quantity of
the second firm, firm B.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.883
I'll write it like that.

00:05:18.883 --> 00:05:20.250
Maybe that is firm A.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.550
And maybe this is also, eh,
it looks about the same.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.930
I'll make 'em a little bit different.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.653
Let's say that's 9,500
units per time period.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.560
Well, here the average total cost

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.970
at that quantity is equal
to the marginal cost,

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.060
so which is equal to the marginal revenue.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.760
So at that quantity,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.380
whatever, that $10
they're getting per unit,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.460
they're also spending
on average $10 per unit.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.293
Another way to think about it,

00:05:46.293 --> 00:05:48.430
the area of that rectangle
is going to be zero

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.340
because it has no height.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.770
So this, this situation right over here,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.910
the firm has zero,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.510
zero economic,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.423
I'll write $0 of economic profit.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.530
And then last but not least,
let's think about firm C.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.870
Pause this video, and think about

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.023
what its economic profit would be.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.650
Well, like we've seen,

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.340
it would be rational for
it to produce the quantity

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.410
where marginal cost is
equal to marginal revenue,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.270
which is equal to the market price.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.840
So it would produce this
quantity right over here.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.840
And let's say that that
quantity is 9,000 units.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.250
And what's its average total cost then?

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.530
So at 9,000 units, its average total cost,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.490
let's say that that is
$12 right over there.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.810
So what's its economic profit?

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.960
So for every unit it's selling,

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.717
it's getting $10 and it's costing

00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:45.950
$12 on average to produce it.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.590
So it's taking an economic
loss of $2 per unit.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.023
So $2 per unit, so this
height right over here is $2,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.580
times the units, times 9,000,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.100
you're going to have two times 9,000,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.590
you're going to have an $18,000

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.110
not economic profit but economic,

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.530
economic loss.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.610
Now one thing to think about is

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.880
why would any firm be in this situation?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.290
Well, it's important to think about things

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.120
in the short run versus the long run.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.980
In the short run,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.350
we've talked about this
analysis right over here,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.750
where a firm can decide what
quantity it would produce

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.200
that is rational.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.580
Its fixed costs are
fixed in the short run.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.940
We've studied that in multiple videos.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.490
But in the long run, its
fixed costs aren't fixed,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.940
and so the firm could decide
to enter or exit the market.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.050
And so for firm C,

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.810
while they've already
put in those fixed costs,

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.260
it is actually rational for them to do it

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.230
because they're actually
able to make their,

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.850
the marginal revenue they
get up to that quantity,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.800
it's at least,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.550
they're able to more than
cover their marginal costs.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.520
And then they're able to eat
up or I guess you could say

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.840
take care of some of their fixed costs,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.900
But they're still not able
to run an economic profit.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.270
So in the long run,

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.940
it wouldn't be rational for
this firm to stay in the market.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.423
They would likely exit the market.
