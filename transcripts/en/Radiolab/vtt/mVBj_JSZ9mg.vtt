00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.200
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab today,

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.390
a whole hour on the Galapagos Islands.

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:10.350
The place that inspired Charles Darwin to create his theory of evolution,

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.550
whose basic ingredients are lots of time isolation and then constant change.

5
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:19.830
But Darwin didn't consider this possibility.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.320
What if on these islands Feldman's of tourists arrive every day carrying fruits

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.710
and chocolates and souvenirs, jumping from island to island.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.280
Now the Galapagos government spends millions of dollars checking all of the

9
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.790
goods that come in and out trying to quarantine the ones that might have things

10
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:36.624
that are a problem.

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.230
But what if simply putting your foot on the ground can completely transform it?

12
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.493
<v 1>The place</v>

13
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.530
I love going back to producer Tim Howard.

14
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.770
So I met this woman named Hika Yeager who is, uh,

15
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.870
like a plant scientist time there,

16
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:56.930
restoration ecologist at the Charles Darwin Foundation.

17
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.520
And here we are in and mellows.

18
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.120
We were going to look at these incredible craters called Los Halos. Ooh,

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.780
I almost got hit by a car. And as we're walking along the path, let's see, she,

20
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.950
she's like, oh wait, look at this here.

21
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.130
She points just to the right of the path. Look at this species here.

22
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.060
Small leafy green thing. They call it [inaudible] 10 and Spanish.

23
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.580
It is in its plan.

24
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.950
Plantago I think in the u s they call it the um,

25
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.860
was it the wrench of the white man?

26
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.180
The range of the white man. It's actually the footprint of the white man.

27
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.990
It doesn't matter. Point is an introduced species. It's introduced,

28
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.160
it's found in Europe. North Africa shouldn't be here and you have this one here.

29
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.240
She points right next to it. It's called Titus Canthia CRB thing.

30
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.390
Green and white leaves has a terrible common name and English.

31
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:51.440
I'm not going to sand wandering Jew basic house plant.

32
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:55.910
You can buy it at home depot. But uh, there it is in the Galapagos and um,

33
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.870
along this path,

34
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.040
just looking to the right and the left and then she's just starts counting the

35
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:04.850
number of invasive species at one, two, three, four. As you can see here,

36
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.200
it's only right next to the trail, but not so much for them.

37
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.890
You will see that they're only there for this border of about five to 10 inches

38
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.350
along the edge of that path. Why? Why would that be?

39
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.770
Because Heikki said what happens is that Taurus,

40
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.390
they'll be back in their home country,

41
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:24.620
there'll be walking around in a garden or a park and it'll be filled with tiny

42
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:25.250
seeds.

43
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.690
The seeds stick to shoes and socks and trousers.

44
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.810
They wear the trousers on the plane and then they wear them when they come here

45
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.450
and then people walk and then just distribute.

46
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.670
I would just post the seats along the trail.

47
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.200
And now most of these plants are actually probably harmless and you know,

48
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:45.680
like you said, Galapagos National Park, they spend tons of money,

49
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:48.260
tons of time trying to keep invasives out.

50
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.270
But the fact is there's only so much you can do and every once in a while one of

51
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:57.560
these hitchhikers slips under the radar and just wreaks havoc.

52
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.730
You just grabbed it just like that. You just put your hands around. Yeah.

53
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.570
That's the only possible the first day.

54
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.420
So while we were in the highlands of Santa Cruz,

55
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.810
Hunky took me through the woods to meet this guy named Arno.

56
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.800
My name is [inaudible]. Adam is an ornithologist from the University of Vienna.

57
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.270
And shortly after we walked up,

58
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.620
he reached out into this tree and he grabbed this tiny little baby fins right

59
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:30.570
off the branch is the dorm. Well, he says, oh my God. He said,

60
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:35.490
he, he looks a little bit furry, almost really tiny vulnerable, uh,

61
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.900
fledgling of a warbler. Finch.

62
00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:40.260
The wall briefings is the smallest of the Darwin's finches you can like see him

63
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.030
pulsing kind of as he's breathing.

64
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.230
So Darwin's finches in short, Darwin,

65
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:50.220
when he visited Galapagos, he collected a lot of specimens of finches,

66
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.510
took them back to England, and eventually he realized that

67
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.600
<v 0>the beaks had all adapted.</v>

68
00:03:56.601 --> 00:04:00.170
They were all a little bit different depending on which island the finches lived

69
00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:03.470
on with the beaks. Beaks adapted to whatever the thing was they were eating.

70
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.450
One island finches had literally like the beak would be shaped sort of long.

71
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.230
And then the next island it would look almost the same, but much shorter.

72
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.180
And this became one of the,

73
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.420
one of the most important pieces of evidence that you know,

74
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:20.210
when animals would move from one place to another,

75
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:23.270
that they would begin to differentiate based on what cities are very,

76
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:24.780
very important. Yes.

77
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.840
<v 1>But speaking of beaks, that finch, that Arno was holding, just the Fred,</v>

78
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.370
his beak that you see,

79
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:37.020
the specially this side is extremely huge. Yeah.

80
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.200
Oh, the nostrils. Nostrils have have big holes. Yeah.

81
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.910
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

82
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.260
<v 1>oh, something had gotten inside this little finch,</v>

83
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.440
his nostrils drilled these holes and it was no eating the flesh on the inside of

84
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:52.950
the birds nostrils.

85
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.170
Scientists first began to see this in 1997 when they started to find nests full

86
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:00.330
of dead baby finches. At first,

87
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:02.490
nobody had any idea what kind of creature it was.

88
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:04.910
So they began to frantically study it.

89
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.003
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

90
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.010
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

91
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.550
<v 1>I actually visited one of the main researchers, PA doddling Congo.</v>

92
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.900
I keep the name of [inaudible].

93
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.090
She's lived in Galapagos for over a decade and she showed me her lab.

94
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.980
I'm surrounded by shelves and on the shelves

95
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.910
<v 4>there are these tiny little plastic cups that are filled with, um,</v>

96
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.310
flies. This is the villain

97
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.130
<v 3>better, but I said Solo qualcare people, they most,</v>

98
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:37.770
a little black fly looks like every other flies.

99
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.803
[inaudible] in fact,

100
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.560
[inaudible] says [inaudible] that it's actually in the same family as the

101
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:50.190
regular house fly, but it's actually a bot fly called

102
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.860
<v 1>Jordan is down. Z. Can you just spell Florence down? Z? Yeah, it's p.</v>

103
00:05:54.861 --> 00:05:58.900
H. I. L. I can't spell out loud. Fail Lore.

104
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.510
L. O. R. N. I. S. D. O. W. N. S. I. Okay. Huh.

105
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.310
[inaudible] actually means bad loving. That's Charlotte Coston.

106
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.580
She's a researcher at the Charles Darwin Foundation. She says,

107
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.100
there's actually very little known about the fly.

108
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.500
They're not sure where it came from or quite how it got here.

109
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:16.460
But here's what they do know.

110
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.210
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

111
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.680
<v 1>the adult fly seems to be harmless, yet a fly is actually vegetarian.</v>

112
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.810
It feeds on flowers and we think decomposing fruits,

113
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.850
baby flies. They're not vegetarian. That will, you know, suck blood.

114
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.860
And what happens is that, um, as soon as I start laying eggs,

115
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.000
mother flies swoop in and lay their eggs on the base of the nest,

116
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.270
sort of underneath the finch eggs. Once the eggs hatch,

117
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.590
the eggs hatch of the flies as well.

118
00:06:49.591 --> 00:06:53.700
And the larvae wriggling little larva will crawl out from the bottom of the nest

119
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.300
of the finches body into its beat and they go into the noses and,

120
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.380
um, of the baby finches and just started eating. You know,

121
00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:08.070
they're basically, um, feed on the blood of the, the baby birds.

122
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.510
How did these little fly babies? No, I mean, that's a,

123
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.410
that's an a very specific trip to take. Good question.

124
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.290
We're still trying to figure that out. Um, you know,

125
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:21.630
we assume that it was carbon dioxide,

126
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.800
carbon dioxide from the breathing of the bed. Oh yeah.

127
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.180
<v 4>Well, they didn't want [inaudible] of boxes.</v>

128
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:35.290
Some of the birds that little, um, being Saunas, the finches.

129
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.100
Oh God. It's the noise. Not the man.

130
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.890
<v 1>Pa Dad showed me this tiny little dead finch in the spot.</v>

131
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.620
<v 4>[inaudible] wow. There's a little hole into the brain of this little finch.</v>

132
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.280
Oh my God. We'll go in there in a nice spa.

133
00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:00.250
They ate the whole back of this little finch to how big a problem is this?

134
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.350
<v 1>Well, I talked to One scientist,</v>

135
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.030
Sonia Klein for I'm professor in animal behavior at Flinders university South

136
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:07.570
Australia.

137
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.960
And she told me that researchers recently did a survey of finch nests for

138
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:15.961
different species on two islands and all research groups found about 95%

139
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:18.370
mortality in the nest.

140
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.140
95% of the babies were dead. Yeah.

141
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.950
And our note told me that this year of small treif inches.

142
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:30.640
So far we had only two nests with fledglings and all that as well.

143
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.590
So it's a lot. Yeah. But even worse so far,

144
00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:38.200
we found file on us on 13 islands.

145
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.860
The flies spreading island to island. Is there any,

146
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:45.610
any timescale we should we worry about like are these finches disappearing very

147
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:48.550
fast? Very slowly. Depends on the species.

148
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.350
We have at least five species that are known to be facing extinction and another

149
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:57.930
six in serious decline. These five species,

150
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.020
does that mean that they may go extinct in the next five years and the next 50

151
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:09.210
years? I have not. Um, you know,

152
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:13.350
we have the case that the mango fence, we have 60 to 80 individuals left.

153
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.170
Wow. It's a race against time.

154
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.960
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

155
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.730
<v 3>so for starters,</v>

156
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.330
they put up all these tracks and [inaudible] they took me outside,

157
00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.400
they showed me where the traps are.

158
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.770
Trap hanging from a tree here and you see them actually all over Santa Cruz,

159
00:09:29.771 --> 00:09:34.430
these bright yellow traps hanging from trees, the school named [inaudible].

160
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.810
And this is to control the fly population? No, no.

161
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.430
They would need like millions of traps every few feet to do that.

162
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.810
This is just to grab a few flies, take them back

163
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.990
<v 1>to the lab and study them so they can learn how to fight them.</v>

164
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:50.390
Charlotte and PA Dodd's fantasy is that the flies use a pheromone to attract the

165
00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:53.270
opposite sex signing testicle.

166
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.960
It would be lovely if we could find something like that because if they could

167
00:09:56.961 --> 00:09:57.800
find that chemical,

168
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.530
that love chemical that the flies used to attract each other,

169
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.040
they could disrupt it, confused the flies and screw up their mating.

170
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.870
Another possibility is sterile insect technique,

171
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:13.610
sterilize male flies and introduce them back into the wild. So the female, um,

172
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.930
mates with a stair fly and obviously it doesn't produce fertile eggs.

173
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.630
If they can't make babies, the population will crash.

174
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.320
And in some cases you can successfully eradicate a species.

175
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.390
This is very much like the mosquitoes that Andy talked about a couple of

176
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.810
podcasts ago. Right? But here's the problem.

177
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.540
[inaudible] if they're gonna release their allies, male flies into the wild.

178
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.090
They have to be able to raise

179
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.300
<v 3>inclusively millions of these fights in the lab.</v>

180
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.270
And they're trying like crazy showing me all of the larvas that hatch today and

181
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.370
the dodge with me for baby flies that had just hatched and they're in these

182
00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:53.550
little cup tea.

183
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.810
But she told me that these four flies will

184
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:03.280
<v 1>probably die because they always die.</v>

185
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.150
Right now we have huge problems trying to rear fylantis and captivity,

186
00:11:07.151 --> 00:11:11.860
which is ironic given you know how abundant it is in the wild

187
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.850
[inaudible] when I was there,

188
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.510
he had told me that so far they had only successfully raised three,

189
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.670
three doll flies when you were saying they needed millions. Yeah.

190
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.050
And meanwhile, the finch populations are just getting decimated.

191
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.930
Charlotte says that they're trying to respond.

192
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.130
Ornithologists have started to notice some new behaviors, for instance,

193
00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:40.330
set up as picking the Lafayette or the nostrils of the baby beds.

194
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.180
And what we're starting to see is that they're beginning to consume them.

195
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.880
You mean eat the fly lower? Yeah.

196
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.390
Which 15 years ago they would never do back in the year 2000 Sonia and some

197
00:11:49.391 --> 00:11:52.000
colleagues tried feeding the finches some fly larva.

198
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.020
And if ever there were a look of disgust on a finch phase, that was it.

199
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.940
So I think there's been a change there.

200
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:01.600
Also seeing baby finches climbing up over each other,

201
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:05.250
just struggling to get away from the larva on the bottom of the nest. Um,

202
00:12:05.251 --> 00:12:09.100
and they'll even start standing on the nest room just to avoid being eaten by

203
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:14.080
it. When I asked Charlotte what she makes of all of these changes, she said, um,

204
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.360
I think probably too little, too late.

205
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.130
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

206
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.030
<v 1>but then Sonia told me something really surprising. Yeah. That,</v>

207
00:12:27.031 --> 00:12:31.260
that was a very unexpected discovery. Takes a couple steps to get there,

208
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.401
but just to set it up,

209
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:36.510
back in 2000 she was on flurry on an island for the first time I started

210
00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:41.490
studying Darwin's finches in particular three tree finch species, the small,

211
00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:42.510
the medium and the large.

212
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.860
And we went out and we set up our mis nets and we caught the birds and we

213
00:12:46.861 --> 00:12:47.490
measured them.

214
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.390
And the thing to know is that even though these are three different species,

215
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.180
they're actually really hard to tell apart visually.

216
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.110
So she would end up relying on their songs, their mating calls.

217
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.880
Do you remember the song types? Could you whistle them for me? Oh yes. It's,

218
00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:05.850
it's a very simple song. The small tree finch goes something like two, two,

219
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:06.720
two two two two two

220
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.833
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

221
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.730
<v 1>That's a small tree finch and the,</v>

222
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.030
the medium tree finch is just a bit slower for the medium as a t,

223
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:21.010
t t t for the large g, g

224
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.011
G. T. Wow.

225
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:29.011
It's like a soprano saxophone and an alto and a 10 or something like that.

226
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.350
That's right. So we, we just, you know, sat in the forest and were,

227
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:34.510
and we would always quiz each other. What's that? What's that?

228
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:38.110
And we all agreed because the calls are really distinct, easy to tell apart.

229
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.190
But the interesting thing was from year to year it got more difficult.

230
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.560
As Tony says, each time she'd go into the field,

231
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.430
the song sounded like they were starting to blur together.

232
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.640
Then when I showed up after a few years, again,

233
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.510
I was truly even more perplexed. Should I go?

234
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.170
Why can't I tell these finches apart? It was very confusing.

235
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.290
Am I losing my touch? But that shouldn't really happen.

236
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:10.800
You should actually get better with experience. Not Worse.

237
00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:13.800
And that's where I thought, oh, something's changed in the system.

238
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.250
I like to think of it as a kind of, um, Darwin finch, you know, slew thing,

239
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.330
adventure. So Sonya and your team rounded up some of the birds they tagged,

240
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.320
we collected genetic samples, got some DNA and song samples,

241
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.020
made some recordings, brought all this stuff into the lab,

242
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:36.050
analyze the genetic samples and had this terrible realization that the large

243
00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:42.450
tree finches now extinct. Totally gone from the island.

244
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.720
So you really only had two species left.

245
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:48.240
You had the small tree finches and the medium tree finches,

246
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.240
and based on that genetic data, the small trees

247
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.470
<v 3>benches not doing great,</v>

248
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:59.270
but compared to the medium tree finches they are because the medium tree finches

249
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.560
were on the brink of extinction like a large ones. Yeah.

250
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.700
But then she sees something amazing in that genetic data.

251
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.890
She sees a small group of birds who have mixed up genes,

252
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.120
a hybrid cluster,

253
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.200
some genes from the small tree finches and some from the medium tree finches.

254
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.090
What does that mean? Well,

255
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:24.290
it means that these two different finches had started having babies together,

256
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.950
which should never actually happen because these are totally separate species.

257
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.980
That's really the classical definition of a species is like a biological rule

258
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.230
about who you're not going to make a baby with. So they,

259
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:39.890
they choose not to breed even if they could for who knows,

260
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:43.780
maybe a million years. The medium tree finch has patrolled that boundary.

261
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.880
I've got my thing over here, and you got your thing over there,

262
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.270
but then along come the flies and all of a sudden,

263
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:53.720
like over maybe 20 years, these medium tree finches,

264
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.840
they start to break their own biggest rule and they start to meet outside of

265
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:03.200
their own kind. And these hybrid finches,

266
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:06.050
are they doing better against the flies? Well, there's,

267
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.020
there's a couple of clues that say maybe, yeah. For example, when you look at

268
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.893
<v 1>in the nest,</v>

269
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.930
they seem to have fewer parasites and they seem to have more babies that survive

270
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.110
15% wow.

271
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.270
Whereas the numbers were very small for the medium tree finch and smaller for

272
00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:26.410
the small tree finch. Wow. I dare say that sounds kind of hopeful.

273
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.360
It does. Yeah. Now, the jury is still very much out on what will happen,

274
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.920
but if the hybrids do have a fitness advantage and if they survive,

275
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:41.250
we may be witnessing in hyperspeed the creation of an entirely new species.

276
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.760
It would possibly be one of the first vertebrate examples of speciation in real

277
00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:52.040
time that we can observe.

278
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.400
<v 7>So tucked into the story of these finches</v>

279
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.130
is this story of Galapagos.

280
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:05.970
<v 2>Uh,</v>

281
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.020
<v 7>same exact story that Darwin saw. These processes that you've described</v>

282
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.340
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

283
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.220
<v 3>they just never ever stopped.</v>

284
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.310
<v 7>It's this on ending</v>

285
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.853
struggle.

286
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:50.743
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

287
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:17.910
<v 1>one last thing. My last night there,</v>

288
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.930
I went to meet up with that guy, Lou Nitas, who is running for mayor.

289
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.560
I met him at this pizza place. The election had happened the night before.

290
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.570
And did he win? No. A Buccellati the incumbent one. So we,

291
00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.340
we go outside. Chad [inaudible] paralysis. I was running as the mayor.

292
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.650
Turns out he speaks some English. So we, you know,

293
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:39.380
we do this interview in English and I'm,

294
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.140
I'm almost embarrassed that I wanted to talk to him because I think that dude is

295
00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:47.340
just going to be so down and out. Exactly the opposite.

296
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.510
He was so joyful to have lost. That's what I thought. You're not sad.

297
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:57.000
You're not sad. And he's like, friend, this is a field of four.

298
00:18:57.001 --> 00:18:58.950
The other three have money behind them.

299
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.480
And you see their flags all over Santa Cruz. I just came in second. Whoa.

300
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:08.370
