doing a review coming up so he said that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
doing a review coming up so he said that
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849
doing a review coming up so he said that
that's probably something that he's

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
that's probably something that he's
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.769
that's probably something that he's
going to need in the review but he

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
going to need in the review but he
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.259
going to need in the review but he
hasn't seen it yet and hasn't written

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
hasn't seen it yet and hasn't written
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.229
hasn't seen it yet and hasn't written
the script so we never quite know what

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
the script so we never quite know what
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.670

he's going to want when he's going to
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.260
he's going to want when he's going to
need but he did say that that was

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
need but he did say that that was
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.200
need but he did say that that was
probably something to think about if I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
probably something to think about if I
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.810
probably something to think about if I
had the time to do it before he wrote

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
had the time to do it before he wrote
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.459
had the time to do it before he wrote
the script and got everything ready what

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
the script and got everything ready what
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.630

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
like that I could just find a cheap mask
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.420

Shyamalan character that Malcolm plays
and stuff like that and then I could

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
and stuff like that and then I could
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.150
and stuff like that and then I could
just take that alter it a little bit cut

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
just take that alter it a little bit cut
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979
just take that alter it a little bit cut

I went to Party City and I got one of
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789
I went to Party City and I got one of
these cheap masks it's similar to the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
these cheap masks it's similar to the
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.170
these cheap masks it's similar to the
one that we used for Shyamalan but it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
one that we used for Shyamalan but it's
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760
one that we used for Shyamalan but it's
a little cheaper is the only one that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
a little cheaper is the only one that
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.080
a little cheaper is the only one that
they have and they had them in different

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
they have and they had them in different
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.830
they have and they had them in different
colors but it's a little broader along

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
colors but it's a little broader along
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.850
colors but it's a little broader along
the face and a little less articulated a

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860
the face and a little less articulated a
 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.010
the face and a little less articulated a
little simpler you could use this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
little simpler you could use this
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080
little simpler you could use this
however for me it's a little too simple

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
however for me it's a little too simple
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999
however for me it's a little too simple
than asking I wanted to do something a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
than asking I wanted to do something a
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.240
than asking I wanted to do something a
little closer to the film and I happen

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
little closer to the film and I happen
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.130
little closer to the film and I happen
to have this Halloween mask that I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
to have this Halloween mask that I
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.640
to have this Halloween mask that I
purchased this past October and was

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
purchased this past October and was
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.929
purchased this past October and was
going to use it for another project I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
going to use it for another project I
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.580
going to use it for another project I
thought it was just like a cool mask is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
thought it was just like a cool mask is
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.410
thought it was just like a cool mask is
really cheap I think I got it maybe it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
really cheap I think I got it maybe it
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.760
really cheap I think I got it maybe it
like a Walgreens or something like that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
like a Walgreens or something like that
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.030
like a Walgreens or something like that
for like 5 bucks it's a little bit more

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
for like 5 bucks it's a little bit more
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.210
for like 5 bucks it's a little bit more
durable plastic than this this is really

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
durable plastic than this this is really
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.910
durable plastic than this this is really
flimsy this is a little bit more rigid

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
flimsy this is a little bit more rigid
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.889
flimsy this is a little bit more rigid
and it's got some really great

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
and it's got some really great
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.219
and it's got some really great
articulation and kind of a cool paint

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
articulation and kind of a cool paint
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.630
articulation and kind of a cool paint
job actually item set it's a neat

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
job actually item set it's a neat
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.570
job actually item set it's a neat
looking mask kind of spooky looking but

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
looking mask kind of spooky looking but
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.859
looking mask kind of spooky looking but
I actually I think it looked a lot more

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
I actually I think it looked a lot more
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.430
I actually I think it looked a lot more
like the mask in the film once you break

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
like the mask in the film once you break
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.120
like the mask in the film once you break
it into

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130
it into
 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.900
it into
components the mask in the movie is has

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910
components the mask in the movie is has
 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.310
components the mask in the movie is has
very earth-like the lips are very

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320
very earth-like the lips are very
 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.580
very earth-like the lips are very
prominent and there are just the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590
prominent and there are just the
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.260
prominent and there are just the
cheekbone elements and stuff like that a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
cheekbone elements and stuff like that a
 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.400
cheekbone elements and stuff like that a
more prominent there's deeper lines and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
more prominent there's deeper lines and
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.040
more prominent there's deeper lines and
stuff like that and grooves in the face

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050
stuff like that and grooves in the face
 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.500
stuff like that and grooves in the face
so I think actually this mask would work

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
so I think actually this mask would work
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.660
so I think actually this mask would work
perfectly this should be actually a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670
perfectly this should be actually a
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.220
perfectly this should be actually a
really simple build all we're really

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
really simple build all we're really
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.920
really simple build all we're really
going to need to do is map out on this

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
going to need to do is map out on this
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.170
going to need to do is map out on this
mask all the places we're going to make

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
mask all the places we're going to make
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.840
mask all the places we're going to make
our cuts based on I have an image

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850
our cuts based on I have an image
 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.580
our cuts based on I have an image
whatever from the movie I'll probably

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
whatever from the movie I'll probably
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.950
whatever from the movie I'll probably
pull up a few more images after I picked

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960
pull up a few more images after I picked
 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960
pull up a few more images after I picked
that one up off the floor and then

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970
that one up off the floor and then
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.340
that one up off the floor and then
cutting it out and I think it's a thin

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350
cutting it out and I think it's a thin
 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.960
cutting it out and I think it's a thin
enough plastic I could do it probably

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
enough plastic I could do it probably
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.910
enough plastic I could do it probably
with some shop sheers or even just a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920
with some shop sheers or even just a
 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.070
with some shop sheers or even just a
knife you could use a rotary tool but I

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
knife you could use a rotary tool but I
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.420
knife you could use a rotary tool but I
don't know if it's necessary you could

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
don't know if it's necessary you could
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.430
don't know if it's necessary you could
you know it's just thin enough plastic

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440
you know it's just thin enough plastic
 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.070
you know it's just thin enough plastic
or I think I could easily cut it with a

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080
or I think I could easily cut it with a
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.720
or I think I could easily cut it with a
pair of scissors then I might use a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
pair of scissors then I might use a
 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.280
pair of scissors then I might use a
rotary tool just to clean up the edges

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
rotary tool just to clean up the edges
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.750
rotary tool just to clean up the edges
and stuff like that and round them off a

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760
and stuff like that and round them off a
 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.730
and stuff like that and round them off a
little bit because some of the edges or

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740
little bit because some of the edges or
 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.380
little bit because some of the edges or
just with a lines and stuff like that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390
just with a lines and stuff like that
 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.860
just with a lines and stuff like that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660
it's a bit more rounded and there's a
 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.870
it's a bit more rounded and there's a
bit of a gap there so that she can speak

bit of a gap there so that she can speak
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.810

we're just going to get started I'm just

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
we're just going to get started I'm just
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.580
we're just going to get started I'm just
going to map out the lines on here and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590
going to map out the lines on here and
 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.810
