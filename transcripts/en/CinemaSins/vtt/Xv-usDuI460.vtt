00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.880
Where did you come from?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.689
The Enterprise, duh.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.650
I beamed in.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.650
You beamed in?

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.650
Yeah.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.750
I thought you were a movie buff.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.750
Star Trek?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.750
Transporters?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.750
I beamed in.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.310
Yeah, I'm familiar with the terminology.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.210
I'm also familiar with the fact that Star
Trek is science fiction, and therefore not

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.210
real.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.040
So how did you get here?

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.079
Dude.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.120
Star Trek is real.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120
Alright?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.400
You take that back you (censored).

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.400
Whoa!

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Dude!

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.210
I forgot how much of a Trekkie you are.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.790
It's Trekker, alright?

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.350
You know we like to be referred to as Trekkers.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.030
You know, I don't have to take this.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.339
I can go back to the Enterprise.

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.390
Calm down, alright?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.670
You came here to talk to me about something,
so what was it?

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.580
I saw Star Trek Into Darkness.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.119
I thought you might want to talk about it.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.119
Yeah.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.119
Did you see it?

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.909
Yeah, I thought it was f*cking awesome.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.920
What did you think?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.460
Well, it has some pros and it has some cons.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.460
Yeah?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.659
Usually you only find the cons.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.710
Well, it's Star Trek, so, I gotta give it
pro points just for being Star Trek in the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.189
first place, even though it's not the real
Star Trek.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.090
Also, this is the second Star Trek movie in
a row that's given us a hot chick in her underwear.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.530
I don't know what's up with that, but it's
awesome!

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.200
So, that's another pro.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.189
I'm still waiting to find out what the con
is.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.420
Well, the villain.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.150
I didn't like the villain at all.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.150
What?!

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.150
Come on!

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.150
Benedict Cumberbatch?

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.250
Man, he was the best thing about this movie!

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.250
He was awesome.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.250
I thought he was terrible.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.250
Oh, come on.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.850
I thought he was terrible.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.679
I mean, Star Trek villains are supposed to
be these big, awesome, famous actors.

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.509
Like Ricardo Montalban, or Christopher Lloyd,
or that guy from Sound of Music.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.149
But this time all we get is British Sherlock
Holmes.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.030
Dude.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.499
Sherlock Holmes is always British.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.549
Always.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.279
Not when it's Robert Downy Junior.

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:10.190
Not when it's Lucy Liu!

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.620
How can you be aware enough culturally to
know that all of those people are in Sherlock

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.519
Holmes adaptations, but not know that Sherlock
Holmes is British?

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.159
Or that Lucy Liu is playing f*cking Watson?!

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.900
How can you be that dumb?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.540
All I'm saying is that I would have preferred
another actor.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.931
I thought he was awesome.

00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:30.390
He was the best thing about the film.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.310
Even people who hate this movie are gonna
rave about him.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.360
Him and Kirk, you know?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.989
Locked in mortal combat.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.680
What's not to like?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.849
Well, I mean, to start with, it's the Kirk
and Spock show, this movie.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.379
I meanâ€”
Yeah, it was awesome.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.939
I like Scotty, Uhura, Chekov, Bones.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.500
I miss those guys.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.170
All of those people are in this movie.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.489
I didn't see them.

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.799
Well, you have a reputation for not looking
hard enough.

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.489
No, I have a reputation for paying too much
attention.

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.860
Sometimes it does make me miss some details.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.140
So if you say they were in it, I'm willing
to take your word for it.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.549
I appreciate that.

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.110
I'm still surprised you liked it as much as
you did.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.110
You shouldn't be.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.110
This movie's awesome, dude!

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.150
It is action packed!

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.110
Your pants are action-packed.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.020
Well now how am I even supposed to be offended
by that.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.909
I mean, like, what scenario can you think
of where that would be anything but a compliment?

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.800
If you add "pants" onto an insult, it makes
it more insulting, even if it's a compliment.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.800
Whatever, dude.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800
This movie's awesome.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800
It's got action, romance, bromance, space.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800
Everything I want in my Star Trek.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800
1: Whatever.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.580
It's got action, romance, friendship, drama,
space... everything I want in my Star Trek.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.879
It is not your Star Trek.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.790
It is not anyone's Star Trek.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.780
It's everybody's Star Trek.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.780
I'm sorry.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.659
I didn't mean to take ownership of it.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.849
If this movie's so awesome, then why isn't
it, like, headlining the Cannes Film Festival

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.239
this week?

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.409
Cannes.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.590
What?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.719
It's Cannes.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.769
Not Cannes.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.549
No, I'm pretty sure it's Cannes.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.680
Or Cannes.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.670
Or maybe Can-ness.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.311
But definitely not Cannes.

00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:17.530
Right, because you're the authority on how
to pronounce French words.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.590
You know what, dude?

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.660
I could call the Enterprise at any time I
want and have them beam you to freaking Mars,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.400
or out in the middle of space.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.310
Why don't you do that?

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.569
Or, better yet, I could use this phaser Captain
Pike gave me and shoot you.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.460
That is not a phaser.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.530
It's set to kill.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.669
That is a set of hair clippers.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.680
No, this is a phaser that's made to look like
a set of clippers.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.590
Big difference.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.650
This thing will kill you.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:55.690
Let's see it.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:14.879
Oh sh*t.
