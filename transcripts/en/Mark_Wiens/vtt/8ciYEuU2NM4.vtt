00:00:00.593 --> 00:00:03.217
- These are like right at the
size where you're not sure

00:00:03.217 --> 00:00:05.918
if you should take a whole bite in one

00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:08.668
or if you should bite it in half.

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.824
(upbeat music)

00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:20.145
- Hello, good morning.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.112
- Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:26.360
with Migrationology dot
com in Mumbai, India.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.117
Good morning, Ying.

00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:29.602
- Good morning.

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.903
- We have just checked out of our hotel

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:35.055
and we ordered an Uber
and we're on our way

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.369
to the airport.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.535
But our flight is not
out until later tonight,

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:41.720
as we're gonna go to the
airport, we're gonna try

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.807
to check in our bag and
then we're gonna go to

00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:48.230
the Juhu Beach area in
Mumbai and hopefully

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.377
hang out around that area for the day

00:00:51.377 --> 00:00:53.409
before we go back to the airport.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.992
(upbeat music)

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.930
We just made it to the airport.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.966
So now we're gonna see
where we can leave our bag

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.501
for the rest of the day.

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:23.266
The baggage storage facility
is in the parking lot

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.544
of the arrivals area and
our baggage is stored

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:27.377
for the next six hours.

00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:28.615
- Hello.

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:29.985
- [Mark] Nice to meet you.

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:30.818
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:30.818 --> 00:01:32.597
- [Mark] Okay, have a great day.

00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:33.430
- Yeah.

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:38.660
- That all went remarkably
smooth and hassle-free.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.418
We are now in a mini-minivan
and on our way to go eat.

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:45.001
(upbeat music)

00:01:49.173 --> 00:01:51.570
The taxi just dropped us off very near

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.571
to Mithibai College, and
we're just going to walk down

00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:58.638
the road a little bit
to a street food stall

00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:01.428
that is famous for serving dosa.

00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:04.558
Can I have the paneer tikka dosa?

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:08.143
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:08.143 --> 00:02:08.976
Thank you.

00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:11.470
This place is called Anand Stall

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.830
and they are famous, especially
for sandwiches and dosas

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.721
and I did not want to leave India

00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:19.098
without having a good dosa.

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:21.993
I ordered the paneer tikka
dosa and then they give you

00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:24.084
a little token, you pay at the front there

00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:25.882
and then you go over
here to the dosa counter

00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:27.378
to pick it up.

00:02:27.378 --> 00:02:30.328
I will never get bored of
watching someone make food

00:02:30.328 --> 00:02:31.495
on the street.

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:34.896
(light music)

00:02:56.621 --> 00:02:59.704
(indistinct chatter)

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.540
In order to make this
kind of modern version

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.770
of a dosa, what he did
was he first spread out

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.401
the batter onto the hot
platter and he cooked

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:13.368
the batter and then he added in the cubes

00:03:13.368 --> 00:03:16.282
of paneer cheese and
then he added in a bunch

00:03:16.282 --> 00:03:19.842
of different sauces, that
tikka sauce, some chili,

00:03:19.842 --> 00:03:22.396
he sprinkled on some
seasoning, he added in

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:24.836
a handful of dhania which is cilantro

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.410
and then I thought they were
actually going to keep it all

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.755
wrapped up inside the dosa but actually

00:03:28.755 --> 00:03:31.796
they scooped it onto a big
plate and then they served

00:03:31.796 --> 00:03:33.825
the dosa, they wrapped it
up and served it on the side

00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:35.825
along with some chutney.

00:03:36.778 --> 00:03:39.730
Oh, and it's crispy and
soft at the same time.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.665
And go in for all of that beautiful,

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:45.094
it's almost, yeah, it's
prepared kind of like a curry.

00:03:45.094 --> 00:03:47.668
But I love how they're
so many greens in there.

00:03:47.668 --> 00:03:50.060
I think there's green
onions in there as well.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.477
Oh, look at that.

00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:55.114
That looks incredible.

00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:05.040
Wow!

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.933
That is incredible.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.481
Wow!

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:14.550
It's just packed full of flavor.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.967
You've got the crispy sort of like spongy

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.974
but very thin, like almost
like crepe like dosa.

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:24.084
And then that curry.

00:04:24.084 --> 00:04:27.579
I cannot believe how
quickly and how masterfully

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:29.823
he whipped up that paneer tikka.

00:04:29.823 --> 00:04:33.574
I was expecting it to be
good, but that is incredible.

00:04:33.574 --> 00:04:36.794
And then I will add some
extra chutney to it.

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:40.127
I think this is a coconut based chutney.

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:50.973
Oh that chutney, oh yeah.

00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:52.866
It is coconut based.

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:56.933
And then I can really taste
the curry leaf in there

00:04:56.933 --> 00:04:59.363
as well as I think some coriander

00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:02.041
and some cumin in there, maybe.

00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:05.043
Some people order and then
just stand around and eat.

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:07.175
But other people get their
plate and they go sit

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:09.727
in their car or they
go stand somewhere down

00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:11.004
the sidewalk and eat.

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.785
You can eat anywhere around here you like.

00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:14.007
What really makes a difference for me

00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:16.674
is the, all of that,
those chopped up herbs

00:05:16.674 --> 00:05:20.674
within the curry and then
of course the chutney.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.296
It kind of has a nutty taste to it, too.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:33.996
Almost like cashew tasting
in the curry as well.

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:36.542
That was literally just
everything I could possibly want

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:37.375
in a dosa.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.333
(upbeat music)

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.290
And we are on our way to Juhu Beach.

00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:00.495
Thank you.

00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:06.804
It is really, really windy.

00:06:06.804 --> 00:06:07.637
Check out Ying's hair.

00:06:07.637 --> 00:06:09.720
(laughs)

00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:11.514
Hello.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.590
How are you?

00:06:16.468 --> 00:06:18.108
Nice to meet you.

00:06:18.108 --> 00:06:19.525
Nice to meet you.

00:06:21.565 --> 00:06:24.232
And I already have a new friend.

00:06:26.008 --> 00:06:28.163
What is your name?

00:06:28.163 --> 00:06:30.580
(indistinct)

00:06:33.691 --> 00:06:36.191
(light music)

00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:50.817
It's so windy, so I don't
know if you're gonna be able

00:06:50.817 --> 00:06:53.042
to hear me on the
microphone, I hope you can,

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:57.713
but we came to the beach,
there is so much going on again

00:06:57.713 --> 00:06:59.569
and I'm sure it's not nearly
as busy as it gets later on

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.422
in the day, but lots of people here,

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:06.505
lots of action going on,
people are flying kites,

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:11.530
there are, it's just a colorful display

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.272
of people and clothes and things for sale.

00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:19.439
And I came to the beach so
I had to order a coconut.

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:27.827
Few things are greater
at refreshing oneself

00:07:27.827 --> 00:07:29.255
than a fresh coconut.

00:07:29.255 --> 00:07:31.838
Oh, coconut water is delicious.

00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:46.406
It started raining
pretty hard so we came in

00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:49.896
to the, like food court, hawker
stall, street food section

00:07:49.896 --> 00:07:53.427
and there's just a ton of food in here.

00:07:53.427 --> 00:07:55.819
Walking around now, lots
and lots of different chaats

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:58.914
and snacks to eat, I just
gotta find the right place

00:07:58.914 --> 00:07:59.831
to eat now.

00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:09.336
(light music)

00:08:39.024 --> 00:08:41.323
There is a torrential downpour right now

00:08:41.323 --> 00:08:43.946
and the wind is just
whipping through this alley

00:08:43.946 --> 00:08:45.414
of food stalls.

00:08:45.414 --> 00:08:48.493
And actually it feels really
good because it's so cool

00:08:48.493 --> 00:08:51.155
but it is kind of a chaotic environment

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:55.322
and pao bhaji is one of the
ultimate Mumbai street food

00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:58.923
snacks available everywhere.

00:08:58.923 --> 00:09:01.086
This will be my first time
to try it in Mumbai so far,

00:09:01.086 --> 00:09:04.426
I haven't had a chance
yet but I'm glad it,

00:09:04.426 --> 00:09:07.724
you can actually just smell
the pao bhaji being cooked

00:09:07.724 --> 00:09:10.700
within these stalls within the alleys.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.987
And I hope you can hear
me over that music.

00:09:11.987 --> 00:09:13.689
So in order to make the pao phaji,

00:09:13.689 --> 00:09:16.630
what they do is they take
tomatoes and potatoes

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.076
and a bunch of different
spices and then they cook it

00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:21.826
on a huge giant round hot skillet

00:09:23.008 --> 00:09:25.259
and it just slowly cooks
and they slowly like mash

00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:27.073
it down with all the spices.

00:09:27.073 --> 00:09:29.627
They mix it with butter,
and then they just sort of

00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:32.585
store it on the side of the
hot plate throughout the day

00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:35.224
and then when it's ordered
they grab some of it

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:36.900
and stick it into the
middle of the hot plate

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.428
and mix it with water, I think,

00:09:38.428 --> 00:09:40.731
and then make it into a kind of a sauce

00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:43.039
and then add lots of butter again,

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:46.284
and then they take bread and
add some butter to the bread

00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:47.930
of course and then fry it on the hot plate

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.054
to crispify it, and
then they serve it here

00:09:50.054 --> 00:09:51.746
and this is, you know,
it's the combination

00:09:51.746 --> 00:09:54.250
of pao, which is a bun like
this, and then the bhaji,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:58.167
which is this tomato,
potato puree with spices.

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:02.268
Mm.

00:10:03.327 --> 00:10:05.770
You can feel the starchiness of the potato

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.353
but then it has a really
nice like tartness

00:10:10.254 --> 00:10:12.254
from the tomato and then

00:10:13.497 --> 00:10:15.634
it's a little bit spicy, you can taste

00:10:15.634 --> 00:10:19.896
that blend of cumin and
turmeric in there as well.

00:10:19.896 --> 00:10:21.629
And then yeah, you can
taste the butter in there

00:10:21.629 --> 00:10:22.870
quite well as well.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.937
I'm gonna take a piece of the bread next.

00:10:24.937 --> 00:10:27.817
Probably mix in with some of the onions.

00:10:27.817 --> 00:10:29.493
Oh, and that little blob of butter

00:10:29.493 --> 00:10:31.576
on the top there as well.

00:10:40.817 --> 00:10:41.650
Mm.

00:10:42.863 --> 00:10:45.615
That's a very buttery, fluffy roll.

00:10:45.615 --> 00:10:47.218
And then I really like it with the onions

00:10:47.218 --> 00:10:49.885
because they're crisp and
they give it that extra

00:10:49.885 --> 00:10:53.218
onion taste, onions never hurt anything.

00:11:05.073 --> 00:11:07.374
I can see why this is so attractive.

00:11:07.374 --> 00:11:09.457
It is a nice combination.

00:11:13.043 --> 00:11:16.960
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:36.233 --> 00:11:37.066
Thank you.

00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:37.899
Bombay bhelpuri.

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:38.732
- Bombay bhelpuri.

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:39.754
- Okay.

00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:43.143
The next snack I wanted to
try here is mumbai bhelpuri.

00:11:43.143 --> 00:11:44.834
And this is a snack mixture.

00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:47.047
There are, I think it's puffy rice

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:48.562
with a bunch of different crunchy things

00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:51.467
and he really stirred it up in a chutney

00:11:51.467 --> 00:11:54.162
and then he mixed it with,
there is some cilantro,

00:11:54.162 --> 00:11:56.785
some dhania, and then also
some other little crispies

00:11:56.785 --> 00:11:58.730
in here, and this is another, like,

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:02.897
just like a mixture of
different crispies and chutneys.

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:05.763
They stuck a couple spoons in it.

00:12:05.763 --> 00:12:07.730
Oh yeah, and also there's lots
of onions in here as well.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.730
And you can see, I think these
are all little rice crispies

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.730
and little crunchy bits.

00:12:17.326 --> 00:12:18.638
Mm!

00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:19.471
- [Man] Chili sauce?

00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:20.304
- Okay, yes.

00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:21.768
Chili sauce, chili sauce.

00:12:21.768 --> 00:12:22.925
On the side.

00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:26.842
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:34.585
Thank you.

00:12:36.894 --> 00:12:38.879
Oh, he just added on
some extra chili sauce

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:40.137
and some onions.

00:12:40.137 --> 00:12:42.602
And then for this one,
I'm gonna take the lime.

00:12:42.602 --> 00:12:44.936
And squeeze it all over.

00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:48.353
It's kind of sweet and savory and crispy.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.943
Yeah, it tastes like
rice crispies, just mixed

00:12:51.943 --> 00:12:56.110
with all sorts of sweet and
tangy and spicy and onions.

00:13:00.543 --> 00:13:02.403
Oh, and there's some potatoes in there,

00:13:02.403 --> 00:13:05.153
on the bottom there too, I think.

00:13:06.628 --> 00:13:09.092
Mm, oh yeah, with that hit,

00:13:09.092 --> 00:13:11.199
with that squeeze of lime.

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:14.813
That's nice because it contrasts
that sweet, tangy sauce.

00:13:14.813 --> 00:13:18.063
These little spoons are kind of flimsy.

00:13:23.118 --> 00:13:23.951
Mm.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.540
This is a good beach snack.

00:13:30.763 --> 00:13:32.364
So I would really recommend
that you try pao bhaji

00:13:32.364 --> 00:13:34.377
when you come to Juhu,
there are many, many places

00:13:34.377 --> 00:13:37.446
to eat pao bhaji and there
are lots and lots of food.

00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:39.322
The bhelpuri was awesome and the stall

00:13:39.322 --> 00:13:43.010
and the owner there was really nice.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.510
(light music)

00:13:50.615 --> 00:13:54.559
We are heading to go try and
find one more last chaat,

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:57.212
one snack before we head
back to the airport.

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:59.961
This will be the final, final snack.

00:13:59.961 --> 00:14:02.387
I gotta hope it's open.

00:14:02.387 --> 00:14:04.887
(light music)

00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:07.537
Okay, thank you.

00:14:07.537 --> 00:14:10.545
Luckily the stall is open,
so one more last chaat

00:14:10.545 --> 00:14:12.628
before we go the airport.

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:19.256
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:21.967 --> 00:14:23.141
Can I have sev puri?

00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:23.974
- Sev puri?

00:14:23.974 --> 00:14:24.807
Yeah, sure, sure.

00:14:24.807 --> 00:14:26.557
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:14:26.557 --> 00:14:28.237
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:28.237 --> 00:14:29.070
Yes.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.400
- [Man] So you are here
for, travel or something?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.914
- [Mark] Yes, travel to eat.

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:34.996
- [Man] Travel to eat?

00:14:34.996 --> 00:14:37.079
(laughs)

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:42.874
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:47.095
- This stall is located on
the corner of Sixth Street,

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.361
which is in the neighborhood
just kind of back

00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:52.491
from Juhu Beach, and it's actually right,

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:54.866
just kind of in the
neighborhood from where we

00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:56.808
ate that dosa a couple hours ago.

00:14:56.808 --> 00:14:58.759
But I'm so glad they're
open, I really wanted to try

00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:02.024
their sev puri before leaving Mumbai.

00:15:02.024 --> 00:15:03.181
It's topped with so many ingredients

00:15:03.181 --> 00:15:05.059
but under here there are little discs.

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:06.866
And what he does, crispy discs.

00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:08.382
And what he does is he takes the discs,

00:15:08.382 --> 00:15:10.569
puts on some potatoes and some onions

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:14.226
and a bunch of different
chutneys and then sprinkles it

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:17.395
with all these crispies and then,

00:15:17.395 --> 00:15:18.510
what are these things?

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.250
I'm not totally sure and
then some dhania cilantro,

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.667
and chili, and so it's like a little disc

00:15:24.664 --> 00:15:28.207
of many toppings and if
I take out the first one

00:15:28.207 --> 00:15:31.900
hopefully we can all see what is inside.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.898
Oh, yeah.

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.290
The cross section.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.540
There are onions in there and potatoes.

00:15:43.919 --> 00:15:44.752
Mm!

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:48.950
Oh, this is one of my favorite chaats.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:49.783
Mm!

00:15:51.353 --> 00:15:55.548
That potato is so creamy
that it almost reminds me

00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:59.469
of guacamole, it's like avocado almost.

00:15:59.469 --> 00:16:01.771
You got a little bit of spice going on,

00:16:01.771 --> 00:16:03.862
it burns your throat a
little bit going down,

00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:05.262
and then you can taste the sweetness

00:16:05.262 --> 00:16:07.856
from the chutney, it's so well balanced

00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:10.518
and that is an awesome snack.

00:16:10.518 --> 00:16:12.286
It's like crunchy and juicy.

00:16:12.286 --> 00:16:13.436
I wanna taste on of these little things.

00:16:13.436 --> 00:16:16.769
I'm not totally sure what that, this is.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.169
Mm!

00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:20.270
I think that's mango.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.273
Mm.

00:16:21.273 --> 00:16:22.611
Nice and sour and crisp.

00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:24.001
These are right at that size

00:16:24.001 --> 00:16:26.679
where they are almost too
big to take a full bite

00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:28.749
but then at the same time you're not sure

00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:32.194
if you want to bite it in
half and risk collapsing

00:16:32.194 --> 00:16:34.094
the entire, the entire snack bite.

00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:36.261
I'll go with the one bite.

00:16:45.596 --> 00:16:47.050
Those chutneys.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.133
And then everything just
collapses in your mouth.

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:56.202
Okay, thank you.

00:16:57.957 --> 00:16:59.451
- International, domestic?

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:00.784
- International.

00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:02.791
Terminal two.

00:17:02.791 --> 00:17:03.624
- Huh?

00:17:03.624 --> 00:17:04.457
- Terminal two.

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:05.290
- Oh, oh.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.184
- Okay, thank you.

00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:07.542
No, it is a microphone.

00:17:07.542 --> 00:17:08.375
- Oh.

00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:11.125
- Do you see for wind, for audio.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.653
- Ah, my photo.

00:17:13.653 --> 00:17:14.755
- Yes.

00:17:14.755 --> 00:17:16.327
What is your name?

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:17.160
- Hami Nash.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.239
- Hami Nash, nice to meet you.

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:23.192
I am so glad that we got
to stop at that chaat stall

00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:26.323
for our last bite to eat in Mumbai.

00:17:26.323 --> 00:17:27.565
That was stunning.

00:17:27.565 --> 00:17:30.228
That's one of my favorite
chaats, sev puri,

00:17:30.228 --> 00:17:32.480
and that was a great, great version of it.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.731
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:36.788
Oh, sev puri is so good.

00:17:36.788 --> 00:17:38.262
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:38.262 --> 00:17:39.984
We're not racing to catch our flight,

00:17:39.984 --> 00:17:41.822
but we are sort of racing
back to the airport

00:17:41.822 --> 00:17:45.691
because I want to avoid
paying the next level fee

00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:47.874
for our baggage storage.

00:17:47.874 --> 00:17:49.283
So we're hoping to get back in time

00:17:49.283 --> 00:17:51.451
to grab our bags.

00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:53.951
(light music)

00:18:10.461 --> 00:18:12.558
Our driver just stopped and got out

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:14.198
to use the restroom.

00:18:14.198 --> 00:18:17.031
So I'm hoping we'll still make it.

00:18:24.399 --> 00:18:25.628
Okay, for you.

00:18:25.628 --> 00:18:26.625
- [Ying] Thank you.

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:27.494
- Thank you, okay.

00:18:27.494 --> 00:18:29.393
Have a nice day, nice day.

00:18:29.393 --> 00:18:30.993
There's nothing quite like rolling up to

00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:34.533
an international airport
in an auto rickshaw.

00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:36.095
We made it back to the luggage stand

00:18:36.095 --> 00:18:38.792
with literally three minutes to spare.

00:18:38.792 --> 00:18:41.396
If our auto rickshaw driver
had spent three more minutes

00:18:41.396 --> 00:18:43.568
in the bathroom during his bathroom break

00:18:43.568 --> 00:18:46.340
in the middle of our ride, we
would have missed that level

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.292
and had to pay extra for
our bag at the baggage drop.

00:18:49.292 --> 00:18:51.883
No, he was, he was a really fun driver.

00:18:51.883 --> 00:18:53.824
He was a really nice guy.

00:18:53.824 --> 00:18:56.939
(light music)

00:18:56.939 --> 00:18:58.387
We got all checked into the airport

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.712
and went through
immigration and we are now

00:19:00.712 --> 00:19:03.524
sitting at the Air India lounge.

00:19:03.524 --> 00:19:07.522
We have about three hours
until our flight even boards.

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.573
But I wanted to come
here early just to relax

00:19:09.573 --> 00:19:12.115
in the lounge and also I
have a lot of work to do

00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:15.492
so I'm gonna sit here and
well, actually I'll probably go

00:19:15.492 --> 00:19:17.470
eat right now and see
what they have for food.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.970
(light music)

00:19:26.722 --> 00:19:29.660
I'm gonna need a couple of cups of coffee.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.577
And I sort of went with half salad,

00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:36.124
Mediterranean food and half Indian food.

00:19:36.124 --> 00:19:40.291
I love chili paneer, so I had
to go for some chili paneer.

00:19:42.867 --> 00:19:43.866
Mm.

00:19:43.866 --> 00:19:44.699
Yeah.

00:19:45.786 --> 00:19:48.089
Chili paneer's one of the great dishes.

00:19:48.089 --> 00:19:50.554
I've definitely had a lack of salad

00:19:50.554 --> 00:19:54.721
in the last few days, so
I'm ready to eat some salad.

00:20:00.755 --> 00:20:03.290
I got some email done
and I could not resist

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.008
going for another plate of food.

00:20:05.008 --> 00:20:07.740
They brought out some new
dishes and I got mostly salad

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.524
but I could not resist a
piece of lamb rogan josh,

00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:15.066
which is an amazing dish.

00:20:15.066 --> 00:20:17.907
Oh, that's like a big chunk of something.

00:20:17.907 --> 00:20:20.657
Oh, look how tender that lamb is.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.185
I'm gonna have to go back
and get some more of that.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:29.676
Oh, that's amazing.

00:20:29.676 --> 00:20:30.676
Tender lamb.

00:20:31.643 --> 00:20:34.226
Tomatoey, just wonderful sauce.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.183
Oh, that's good.

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.040
It has been an amazing trip to Mumbai

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.112
and it's only been four
days but it's been a pretty

00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:47.408
action-packed four days
and I think we managed

00:20:47.408 --> 00:20:51.003
to do quite a bit and eat some
incredibly delicious food.

00:20:51.003 --> 00:20:54.327
A special thank you to all of
you for your recommendations

00:20:54.327 --> 00:20:56.436
for all the food to eat in Mumbai.

00:20:56.436 --> 00:20:58.936
(light music)

00:21:00.106 --> 00:21:01.082
(indistinct)

00:21:01.082 --> 00:21:02.749
Thank you very much.

00:21:03.928 --> 00:21:06.595
Ying is pretending to be asleep.

00:21:09.973 --> 00:21:12.274
And this is going to be
about a three hour ride,

00:21:12.274 --> 00:21:14.191
flight to Muscat, Oman.

00:21:15.258 --> 00:21:17.758
(light music)

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:23.378
Dinner on the flight is served.

00:21:23.378 --> 00:21:26.800
I went for the angara murgh masala.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.377
Oh, and there's a chili on top here.

00:21:28.377 --> 00:21:31.544
How wonderful for that chicken masala.

00:21:38.683 --> 00:21:41.254
You can taste the blend of masala spices,

00:21:41.254 --> 00:21:44.754
it's buttery, it's nutty, and it's creamy.

00:21:49.515 --> 00:21:52.147
Take a bite of the dahl.

00:21:52.147 --> 00:21:54.730
(upbeat music)

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:03.119
- [Loudspeaker] Passengers,
return our request

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:05.475
to kindly remain seated.

00:22:05.475 --> 00:22:06.471
And we'll be--

00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:07.471
- Thank you.

00:22:10.046 --> 00:22:12.666
Okay, we just landed in Muscat.

00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:16.833
It is 11:30 PM at night and
they said it's 39 degrees.

00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:20.441
Oh, you can feel that oven heat.

00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:22.667
Thank you, Air India, for the good flight.

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:24.101
And Star Alliance.

00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:26.111
We're just now waiting for our bag

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:28.600
and then we're gonna
catch a taxi to our hotel.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.951
City Seasons Hotel.

00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:31.165
- Okay, City Seasons Hotel?

00:22:31.165 --> 00:22:31.998
- Hotel, yes.

00:22:31.998 --> 00:22:33.004
City Seasons Hotel.

00:22:33.004 --> 00:22:35.045
- Ah, City Seasons Hotel.

00:22:35.045 --> 00:22:36.045
- Thank you.

00:22:37.664 --> 00:22:40.247
(upbeat music)

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:52.186
Hi, good evening.

00:22:52.186 --> 00:22:53.975
- [Man] Hello.

00:22:53.975 --> 00:22:56.053
- Taxi was pretty expensive.

00:22:56.053 --> 00:22:59.803
We are definitely in a
different country now.

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:03.303
Just a very quick tour of the room,

00:23:03.303 --> 00:23:06.796
this is the bathroom, nice and spacious.

00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:09.796
And then this is the main room here.

00:23:11.817 --> 00:23:13.734
Blue and desert themed.

00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:17.450
I'm excited to be in Muscat, Oman.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.740
This is my very first trip visit to Oman,

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.505
but I'm about to go to sleep now,

00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:24.846
it's been a long day, I'm pretty tired.

00:23:24.846 --> 00:23:27.350
So I'm gonna end the video for today now,

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.003
thank you all for watching.

00:23:29.003 --> 00:23:31.123

thumbs up if you enjoyed it

00:23:31.123 --> 00:23:33.232

00:23:39.893 --> 00:23:43.269
for our first full day in Muscat, Oman.

00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:44.437
(beep)

00:23:44.437 --> 00:23:48.458
I think that's a big chunk of cauliflower.

00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:49.291
Oh.

00:23:50.908 --> 00:23:53.462
Oh, tomato just went flying under my lap.

00:23:53.462 --> 00:23:56.879
That's why, that's why they have napkins.

00:24:00.888 --> 00:24:01.721
(chuckles)

00:24:01.721 --> 00:24:04.221
(light music)
