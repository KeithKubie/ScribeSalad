00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:11.297
Beneath your ribs, you'll find,
among other things, the pancreas,

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:15.646
an organ that works a lot 
like a personal health coach.

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:20.232
This organ controls your sugar levels
and produces a special juice

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:22.581
that releases the nutrients from your food

00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:26.215
to help keep you 
in the best possible shape.

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:28.937
The pancreas sits just 
behind your stomach,

00:00:28.937 --> 00:00:33.858
an appropriate home, as one of its jobs
is to break down the food you eat.

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:38.070
It aids digestion by producing 
a special tonic made of water,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.518
sodium bicarbonate,

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:42.764
and digestive enzymes.

00:00:42.764 --> 00:00:46.715
Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes 
the stomach's natural acidity,

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:50.574
so these digestive enzymes 
can perform their jobs.

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:53.686
Lipase breaks down fatty substances,

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.134
protease splits up proteins,

00:00:56.134 --> 00:01:00.661
and amylase divides carbohydrates
to create energy-rich sugars.

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.867
Most of those nutrients then get absorbed
into the blood stream,

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:06.693
and go on to enrich the body.

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:11.136
While all this is happening, the pancreas
works on another critical task,

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:13.901
controlling the amount 
of sugar in your blood.

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:17.611
It achieves this with the hormones 
insulin and glucagon,

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:22.212
which are produced in special cells
called the Islets of Langerhans.

00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:25.974
Having too much or too little sugar
can be life threatening,

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:28.959
so the pancreas must 
stay on constant alert.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.719
After a big meal, the blood often
becomes flushed with sugar.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.770
To bring us back to normal,
the pancreas releases insulin,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.659
which makes the excess sugar 
move into cells,

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.186
where it's either used 
as an energy source, or stored for later.

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:47.916
Insulin also tells the liver
to shut down sugar production.

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:50.552
On the other hand, if blood sugar is low,

00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:53.953
the pancreas releases 
a hormone called glucagon

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:57.204
that tells the body's cells and liver
to release stored sugars

00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:59.353
back into the bloodstream.

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:04.782
The interplay between insulin and glucagon
is what keeps our sugar levels balanced.

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:08.739
But a faulty pancreas can no longer 
coach us like this,

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.593
meaning that this healthy 
balance is destroyed.

00:02:11.593 --> 00:02:13.235
If it's weakened by disease,

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:17.477
the organ's ability to produce insulin
may be reduced, or even extinguished,

00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:21.361
which can trigger the condition
known as diabetes.

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:25.906
Without regular insulin release,
sugar steadily builds up in the blood,

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:29.389
eventually hardening the blood vessels
and causing heart attacks,

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:30.680
kidney failure,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.125
and strokes.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:35.561
The same lack of insulin deprives cells
of the energy-rich sugar

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:37.907
they need to grow and function.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:41.413
People with diabetes also tend to have
higher levels of glucagon,

00:02:41.413 --> 00:02:44.274
which makes even more sugar circulate.

00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:48.323
Without this internal health coach,
our sugar levels would go haywire,

00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:51.883
and we wouldn't be able 
to digest important nutrients.

00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:53.362
But like any coach,

00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:56.259
it's not the pancreas' job 
alone to keep us healthy.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.851
It needs our conscious participation, too.
