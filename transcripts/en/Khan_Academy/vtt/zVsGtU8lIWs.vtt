00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
Let's add some transformation
that maps elements in

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.710
set X to set Y.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.870
We know that we call
X the domain of T.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.920
So that's my set X and then my
set that I'm mapping into, set

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.270
Y, that's the codomain.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.750
We know that T is a
transformation that if you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.510
take any member of X and you
transform it, you'll associate

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.230
it with a member of set Y.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.430
You'll map it to a
member of set Y.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.040
That's what the transformation
or the function does.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.740
Now, if we have some subset of
T, let's call A to be some

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.245
subset of T.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.090
So let me draw A like that.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.570
This notation right here
just means subset,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.730
some subset of T.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.590
We've defined the notion of an
image of T of A like that,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:59.870
which is the image of A, of
our subset A, under T.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.700
We've defined this to be equal
to the set-- let me write it

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.010
here-- the set of all-- where if
we take each of the members

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.390
of our subset, it's the set of
all of their transformations.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.060
And, of course, these are going
to be some subset of Y

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.680
right there.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.140
So we essentially take each
of the members of A.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.930
This was one of them.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.960
You find its transformation.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.900
It's that point.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.160
You take another member of A.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.790
This is all set A right here.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.660
Take another member of A.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.720
Find its transformation.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.740
Maybe it's that point.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.760
You keep doing that.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.580
Find it's transformation.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.600
Maybe it's that point.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.160
And then the set of all of those
transformations, maybe

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
it's this blob right here,
we call this the

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.830
image of A under T.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.630
Now, what if we wanted
to think about

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.770
the opposite problem?

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.340
What if we were to start with
set Y, which is our codomain,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.570
So that's Y, and we were to
have some subset of Y.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.980
Let's call our subset of Y S.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.520
So S is a subset of
our codomain Y.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.610
And I'm curious about what
subset of X maps into S.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.230
So I'm curious about this set.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.170
I'm curious about the set of all
vectors that are members

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.390
of my domain such that they're
mapping or the transformation

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.070
of those vectors ends up
in my subset of S.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.560
So what I'm saying is, look,
if I take my domain, there

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.530
must be some subset of vectors
right here, where if I take

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.140
any member of this set, it will
map into these guys, and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.690
that's what I'm defining
right here.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.140
This is equal to that guy.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.570
So I'm literally saying what
are all of the members of X

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.570
where those members of
X all map into S?

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.710
Now, I want to make a very
subtle nuance here to point

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.270
out something here.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.630
I'm not saying that
every point in S

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.190
necessarily gets mapped to.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.430
For example, maybe there's some
element in S right there

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.800
that no element in X ever
gets mapped to from our

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.140
transformation T.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.190
That's OK.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.760
All I'm saying is that
everything in this set maps to

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.460
something within S right here.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.970
And what we call this set right
here, the notation is

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.000
the inverse T of S, but
this is equal to the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.540
pre-image of S under T.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.710
So this is S.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.530
This is the pre-image
of S under T.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.190
And that makes sense.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.980
The image, we go from a subset
of our domain to a subset of

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.050
our codomain.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.250
Preimage, we go from a subset
of our codomain, and we say

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.920
what subset of our domain
maps into that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.850
subset of our codomain?

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.720
Now let me ask you an
interesting question, and this

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.170
is kind of for bonus points.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.850
What is the image of our
pre-image under S?

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.210
So if we take this guy, this
is essentially the image of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.050
this guy right here, right?

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.455
This part right here is the
pre-image of S right here.

00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:37.530
Now, if we take the image of
this, we're saying if we take

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.520
every member of this, what
vectors do they map into?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.290
All of them are going to be
within S, so they're going to

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.880
map within S, but they don't
necessarily map to

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.700
everything within S.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.000
So this is going to be
some subset of S.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.820
So this right here is going
to be some subset of

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.130
our original S.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.870
It's not necessarily equal to
S, but it's a subset of it.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.960
And so this is I think the
motivation for where the

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.330
notation comes from.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.950
We can construct a subset of S
by taking the image of the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.900
pre-image of S.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.950
We can kind of view the image
and the pre-image kind of

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.370
canceling out, and that's why
the inverse notation was

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.720
probably introduced.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.560
Now this is all very abstract.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.400
What I'm going to do in the
next video is actually

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.930
calculate or determine
the pre-image of some

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.430
subset of my codomain.
