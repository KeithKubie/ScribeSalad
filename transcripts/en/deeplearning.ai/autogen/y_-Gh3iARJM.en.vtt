lot of time watching these videos and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420
lot of time watching these videos and
 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.840
lot of time watching these videos and
maybe spent a long time also working on

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850
maybe spent a long time also working on
 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.970
maybe spent a long time also working on
the quizzes and the programming

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
the quizzes and the programming
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.550
the quizzes and the programming
exercises I hope you enjoyed it and you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560
exercises I hope you enjoyed it and you
 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.410
exercises I hope you enjoyed it and you
got a lot out of the process but I'm

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420
got a lot out of the process but I'm
 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.050
got a lot out of the process but I'm
also very grateful for all your time you

also very grateful for all your time you
 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.120
also very grateful for all your time you
spend and for all your hearts wherever

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
spend and for all your hearts wherever
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.610
