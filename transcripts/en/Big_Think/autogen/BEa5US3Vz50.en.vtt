00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
of a problem we've seen many times in
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.320
of a problem we've seen many times in
the past Rwanda others where there's

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
the past Rwanda others where there's
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.929

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.999
very close to a genocide taking place
within a country and so there's this

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009
within a country and so there's this
 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.790
within a country and so there's this
clash between the sovereignty of that

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
clash between the sovereignty of that
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800
clash between the sovereignty of that
country the ability of it to control its

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
country the ability of it to control its
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.310
country the ability of it to control its
own affairs and the imperative of the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320

and so forth and and again each of the
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.110
and so forth and and again each of the
permanent five members can veto and so

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
permanent five members can veto and so
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.720
permanent five members can veto and so

to avert a genocide and so that would
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.410

one that's unjustified and so the real

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280
one that's unjustified and so the real
 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.440
one that's unjustified and so the real
question is how will the international

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
question is how will the international
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.160
question is how will the international
community find the willpower to act

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
community find the willpower to act
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.410
community find the willpower to act
which it is often in the past lacked

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420
which it is often in the past lacked

Rwanda being the best example 800,000

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630
Rwanda being the best example 800,000
 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.260
Rwanda being the best example 800,000
people killed when that could have been

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270
people killed when that could have been
 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.270
people killed when that could have been
averted relatively easily

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
averted relatively easily

if troops had been put in a Rox a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690
if troops had been put in a Rox a
 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.050
if troops had been put in a Rox a
sovereign state so it's so essentially

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060
sovereign state so it's so essentially
 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.820
sovereign state so it's so essentially
the answer to the question of what if

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830
the answer to the question of what if
 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.830
the answer to the question of what if
there were a genocide is the same if

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840
there were a genocide is the same if
 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.560
there were a genocide is the same if
it's a rock or if it's any other any

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570
it's a rock or if it's any other any
 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.930
it's a rock or if it's any other any
other country in the world and of course

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940
other country in the world and of course
 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.240
other country in the world and of course
the reality is we're gonna have some

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
the reality is we're gonna have some
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.640
the reality is we're gonna have some
troop presence there and and right now

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650
troop presence there and and right now
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.780
troop presence there and and right now
we have a vast troop presence so so so

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790
we have a vast troop presence so so so
 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.580
we have a vast troop presence so so so
from a legal point of view there's no

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590
from a legal point of view there's no
 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.080
from a legal point of view there's no
real difference genocide is illegal but

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090
real difference genocide is illegal but
 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.210
real difference genocide is illegal but
you run into this problem of you can't

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
you run into this problem of you can't
 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.050
you run into this problem of you can't
just invade a country willy-nilly

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
just invade a country willy-nilly
 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.900
just invade a country willy-nilly
so now morally I think there's a harder

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910
so now morally I think there's a harder
 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.130
so now morally I think there's a harder
question politically is a harder

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140
question politically is a harder
 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.710
question politically is a harder
question right what does the u.s. owe to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720
question right what does the u.s. owe to
 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.830
question right what does the u.s. owe to
Iraq what do we what what's our what's

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840
Iraq what do we what what's our what's
 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.660
Iraq what do we what what's our what's
our role and what if that genocide

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670
our role and what if that genocide
 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.850
our role and what if that genocide
starts to occur would we then bring the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860
starts to occur would we then bring the
 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.890
starts to occur would we then bring the
troops back and this is particularly

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900
troops back and this is particularly
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.410
troops back and this is particularly
hard for the Democrats because

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420
hard for the Democrats because
 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.030
hard for the Democrats because
traditionally Democrats have been in

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040
traditionally Democrats have been in
 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.280
traditionally Democrats have been in
favor of humanitarian intervention where

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290
favor of humanitarian intervention where
 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.470
favor of humanitarian intervention where
as Republicans traditionally took the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480
as Republicans traditionally took the
 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.710
as Republicans traditionally took the
view that that was the kind of thing

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720
view that that was the kind of thing
 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.330
view that that was the kind of thing
that our armed forces should not be used

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340
that our armed forces should not be used
 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.790
that our armed forces should not be used
for that's social work foreign policy is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800
for that's social work foreign policy is
 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.750
for that's social work foreign policy is
social work

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760
social work
 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.840
social work
whereas we should we should reserve our

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850
whereas we should we should reserve our
 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.610
whereas we should we should reserve our
military power for real national

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
military power for real national
 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.650
military power for real national
security threats so I think if Barack

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
security threats so I think if Barack
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.370
security threats so I think if Barack
Obama's president he'll have it'll be a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380
Obama's president he'll have it'll be a
 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.860
Obama's president he'll have it'll be a
vexing issue about what to do if there's

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870
vexing issue about what to do if there's
 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.970
vexing issue about what to do if there's
something that starts to look like

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980
something that starts to look like
 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.420
something that starts to look like
ethnic cleansing going on but the legal

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430
ethnic cleansing going on but the legal
 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.360
ethnic cleansing going on but the legal
issues would be exactly the same
