00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.460
Welcome to our strength
test, bladesmiths.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm gonna to take your blades
and beat them repeatedly

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.960
into these railroad spikes.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.380
I want to see what the spikes
are going to do to your blades.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.290
John, you're up first.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.880
You ready?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.540
I'm nervous as hell.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.460
My knives are thinner
than the others.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.000
So I don't know if I can hang.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.250
[beating, grunting]

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.750
(WHISPERING) Holy crap.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.750
No kidding.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.500
Well, John, not bad.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.880
You got a little edge
damage, a little deformation,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.580
a little too soft on this one.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.750
This edge, not bad,
a little brittle.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.750
This one held up the best.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.580
Overall, you survived
the strength test.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.500
Nicely done.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.380
Thank you.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.210
Duane, how you feeling?

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.750
Let's do it.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.040
[beating]

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.790
[exhales out]

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.380
All right, guys.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.880
All right, Duane.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.120
We got a bit of a problem here.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.420
The edges on your blades
aren't as hard as we hoped.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.960
We don't have chipping.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.290
The steel is actually
compacted in on itself.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.710
Drew.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.920
You're up.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.790
How do you feel?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.620
- Nervous.
- Nervous?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.580
That's all right.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.710
I'll be over in a minute.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.620
I'm completely
distraught inside.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.460
I'm trying to calm myself down,
doing some deep breathing,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.330
and I'm just stressed
out like crazy.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.670
[beating, grunting]

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.670
All right, Drew, your
blades are actually

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.960
very comfortable, except for one
point, these hooks back here.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.170
There's sharp corners on
there, and that actually

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.960
built bit Dave's hand here.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.250
Right here.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.500
The edges took some damage.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.670
For the most part, your
blades held up well.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.620
So good job.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.670
Thank you.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.330
All right, bladesmiths, it's
time to see what kind of edge

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.000
your blade still have.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.080
A sharp edge should cut easily.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.830
A rolled edge, it might snag,
or worse do nothing at all.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.710
John, you're up first.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.710
You ready for this?

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.500
I'm ready as I can be.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.290
[slashing noises]

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.040
All right, John,
all your blades

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.380
have areas that are
sharp and some areas

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.170
that aren't as sharp.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.880
On the inside of the
canvas, your blades cut.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.170
But on the thick edges, they
had a hard time cutting through.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.290
But all your blades will cut.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.330
Thank you, sir.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.330
All right, Duane, your turn.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.500
You ready?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.620
Let's do it.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.420
[slashing noises]

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.250
All right, Duane, overall,
there's a lot of damage

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.080
in all the edges, and it shows.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.330
Your blades pretty much hang
up and rip into the canvas.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.830
They didn't cut.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.830
Overall, your blades will rip.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.750
All right, Drew, your turn.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.420
You ready?

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.250
Yes, sir.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.580
[slashing noises]

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.620
All right, Drew, there
are some areas here

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.460
that are damaged, and
it's exactly those areas

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.580
that hung up on the canvas.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.040
But overall, your
blades here will cut.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.460
Thank you.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.960
Bladesmiths, for one of
you, your journey stops

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.620
dead in the tracks right here.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.790
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is Duane.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.210
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.420
Yeah, Duane, though I
like the diversity of blades

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.420
you made for us, your
knives suffered the most

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.080
damage in the strength test.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.500
And that was really made
apparent in the sharpness test.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.120
So that's why we're
letting you go.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.170
Duane, please
surrender your blades.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.670
I'm pretty disappointed,
but I'm going to go

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.750
home with my head held high.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.620
I'm very happy with what
I've accomplished here.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.830
I'm looking forward to getting
back out in the shop with Dad

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
and working on some knives.
