MALE SPEAKER: Action.

00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:03.952
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:04.940
My name is Brian Fitzpatrick.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.014
Most people call me Fitz.

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:07.904
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
My name is Ben.

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.880
And we are in a new
location today.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.362
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We're in
a new location with Google

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:11.856
Develop for Good.

00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:14.820
And we've got some more people
to talk to you about it.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.290
So let's get our first guest.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.772
Hi, what's your name?

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:20.254
CAROLYN WENDELL: My name's
Carolyn Wendell.

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:21.736
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And where
do you work at, Carolyn?

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:23.218
CAROLYN WENDELL: I work at
Google for Nonprofits.

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:25.070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And you'll
tell us a little bit

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.194
more about this?

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:26.182
CAROLYN WENDELL: Yeah, sure.

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:27.432
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:31.616
MALE SPEAKER: We've
got to start over.

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:34.086
Can we change their line?

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:35.290
CAROLYN WENDELL: --streamline
their internal

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.780
operations as well.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.970
And Google for Nonprofits, the
way that we really do this is

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.950
by providing nonprofits with
special tools to help them.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.270
And so we provide them with
Google products either free of

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.570
charge, or sometimes
at reduced cost.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.840
And so for example, one thing
that we have is the Google for

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.980
Nonprofits program.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.370
And this allows US nonprofits to
really apply to a program,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.200
where they have access
to exclusive

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.069
nonprofit product benefits.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.990
So for example, a nonprofit
could use Google Apps free of

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.560
charge for up to 3,000 users.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.140
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Wow.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.610
CAROLYN WENDELL: Yeah.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.810
And they get premium Geo Tools
as well, such as Google Maps

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.850
API Premier, or Google
Earth Pro, for free.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.390
We also offer Google AdWords
advertising, and some special

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.240
YouTube features, as well,
for nonprofits.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.350
And that's all through the
Google for Nonprofits program.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.620
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So you guys
are all out to basically help

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.830
nonprofits and save
them money.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.750
CAROLYN WENDELL:
Yeah, exactly.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.940
And if they want to apply to
the Google for Nonprofits

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.060
program, it's really easy.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.310
You just have to go to
google.com/nonprofits.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.060
If you're a US nonprofit,
you can apply there.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.780
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And is that
like for 501(c)(3)s?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.470
CAROLYN WENDELL: Exactly, yes.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.040
You have to be a 501(c)(3).

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.650
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So what is
the motivation for having a

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.790
booth here at our developer
conference today?

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.780
CAROLYN WENDELL: Oh, well, thank
you for asking that.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.170
We're so excited to be here at
I/O today, because we all know

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.560
that developers want
to do good.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.800
And we've had developers come up
to us who already have been

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.300
engaging with their nonprofits
in their local communities.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.970
And really, we're here at I/O
just to learn more from

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.260
developers about what sort of
engagement they'd like to have

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.490
with nonprofits.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.250
So if you're out there, and
you're interested in talking

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.340
to us about how you have helped
nonprofits, or maybe

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.430
how you might want to get
involved more in the future,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.790
we'd love to come up
and hear from you.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.710
We also are here because we
really want help promoting the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.140
Google for Nonprofits and Google
for Nonprofits program,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.920
and helping to educate other
nonprofits that you may know

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.060
about about our program, and
about how Google can help you

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.130
and help their cause.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.980
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So if
people out there in

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.370
internet-land want to know
more, where do they go?

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.540
CAROLYN WENDELL: Where should
they go if they want to know

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.970
more about Google
for Nonprofits?

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.950
Google.com/nonprofits, that's
where they want to go.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.030
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's fabulous.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.920
Thanks so much for your time.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.300
It was great having you on.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.945
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Wonderful.

00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:43.070
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Take care.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.510
Have a great conference.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.000
CAROLYN WENDELL: Thank
you, guys.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.520
Bye.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.135
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Bye, bye.

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:46.330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Let's
grab another person here.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.870
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have
another person here.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.450
All right, who do
we have here?

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.670
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Hello.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.870
What is your name?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.100
TANYA BIRCH: My name
is Tanya Birch.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.590
And I work on the Google
Earth Outreach team.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.640
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And tell
me a little bit more

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.690
about what is that.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.090
What is Google Earth Outreach?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.930
TANYA BIRCH: Yeah, so Google
Earth Outreach is a team

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.310
underneath the Geo, underneath
Google Earth.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.380
We help nonprofits solve the
world's most pressing problems

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.460
using Google's mapping
technologies, whether it's in

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.010
the environmental sector, or
humanitarian, or crisis

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.440
response, or any
kind of sector.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.770
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Does this
involve working with a lot of

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.350
governments, then, I assume?

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.300
Or making--

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.490
Or is it-- ?

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.270
TANYA BIRCH: It's
more nonprofits

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.820
that are on the ground--

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.480
similar to what Carolyn
was talking about--

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.300
that are really implementing
solutions for environmental

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.320
issues, or humanitarian
issues on the ground.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.190
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So
what brings you guys

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.600
here to Google I/O?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.580
What are you looking for
from developers?

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.240
TANYA BIRCH: I'm really excited
to be here at Google

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.380
I/O because we get a lot of
nonprofits who are always

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.360
coming to us, asking for help
creating interesting mapping

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.660
visualizations.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.710
And we have a couple things.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.190
We have a Developer
Grants program.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.890
We also offer software
grants to nonprofits.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.620
But we really, mainly, just
want to connect with

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.540
developers, because we know so
many NGOs that are out there

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.140
that need help building
their maps.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.190
And so we want to put
the two together.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.070
We have a Developer Marketplace
for nonprofits to

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.440
go and find developers.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.980
It's sort of like a matchmaking
service, right?

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.440
If you're a developer,
and you want to do

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.829
something that's for good--

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.730
instead of for the man, or
whatever-- then you can list

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.500
yourself on the Developer
Marketplace.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.470
And our URL is
earth.google.com/outreach.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.970
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Do you have
any particular examples

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.590
or success stories that
you can share with us?

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.890
TANYA BIRCH: Yeah, I do.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.710
Let's see.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.820
Probably my favorite one is, I
was just last week at Rio+20.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.480
And the Surui Amazon indigenous
tribe launched

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.120
their cultural map.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.090
So this is a tribe in the
Amazon Rainforest.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.890
And they're struggling to
protect their land from

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.160
deforestation.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.560
And also, they want to preserve
their culture in a

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.940
mapping environment.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.090
They've created this cultural
map that's right now only on

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.700
big PDF version.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.420
It's beautiful, but it's hanging
in their office.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.490
So they created this cultural
map, that is now in Google

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.980
Earth, that everybody can see.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.610
And they're also using Android
smartphones to engage, to

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.050
measure the carbon of their
trees in their rainforest, and

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.090
preserve their forest for
future generations.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.190
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And so
developers can join in and

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.920
help make that happen?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.840
TANYA BIRCH: Organizations
like that are looking for

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.780
developers, exactly.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Sounds like a

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.150
great way to get connected.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.110
Wow, fantastic.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.080
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And what's
your second favorite?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.360
Name one more.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.430
I'll make you pick your favorite
children here.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.680
TANYA BIRCH: It's tough, because
there are so many.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.490
But probably my second favorite
is WWF and Eyes on

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.110
the Forest.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.210
And they just launched
a Google Maps

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.840
Engine powered map.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.940
It's eyesontheforest.or.id.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.410
And it basically tracks rates
of deforestation, historical

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.430
rates of deforestation, in
Sumatera, and compares it to

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.770
animal habitats, like
rhinoceros, tiger, orangutan.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.890
And you can see how as the
forest, the habitat, shrinks,

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.560
the ranges of the animals
shrink as well.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.810
So it's eyesontheforest.or.id.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.370
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And have you
gotten a lot of interest

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.255
here at the I/O from people
you've been meeting at the

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:20.520
booth today?

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.320
TANYA BIRCH: Yeah, I mean, we
have a very, very close

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.910
relationship with both
developers and both the

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.400
nonprofits who we work with.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.740
So it's great to be here,
because there's a lot of

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.990
excitement.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.370
And we have, actually, a talk
tomorrow, "Maps for Good,"

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.410
where we're going to have two
of the developers who were

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.000
awarded Developer
Grants last year

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.320
speaking about their projects.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.560
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's fabulous.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.950
So one last time, let's give
the URL, so everybody knows

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.110
where to go so they
can help out.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.050
Because they're going to
do this right now.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.720
TANYA BIRCH: It's
earth.google.com/outreach.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.290
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Excellent.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.190
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Thank you so much.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.600
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Thanks so much.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.330
It's great meeting you.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.820
All right.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.880
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All right,
who else is here?

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.550
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
OK, number three.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.670
Here we go.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.250
So who do we have here?

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.090
CHRISTIAAN ADAMS: Hi, my name's
Christiaan Adams.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.230
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And what
do you do, Christiaan?

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.610
CHRISTIAAN ADAMS: I'm with the
Crisis Response team out of

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.470
google.org.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.880
And we are here talking to
developers about the various

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.390
tools that we make available to
help get information out in

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.645
times of crisis.

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.870
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: All right, so
tell us a little more about

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.060
what Crisis Response does.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.450
Exactly how do you guys work?

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.220
CHRISTIAAN ADAMS: Sure.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.430
So when a disaster happens--

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.670
an earthquake, or a flood,
or a tornado, or

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.760
something like that--

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.830
the people affected, one
of their big needs is

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.030
information, like, where's
my family?

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.120
Are they OK?

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.860
Where are the shelters?

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.870
Do I need to evacuate?

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.370
If so, where?

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.820
And when people are looking for
information, they tend to

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.260
come to Google, because we're
pretty good at information.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.310
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have
a search engine.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.390
CHRISTIAAN ADAMS: Yeah, we do.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.280
And so we're trying to make the
kind of information that

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.970
people look for during times
of crisis easier to find,

00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.950
access, and use.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.520
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now, you
were giving me an example

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.280
earlier about New York City,
about just sometimes there's a

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.380
lack of serving power to
get information out.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.110
Can you tell me a little
more about that?

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.130
CHRISTIAAN ADAMS: Sure.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.350
When Hurricane Irene went up
the East Coast last year,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.910
there were evacuation
maps that were--

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.590
I believe it was a 10 megabyte
PDF on somebody's website.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.410
And of course, that server
didn't stand up very well to

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.240
the millions of people who were
trying to access that

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.710
information at that time.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:34.679
So we helped by adding that map
information to one of our

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.909
tools, which is our Crisis
Mapping tool, and combined it

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.520
with many other layers, like the
radar, and the clouds, and

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.840
the evacuation routes, and the
flood stages from the USGS,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.130
and a whole bunch of other
layers, and made that

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.440
available both through our
website, and made it easy for

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.730
the city to embed on their
website, and for news agencies

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.770
to embed on their websites.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.990
And because it's running on our
data centers, we didn't

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.500
have a problem with the large
amount of users, the large

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.970
spike of users that you get
during those times.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.375
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Wow,
that's incredible.

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:09.410
CHRISTIAAN ADAMS: Yeah, we're
here talking to developers

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.320
about all those different tools,
and talking about the

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.870
open standards and the
web-friendly scalable data

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.080
formats that we encourage people
to publish data in, so

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.460
that they can be shared
and made accessible

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.980
during crisis times.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.740
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So how
can developers help out?

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.010
What can they do to help?

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.270
CHRISTIAAN ADAMS: So we touched
on our mapping tools.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.150
They can publish things in
formats such as KML, or using

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.110
some of Google Tools, such as
Fusion Tables, or our new Maps

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.650
Engine tools.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.710
And those are all ways to
publish map data in a way that

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.640
scales well, that can handle
the load, and that is

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.470
web-friendly.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.400
Our maps work across mobile
and desktop seamlessly.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.690
People can access them on the
go, because they may not be in

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.060
front of their desktop
when they're

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.530
responding to a disaster.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.470
And we also have things like
our Person Finder tool.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.900
So we have an open format there
that has helped bring

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.230
together the missing
persons databases.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.300
And so that if you're looking
to see where your family is,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.810
or if they're OK, or you want
to let your family know that

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.920
you're OK, there's one place you
can go in Person Finder to

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.040
share that information.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.830
We encourage developers to use
that open source tool to

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.030
implement that and use the
open format there.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.320
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So you guys
are talking about bringing

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.100
people together in crisis,
and saving

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.260
families, and saving lives.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.640
I mean, this is really
important stuff.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But then
harvesting developers' power

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.200
to provide that information
into Google systems.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.550
And it's really fantastic.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.320
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So if
I'm a developer out

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.650
there, how can I help?

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.815
Where do I go?

00:10:38.815 --> 00:10:40.530
CHRISTIAAN ADAMS: You can
check out our website.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.130
It's google.org/crisisresponse.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.500
You'll see our various tools
up there, a whole list of

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.070
tools that responders can use,
tools for people impacted by

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.370
disasters, and links to some
of our previous responses.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.190
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: That
sounds really awesome.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.430
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All right.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.650
Thank you.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.410
Thank you so much.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.800
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Another
place for everyone to go.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.050
Thanks a lot.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.740
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Wonderful,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.620
one more person here.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.890
So what is your name?

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.070
FIONA LEE: My name's
Fiona Lee.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.310
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And what
do you work on, Fiona?

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.370
FIONA LEE: I work
on the Emerging

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.310
Markets team in Google.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.310
Basically, we work on places
like Latin America,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.620
Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East,
North Africa, India, and

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.390
Southeast Asia.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.230
So the developing parts
of the world.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.700
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And you're
here at I/O for Android for

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.530
Good, is that right?

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:23.910
FIONA LEE: That's correct.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.830
Android for Good is a
donation program.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.150
The goal is to reuse Android
phones by donating them to

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.850
nonprofits and to educational
institutions, so universities

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.570
in emerging markets.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.950
If you have a working Android
phone and it is unlocked, you

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.170
should drop it off at the
Android for Good booth at I/O.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.250
We also collect them
from Googlers from

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.420
offices around the world.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.180
And we take the phones, we
wipe them of personal

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.850
information, we test
them to make sure

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.030
everything's working.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.590
And then we donate them to
nonprofits that will use them

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.680
in the field, or to educational
institutions in

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.200
Africa, mostly, to teach
Android programming.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.180
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And
how has this program

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.970
worked out so far?

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.630
Do you have any interesting
stories?

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.500
FIONA LEE: So we've had
two full years.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.200
This is our third year.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.680
We've collected about
450 phones.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.510
And they were valued at probably
$400, $500 a piece

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.510
when they were donated.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.860
So do the math.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.110
A variety of nonprofits have
gotten those phones.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.310
Probably the one that is closest
to my heart is one

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.600
called V-Day, which
is a nonprofit

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.130
founded by Eve Ensler.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.350
She's a playwright
and activist.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.260
She wrote The Vagina
Monologues.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.540
I don't know if you can
say that on the air.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:29.990
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's
the internet.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.200
It's OK.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.170
FIONA LEE: OK, so they use those
phones and work with

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.570
Panzi Hospital in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.670
In the DRC, rape is a really
huge problem for women.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.570
And so this hospital does a
lot of work with women who

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.140
have been raped.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.020
And they use the phones and
document the stories of the

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.860
rape, and to capture the history
so that if there

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.400
should ever be a time when
justice is served, and we have

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.370
trials, the perpetrators can
be brought to justice.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.010
So that's probably my favorite
use of the phone,

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:57.900
the donation program.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.100
The second one is--

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.430
and this one has scaled
really, really well--

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.230
a nonprofit called VETAID that
works in Kenya and Tanzania.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.870
They use the phones to basically
track animal disease

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.780
and vaccination programs.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.955
And they use a data collection
tool called EpiCollect.

00:13:13.955 --> 00:13:15.550
It's built on top
of App Engine.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.100
It's open source.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.950
And they do a lot of work
to track droughts.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.600
For example, when Kenya had a
really bad drought last year,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.670
they tracked all that because,
for people in the Rift Valley,

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.630
your animals are your
livelihood.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.490
It's been so successful that
the Food and Agriculture

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.020
Organization, Veterinarians
Without Frontiers, the Gates

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.980
Foundation are now using this
tool to do animal surveillance

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.320
and disease monitoring
for all of Africa.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.090
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So
you're saying, any

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.140
Android unlocked phone.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.790
So I've got an old unlocked G1
that's like 50 years old.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.790
Could you guys do anything
with that?

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.510
FIONA LEE: I would prefer to
have more recent phones.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.970
But if they're unlocked and they
work, and you have the

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.310
charger, hand it over.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.630
And we don't have a website,
unfortunately.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.480
This is a 20% project and a
labor of love with a lot of

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.350
help from other Googlers.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.976
So you can just email me,
flee@google.com--

00:14:08.976 --> 00:14:10.650
flee@google.com.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.920
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: OK,
so that's great.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.710
I mean, that sounds
really good.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.460
450 phones, and you've just been
working like 20% time?

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:16.970
FIONA LEE: Yeah.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.830
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So this is
you and some other engineers,

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.280
and other folks, or other
companies within the company?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.830
FIONA LEE: We have points of
contact in all the Google

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.260
offices around the world.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.880
And so this is a team effort.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.600
And then we use a local company
here to wipe the data,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.930
and to donate it and
all that stuff.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:31.970
So it's all above board.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.690
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: All right,
so if anyone out there has a

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.770
phone that they wanted to give
to Android for Good, they can

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.820
email flee--

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.960
flee@google.com.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.870
And you will make sure that
it gets somewhere and does

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.420
something good.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.800
Is that right?

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.560
FIONA LEE: You got it, yep.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.735
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: That's
fabulous, excellent.

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:45.960
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
It's fantastic.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.680
Thank you so much.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.780
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Wow,
this is amazing.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.430
15 minutes of four incredible
projects

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.790
that people are doing.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.260
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: If you are
a developer, you can make

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.770
a real impact on the world,
not just make money.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.350
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Not
just work for the--

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.810
I think Tanya said, work
for the man, right?

00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:59.670
Like we do.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.952
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I
resemble that remark.

00:15:01.952 --> 00:15:02.440
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's great.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.140
Well, I think now we're
going to wrap up.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.630
And we're going to turn things
back over to the next session.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.160
We'll see you guys, I think, in
another hour or so, when we

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.035
have some other interesting
people to talk to.

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:11.880
See you then.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.490
Thanks a lot.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:12.590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Bye, bye

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.840
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Bye, bye.
