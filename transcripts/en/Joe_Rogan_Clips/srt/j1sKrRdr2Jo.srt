1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,870
The Joe Rogan experience.
Just as a reminder,

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,290
I want to give props to American
airlines for returning my luggage. Oh,

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,950
after the whole weekend and they missed
that fucking half ounce of weed in my

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:15,900
boxing glove. So you're the
delivery driver. You were dumb.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,680
Fuck that. They lost my
movie tie bag. They did.

6
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:22,860
I was going to Columbus to go to the
short movie thigh and I brought in the uh,

7
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,160
you know my little fucking shin
pads and my gloves is some ad raps.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,490
He'd been doing that a lot lately. Huh?
More than I love it. It's great. Right?

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,170
I go twice a week. Well I've had, I'm 56,

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,050
the targets that thing and I take
the class where everybody else,

11
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,540
I do everything else. I die
and I go don't want boxing.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,870
Cause Tuesday and Wednesday,
Tuesday and Thursdays boxing.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,670
Now when you do the class,
did they have you spar?

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,750
I'm 56 cause I light no
headgear. Tapping pop. Yeah,

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,980
working in a combination shit like
that. Saturday, Sundays I go in,

16
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:57,390
there's an open mat. If I'm home,

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:02,160
I go on in is a chick that's
like an ice cop, an ice cop.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,170
Oh no. You know she's, she's
a tough chick. Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,650
She trains for Brett and the whole thing.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,680
If I go down and just let her beat
me up to death. Let me ask you this.

21
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,660
As someone who was born
in another country,

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,890
how do you think that they should
handle the immigrations that are here?

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,670
Because this is the big question. A
lot of people know people that are,

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,020
I mean probably a lot of people listening
know someone who they love that's

25
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:25,770
illegal.

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,070
Whether they're illegal from Canada or
they're illegal from Europe or they're

27
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,480
illegal from Mexico, where the fuck,

28
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,030
there's a lot of people that get over
here and stay over here that aren't

29
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:36,660
supposed to be. Some of them turn
out, turn out to be amazing people.

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,150
So how do you decide,

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,510
how do you decide who gets to say and to
someone coming over here and trying to

32
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,440
make their life better? A better
thing, but just doing it illegally.

33
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,640
Does that automatically discount them
from staying here? That seems crazy.

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,533
What if they're great.

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,860
There's a lot of people come over here
because they were super unfortunate and

36
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,450
where they were born, they, they,

37
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,630
they grew up in a shitty place
and they wanted to make it better,

38
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:01,500
but they didn't know how to do it.

39
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:04,500
So they came over to
America by hook or by crook.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,140
They figured out how to get here. They
got here and now they're kicking ass.

41
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,210
Why? Why would you want
to get rid of them?

42
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,570
As long as they're not
criminals that hurting anybody.

43
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,510
Why would you want to get rid of
them? Well, start is, let's do this.

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,640
That's what's going on right now.

45
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:22,470
Just points the finger
at a certain realm of,

46
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,580
Oh, you're pointing the finger South
of the border. Yeah. It's Canadian.

47
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,880
A lot of Canadian. Which, and I'm
not saying nothing bad about anybody.

48
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:32,880
This is the United States of America.
People come here to fucking have a dream.

49
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,600
Yeah. And whatever happens, bro,
sometimes a dream goes caput. You know,

50
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,710
when I went to New York,

51
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,420
I spent three weeks in New York and I
Ubered and I did a little thing in my

52
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:44,610
mind, you know, I took 20 Ubers.

53
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,060
In fact I became Uber platinum
because I was doing, you know,

54
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:51,900
all of these rides, not one
white person picked me up,

55
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,880
not one time. And guess
what? I asked questions,

56
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,700
I asked everybody questions
and the most inspiring

57
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,960
person I met was one that I worked
though. I rapped at six 30 in the morning.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,830
There was no way I was getting in the
van to go home and I just called Uber.

59
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,930
I was Ridgewood, Brooklyn and
this Indian girl picked me up.

60
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,320
Very cute, you know, six
in the fucking morning,

61
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,120
it's still kind of dark out, you
know, five 30 whatever it was.

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,250
And this little girl that
weighed 90 pounds picked me
up, got in the car, hello?

63
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,280
We have charger in the back if you want
to charge your car and there's little

64
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,570
caramels in the front, you know.
And I said, where are you from?

65
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,990
And she told me India and I go, how long
have you been here? A year and a half.

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,370
Spoke perfect English.
Wow. I go, why do you,

67
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,720
why did you become a little bit drive?

68
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,410
But she doesn't became Uber driver
because I was a wasted something Indian

69
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:52,000
restaurant and the guy abused me and he
would only pay me eight bucks an hour

70
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,680
and take half my tips. So me
and my cousins got together.

71
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:00,820
We put away money and we
rent a car. We leased a car,

72
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,860
my S she drives in the daytime
and I drive with at night. Wow.

73
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,180
And I drag on, why do you, aren't you
scared to go? I at? And she's like, no.

74
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,630
She's like, I love it because
there's no traffic in it.

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,750
Mm. I go, what do you walk with? I just
asked her creepy questions. Not sad.

76
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,070
Yeah. And it was, I went, I gave her
an extra tip like, let me see this.

77
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,630
Can you be illegal and do that?

78
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,680
Did they check your citizenship? I, I
don't know what the status was with her.

79
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,470
I didn't ask her. I didn't know if she
made me any, but what do you think?

80
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:36,940
Do you think that you could
do that? Do you think?

81
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:39,580
Like if you came from another car,
you came from Guatemala illegally,

82
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:44,390
you were came over here though and became
an Uber driver. Could you do that? Me?

83
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,090
No. Can anybody do that or did
they check your citizenship?

84
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
What do you think Jamie?

85
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,260
There's, yes, they can do that.

86
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,070
So someone definitely can come over
here and start working for Uber or,

87
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,150
or another or a similar, yeah.

88
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,020
I'm not saying that I'm
doing that necessarily,

89
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:01,500
like through the proper ways that
you can, if you have a legal friend,

90
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,360
you can use their license to be the,

91
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,880
like the Uber thing and they
don't know who's behind the car.

92
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,560
So it happens all the time.
When I'm ordering food,

93
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,210
you will, you definitely have to have
a valid driver's license, right? Yeah.

94
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,970
When you get a valid driver's
license, if you're illegal.

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,690
Oh, that's the part. Like,
so I'm saying so like, no,

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,540
but that doesn't stop someone from
getting behind a car if you don't have a

97
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,740
license any day.

98
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,450
That's sort of where I'm going with
someone to getting in trouble right now is

99
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,800
on we on the shit list because we
agreed in somebody else to give illegals

100
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:31,020
licenses. That's why I was asking,

101
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,790
there was a thought that popped a memory
that popped into my head about some

102
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,624
story like that,

103
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,410
that they were going to give a
illegal aliens the right to drive.

104
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,220
I'm sort of saying like ed does happen
but not above the board basically.

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,330
Cause it's, yeah, but are you sure?

106
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,720
Could you see if they're trying to
give illegal aliens driver's licenses?

107
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,850
Cause I remember a story
like this too as well.

108
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,540
People were super upset
about it. It's a weird man.

109
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,100
13

110
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,990
States that allow it. There you go,
baby. Where do you have to move? What are

111
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,903
those States in DC?

112
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,010
Uh, California is the first one
as of 2013 Colorado, Connecticut,

113
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:13,890
Delaware, everywhere. Their
suite. Hawaii, Illinois,

114
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,010
Maryland, Nevada, New
Mexico. Your interests.

115
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,930
Yeah, everywhere. There's weed.

116
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,180
Hawaii doesn't necessarily have Vermont.

117
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,620
I think Hawaii is very close
to that business standpoint.

118
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,670
They work for cheaper and work
harder than, you know. I mean,

119
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:33,930
there's so many benefits to as a
business owner and different, I mean,

120
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,500
when was the last time you saw
a white laborer? You see him,

121
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,150
you go in the kitchen and at any
restaurant it's all you know.

122
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,100
I mean, and so now you, now you,

123
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,230
you questioning what rights you
have as an American. You come here,

124
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,560
you got a job, you're working
hard, you stay out of trouble,

125
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,350
you stay out of trouble, you mind your
business, you know, I mean, I grew up,

126
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,520
you and I grew up in the East coast
where you go to a Chinese restaurant and

127
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,953
you'd see them,

128
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,070
the husband and wife working and the
kids would be doing homework at the back

129
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:11,790
table. And if you came in the
daytime, it was a different couple,

130
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,610
which is telling me that
two couples got together,

131
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,590
they buy a home and they opened a
business together and they work together.

132
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:21,630
That's what those immigrant groups do.

133
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,930
And then from there they bring
a cousin and they open the open.

134
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,921
And next thing you know,

135
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:30,210
they got three houses on the block and
now he just had a fucking immigrant

136
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:33,900
family move into your neighborhood.
Not necessarily good or bad.

137
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,110
You know what I'm saying? That that nice.
We all had them in our neighborhoods.

138
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,290
Sure. I remember 70 years ago,
this is your grandparents,

139
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,690
so you have to think
about your grandparents.

140
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,560
How would you want them to treat it?
I'm sure your grandpa father got a job,

141
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:49,410
lame Rick way before he
got his immigration papers.

142
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,100
I don't know how they did it right.
I think they got it pretty quick.

143
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,010
You get through Ellis Island
and they push boy shoot drew.

144
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,450
I mean the legal situation, it
was a different world back then.

145
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,220
You could immigrate pretty easily.

146
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,610
Like my grandparents weren't rocket
scientists when they came over here.

147
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,450
They were kids. They're there,
their parents weren't geniuses.

148
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,890
Do you know what's going on with farmers?

149
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,970
Do you know what's going on in South
America right now? Nicaragua, Honduras,

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,230
all those places. Pure hell, pure hell.

151
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,370
You know, I can't be mad at you for
wanting to get the fuck out of there,

152
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,950
but there's other places
on earth right now. Well,

153
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:30,000
this PO fucking hell going on. Yeah,
there's places trying to come over to,

154
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,720
let's point everybody out. Let's
lock all the fucking borders.

155
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,310
Don't make it seem like it's just
Mexico. That's the fucking problem.

156
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
You know, we're getting
bombarded from everywhere.

157
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,440
We'll get new people in here every day
from everywhere. I ain't mad at it.

158
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,900
They come in here to make better lives,

159
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,390
but don't just keep pointing
the fucking water that you know.

160
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,310
Who else is coming through that Mexican
border that nobody's about. Jamie,

161
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,430
when you get a minute, if you'd
love to check it, just to verify me.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,450
You know how many Cubans and getting sent
back to cube on a daily basis from New

163
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,430
Mexico? Really getting back to go shot.

164
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,470
But Cubans when they come to a why they're
not coming through, they're closed,

165
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:14,250
all that type of shit. What? So right
now you can't come through Miami.

166
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,020
It's easier to come. Go from Cuba
to Mexico and just join the walk.

167
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,150
Whoa. And walk up. But once that happens
are in America, we give them asylum.

168
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,740
Right? Right. The tag. But does that still
going on? I think RO Bama removed it.

169
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,270
Did he really? Yes.

170
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,040
Trump made it so we can't go over there
and then you go [inaudible] pack Mexican

171
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,090
shelters hoping people
are going through Mexico.

172
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,420
That's crazy. I think I the
lumber a couple of weeks ago,

173
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:46,500
I think 900 Cubans are getting
sent back weekly to get shot.

174
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,900
Does you think more people,

175
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,520
more people or make it towards the border
since Trump was like, build that wall,

176
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:54,300
build that wall.

177
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,330
Do you think more people are headed
towards the border now because it's just

178
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,570
like it's a popular thing to
do. It's a part of our culture.

179
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,750
A part of the conversation
is the border wall, right?

180
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,020
Like do you want a border wall or do you
not want to build that wall and make it

181
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:10,080
a fucking million feet high, bring
it right to that top of the earth.

182
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,110
Or are you one of those people that
thinks anybody should be able to come over

183
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,940
here and have a better
life? You know, and this,

184
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,510
those two ideas of fucking
clashing left and right.

185
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,020
Some people think that people
should be able to try to do better,

186
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,360
try to better themselves. They
should have the opportunity.

187
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,750
And then some people think, fuck
them, you were born somewhere else.

188
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,490
You don't ever get a chance
to come over here, go,

189
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,800
go in through proper channels,
which is almost impossible.

190
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,550
Do something that's very valuable to
us over here. See, that's the thing.

191
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,690
Like if you're a person who has
some extraordinary skill, you know,

192
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,050
you could probably get American
citizenship easier, you know, unusual.

193
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,590
If you contributing to the
physics department at Harvard
or something like that

194
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,290
and you're, you know, you were
born in Germany or wherever,

195
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,670
you probably get citizenship a little
bit quicker than you're just a guy who

196
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:54,960
like lives in Guatemalan,

197
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,860
wants to come to America because
he thinks he can advance his life.

198
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,740
You think he can get better,
whereas where he lives, there's no,

199
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,060
you can't go anywhere. You're
stuck. The poverty is extreme.

200
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,410
The crimes extreme and he wants
none of that. He wants to do better.

201
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,340
So he makes it over here. I'm like,
listen, when you talk about immigration,

202
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,310
you're going to get good and
bad from every show. You know,

203
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:22,311
Castro was 79 opened up this prisons in
the Mario and you got 100,000 Cubans and

204
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,370
I'm like a thousand fucking spoiled rotten
savages from Cuban prisons where they

205
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,940
were no clothes and this,

206
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,880
they have to shit in a hole in the
middle of the floor. This averages,

207
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,600
they're animals.

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,140
They got no problem taking your
life from a piece of toilet paper.

209
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,650
But the same one's true
from other countries.

210
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,710
We get the good and the bad
from other country, you know,

211
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,900
let's not beat around the Bush before
Russians come here, they got a course,

212
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,860
they go to a school and to take the 12
week course on how to come and get money

213
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:58,270
right off the bat. How did I go to
social security? Check that out, Jamie.

214
00:11:58,271 --> 00:11:59,560
That's a very weird one.

215
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
They get taught how to come
here and scam the system.

216
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,600
Whether you want to call a scan,
I'm not putting nobody down.

217
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,630
I have a tons of Russian friends. I
love them. I'm not saying them bad,

218
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,540
but I've heard that's a fact.
I've heard them from them.

219
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:18,180
I have a friend who's married and she
told me one day that before they come

220
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,370
here, they'd take a course to
prep them on how to get money.

221
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,540
As soon as they land, three days
after they get them, they land.

222
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,190
They get caching and Dola
paperwork. What to say?

223
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,750
They coach. That's hilarious. It's
like a service that they offer. Yeah.

224
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,710
Some type of class, the system works, but,

225
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
but if you want to send the system,
they'll tell you how to do it.

226
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,220
That's how many Armenians come
over. Come over, get citizenship.

227
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,353
Guess what they do?

228
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,600
They get social security and they move
back to our meeting and they get the

229
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:53,890
check sent back to our media. They
have a system on how to do that.

230
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,990
They've got a thousand loopholes now,
brother. And if you learn those loopholes,

231
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,400
you could cave the fucking system.

232
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,680
There's nothing wrong with having a
group of people that all agree on certain

233
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,200
rules, right. Which is what
the United States should be.

234
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,770
But the problem with having
a group of people is you,

235
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:12,760
you don't get to pick
like who's in that group.

236
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,210
So you just deciding instead of being
admitted by your merit or how how good a

237
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:21,730
neighbor you are or how nice of
a person you are. Now you just,

238
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,150
whether or not you were
born on the dirt like that,

239
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,030
were you born on this dirt or that
dirt cause you're born on that dirt.

240
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,890
You can't stay. But if
you're born on this dirt,

241
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,860
even if you're a shit human
being, you get to hang out,

242
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,080
you get to ruin other people's
lives while you're here.

243
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,900
As long as you don't do enough
that we need to put you in a cage.

244
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,310
And then if we do,

245
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:41,200
we keep you for a couple of years
and let you out and you do more.

246
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,370
I mean this is, we have no problem
with that. I don't know what, uh,

247
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,540
what the percentage is. What
the fuck was I going? I dunno.

248
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,620
I almost thought it was what you said
is a good people versus bad people that

249
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:58,210
come in to across the
border. The thing is,

250
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,010
every time there's a bad one
that comes across the border,

251
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:03,790
it's highlighted as an example of why we
got to keep the border closed and they

252
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,220
have a point. They all
have a point. Absolutely.

253
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,190
When you see someone who is
talking about illegal gang members,

254
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,500
they're sneaking across the
border and murdering people,

255
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:15,460
it absolutely has happened. It's
100% of a real thing. This is not,

256
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,060
not fiction questions. How
much does it happen? And uh,

257
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,570
how much better is it for those
people's lives that make it across?

258
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,620
Is there a way to screen better to make
sure that the bad people don't come in

259
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,230
and all of these questions
are legitimate. You know,

260
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:32,770
you don't want a bunch of fucking evil
vicious people from another country in

261
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,380
your neighborhood. That's how everybody
feels. You don't want your children,

262
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:39,070
your family to be in danger because
someone's knock across the border and they

263
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:42,040
have a long history of working
for the cartel, murdering people.

264
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,290
That's a real thing.
That's a real possibility.

265
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,200
So all the people that are vigilant, all
the people that are scared, you know,

266
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,350
they're probably smart to be scared.
Look at fucking human history.

267
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,280
People are capable of doing some awful

268
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,180
shit. No one's saying I'm not. I
don't think there should be no,

269
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,320
no wall at all. Nothing stopping
people from coming across.

270
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,290
You definitely don't want
pieces of shit coming over here.

271
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,880
That's how I find out. Did you ever
notice that? Maybe we'll full. Yeah,

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,330
we're probably, maybe we'll fall.
Did you notice that when you go on,

273
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,100
there's homeless people on Ventura
fucking Boulevard on Lankershim Boulevard

274
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:19,970
under bridges everywhere. Has that ever
come to your mind that a way you go,

275
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,930
there's cars everywhere and the
between Uber and Lyft and cabs,

276
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:27,890
now there's trafficking. Every major
fucking city. There's lock or whatever.

277
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,210
Did you give notice that?

278
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:33,290
Maybe it's not that I hate Cubans or
Mexicans or Puerto Ricans or blacks and

279
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,470
Germans. Irish maybe
that will fucking fall.

280
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:40,070
Have you ever come to that conclusion?
Yeah, we're just full right now. Yeah.

281
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,480
We have to take five years off. Like I
would accept that. I would accept that.

282
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:47,360
I would accept special circumstances,

283
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:51,470
like why are you have family
here? But at this point right now,

284
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,380
we'll fucking fall. We'll fall.

285
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,660
We don't have nowhere else to put anymore.

286
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,020
We really don't look at eddies unless
we pack them all to Iowa and send them

287
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,700
all, you know, send them all into my,

288
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,670
where's the highest population
of Mexicans in the country?

289
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,790
I would probably say Southern California.
Wrong. Indiana. Chicago. Chicago.

290
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,940
Yeah. Hi. They farm a ton
of shit up in Chicago,

291
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,060
Illinois. You know, where's the
highest population of Puerto Ricans?

292
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,950
The Bronx. You're wrong. Cleveland
clinic. Because in the 50s they shipped,

293
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,180
they all the dealers were with uh,

294
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,880
taking Puerto Ricans and
putting them to the Cleveland,

295
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:39,380
Ohio area to work in the fucking
Ford plants and all those plants.

296
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,450
And after all those places sat down,

297
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:43,670
all those people sitting
there holding on to that Dick.

298
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,450
When you go to certain parts where Ohio,
there's a suburb outside of Cleveland,

299
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,590
12 fucking Puerto Rican. Wow.
You know, interesting. But it's,

300
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,480
I don't think of it as we hate
Russians or German and Chinese.

301
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,440
I look at it from a different spread back
through the times and maybe will flow,

302
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,670
you know,

303
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,350
it's for me to send my daughter
to date cam cost rebills a week.

304
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,040
I'm not complaining. It's a great day.
Kids a science camp, they make potions.

305
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,500
They learn about light
bulbs and electricity.

306
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,650
My point is I did the same
thing for free when I was a kid.

307
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,000
All I had to do was walk to my
park. There's no funds left.

308
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,910
There's nothing left for
these kids. You know,

309
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,770
I dunno when I walk into
a Dodger game or an event,

310
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,520
I go,

311
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,290
I always think of the family of four in
America today that both parents have to

312
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,540
work. Yeah. And everybody has to work.

313
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:40,220
If you go by my office with a podcast in
the middle, is that a 24 hour daycare?

314
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,090
And many times I'll leave my office at
midnight and I see parents picking up

315
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:49,040
their kids, carrying them out over
their shoulders into that car. You know,

316
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,640
at the cost a lot to control the American
family. There's not a lot of jobs.

317
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,910
Why didn't you see everybody's
driving Uber? If you take Uber.

318
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,030
Uber's is interesting. I'm
thinking of doing a documentary.

319
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,230
I'm just going overs and talking to these
people and ask them why they're Uber.

320
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,300
Yesterday I had an engineer
engineer lost his job.

321
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,110
58 years old, got to work. Asian fellow.

322
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,550
Very nice. I've tipped him extra. He
offered me to plug the phone. I mean,

323
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:21,300
you know. Yeah. You have to
look at that and go, wow,

324
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,700
that's a lot of people in
this country without work.

325
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,560
There's a lot of fucking homeless people
and we're running out of money to take

326
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:29,730
care of what we got here.

327
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,750
[inaudible].
