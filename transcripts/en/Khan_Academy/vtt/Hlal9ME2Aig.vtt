00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.180
In this video, I want
to familiarize ourselves

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.250
with negative numbers,
and also learn

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.440
a bit of how do we
add and subtract them.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.130
And when you first
encounter them,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.570
they look like this deep
and mysterious thing.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.080
When we first
count things, we're

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.620
counting positive numbers.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.080
What does a negative
number even mean?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.280
But when we think
about it, you probably

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.770
have encountered negative
numbers in your everyday life.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.487
And let me just give
you a few examples.

00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:26.070
So before I actually
give the example,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.611
the general idea is
a negative number

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:29.445
is any number less than the 0.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.850
And if that sounds strange
and abstract to you,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.350
let's just think about it in a
couple of different contexts.

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:45.110
If we're measuring the
temperature-- and it

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.950
could be in Celsius
or Fahrenheit.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.790
Let's just assume we're
measuring it in Celsius.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.490
And so, let me
draw a little scale

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.270
that we can measure
the temperature on.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.000
And so, let's say this
is 0 degrees Celsius.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.570
That is 1 degree Celsius,
2 degrees Celsius,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.990
3 degrees Celsius.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.730
Now let's say that it's
a pretty chilly day,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.120
and it's currently
3 degrees Celsius.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.760
And someone who
predicts the future

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.780
tells you that it
is going to get

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.980
4 degrees colder the next day.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.360
So how cold will it be?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320
How can you represent
that coldness?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.680
Well, if it only
got 1 degree colder,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.809
we would be at 2 degrees.

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:26.600
But we know we have to
go 4 degrees colder.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.650
If we got 2 degrees colder,
we would be at 1 degree.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.846
If we got 3 degrees
colder, we would be at 0.

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:36.270
But 3 isn't enough.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.300
We have to get 4 degrees colder.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.190
So we have to actually
go one more below the 0.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.510
And that one below 0,
we call that negative 1.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.760
And so, you can kind of
see that the number line,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.990
as you go to the right
of 0 on the number line,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.792
it increases in positive values.

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:58.500
As you go to the left
of the number line,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.930
you're going to have negative 1.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.690
Then you're going
to have negative 2.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.931
And you're going
to have negative 3.

00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:05.430
And you're going
to have-- depending

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.510
on how you think
about it-- you're

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.759
going to have larger
negative numbers.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.340
But I want to make it
very clear-- negative 3

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.180
is less than negative 1.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.150
There is less heat in
the air then negative 1.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.980
It is colder.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.300
There's less temperature there.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.180
So let me just
make it very clear.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:39.622
Negative 100 is much
smaller than negative 1.

00:02:39.622 --> 00:02:41.580
You might look at 100,
and you might look at 1,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.121
and your gut reaction
is to say, wow,

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.860
100 is a much larger
number than 1.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.570
But when you think
about it, negative 100

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.510
means there's a
lack of something.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.260
If it's negative 100 degrees,
there's a lack of heat.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.580
So there's much less heat here
then if we had negative 1.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.320
Let me give you another example.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.840
Let's say in my bank
account today, I have $10.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.090
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.130
So let's say today I have $10.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.120
Now let's say I go
out there-- because I

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.035
feel good about my $10-- and
let's say I go and spend $30.

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.660
And for the sake of
argument, let's say

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.630
I have a very flexible
bank, one that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.930
lets me spend more
money than I have--

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.360
and these actually exist.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.160
So I spend $30.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.850
So what's my bank account
going to look like?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.220
So let me draw a
number line here.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.660
And you might already have
an intuitive response.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.679
I will owe the bank some money.

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:42.970
So let me write this over here.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.070
So tomorrow, what
is my bank account?

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.740
So you might immediately
say, look, if I have $10,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.840
and I spend $30,
there's $20 that

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.180
had to come from
someplace, and that $20 is

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.260
coming from the bank.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.970
So I'm going to
owe the bank $20.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.530
And so, in my bank account,
to sure how much I have,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.240
I could say $10 minus $30
is actually negative $20.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.240
So in my bank account tomorrow,
I'm going to have negative $20.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.115
So if I say I have negative $20,
that means that I owe the bank.

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:18.990
I don't even have it.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.314
Not only do I have
nothing, I owe something.

00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:22.230
It's going in reverse.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.660
Here, I have something to spend.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.710
If my $10 is in my bank, that
means the bank owes me $10.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.730
I have $10 that I
can use to go spend.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.490
Now all of a sudden,
I owe the bank.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.156
I've gone in the
other direction.

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:36.530
And if we use a
number line here,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.488
it should hopefully make
a little bit of sense.

00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:39.400
So that is 0.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.920
I'm starting off with $10.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.630
And spending $30 means I'm
moving 30 spaces to the left.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.140
So if I move 10 spaces to the
left-- if I only spend $10,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.600
I'll be back at 0.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.570
If I spend another $10,
I'll be at negative $10.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.920
If I spend another
$10 after that,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.950
I will be at negative $20.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.510
So each of these distances--
I spent $10, I'd be at 0.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.720
Another $10, I'd
be at negative $10.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.470
Another $10, I would
be at negative $20.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.505
And this whole distance right
here is how much I spent.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.090
I spent $30.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.119
So the general idea, when
you spend or if you subtract

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.660
or if we're getting
colder, you would

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.160
move to the left
of the number line.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.610
The numbers would get smaller.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.837
And we now know they
can get smaller than 0.

00:05:26.837 --> 00:05:28.420
They can go to
negative 1, negative 2,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.630
they can even go to
negative 1.5, negative 1.6.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.590
You're getting more and more
negative the more you lose.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.830
If you're adding-- if I
go and get my paycheck,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.840
I will move to the right
of the number line.

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:43.080
Now with that out of
the way, let's just

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.010
do a couple of more
pure math problems.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.270
And just think
about what it means

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:56.330
if we were to say 3 minus 4.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.277
So once again, this is
exactly the situation

00:05:58.277 --> 00:05:59.860
that we did here
with the temperature.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.829
We're starting at 3,
and we're subtracting 4.

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:03.370
So we're going to
move 4 to the left.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.770
We go 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.870
So that gets us to negative 1.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.370
And when you're
starting to do this,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.680
you really understand what
a negative number means.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.074
I really encourage you to
visualize the number line,

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:17.490
and really move
along it depending

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.550
on whether you're
adding and subtracting.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.760
Now let's do a couple more.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.400
Let's say I have 2 minus 8.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.240
And we'll think about more ways
to do this in future videos.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.550
But once again, you just
want to do the number line.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.920
You have a 0 here.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.870
Let me draw the
spacing a little bit.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.600
So we have 0 here.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.830
We're at 1, 2.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.960
If we're subtracting
8, that means

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.860
we're going to
move 8 to the left.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.630
So we're going to go 1
to the left, 2 the left.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.890
So we've gone 2 to
the left to get to 0.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.830
We have to move how
many more to the left?

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.600
Well, we've already
moved 2 the left.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.280
To get to 8, we have to
move 6 more to the left.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.650
So we're going to have to
move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 more

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.260
to the left.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.800
Well, where is that
going to put us?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800
Well, we were at 0.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.590
This is a negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, negative 4,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.560
negative 5, negative 6.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.760
So 2 minus 8 is negative 6.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.440
2 minus 2 would be 0.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.440
When you're subtracting 8,
you're subtracting another 6.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.830
So we'd go up to negative 6.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.120
We go 6 below 0.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.245
Let me do one more example.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.578
And this one will be a little
less conventional for you,

00:07:36.578 --> 00:07:38.040
but hopefully it
will make sense.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.490
And I'll do this in a new color.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.570
Let me take negative 4 minus 2.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.199
So we're starting at
a negative number,

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:50.740
and then we're
subtracting from that.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.030
And if this seems confusing,
just remember the number line.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.050
So this is 0 right here.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:05.420
This is negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, negative 4.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.800
So that's where we're starting.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.750
Now we're going to
subtract 2 from negative 4.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.570
So we're going to
move 2 to the left.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.940
So if we subtract 1, we
will be at negative 5.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.820
If we subtract another 1, we
are going to be at negative 6.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.610
We are going to
be at negative 6.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.072
So this is negative 6.

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:24.530
Let's do another
interesting thing.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.490
Let's start at negative 3.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.230
Let's say we have negative 3.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.280
Instead of subtracting something
from that, let's add 2 to it.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.230
So where would this put
us on the number line?

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.620
So we're starting at negative
3, and we're adding 2,

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.809
so we're going to
move to the right.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.460
So you add 1, you
become negative 2.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.680
But if you add another
1, which we have to do,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.710
you become negative 1.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.260
You move 2 to the right.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.422
So negative 3 plus
negative 2 is negative 1.

00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:56.130
And you can see for
yourself but this all

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.870
fits our traditional notion
of adding and subtracting.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.910
If we start at negative
1, and we subtract 2,

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.540
we should get negative 3--
kind of reverse of this thing

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.250
up here.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.349
Negative 3 plus 2 gets us there.

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:10.890
Then if we start
then, we subtract 2,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.306
we should get back to negative
3, and we see that happens.

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:17.720
If you start at negative
1 right over here,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.110
and you subtract 2--
you move 2 to the left--

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.469
you get back to negative 3.

00:09:21.469 --> 00:09:23.010
So hopefully, this
starts to give you

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:28.012
a sense of what it means to
deal with, or add and subtract,

00:09:28.012 --> 00:09:28.720
negative numbers.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.560
But we're going to give
a lot more examples

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.090
in the next video.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.590
And we're actually
going to see what

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.936
it means to subtract
a negative number.
