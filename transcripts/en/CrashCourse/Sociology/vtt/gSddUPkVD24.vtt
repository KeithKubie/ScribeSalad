00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
I think you’ll all agree with me that racism
is a...loaded topic.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.200
What is or isn’t racist – or who is or isn’t
racist – is one of the most hotly debated
issues in American society.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.000
Is racism about what you believe?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.280
Or is it about how you behave toward other races?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.640
What is prejudice?
And why does it exist?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.980
Sociology can’t make racism go away.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.020
And it can’t make it any less disturbing.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.020
It probably can’t even make the issue of
race and racism less loaded than it already is.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.580
But it can help us understand racism, and
understanding is an important start.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:40.500
[Theme Music]

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.360
As always, let’s start by defining our terms.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.640
For one thing, what’s the difference between
racism, discrimination and prejudice?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.040
Prejudice is a rigid and unfair generalization
about an entire category of people.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.140
So, what exactly do I mean by unfair?

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.580
Well, a prejudice assumes that something you think to
be true for a whole group applies to every individual
member of that group, too, with little or no evidence.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.300
Prejudice often takes the form of stereotypes,
or exaggerated and simplified descriptions that
are applied to every person in a category.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.780
Negative stereotypes are often directed at
people who are different from yourself,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.820
which means that people who are a minority in a
population are more likely to be negatively stereotyped.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.980
For example, two common stereotypes of people
who use government assistance are that they’re

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.660
A) African-American -and-
B) gaming the system.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.560
But both of these ideas are demonstrably false.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.000
The majority of people on welfare are White,
and people who use social services like welfare
are also likely to need the extra help.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.980
But these stereotypes lead people to claim
that Black Americans, particularly single
mothers, are lazy or untrustworthy.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.280
This example is a specific type of prejudice:
racial prejudice.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.240
Racism includes beliefs, thoughts, and
actions based on the idea that one race is
innately superior to another race.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.280
Some take this definition further and argue that
racism is inherently tied up in structures of power,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.860
meaning that racism specifically refers to the belief that
a race with less societal power is inferior to other races.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.040
And, of course, racism can be explicit or
implicit.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.000
Explicit bias refers to the attitudes or beliefs we
have about a group that we’re consciously aware of.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.660
But implicit biases are a little bit more
insidious.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.980
These are the unconscious biases that we have
about other groups.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.680
While we might easily recognize an explicit
act of racism, like calling someone a racial slur,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.600
we often don’t consciously recognize how implicit
biases affect how we interact with each other.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.100
For example, a 2007 study by University of Colorado
social psychologist Joshua Correll and colleagues

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.860
found that people’s implicit bias comes into
play when making judgments about how likely
it is that a person is holding a gun.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.260
Participants in the study played a videogame
in which the goal was to shoot people who
had a gun, but not shoot unarmed people.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.020
Participants were more likely to mistakenly shoot
an unarmed Black man than an unarmed White man.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.200
This was true whether the participants in the study
were White or Black, and it didn’t change, regardless of
what explicit biases the subjects said they had.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.220
What did seem to matter was if the subjects
said he or she was aware of stereotypes about
Black men and gun violence –

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.380
even if the subjects adamantly disagreed
with those stereotypes.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.700
That said, it does seem like training can
make a difference.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.380
The sample for this study contained both a
sample of adult community members from Denver
and a sample of police officers.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.160
The study found that police officers – who are trained
to recognize when someone has a gun or not –

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.940
were less susceptible to racial bias in who
they shot than a community member was.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.400
Also, we should note that like many studies
in psychology, this is a small sample design:

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.880
about 130 members of the community and 230
police officers participated in the study.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.300
So, prejudice is about what people believe.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.520
But discrimination is a matter of action.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.380
Discrimination is simply described as any
unequal treatment of different groups of people.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.100
Most of us think about discrimination in terms of
specific actions, like calling someone a racial slur, or
refusing to do business with a certain type of person.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.940
But racism can be bigger than one individual.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.860
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to talk about
institutional racism.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:01.100
Institutional prejudice and discrimination are the biases
that are built into the operation of society’s institutions,
like schools, banking systems, and the labor force.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.520
The concept of institutional racism was
highlighted by civil rights activists Stokely Carmichael
and Charles Hamilton in the 1960s,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.980
who argued that institutional racism is harder to identify
and therefore less often condemned by society.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.640
Carmichael and Hamilton compared
society’s response to the suffering caused by
white terrorists bombing black churches,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.160
to the lack of attention given to thousands of
black children who suffered for different reasons

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.680
– like from the lack of access to quality
housing, food, healthcare, or schooling.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.260
Bombing black churches is an overt act of racism,
motivated by racial hatred, so it’s easy to understand
as racism.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:42.700
By contrast, elevated rates of sickness and death
– which stem from structural disadvantages –
aren’t the fault of any one individual’s racial animus.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.740
But it still results in discrimination on
the basis of race.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.040
And it’s much more likely to go unnoticed,
because there’s no single person to blame.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.740
Together, prejudice and discrimination form
a vicious cycle that entrench social disadvantages.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.500
The cycle starts with prejudice taking hold
in a society, often as a strategy for consolidating
economic or social power for a certain group.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:10.860
This prejudice then motivates discrimination
against the minority group, both at an individual and
institutional level, which forces the group into a
lower position in society.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.140
Then, this social disadvantage means that the
minority group is seen as less successful and
therefore inferior to the majority group,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.220
seemingly justifying the original prejudice
– and the cycle continues.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.360
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.260
So that’s what racism is.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.420
Now, why does it exist?

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.140
One theory of prejudice is known as scapegoat
theory, also known as frustration-aggression theory.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.560
Scapegoat theory frames prejudice as a defense
mechanism on the part of frustrated people

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.000
who blame another, more disadvantaged group
for the troubles that they face, even when those
troubles stem from structural changes.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.480
Economic anxiety is seen as a common trigger
for scapegoating –

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.080
fear of losing jobs leads to blaming immigrants for
taking jobs, rather than looking at how globalization
and automation have changed the economy.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.180
A second theory was proposed in the 1950s by
German sociologist Theodor Adorno and his colleagues,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.880
who were trying to understand
how fascism and anti-semitism took hold in
Germany before and during World War II.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.660
The authoritarian personality theory sees prejudice
as the outgrowth of a certain personality profile –

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.840
one that’s associated with authoritarianism,
or the desire for order, tradition, and strong leaders
who will maintain the status quo.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.380
People with authoritarian personalities tend to see
society as hierarchical, with people who are naturally
superior having the right to power over others.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:30.700
So according to this theory, racial prejudice is
heightened when an authoritarian personality feels
there’s some moral or physical threat to their way of life.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.940
Both this theory and the scapegoat theory
see prejudice as a reaction that certain types
of people have –

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.840
people who are frustrated or people who
have a certain personality type.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.120
A third theory of prejudice takes a different
tack.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:48.500
Culture theory claims some prejudice can be found
in everyone, because people are products of the culture
they live in – and we live in a prejudiced culture.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.660
This is what some people mean when they say
“everyone’s a little bit racist.”

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.750
That, or, they just like quoting Avenue Q.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.699
We learn racial prejudice and stereotypes
through a kind of cultural osmosis.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:05.340
For example, history textbooks tend to be written from
a Euro-caucasian perspective and focus mainly on the
contributions of White people, rather than other cultures.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.740
And this relates to yet another approach, which
measures prejudice in terms of social distance.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.440
In the 1920s, American sociologist Emory Bogardus
developed the social distance scale,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.920
which measures how closely people are willing to
interact with people from different races and ethnicities.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.240
Social distance is a kind of proxy for how much
of an ‘other’ you see members of another race.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.480
Just like how geographic distance makes
you more likely to generalize about a group
of people who are different from yourself,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.380
social distance increases the likelihood that
you might hold stereotypical or prejudiced views
about another racial group.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.980
And the final theory of prejudice is one we’ve
talked about before: conflict theory.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:44.700
Race-Conflict Theory focuses on how social
inequality develops as the result of power conflicts
between different racial and ethnic groups.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.140
Under this theory, prejudice is a tool for
maintaining the power of the majority.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:57.600
For example, the argument that Whites are a superior
race was used as a justification for slavery and the racial
discrimination that continued long after slavery ended.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.180
So, people may think about and treat each
other differently, based on their race or ethnicity,
in many different ways.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.240
But the ways in which racial groups interact
within a society are often described by sociologists
in terms of four broad patterns:

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.780
pluralism, assimilation, segregation, and genocide.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.640
Pluralism is a state in which all races and ethnicities
are distinct, but have equal social standing.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:23.920
This isn’t a society that’s color blind per se –
because people still have different racial heritages
that are recognized in society.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.140
But in terms of how social and economic resources
are distributed, the color of one’s skin plays no role.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.040
So, is the US pluralistic?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.680
Ehh… not exactly.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.420
The United States is pluralistic by the letter
of the law.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:43.800
But in a practical sense, there’s still a lot of racial and
ethnic stratification, and despite having equal legal
standing, all races do not have equal social standing.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.560
Now, in contrast to pluralism, in which
different races remain distinct,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.520
assimilation describes the process by which minorities
gradually adopt patterns of the dominant culture.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:09:01.380
By adopting the modes of dress, values, religion, language, and lifestyles of the majority culture, minorities are sometimes able to avoid prejudice or discrimination.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.600
But assimilation is much easier for some groups
than others.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.660
And it’s easier if you look and sound like
the group that you’re trying to assimilate to.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:13.420
A third pattern of racial interaction is to
just…not interact.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.500
Segregation is the physical and social separation
of categories of people.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.400
Racial segregation has a long history in the
United States,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.420
with racial minorities historically being
segregated into lower quality neighborhoods,
occupations, and schools.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.940
Much of the segregation under the law – also
known as De Jure Segregation –

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.680
has since been prohibited through court cases
and laws such as Brown v. Board of Education.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.300
But De Facto segregation, or segregation due
to traditions and norms, still remains.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.980
People live in neighborhoods, attend schools,
and work mostly with people like themselves.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.820
This self-segregation has led to high levels
of racial stratification.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.720
About one-quarter of black students attend public
schools that have more than 90% students of color –

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.720
and those schools tend to have
less resources available to them.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:01.860
De jure school segregation may be over, but de facto segregation has all but insured that the public school system remains separate and unequal for many Americans.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.420
Sometimes, however, racial prejudice has consequences
beyond segregation and inequality.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.180
Racism can lead to genocide, or the the systematic
killing of one group of people by another.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.740
Whether we’re talking about the attacks on indigenous
populations by colonizers starting in the 1600s,

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.880
the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Empire during
World War I, the Holocaust during World War II,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.240
or modern examples in Rwanda and Darfur,
genocide represents some of the worst of humanity.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.440
And it is usually motivated by racism.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.520
We can’t talk about race without talking
about how people have used racist attitudes
as an excuse for violence and subjugation.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:41.180
But hopefully, what we’ve talked about today
will give you some context for thinking about
how race plays out on a societal scale.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:46.780
Today, we discussed prejudice, stereotypes,
racism, and five theories for why prejudice exists.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.520
We talked about discrimination and the legacies
of institutional racism.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:57.560
And we ended with an overview of four types
of racial interaction: pluralism, assimilation,
segregation, and genocide.
