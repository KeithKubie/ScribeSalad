[Music Plays]

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.090
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Please join me in welcoming
Anne Rice to Google.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.090
[Applause]

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.939
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Thank you.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:18.939
[Applause]

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.190
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: As we proceed I’ll ask questions
of my own, but I’ll also be including some

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.829
questions that fans that submitted to us online
in advance of the event today, who I hope

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.250
have tuned in to watch.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.369
And after the Q&amp;A we’ll open the floor for
questions from the audience.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.170
Uh, so my first question for you Anne is,
werewolves?

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.489
In my mind they’re as big a part of the
paranormal pantheon as vampires but I’m

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.399
curious what inspired you to go there.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.100
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well actually I had never really
considered doing a werewolf novel but I got

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.989
a suggestion, “Why don’t I do it?” from
a very good friend, Jeff Easton.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.620
And I’ve never met Jeff.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.620
Jeff is a producer.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.620
He’s the creator of the TV show White Collar
on the USA channel.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.339
But Jeff and I are e-mail buddies.

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.960
I’m a fan of White Collar and we connected.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.590
And he just happened to send me an e-mail
saying that he had just watched a documentary

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.700
on werewolves, the legend in werewolf fiction,
and he said if you ever tackle that, if you

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.670
ever write a werewolf novel I will buy buckets
of hard covers.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.810
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Just a casual mention and for

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.480
some reason it was just the right time for
me to think about it.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.190
I wanted to return to gothic supernatural
fiction.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.340
I really wanted to get back to it.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.790
And I was stuck on a novel, I was writing
about Atlantis and I couldn’t go forward

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.670
because the science was overwhelming me.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.390
And it was, it was turning into too much of
a sci-fi thing, it was made for Michael Crichton,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.390
not me.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.390
You know?

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.090
And I was, and, okay, then comes this e-mail
and I thought, “Well maybe I can do that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.090
now.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.090
I mean, why not?”

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.510
And I started to think about it and think
about what I wanted to do with the werewolf

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.350
mythology and what had not satisfied me in
other werewolf films that I’d seen.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.340
And in about 3 months the novel was done.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.340
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Wow.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.710
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Yeah it worked out very well.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.080
I wrote Jeff the other night after the novel
came on the New York Times list number 3 and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.060
said, “Do you have any other suggestions?”

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.060
[Laughter]

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.040
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: You know, he’s a good muse.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.239
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Right!

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.239
[Laughter]

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.239
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So what about the legend appealed
to you?

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.189
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well, the transformation.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.920
The idea that you, well what appealed to me,
what if the werewolf, what if the man or the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.720
woman was completely conscious during the
transformation?

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.370
You know, the way we get it in movies and
books often, the person is not conscious.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.180
They lose themselves in the transformation,
become almost a rabid beast and really don’t

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.520
behave like a wolf so much as they behave
like a mad dog.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.019
Then they wake up the next morning and the
village is filled with rumors of people being

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.269
torn limb from limb in the woods, they realize
they did it, and the whole thing ends with

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.049
a silver bullet, you know?

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.510
But I thought, “What if the subject is conscious?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.500
What if instead of being an agonizing transformation
this is something sensuous?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.150
“I know what it would mean to me if I could
grow muscles and several feet taller.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.150
You know?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.760
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: And get really, really strong.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760
You know?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.099
And I thought, “Okay that might feel absolutely
terrific.”

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
And I explored it from that point of view.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.569
And my hero, Rueben, stays conscious all during
it.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:27.569
He can talk.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.689
He can talk quite clearly when he’s a werewolf
or a man wolf.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.439
And what he really becomes is a man wolf rather
than a 4 footed animal.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.840
It’s more like Ron Chaney, in the original
black and white movie, whose always running

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.389
around in his shirt and trousers.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.389
[Laughter]

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.389
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Right.

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.340
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: But my man wolf does not run
around in his shirt and trousers.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.170
But he’s upright like this.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.609
You know?

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.760
He’s anthropoid, whatever.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.980
But, um, again what I wanted to explore was
how he responds to this.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.420
What do you do the next day?

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.430
You remember all of it.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.040
He even photographs himself with his iPhone.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040
[Laughter]

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.190
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That’s a wonderful scene
actually, you know?

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.279
Him trying to paw his iPhone and take a self-portrait,
it was very meta.

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.279
[Laughter]

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.230
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: But isn’t it exactly what
he would do?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.230
You know?

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.230
[Laughter]

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.669
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I mean, so he does it and he
e-mails that to his computer and then when

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.600
he wakes up he’s fully expecting those photographs
to show him in a normal physical state and

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.719
a psychotic mental state, but still he sees
photographs of exactly what he remembers.

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:28.719
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Right.

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.140
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: That he was a man wolf.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.509
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: And he has a really great
moment, I think, early on when he’s realizing

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.710
his transformation and he’s madly researching
werewolves online

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.710
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Right.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.861
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: And he finds that they’re
really pretty one dimensional and his experience

00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:46.100
is so different and were you writing him with
that in mind, thinking about how to add, sort

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.310
of, the human experience to his mildly unexpected
animal?

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.940
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Really what I did with him was
really just what I would do if it were happening

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.940
with me.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.940
I would research it online immediately.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.940
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.930
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I would, you know, these are
all the things I think anybody would do.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.350
Often in horror fiction, things like this
are presented in such another worldly realm,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.849
that there’s no real hook into what we would
actually do.

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.370
You know, we go to see werewolf movies and
vampire movies, in which nobody seems to guess

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.680
that they might be vampires or werewolves.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.960
I wanted to put Reuben in the real world of
Northern California, right in our own time.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.979
And he does, he looks up everything.

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.650
And he makes the news as the man wolf and
he’s a reporter.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.520
So he’s actually asked to interview one
of the people that he rescued.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.370
While he was a man wolf he attacked a rapist
who was attacking this woman, and the next

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.930
day has to interview her for various reasons
that are explained in the novel.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.090
But I had a lot of fun playing with all of
that.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:54.300
I mean, I think I started over 35 years ago,
taking the comic book image of the vampire,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.139
The Man in the Black Cape, and getting into
that character and trying to say what’s

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.199
the real deep back story to this?

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.020
Where’s the tragic dimension if the vampire
is a real being.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.539
And I’m really doing this same thing with
Reuben and him being a man wolf.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.220
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: When you talk about his transformation
and him being conscious through it and it

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.680
being, it’s so much more ecstatic than it
is agonizing.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.199
You know, that whole American Werewolf in
London thing doesn’t happen which I, um,

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.199
which is so different.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.470
And I think it’s an example of how you’ve
been creative with archetypes before, you

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.279
know, you’re vampire’s aren’t afraid
of garlic and crosses and things like that.

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.569
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Right.

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:39.199
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: But his killings are quite
violent at the same time, so would you, what’s

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.969
happening with him in sort of that pleasure,
plain conflict?

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:47.810
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well he finds he enjoys, very
much, killing and that though he’s conscious

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.770
and he’s Reuben, he still has all these
hormones surging through him as a beast and

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.139
he’s able to kill without much hesitation.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.430
But he can differentiate between innocence
and guilt when he’s in that state.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.020
And he kills guilty people.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.689
He kills kidnappers, rapist, people like this
and he does not harm anybody who’s innocent.

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:11.050
In fact, it’s almost impossible for him
to do that.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.680
He can smell evil the way a dog smells fear.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.919
And he can sense innocence the way dogs often
sense helpless people, handicapped people

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.419
or people who are challenged in some way.

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.879
And what he has to do when he comes back to
himself is ponder whether he has the right

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.110
to kill people evil or not.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:35.389
Whether, I mean he’s doing things that he
can’t morally forgive himself for.

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:41.680
But it’s also very alluring and he discovers,
just like the vampires in my books, that he’s

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.090
resilient, that he heals from almost any kind
of wound.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.110
So that makes the power, the gift, all the
more alluring.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.310
There’s no way that he’s gonna give it
up.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.900
And again I was asking myself, “Well what
would you do if someone, you know, gave you

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.060
the capacity to be immortal, possibly immortal,
and definitely resilient?”

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.939
And I would find it almost impossible to give
up.

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:12.870
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: One of our fans, Fab, of Sherman
Oaks California, asked, “One aspect of Reuben

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.219
Golden is his ability to smell good and evil
in humans.”

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:20.460
He said, “I think about my pets and how
they love some and nearly bite others, I wondered

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.770
if that’s how you got that idea.”

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.379
He wishes it was a character trait that we
all had to be able to sniff people out.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:30.099
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know we probably do have
it on some level.

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:37.770
And dogs have it, a stronger ability to sense
things, maybe, from physical cues and glandular

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.830
activity and I did get it from animals.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.550
I did get the idea from dogs.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:49.850
I heard a story of some friends of ours that
had a dog that would play very roughly in

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.370
the back yard with all the kids but when a
child came out of the house that was very

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.820
handicapped and challenged, the dog would
go over to that child and protect it, just

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.019
walk beside it into the yard.

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.350
And the animal was totally transformed.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.139
Nobody had to teach that dog that.

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:09.730
He sensed that that child was different, that
it had trouble doing the things the other

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.290
children were doing.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.829
And I think that went into my concept.

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:17.089
I mean, this is after all a myth of somebody
turning into an animal.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:22.079
So I was thinking, “Well what are the mysterious
characteristics of an animal that are going

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:27.550
to be really preternatural to him when he
goes through this?”

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.250
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: You mentioned earlier how
you looked to, sort of, that comic book, sort

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.370
of, hero model that he has this, sort of,
this black knight quality.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:41.800
And I was wondering if you, as he discovers
that the gift is a means to save lives and

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:48.100
it’s a means for good, he becomes, you know,
with his obsessive documenting and his heroic,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.490
sort of, running to the rescue a curious blend
of Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.070
Um, do you see some classic comic book hero
in him?

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.070
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Oh yes.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.360
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Or were there certain stories
that really came to mind beyond?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.000
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: No I was consciously exploring
that dimension.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.839
That he does become Batman or superman.

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:09.970
You know, and how does he live with it?

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:16.930
And I absolutely love doing that and you know
looking, again, for the tragic dimension behind

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:21.260
those images and I’ve been doing that since
I did Interview With a Vampire.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:27.510
And what’s it like to be a vampire, what’s
it like to talk, if you can get a vampire

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.000
talking about it.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.320
I think it’s, I think it’s something I
truly, truly love.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.690
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Do you think that you’ll
write more books in this series?

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.690
Is this the first?

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.380
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I think definitely.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.140
But I have other books I wanna write first.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.910
I’m doing another supernatural novel and
I wanna get that done first and then maybe

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.910
a sequel.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.820
I think it’s a good idea to wait a little
while.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.360
The sequel you would write the next day after
you finish a book, it’s not really the sequel

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.000
you would write a year later, or two years
later.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.300
You learn things, you think about things,
you see possibilities that you don’t see

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.480
immediately.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.760
And I wanna give that little interval there.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.660
What I don’t know, I never know what’s
gonna happen.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:17.949
I’m looking forward to going home and spending
the next few months just writing and if Reuben

00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:20.870
gets into my brain, I might go ahead and do
the sequel right away.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.870
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: One of our fans submitted
a question about what you’re working on

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.870
next.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:32.490
She said, this is FantasyFreak of Philadelphia
Pennsylvania, she asked, “On a few instances

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.610
on Facebook you alluded to work on a new book
that appears to be a ghost story, can you

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.560
reveal any details about this?”

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.839
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know, I don’t want to
because I talked a lot about that novel about

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:46.020
Atlantis and then I just can’t make that
book work.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:51.670
So I would just prefer to say that it’s
a supernatural novel and It’s in this same

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:58.070
spirit as The Wolf Gift or Interview With
a Vampire and I’m hoping that in a few months

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.919
I’ll have the manuscript.

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:00.919
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Wonderful!

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:05.040
Well, I for one am very excited for that.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.829
Um, you did take a break between Interview
With a Vampire, and you didn’t write The

00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:13.310
Vampire Lestat until almost ten years later.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.809
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Actually it was eight years
later.

00:12:14.809 --> 00:12:15.809
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Eight years later.

00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:17.120
And you did some books in between that.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Right.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.010
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So that’s a style that has
worked for you in the past and it’s,

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.040
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well it worked at that time.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.089
[Laughs]

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:31.029
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: I had another, I had another
two books that I really wanted to do after

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:37.130
Interview With a Vampire but I’m very glad
that I got into the Vampire Lestat and that

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.199
it worked.

00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:44.410
Cause that, the Vampire Lestat is really the
book that launched my career.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.650
I was doing really well, I had nothing to
complain about as a writer, but Interview

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.540
With a Vampire was actually a flop, it did
not do well.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.010
It was so strange.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.430
People didn’t know what to make of it.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:02.160
And it actually had a life as a hard cover
book that flopped, basically, and didn’t

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.570
sell and then it had life as a paperback bestseller
briefly and then it became, sort of, an underground

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.570
book.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.209
And that was kind of wonderful finally.

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:14.980
But the Vampire Lestat that sort of put me
on the map.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:20.360
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: And he’s written so large
in that book I mean, that’s his debut.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.360
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Yeah.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.360
[Laughter]

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360
&gt;&gt;Anne Rice: Probably love him more than any
character, I guess, I’ve ever written.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360
[Laughter]

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.930
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Do you have a second favorite?

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.340
I have to ask that as a middle child.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.340
[Laughs]

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.560
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well, you know I’m in love
with Reuben right now.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.280
You know, I’m always in love with the latest
creation.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.079
But Lestat, I mean, that was, he’s almost
more than a literal character to me.

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:40.320
I’m always haunted by him.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.779
I mean, I’m always thinking of what he would
think of places and how he would like this

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:48.600
hotel or that hotel or this view or what he
would think.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.449
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anne Rice: It’s, you know, I don’t know.

00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:57.339
He’s sort of alive inside me in a way that
some of the other characters have never been,

00:13:57.339 --> 00:13:58.480
you know?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.029
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: One of our fans, Artist of
Ideas from California said that, “My favorite

00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:07.860
book beginning of all time is I am the vampire
Lestat.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.940
I am immortal, more or less.”

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.800
And she wanted to know what you’re favorite
first line was.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.060
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Wow, uh.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.589
Favorite first line, the first line is the
hardest part of the book.

00:14:20.589 --> 00:14:23.190
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: It’s absolutely the worst

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.190
part.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.220
That might be it; I don’t know that I can
top that.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.220
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: It’s pretty fantastic.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.190
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I don’t know.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.519
And that first line came from desperation,
I mean, the book was done and I just said,

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:35.240
“I got to get into this somehow.”

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.240
[Laughter]

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.980
&gt;&gt;Anne Rice: So I went back and worked on
the beginning and I came up with that.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.259
Okay just say it, “I am the vampire Lestat.”

00:14:42.259 --> 00:14:46.050
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: And it totally captures his
voice from the beginning.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.430
That’s just who he is, right there.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:53.260
Andy, another fan, asked if you’d ever consider
continuing the Vampire chronicles or going

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.260
back to them.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.100
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I don’t wanna say no to anything
right now.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.329
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Yeah.

00:14:57.329 --> 00:15:02.130
So I’ll get back to Reuben, to your favorite.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:08.300
I would love to know more about him and how
you, um, how he came into view for you.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:14.040
I mean, he’s this well to do, young, handsome
sunshine boy, they call him.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.010
You know, driving his Porsche up to Mendocino,
like, who is he?

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:25.190
How is he the likely or unlikely, uh, person
to encounter and survive a wolf attack?

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:30.350
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I think when you write, or when
I write, I put everything I know into a character

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.769
but I really don’t know how that character
is going to develop.

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:37.070
And in the cliché they come to life on the
page is really true.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.459
If they don’t come to life for me, uh, I
have to do another book.

00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:43.769
[Coughs]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Or the book doesn’t work.

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:45.509
But he really just came to life.

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:51.610
Walking up this hill in Mendocino County talking
to this woman Marchant Nideck about her house

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:57.750
and I guess he really came to life when I
hit on the idea that he was very good looking

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.509
but he was kind of uncomfortable with it.

00:15:59.509 --> 00:16:01.990
And he wanted to be taken seriously.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.709
And that he’d been a person that had never
been taken seriously because one he was very

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:11.170
good looking and two he was fairly well off,
and people tended to dismiss him as superficial.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:16.839
But he really had a lot to offer and that’s
when he began to work for me as a character.

00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:23.600
I began to see his frustration with that and
his longing to be taken seriously and how

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.860
uncomfortable he was inside that beautiful
body and face, you know?

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.422
I think many, many women probably feel that
way, maybe more than men, but there are probably

00:16:32.422 --> 00:16:33.920
men that feel that way too.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:40.800
I remember once a man telling me that when
he was young his physical looks had nothing

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.920
to do with who he was and it was very disturbing
and jarring for him.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.500
And as he got older he was more comfortable
in his skin.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.700
So, but why that made that character come
to life I don’t know.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:58.170
The character I kept seeing physically was
the actor Matt Bomer from White Collar.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.550
Who’s an exceptionally beautiful guy, I
think.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:08.270
And also kind of unassuming and boyish and
seems to me, maybe, he’s a bit uncomfortable

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.270
being good looking.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:15.059
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: I think what’s interesting
about Reuben to is that he’s very, he is

00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:21.319
a really, um, dedicated to this career as
a journalist and he’s an obsessive researcher

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.780
and he’s hungry for information all the
time.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:30.400
And I think about him in that aspect next
to Felix Nideck who’s also, you know, sort

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:38.740
of, becomes his ancestral, sort of, foil and
who is also, you know, obsessed with information

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.240
and history and collecting stories.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.830
How do you see there, sort of, for me they’re
the twin figures of the book, and how do you

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.830
see that?

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:53.630
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I think definitely Reuben falls
in love with the figure of Felix Nideck because

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.580
he sees him as a mentor, as a model.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.580
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Right.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.960
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: As a man who’s obviously a
scholar and curious who traveled all over

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.500
the world seeking knowledge and Reuben loves
that idea.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.020
He loves that very, very much.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:12.000
In fact, you know, in the novel he goes to
live at Nideck Point, the house where he was

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.270
bitten or became a werewolf and he’s looking
for all the answers up there.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.750
But it’s sort of like he moves from a family
where he’s so uncomfortable and so underappreciated

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:27.040
and so much loved and dismissed, he moves
up to Felix’s family basically in Felix’s

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.040
house.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040
So he chooses that path.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.509
And, you know, when I’m writing I don’t
really calculate all that it just happens.

00:18:33.509 --> 00:18:34.509
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Right.

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:37.280
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I’m writing away and this
is what happens, you know?

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.650
Um, and it was a great pleasure to write that.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:46.450
I think if you focus on writing what’s really
exciting to you and what’s really intense

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.570
to you, many other aspects of the book take
care of themselves.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:57.780
Like, I used to worry a lot, at the beginning
of my career, that I didn’t put enough meaningful

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.060
things in the books, that the book wouldn’t
be perceived as shallow.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.950
But what I realized was that I was putting,
if anything, too much for some people, philosophy,

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:07.950
theology
[Laughs]

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.260
&gt;&gt;Anne Rice: Questions about the meaning of
life and so forth and what I came to realize,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.740
in my work, those questions will always crop
up.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:19.600
All I have to do is kind of get the characters
going and into motion, get very excited and

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.110
wanna know what’s happening next as I write
and the rest will take care of itself.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.000
But that was part of what took care of itself,
his gravitating toward Felix.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.659
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Do you think that, um, the
supernatural environment that you find yourself

00:19:33.659 --> 00:19:38.191
writing in is that a more fertile ground for
you to explore some of these bigger questions

00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:39.309
about faith and spirituality.

00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:43.210
These bigger existential questions, you know,
like there’s something about that world

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:49.500
or those, you know, that identity help bring
of those ideas and thinking to the surface?

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.130
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: It’s the only way that I can
explore those questions.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.980
I simply cannot write pedestrian realism,
I tried.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.020
I knocked myself out as a creative writing
student trying to write about experience,

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.020
I couldn’t do it.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:07.770
It was when I chose this, that absurd title,
Interview With a Vampire and when I started,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:14.220
you know, writing through the voice of the
vampire, and it was a comic book image, that’s

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.490
when the door opened to my reality.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:21.010
Then I could talk about everything that mattered
to me, absolutely everything, grief, pain,

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.230
good and evil, conscious, everything.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:30.059
Tragedy, horror, the fear that life was meaningless,
just a million things I was able to talk about.

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:33.460
But before that I was completely ham strung
as a writer.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.900
Just couldn’t do it.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.159
Way out of step with everybody.

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:37.159
[Laughter]

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:41.090
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: How is it for you, and I don’t
know how or wanna assume that you’ve read

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:46.540
a ton of the contemporary sort of vampire
fiction that’s out there now, but that,

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.400
um, the feel of those stories is very different
from yours.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.490
You know, they don’t have that gravitas
really in a lot of the characters and, um

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.680
, which is not to say they’re not great
stories and you know, creative and clever

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:05.180
but is it strange for you to encounter those
creatures that you know really well but rendered

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.180
so differently.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.490
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well I’m enjoying it.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.490
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Yeah.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.480
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I really am.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.260
Authors like Stephanie Meyer and Charlaine
Harris, are doing things with the vampire

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.310
that never occurred to me to do.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.510
I never thought of doing it.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.520
[Coughs]
&gt;&gt;Anne Rice: I think for me it was very important

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.299
that my vampires be heroic and mythic and
at the same time intimate with the reader.

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:29.330
You know, talking slang, talking naturally.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:35.520
But they always, for me, had this glamour,
this important glamour, this important mythic

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520
dimension.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.650
And what Charlaine Harris and Stephanie Meyer
are doing is domesticating the vampire.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.659
You know, basically saying it’s the guy
down the road.

00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:46.850
It’s the guy you’re gonna meet at Sam
Merlotte's, you know, when you go for a burger.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.420
Or he’s the guy next to you in biology class
in high school, which really never occurred

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.460
to me.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.409
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know, in the Vampire Diaries,

00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:57.480
it’s the same thing vampire’s in high
school.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.540
It’s a genius stroke but for my immortals
they would not go to high school, you know,

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.879
that would be
[Laughter]

00:22:03.879 --> 00:22:07.640
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: the last option that they would
choose.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.330
But, so I read some of that with a smile,
you know?

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:16.409
But I think, I understand, I’ll admit the
audience loves it obviously, it’s a lot

00:22:16.409 --> 00:22:17.590
of fun.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:22.970
I think the concept of the vampire is so rich
that we’ll see even more surprising developments

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.179
with it.

00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:27.549
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Do you have any predictions
with what’s gonna be the next big?

00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:30.320
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: No, I could never predicted
what I’ve seen so far, so.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: So I wouldn’t try to make

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.640
a prediction.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.970
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So without spoiling the story,
for those that haven’t read The Wolf Gift,

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.679
I was wondering if you could tell us a little
more about Felix Nideck and the six men that

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:45.659
appear in the portrait with him at the estate.

00:22:45.659 --> 00:22:52.890
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well from the very beginning
of the novel, these six men, friends of Felix’s

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:58.309
and Felix who disappeared twenty years ago,
there are, or maybe it’s fifteen years I

00:22:58.309 --> 00:23:03.020
don’t remember the exact number, but they
disappeared and they loom over the book and

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.600
there is a mystery there.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600
Where did they go?

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.679
They, Felix has been declared legally dead,
or the house wouldn’t be for sale and Reuben

00:23:10.679 --> 00:23:13.990
wouldn’t be there writing a story about
the house being for sale.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:20.270
But he falls in love with Felix and really
wants to know more about him and to me that

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.950
was a very interesting mystery to prompt.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.240
What happened to Felix?

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.150
How it happened.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:31.039
Why nobody ever heard from him again and I
had to reveal that as the book went on.

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:35.669
But the real subject of The Wolf Gift is really
Reuben and how Reuben deals with everything

00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:37.419
that happens to him.

00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:42.950
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Right, and The Wolf Gift also,
I think, this is something that I just, always

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.049
appeals to me in fiction there are wonderful
names and I think Reuben Golding is a very

00:23:47.049 --> 00:23:52.520
distinctive name, but Felix Nideck, Margon
Spangler, you have these wonderful, creative,

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.970
unusual names, I wanted to ask you, if, when
you’re developing characters, like, where

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.220
do names fall in the process?

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.700
Do you start with names or do they come to
you as you’re writing?

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.060
Do you have particular places you turn for
inspiration?

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.890
&gt;&gt;Anne Rice: They’re the hardest part.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:10.950
If I don’t have the name of the character
I can’t get going with the character.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.260
Reuben’s name just came to me, I love the
name Reuben.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.220
It seemed perfect for him.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.720
That wasn’t too hard.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.850
But I often have to stop and think a lot about
the other characters name that I have.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.190
And Marchant I made up that name.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.620
I never heard the name Marchant.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.790
And I made it up.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:31.300
But, uh, it’s hard and if you’re dealing
with other worldly characters, characters

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:37.190
from former ages and or aliens or whatever,
it’s very hard now to choose names for them

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:44.210
because names have been used all over the
internet by bloggers and fanfic writers and

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.149
game makers and so forth.

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:51.590
So you can’t just name somebody Malkya you’ve
got to go look and make sure that that’s

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.899
not a major, you know, game character or something.

00:24:54.899 --> 00:24:56.960
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: And so it’s just very difficult.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.789
But I actually go to old name books.

00:24:59.789 --> 00:25:02.440
Jewish baby names are really, really good.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.580
Biblical baby names and I look through any
source for names.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.710
And anytime I’m reading anything that I
come across a really great name, I’ll jot

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:14.539
it down, whether it’s a last name or a first
name.

00:25:14.539 --> 00:25:18.480
And a character’s sometimes born when I
hear that name, like Margon.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.480
[Laughter]

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.480
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That’s good.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.001
That’s such a strong, you just don’t forget
it.

00:25:22.001 --> 00:25:25.429
And I think, you know, said that in the beginning,
your names are really distinctive and those

00:25:25.429 --> 00:25:28.480
characters really fell around them.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.179
Do you have any names, like prior names for
characters now like famous?

00:25:32.179 --> 00:25:36.690
Like that you changed with step or have you
always just known?

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:42.309
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Memnoch the devil, when I created
that character, first he was Maximilian, but

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:44.610
it was much too ordinary a name.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:49.250
I love to make up a name that doesn’t exist
and Memnoch didn’t exist.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.110
Lestat didn’t exist.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.899
Now people are coming up at signings and showing
there’s baby named Lestat.

00:25:54.899 --> 00:25:55.899
[Laughter]

00:25:55.899 --> 00:25:57.390
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Wow, that’s.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.590
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: For about ten years it was pets.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.419
Alice Cooper had a dog named Lestat.

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:04.950
That was great.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.480
Now it’s babies.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.130
The name is working its way into respectability.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.130
[Laughter]

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:15.980
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: One of our fans, Brandon of
Kentucky, asks “With each of your works

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:21.179
your readers find themselves thrust so vividly
into a richly detailed universe, that loving

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:22.800
your worlds and characters is effortless.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.260
Can you describe one of your favorite characters
or places in your new novel and why?”

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.760
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You mean in The Wolf Gift?

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.760
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Yeah.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.070
&gt;&gt;Anne Rice: Well Nideck Point making that
house.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.200
I grew up in love with houses.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.779
And in love with houses in fiction, in Dickens’
Great Expectations there was this incredible

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:42.090
where Miss Havisham lives.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:47.620
This doomed lady who’s still in her bridal
gown thirty years after being stood up at

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.620
the altar.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.980
And Jane Eyre was a novel I loved and there’s
Rochester’s great big spooky house in Jane

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.919
Eyre with the mad woman in the attic.

00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:02.909
And I love to create houses and Nideck Point
in this novel is sort of the tribute to me

00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:06.640
for all the great houses I came to own as
I fulfilled my dreams.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.900
I lived in some pretty spectacular houses
that were a hundred, hundred fifty years old.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.900
I don’t, now.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.820
I live in a very small, very ordinary family
home where I’m very comfortable.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.880
But I had to sort of build Nideck Point almost
block by block, floor board by floor board.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.990
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Added the materials of all those

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.510
other houses, and I love doing that.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:33.309
And I love doing the origin stories, you know,
where vampires came from, where werewolves

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:34.960
came from.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.399
And I loved doing that in this book.

00:27:37.399 --> 00:27:41.760
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That’s one of the questions
I wanted to ask you about because Felix has

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:47.909
this notion about werewolves being an ancient
sort of super race and you know, one of our

00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:53.149
fans, Ben of Salisbury Maryland, said he loved
the Vampire creation mythology and Queen of

00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:58.039
the Damned and he wanted to know if there
were other origin stories that you’ve drew

00:27:58.039 --> 00:28:01.039
upon for The Wolf Gift or did you just create
this?

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:02.961
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I think I created it.

00:28:02.961 --> 00:28:03.961
You never know.

00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:04.961
[Laughter]

00:28:04.961 --> 00:28:06.109
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: But I think I created it.

00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:12.350
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Was there a particular point
in history or culture that was a good spring

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:17.070
board for you in thinking about, sort of,
the wolf lineage.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:22.680
You talk a lot about these tablets and cuneiform,
and there’s something, I don’t know, Tigress

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.610
River to me about the whole, the whole....

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.610
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Yeah.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.950
They’re definitely, in the book, they’re
searching for something and it’s never entirely

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.420
revealed in the book what they’re searching
for.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:38.100
But I took the idea of wolves all the way
back to a time in history when you didn’t

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.289
have just homosapien sapiens but you had a
couple of other species out there.

00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:44.450
I can’t pronounce the names of those other
species.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.169
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: But you know now we’ve found

00:28:47.169 --> 00:28:52.190
fossil evidence that there were at least two
maybe three other species of human that were

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:57.539
also occupying the world at the same time
as homosapien sapiens.

00:28:57.539 --> 00:28:59.200
We outlived the others.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.850
Not just Neanderthal but a couple of others
that were different.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:07.149
And so I’m tracing the werewolves back to
that time in history.

00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:11.210
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And how do they find themselves
in the Northern coast of California.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:18.299
Like, what made you set your cumulative, sort
of, dream house in that beautiful setting?

00:29:18.299 --> 00:29:22.360
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well the presumption is, I think,
without it ever being said is that they're

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.679
all over the world in different places.

00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:29.529
But, they come to that place because it has
the great North Woods, it has the great beautiful

00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:34.060
Redwood forest and they do love being out
in the forest and being beasts.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.529
I mean, they, when they’re not.

00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:40.120
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Running over rooftops and intervening

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.320
and tearing rapists to pieces and stuff, they
also like to hunt and be in the forest and

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.220
just behave like wolf men, like beast men.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.890
I think that’s what drew them to that part
of the world.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.809
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Did you spend time there as
you were writing the book just to, sort of;

00:29:54.809 --> 00:29:57.710
get your mind in that space?

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.600
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: No but I had spent a lot of
time there.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.809
I lived in Northern California for thirty
years before I ever went back to New Orleans

00:30:04.809 --> 00:30:08.110
and, uh, where I lived for eighteen years.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:13.320
But, and, during the time when I lived there
we often went to the Redwoods, to Muir Woods

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.730
and to Marin County and to places in the wine
country and in Mendocino County.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.909
So I was very, very familiar with it.

00:30:20.909 --> 00:30:25.039
Right after I finished the book I did go up
and visit every single place I had written

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:31.049
about and made sure I had not misremembered,
and I had a wonderful time and it turned out

00:30:31.049 --> 00:30:36.000
my memories were quite true to the atmosphere
and the feeling, everything I remembered.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.340
It was wonderful to go back to Muir Woods
after all these years and walk again through

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.679
the Redwoods.

00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:46.220
I stayed in Mill Valley at the hotel where
Reuben stays.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.671
I went to the restaurant where he meets Laura
in the book for breakfast, you know, I love

00:30:50.671 --> 00:30:51.750
to do things like that.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.380
I love to go pick the sets.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.460
But it’s often after the book that I do
that.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:00.399
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Was it very different for
you thinking, like being in that environment

00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:03.460
versus New Orleans where so many of your books
have taken place?

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:08.309
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well to me it was a wonderful
environment because it was also haunted and

00:31:08.309 --> 00:31:15.519
gothic, I mean, the idea, the windy Northern
coast to me is just as mysterious as the English

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:21.350
coast is, so in a novel like Rebecca you know,
where you had Mandalay burning down the coast.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.210
But I find it just a great place to be.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:28.090
To me the forests are gothic and ghostly.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.110
I don’t feel the present of ghosts but I
don’t feel them in big houses in New Orleans

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.590
either, you know?

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:39.970
So I loved exploring that bringing, I guess,
what would be my gothic sensibility to that

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:40.970
landscape.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.529
I’m sure other authors have done it I just
haven’t come across it.

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:46.410
But I found it a natural thing to do.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.440
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Are there other locations
you have in mind for future stories, places

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.570
you’d like to explore?

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.580
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Yeah, but I don’t know what
they’ll be yet.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.539
I really don’t, um, there’s so many places
that I love.

00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:02.309
And the first thing I think about in any new
place is, “What am I gonna write about this?”

00:32:02.309 --> 00:32:03.309
You know?

00:32:03.309 --> 00:32:06.429
What am I gonna write about Google Headquarters?

00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:07.909
[Laughter]

00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:13.460
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Well you have a wonderful
ability to capture, um, the environment that

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.460
you’re in.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.340
I think that house and that certainly those
woods are characters in their own right, so

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.860
much drama happens there and it’s just really
transported right away.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.510
So, I’ve always loved that about your books,
certainly I’ve never been to New Orleans,

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:32.451
but I felt like I had been there time and
again through all the times that I read your

00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:35.389
vampire books.

00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:39.820
Um, let’s see.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:45.440
Before we open up the floor to our audience,
um, I wanted to ask you a few more of our

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.640
fan submitted questions that are here today.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:56.659
Um, Tammy of Kenmore Canada and Valley Tile
of Tarzana Canada, or California that one

00:32:56.659 --> 00:32:59.630
and other fans were interested in your writing
process, in particular, they wanted to know

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:04.250
what kind of research and preparation you
do when you’re starting a new book.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:10.600
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Well, I can do a lot of research,
um, and sometimes way over research because,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.539
you know, researching for me isn’t just
finding the answers to questions or accumulating

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:22.580
facts or details, it’s getting inspiration,
and its ideas, plots, chapters, incidents,

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.090
all that springs to my mind during research.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:29.230
So, it’s a, it’s a wonderful preparation
for writing.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:35.399
But, for the Wolf Gift I didn’t do very
much, I mean, I researched the legends of

00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:41.200
werewolves but I had done that before with
the vampires, so I had read all that material.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.000
And when I researched the witchcraft persecutions
in Europe, I read about all that.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.309
So really I didn’t need to go back and read
very much more.

00:33:51.309 --> 00:33:58.679
Uh, the writing process, once I actually start,
once I make up my mind to leave the dreamy,

00:33:58.679 --> 00:34:03.000
beautiful, seductive, engulfing world of research
and actually get down to work, you know.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.490
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: And narrow down the possibilities,

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.940
I write very fast.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.500
And I plunge, and the hardest part is always
the beginning, it is the worst part.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.530
The first forty, sixty, eighty pages of the
novel take most of the time.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.930
But once it begins to flow, really begins
to roll, I like to get it done in two months,

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:22.100
or three months max.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.280
You know, if it goes any longer than that
it doesn’t bode well for the book.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.750
And it doesn’t, if it’s done in two months,
that’s the best, that’s the optimum period

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:36.750
for me because it’s all fresh in my mind,
it’s all right there and random access memory

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:41.740
is totally there and if I can do it in even
shorter time that’s better.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.220
But, I write all day, I usually start in the
morning.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.860
I get up; drink coffee, read the New York
Times, read the L.A. Times and the Desert

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:51.860
Sun
[Laughter]

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.740
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know the suburban paper
where I live.

00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:00.040
Then I go online and talk to my Facebook people
of the page whom I love and I usually post

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.460
some stories from The New York Times, so we
start talking about politics like the republican

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:10.860
primary or, you know, the war on women in
America and their rights

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.760
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know, things they’re concerned

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.760
about.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.920
And we get into quite a few discussions on
that and I get to work finally around ten

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.640
o’clock, maybe ten thirty.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.941
And when I’m writing a book I’ll work,
from say, ten thirty, break for lunch, go

00:35:24.941 --> 00:35:28.430
back and work all afternoon and knock off
maybe eight in the evening.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:31.770
I don’t like to get totally strung out anymore.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:36.790
Writing eighteen hours straight is too, I
get too crazy when I do that.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.630
And I knock off at eight and usually gravitate
to something that will just take my mind someplace

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.970
else, like I’ll watch a crime show, White
Collar.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.991
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I just watch something that

00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:48.480
diverts, but it’s usually a narrative.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.410
I can’t watch sports, I can’t figure out
what’s happening.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:58.011
I go to watch, I don’t know, Law and Order,
full of 15 million re runs or whatever.

00:35:58.011 --> 00:36:02.840
Whatever will just divert, I mean, if something
wonderful is on like Downton Abbey, I’m

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.930
watching Downton Abbey.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:09.020
Or Pillars of the Earth or Game of Thrones
or whatever, real high quality, whatever the

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.640
highest quality I can get of TV.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.060
And that’s my writing habit.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.260
When the book’s really going well, so that
I get out of bed wanting to know what’s

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:22.880
going to happen, I will just barely do anything,
you know, I work in my flannel nightgown.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.910
I have hundreds of flannel nightgowns.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:26.620
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Like Laura in the book, she

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.620
has hundreds.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.620
[Laughter]

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.620
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Yeah.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.620
[Laughter]

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.620
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I have hundreds of flannel nightgowns.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.620
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: And I live in those gowns if

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.820
I can 'cause it’s the simplest garment,
it’s just a sack.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.840
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You don’t have to worry about

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.840
anything.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.350
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Well you have to be comfortable
if you’re gonna, you know, give yourself

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.350
over to something that...

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.350
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Yes.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.530
Yeah, and that’s one of the great things
about being a novelist is, for me, it’s

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:49.601
that I can work at this thing that I’m totally
engulfed by and obsessed with, it’s just

00:36:49.601 --> 00:36:50.601
divine.

00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:54.830
You know, I’m so thankful that I’ve been
able to do this in my life, wonderful.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.940
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Well if you’re writing these
wonderful books in two months, I think you

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.480
must have a very happy editor.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.910
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: She must love that you have

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.040
such forward momentum.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:12.530
Um, another question from Cornelius Offdark
he says, “Miss Anne Rice, would you ever

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.370
write a werewolf versus vampire novel?”

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.370
[Laughter]

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.650
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I don’t think so.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.070
I don’t think so.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:27.320
In the past I did unite two groups of my people
and I’m not sure it was the best thing to

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:35.070
do, to unite them, Um, I, but they do share
the same world and there’s an organization

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:40.900
I invited called The Talamasca, which is supposed
to be an ancient order of people who track

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.820
supernatural activity in the world.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.780
And they probably will definitely enter the
world of the werewolves, but I’m not sure

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.340
I’ll bring all the other entities out there
into contact with them.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.530
I don’t think there’s any reason why my
vampires would have any problem with my werewolves,

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.530
you know, if they did know each other.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.860
I think they’d be fine with each other.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.860
[Laughter]

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.880
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Band of brothers.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880
[Laughs]

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.501
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Do you ever imagine one of
your own books getting that, kind of, Game

00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:09.110
of Thrones treatment, like seeing it in a
kind of dramatized that way?

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.780
I mean, I know you have some experience with
that.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.960
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: There’s not an author in the
world right now that wouldn’t work with

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.070
HBO on a series like Game of Thrones.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.820
I mean, we all want that.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.860
It’s, we totally want that, but how many
times can you call your agent and tell them

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.860
that?

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.310
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Right now, um, Imagine Entertainment

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:30.890
has optioned to tell The Body Thief, the fourth
of the Vampire Chronicles and they’re gonna

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.510
do that as a movie.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:37.750
But maybe someday in the future, you know,
there could be an HBO series of the Vampire

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.570
Chronicles, I would love it, everybody, who,
I mean we’re in a golden age right now,

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:46.960
I think, of costume, historical, and fantasy
drama on TV.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.000
There’s never been a richer time.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.070
I’ve never seen shows with these production
values like the Game of Thrones series, and

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.250
I thought it was just terrific, really first
rate.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.550
And I think the Tudors and Pillars of the
Earth and Downton Abbey and all the different

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:06.310
costume and historical dramas, the Elizabeth
miniseries about Elizabeth the First, it’s

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.310
just wonderful stuff.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:11.200
Spartacus, I mean it’s over the top and
it’s great, all of that.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.560
So this is a great time for fantasy writers
and writers of historical fiction.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:21.770
It’s just a wonderful time and I think we
all dream of having our stuff done well.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:28.080
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So my last question for you
is from one of our fans, Gerard from San Diego

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.360
asks, “My dear Anne, what message do you
wish the reader to draw from reading The Wolf

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.360
Gift?”

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.130
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Oh, well first of all I want
you to enjoy it and never forget it.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.870
If you don’t enjoy it, forget the rest,
you know?

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:42.870
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know, if it’s not fun

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.210
to read if it’s not enjoyable, if it’s
not exciting, nothing else matters.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:52.310
But I hope it’s about us, it’s about everything
we go through, what we feel about the transformations

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:55.280
we experience and how we have to deal with
them.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.020
I think supernatural fiction doesn’t work
unless it’s really about us.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:05.630
Unless it’s about our souls and our hearts
and how we feel inside as outsiders and how

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:10.950
we feel alienated and how we sometimes feel
like monsters, it’s all about that.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.580
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Thank you.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.580
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Sure.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:17.030
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So we’ll open up the floor
to questions from the audience here.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:22.570
&gt;&gt; male #1: Miss Rice, you’re an unabashed
follower of Christ, how much does that influence

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.570
your writing?

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.030
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I’m sorry, say that again.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:29.150
&gt;&gt; male #1: They say you’re a rather outspoken
follower of Christ.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.720
I was just curious how much that influenced
your writings.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.620
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: A follower of Christ?

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.950
I’m not sure that I am in the way people
generally mean that, you know?

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:42.590
Faith in God is very, very important to me,
but I’ve broken with organized religion

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:52.110
and, um, it was a very long painful experience
for twelve years I tried to be a believing

00:40:52.110 --> 00:41:00.060
member of the religion and my, my break with
faith was theological and social and political

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.650
and it was total.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:06.640
So, I don’t really know, I feel like all
of life is a spiritual quest.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.490
I’ve been on that quest since I was a kid.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:15.140
I’ve been through many phases of it and
now I’m a little bit discouraged, but also

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:19.710
perfectly at peace with knowing that I’m
back with the same questions I was asking

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:20.840
before my conversion.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:26.190
I’m back more with the questions I was asking
when I wrote Memnoch the Devil.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:32.080
Then when I wrote the two novels about Jesus,
that I wrote, but I will say this, writing

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.191
the two novels about Jesus was, for me, a
joyful experience and I think they’re some

00:41:36.191 --> 00:41:38.490
of the best writing I was ever able to do.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.440
They’re not what my readers wanted, basically.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.300
They have, sort of, another entire readership.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:50.280
And I hope someday all of it will be viewed
as having a continuity 'cause I see the continuity

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.330
of the journey.

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:53.491
&gt;&gt; male #1: I see it too, thank you.

00:41:53.491 --> 00:41:54.491
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Sure.

00:41:54.491 --> 00:41:55.491
[Pause]

00:41:55.491 --> 00:42:06.370
&gt;&gt; female #1: Miss Rice, thank you for coming
to Google today, um, my question is, what’s

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:07.370
on your nightstand?

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.760
What’s in your “to be read” pile?

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760
[Laughter]

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:15.440
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Actually a book on mitochondria
by Nick Lane, about cells.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.160
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I’m trying so hard to understand

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.670
how molecular life began in the world, you
know?

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:27.220
How life formed and the kind of strange cell
life that they’re still finding evidence

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:32.020
of and hypothermic vents and things like this,
I’m fascinated by all that.

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.460
But I’m almost scientifically challenged,
I mean, I really can’t understand it.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:41.080
So I look to writers like Nick Lane, who are,
he’s a biochemist and almost a poet of science

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.700
and that’s really what I read.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.510
I read a lot of nonfiction.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.490
I read a lot of books on history.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:54.640
I read some books on trying to get a historical
perspective on this amazing time we’re in,

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.470
where we are experiencing things that really
the world never experienced before, like abundance

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.400
and affluence for most people.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.780
But I don’t read very much fiction at all
and when I do I generally grab up my favorite

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.110
books by Charles Dickens and look to him for
lessons on how to write.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.700
So, anyway, Nick Lane is what’s on my nightstand,
definitely.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.700
[Pause]

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:22.710
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: What’s your favorite Dickens
book?

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:28.150
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Great Expectations for sure,
you know the one with the big house.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.150
[Laughter]

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:30.150
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Of course.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.390
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: And the spooky lady.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.390
[Laughter]

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.610
&gt;&gt; female #2: Hi Anne, thanks for coming today.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.710
I wanted to know how you get over writers
block.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.490
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: How I get over writers block?

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:44.090
The only way to get over writers block is
to write through it.

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:45.610
You have to fake it 'til you make it.

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.770
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You have to remember that you

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.940
can always throw away what you’re doing.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.550
You have to play tricks on yourself.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:56.960
You have to say, “Okay just write and at
5 o’clock throw it out.”

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.120
And whatever you need to release yourself,
something’s inhibiting you, something’s

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.670
telling you you can’t do what you want and
you’ve just got to write through it.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:10.670
And usually that works, and if that doesn’t
work, um, there are certain movies that I

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:16.970
turn to and certain books that almost always
stimulate me and make me want to create.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:23.280
And two of the movies are Amadeus and Immortal
Beloved, a movie about Beethoven.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.720
For some reason when I watch those movies
I want, very much, to write.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.540
And that’ll often do it.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:37.780
And then there are books I pick up and they
can be anything from Anna Karenina by Tolstoy

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:43.300
to the Executioner's Song by Norman Mailer
to a Sidney Sheldon novel called The Other

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.460
Side of Midnight or the Godfather.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:53.110
They’re books where there’s a big narrative
drive and a world that you get engulfed in

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.510
and that will make me want to write.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.280
I’ll get stimulated in that way.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.360
&gt;&gt; female #2: Great.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.620
I have a follow up question.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.010
At what point in your life did you realize
you wanted to become an author?

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:07.811
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I knew when I was a kid that
I wanted to do it and wrote long, long, what

00:45:07.811 --> 00:45:09.420
I called novels but they weren’t.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:15.310
You know, the 25 cent notebook in 1951 probably
had about 50 pages in it.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:19.930
But I wrote stories in the 5th grade and 7th
grade and passed them around.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.600
And I lost sight of it when I went to college,
talk about writers block.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.230
I was blocked for, I guess, eight years.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:31.750
But I was learning so much in college that
I didn’t have much to write, I was absorbing.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:38.360
And then when I was a graduate student at
Berkley, that when I realized that I really

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:44.290
didn’t wanna pursue the PhD in English Lit,
that I really wanted to just write, even in,

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.950
no matter what that meant.

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:49.850
And I withdrew from the program to really
put all my chips in writing.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:56.480
I’d written stuff all along, at various
times in graduate school, not so much as an

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480
undergraduate.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.440
But I remember that moment because it was
hard to get into Berkley and especially for

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.360
someone who had been a bad student, as I had,
and had, kind of, worked their way up to the

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.480
point where they could get accepted in a great
program like that.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.090
And I thought, “If you withdraw this, you
know, you’re life will be maybe filled with

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.880
risks rather than any kind of security.”

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.000
But it was definitely the right thing to do.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.610
I went back to San Francisco State and finished
up my Masters in Creative Writing in English

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:29.880
and ever after really just put all my chips
on writing.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.580
&gt;&gt; female #3: Thanks.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.270
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Sure.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.270
[Pause]

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.860
&gt;&gt; male #2: Hi.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.180
I wanted to know what you thought of the movie,
Interview with a Vampire, and the casting.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.670
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Uh, Interview With a Vampire?

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.240
Well, I liked it.

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:54.880
I was really surprised by how true it was
to the spirit of the book, and how excessive

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.960
it was in the way that the book was excessive,
so I was very, very pleased.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.420
I had never envisioned it with American actors.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.970
I had always thought of it to have British
actors simply because I felt that they did

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:13.210
such a better job of articulating that they
would have the quality of these European vampires

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:17.530
you know, that they would convey it all better.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.350
I felt that it worked.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.740
I felt it was successful for a number of reasons.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:27.320
And as the years passed I came to see that
it was a very rare thing that had happened

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.320
there.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:33.840
The producer David Geffen had pulled all the
stops out to do it on a larger scale and to

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:38.520
be faithful to the book and I was kind of
amazed at what happened.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:42.880
You know, I would say, I can’t watch it
because it’s too personally intense for

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.410
me to watch.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.880
But I feel I was very fortunate to have my
book made into that film.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.800
&gt;&gt; male #2: Um, follow up questions.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:56.760
I know there was controversy with the casting
of Tom Cruise as Lestat, but did you ever

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.150
meet Tom Cruise or speak to him about it?

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:02.590
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: I talked to him a number of
times but only after I saw the film and he

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:08.540
was very charming, very nice guy, very nice
guy, exceptionally nice.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.930
And I was very happy with what he did.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:16.090
Um, you know, could it have been different
with different actors?

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.960
Probably so but I think it was very successful
for what it was.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.010
It really was, it was remarkably faithful.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:25.220
I mean, It’s a very eccentric book, very
eccentric.

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:31.090
And they really did it, and I think Jordan
was a very talented director, still is, exceptionally

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:32.360
talented.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:36.650
But I got over that casting hump, I mean,
you know.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:41.570
I mean, what happened was that I spoke out
against the casting and was very angry about

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:47.750
it but David Geffen sent me an early video
of the finished movie and a lot of people

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:51.450
wouldn’t of done that, I mean that’s a
risky thing to do with a movie that you are

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:54.100
gonna release and you hope will make a lot
of money.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:58.410
But he mailed me that video and I was swept
away by it and I still had his home phone

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:02.670
number from when we had been speaking to each
other and I called him and told him I said,

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:03.840
“It’s really terrific.”

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.050
And that changed everything.

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:10.840
You know my relationship with them and the
movie was pretty successful.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:17.370
It wasn’t as successful as they had hoped
but it was for a long time it was the highest

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:21.090
grossing R rated movie for years, it was the
highest.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.790
&gt;&gt; male #2: Well thank you.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:23.810
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Sure.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:27.070
&gt;&gt; female #4: Hi Miss Rice, thank you so much.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.500
My favorite series are the witches.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.370
If you could speak a little bit to your inspiration
for those.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:36.480
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know, that’s a complicated
story.

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:43.370
I started The Witching Hour when I still lived
in San Francisco and I only had a few chapters

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:46.140
and I didn’t know for sure where I was going
with it.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.560
But something was preventing me from writing
it.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:55.280
And we moved back to New Orleans at that time
and I ended up moving into a house which was

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.400
the perfect house for the Mayfair family in
the novel.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:06.730
And the novel just took off and it is filled
with all of my, um, energy and happiness of

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:12.440
returning to my hometown of New Orleans and
finding it as beautiful as I had remembered.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:20.500
And the novel just unfolded with tremendous
energy and it was in many ways my attempt

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.440
to do great haunted house movie, that’s
the idea I started with.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:30.010
I read The Turn of the Screw by Henry James
right before I plunged into it.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:36.660
And I wanted to do a big dark house, a ghost
that was persistent and horrifying and scary

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:41.380
and I think it was some of the best writing
I’ve ever done at trying to get at the ambiance

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:46.680
of being haunted and being afraid of the vision
that shakes you to the root.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:52.920
But, so much went into those novels, the Mayfair
Witches; they’re everything but the kitchen

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:53.920
sink books.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:58.210
I mean, everything I knew and was feeling
was just going into those books.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:01.150
And the house, I put the house I was living
in in there.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.650
I described everything that was going on.

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:11.320
It was a great, great experience, um, I don’t
think those characters lived for me as much

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:19.730
as the vampires do but only because I felt,
I guess I completed their world in a sense.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.170
But I loved writing them.

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:27.310
&gt;&gt; male #3: Thanks very much for coming to
speak with us today.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:31.210
I wanted to ask about you, I know you’ve
gone through some adaptations of works that

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:34.170
have not been faithful to the material.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:38.420
What comes to mind for example is the film
Exit to Eden.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.700
How does that affect your writing after that
when you feel that what you’ve done has

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.610
been very misinterpreted?

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:49.890
Does it throw you off for your future projects
or are you able to really deal with it?

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.910
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: No, it doesn’t throw me off
in terms of my writing but it does make me

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:58.940
much more cautious when talking with people
who say they want to make a film.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:03.010
I mean, what I’ve learned is, that there’s
no consensus amongst these people as to what

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:05.270
my books mean.

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:11.900
I can think the book is clear, you know, that
it’s all, its priorities are very clear,

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.260
and then they take away something totally
different.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:20.200
The people that made Exit to Eden saw it as
a comedy, just a rocking satirical comedy.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.090
They had no real interest in what it was about.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:27.480
And that was a sobering lesson, a sobering
lesson.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:33.690
And, of course sometimes it’s a grave disappointment
like with the movie Queen of the Damned where

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:37.420
there really was no attempt to be faithful
to the Vampire Chronicles at all there.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:41.830
They simply wanted to take the names and some
of the ideas and make what they called a new

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:43.350
franchise.

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:49.810
And that was very wounding and disappointing
and that set back any effort in Hollywood

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:53.380
to make any more movies based on my vampires.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:54.850
It was devastating actually.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:58.810
But I talked to those people, I know what
they were thinking, there was no getting through

00:52:58.810 --> 00:52:59.810
to them.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:04.940
They had no interest in the readers, they
had no interest in talking to me they simply

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:09.180
said we’re going for a new franchise here.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.310
That was what they wanted to do.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:16.450
So, it doesn’t affect my work so much as
it affects my relationships with them.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:21.190
You can take the attitude of take the money
and run or you can take the attitude of be

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:26.230
very, very careful and try to control what
happens.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:30.790
But the truth is, I don’t think an author
ever can control what happens unless you,

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:34.310
for some reason, have an enormous amount of
power.

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:38.400
Even if you do, even if you’re the producer
on the project you have a lot of power you

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.060
can still be completely overruled.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.470
You can sit down with people who are your
friends and they’ll sit there and nod at

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:47.733
everything you say then they will turn around
and do something so different in that movie

00:53:47.733 --> 00:53:52.630
or musical or whatever that you just be aghast.

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.510
That happens all the time in Hollywood.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:59.020
One great thing about being a novelist is
it’s not a collaborative art form.

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.640
You do it all yourself.

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.390
You know, all yourself.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:04.720
And if your editor says, “I don’t get
this part.”

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.160
You can always say, “Well I do.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.240
Shall we go to press?” and usually they
will.

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.930
Or if she says, “Can you make this a little
clearer?”

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:14.700
Usually you can, but it’s not collaborative.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.360
It’s not like Hollywood where they come
in and just change everything and you have

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:25.760
eight, ten, twelve people involved in every
decision to where there’s no singularity

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.320
of vision—to use [inaudible name] phrase—there’s
no singularity of vision controlling the project.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.770
&gt;&gt; male #3: Thanks very much.

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:34.230
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Sure.

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:37.170
&gt;&gt; male #4: Thank you for coming.

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:41.010
I’m curious about what got you inspired
to write books like Violin

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.470
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Can you talk up?

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:43.470
&gt;&gt; male #4: Of course.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:47.490
I’m curious about what got you inspired
to write books like Violin and Cry to Heaven?

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:54.360
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know, I love music with
all my heart and if there’s anything I would,

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:59.580
I dreamed of being it was a musician, a violinist
or a singer.

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.380
And I don’t have any musical talent at all.

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.380
[Laughter]

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.640
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: You know I tried.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.290
Nothing.

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:13.570
And those books are filled with my love of
music and the way I perceive, and the musician

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:15.930
is a tragic hero or heroine.

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:20.610
And I tried in those books very much to get
what the world of music was like and what

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.250
music itself was like.

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:32.080
That’s what they were trying to do, you
know, and to me there very, very personal

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080
books.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:37.920
They have a lot to do with what art is and
what art demands of us and how we can save

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.270
ourselves in art.

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.330
How we can save ourselves through art.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:46.730
And I think the subtext of Cry to Heaven too
is that you can save yourself through sexuality

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:50.670
in art even when horrible things happen to
you.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:55.760
You can through love and sexuality and music,
you can redeem yourself.

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.190
You can live a great, heroic and productive
life.

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:01.350
&gt;&gt; male #4: Thank you.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:02.970
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Sure.

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:09.820
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Well if you don’t have any
other questions I hope you’ll join us downstairs

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.910
in [inaudible] to meet Anne and to have your
book signed.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:16.190
And if you don’t have a book, to purchase
a book.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:20.110
I’d like to thank you all for being here
today for this wonderful event.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.370
&gt;&gt; Anne Rice: Thank you.

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:21.680
[Applause]
