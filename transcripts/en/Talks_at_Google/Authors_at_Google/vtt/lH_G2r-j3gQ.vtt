MIKE: Welcome to Google
Atlanta's first Authors

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.955
AtGoogle talk.

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:11.000
It's a bit of an accomplishment
for us.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.870
Today, we have Thomas Huynh,
who will be addressing the

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.273
ongoing relevance and the
contemporary applications for

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:18.680
Sun Tzu's "Art of War."

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.660
Thomas has an MBA from
Vanderbilt University and has

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.060
been studying "The Art
of War" for 20 years.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.430
In 1999, he found sonshi.com,
which is now regarded as one

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.571
of the foremost resources on the
internet for "The Art of

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:35.830
War." In 2008, his
"The Art of War--

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.955
Spirituality for Conflict"
was published.

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:40.770
And this book is his new
translation of "The Art of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.540
War" combined with
his annotations.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.840
Please welcome Thomas Huynh.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.085
THOMAS HUYNH: Thank you, Mike.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:52.394
I appreciate the introduction.

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:55.080
OK, so I'm going to
get used to this.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.140
Well, anyways, like what
Mike was saying, my

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.290
name's Thomas Huynh.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.270
I'm the founder of sonshi.com.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.560
And the title of my presentation
today is "Sun Tzu

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.240
and You," because I want to
emphasize the fact that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.620
despite Sun Tzu's being 2,500
years old, it's still relevant

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.250
to our modern world.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.340
And at the individual level,
it's relevant to you as well.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.080
So I thought I could
clear up--

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.090
discuss the elephant in the
room, what is it in it for you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.580
to spend some time with
me here today?

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.770
Well, you'll learn a little bit
about "The Art of War" and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.750
what the big deal is about.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.050
You might have heard about "The
Art of War" through a

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.410
newspaper article or maybe
through a friend--

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.800
they might have recommend
it to you.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.702
I've heard professors
would recommend the

00:01:49.702 --> 00:01:51.770
book to their students.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.660
Well, to me, it's a big deal.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.646
And we'll find out a little
bit about it in our

00:01:57.646 --> 00:01:59.960
presentation.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.410
And hopefully you will see
clearly how it can help you in

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.280
your life, because we all
experienced conflict and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.100
competition in all
of our lives.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.730
OK, so the flip side of the coin
is, what's in it for me?

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.730
Why am I here spending the
time with you here today?

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.390
Well, I understand--

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.440
I think Mike promised that
Google would change the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.680
algorithm where sonshi.com
would be number one.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.230
Anyways, just kidding on that.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.001
Seriously, this is what
I like to do.

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.340
I like to share Sun Tzu's "The
Art of War" to as many people

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.790
as possible, because I think the
book can be a big benefit

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.940
to everyone who reads it.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.820
And I've been doing this at
sonshi.com since 1999.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.240
And before that, I studied
the book for 10 years.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.320
And so it's been about 10
years since we started

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.250
sonshi.com.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.915
And that's pretty much the same
time Google was founded.

00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:05.165
That's quite interesting
there.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.230
Having been born in Saigon,
Vietnam, as you know, it's a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.260
war-torn country.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.680
It's better, but it's still
a communist country.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.350
But you can kind of understand
why the subject of war

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.590
fascinates me and it's an
important issue to me.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.690
And if all political leaders,
and even tyrants, if they were

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.980
to read and understand, and even
apply the book, I believe

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.110
that all existing wars
would literally stop.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.070
Literally.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.220
And in fact, all future wars
would be prevented altogether.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.670
So that's how much I view "The
Art of War," and how important

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.075
it is in our society.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.760
What this presentation is not.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.936
Thought I'd review it
with you real quick.

00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.460
It's not about China.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.160
I know it's a hot topic
nowadays, but unless it's

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.180
related to Sun Tzu, we're not
going to talk about China.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.600
We're not going to talk about
what are the best translations

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.089
out there--

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.310
the Chinese characters
and whatnot.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.630
These two subjects-- these two
items, we have very, very good

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.060
experts on these two items.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.766
And so some of them are
part of sonshi.com.

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:33.640
My role at sonshi.com is more
of a liaison between the

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.550
scholars and the
general reader.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.826
We won't be going through every
concept of "The Art of

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:42.990
War." It'll take
too much time.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.140
This is just to get
your feet wet.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.305
And most definitely, I won't be
changing your belief system

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:52.820
if you have a religion or
something like that.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.610
I won't be trying to do that.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.050
If anything, Sun Tzu's
teachings would only

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.927
complement whatever
you believe in.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.120
OK, so this presentation,
there's only

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.100
one very simple goal.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.660
And that is to get you
interested and start reading

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.340
about Sun Tzu's "The Art of
War." And then perhaps

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.370
understand it a little bit and
ultimately apply it to your

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.430
life because, again, I believe
it will be a big benefit.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.000
Let's discuss about the
background behind Sun Tzu and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.080
his "Art of War" book.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.000
What we know now as China, back
in 500 BC, it's what they

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.700
call the Spring and
Autumn period.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.910
It was composed of 13
separate states.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.150
And Sun Tzu was born
in the state of Qi.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.060
And he was later employed
by the state of Wu.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.440
And he wrote "The Art of War"
kind of like a resume, what

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.990
we'd consider a resume now,
to be employed by

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.130
the state of Wu.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.570
And so when the ruler
of Wu was reading

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.190
this, he was very impressed.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.490
This is his philosophy
on warfare--

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.170
how you would approach
warfare.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.920
What became as "The Art of War"
indeed was the earliest

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.220
work on military strategy.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.470
OK, so a lot of people, when
they envision Sun Tzu--

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.770
excuse me, I'm going to
drink a little bit--

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.770
what they envision about Sun
Tzu, they're taking some old

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.600
guy with a long beard
or whatnot.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.820
But he was only about 30 years
old when he wrote "The Art of

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.660
War."

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.490
And you might be thinking, man,
that seems a little bit

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.220
young to know anything
about war.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.720
But consider this.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.350
His father was an accomplished
general.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.490
His grandfather was a
provincial governor.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.460
And their entire family is
very focused on military.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.290
So it's not unlike Mozart.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.600
A lot of people think Mozart
is a genius, and he is.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.090
But his father was a worldwide
famous composer.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.530
And his father literally quit
his job to focus on little

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.130
Wolfgang, trying to help him
study music and whatnot.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.850
And so by the age of
15, Mozart was

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.550
composing his own music.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.560
Well, this is Sun
Tzu at age 30.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.960
And so by this time, you
know that he's studied

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.880
all the past battles.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.250
He's gone with his father
to know the inner

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.080
workings of the army.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.260
And so--

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.835
but of course, the proof
is in the pudding.

00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:55.530
Is he competent at that age?

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.210
Well, he was hired by
the ruler of Wu.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.510
And what he did was--

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.160
the state of Wu was one of the
smallest, if not the smallest,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.320
of all the 13 states.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.750
So they had very limited
resources.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.050
Yet he was able to help them
capture the capital city of

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.830
the largest state of
the 13 states, the

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.530
capital city of Ying.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.045
And so everybody took notice
after that and said, man, who

00:08:25.045 --> 00:08:26.080
is this guy?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.650
I want to know a little
bit about him.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:34.754
And so "The Art of War" was
treasured from day one.

00:08:34.754 --> 00:08:41.220
And so it's never been lost or
burned or anything like that.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.010
You might have heard that
Chinese emperors have a

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.100
tendency to burn books,
especially books that counter

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.560
to their philosophy.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.170
Well, "The Art of War"
wasn't one of them.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.330
And a lot of Chinese works
have been lost due to

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.550
generations, not through
intent but

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.640
just through neglect.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.320
But again, "The Art of War"
wasn't one of them.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.170
So it's still with us.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.690
And that's why it's
such a big deal.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.910
Not only is it still
here, it's still

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.400
being actively used.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.790
And not only in China, where it
originates, but it's also

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.620
here in the United States.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.630
And so I thought to go through
some of where it's being

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.880
applied here in America.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.030
War colleges.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.790
No surprise there.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.630
It's a military work.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.860
And so it's being studied at
the Naval War College, the

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.110
Army War Colleges.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.990
What might be interesting is
that it's required reading for

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.660
all US Marine Corps officers.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.250
And as you know, the Marine
Corps are the

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.870
first ones into battle.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.320
And so they don't like fluff.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.690
They like something
that's relevant.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.500
Another principle that they
believe in is "leave no man

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.300
behind." Sounds like a very
compassionate principle, but

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.925
it's also very effective.

00:10:15.925 --> 00:10:20.220
If you think about it, you
have an organization that

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.140
values you enough to come back
for you, you're going to work

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.010
hard for them.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.130
So anyways, the reason
why I know this is we

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.130
interviewed a general.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.590
His name is General
Charles Krulak.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.590
He was the 31st commandant
at the US Marine Corps.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.050
And he tells us that he
installed this policy because

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.830
he knows that it would help the
officers out in the field.

00:10:47.794 --> 00:10:52.270
Well, here's the bombshell
here, I think.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:57.340
Not only is it applicable to the
US Marine Corps, but all

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.080
of the US Armed Forces.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:06.380
The current secretary of
defense, Robert Gates, when he

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.220
was first hired by President
George W. Bush in 2007, he had

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.380
to get in front of Congress and
explain to the US Congress

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.490
why he would be different and
better than his predecessor.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.525
And so both in March and in May,
he went in front of them

00:11:23.525 --> 00:11:27.830
in public and he quoted Sun
Tzu's "The Art of War." And

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.740
right after he cites it, he
says, this is the general

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.000
approach to how we will
secure America.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.745
So as you know, his reputation
is second to none now.

00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:42.010
He is still the secretary of
defense under the Obama

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.400
administration, under a
different political party.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.230
And so I'm glad, obviously,
that he is using Sun Tzu's

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.410
"The Art of War" as
a part of his

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.995
curriculum to secure America.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.380
It's being studied at the
graduate business schools.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.250
As Mike was telling you,
I received my MBA from

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.070
Vanderbilt University.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:13.670
And in our business strategy
class, we studied two concepts

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.890
that came straight out of Sun
Tzu's "The Art of War."

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.340
It's really no surprise, because
there are successful

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.530
companies that employ Sun
Tzu's "The Art of War"--

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.840
especially in Asia, but here
in America as well.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:32.790
The really documented ones are
Oracle and salesforce.com.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.870
The founder of Oracle,
some of you might

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.800
know, is Larry Ellison.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.640
And he quotes the book a lot.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.760
And he really likes the book.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.840
And I think his house is some
sort of Japanese fortress or

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.480
palace or something like that.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.850
He actually flew Japanese
craftsmen here to America just

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.622
to build his house, because
he has a lot of money,

00:12:56.622 --> 00:12:58.330
apparently.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.960
His protege is Mark Benningham,
who founded

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.740
salesforce.com.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.880
And Salesforce, as some
of you might know, is

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.560
a partner of Google.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.220
And Mark said in one of the
interviews, he says,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.290
salesforce.com would look very
different today it wasn't for

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:19.410
Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.920
And I would like to quickly
mention that Mark has a new

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.970
book coming out on
November the 9th.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.000
It's called "Behind the Cloud,"
and it chronicles the

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.290
beginning days of
salesforce.com.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:36.742
He will also outline how you can
run successful companies.

00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:42.430
So just make sure you pre-order
from Amazon.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.090
And of course, there are other
areas where Sun Tzu's "The Art

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.200
of War" is being used, but I
thought I'd put down something

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.860
cool and current.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.155
Anybody a hard rock fan here?

00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:54.870
Come on, it's OK.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.176
There's a lot more
than you'd think.

00:13:58.176 --> 00:14:00.150
OK.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.870
Anyways, Megadeth--

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.515
and I don't know if you've
heard about Megadeath.

00:14:03.515 --> 00:14:05.890
It's one of the more
famous ones.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:06.740
The front man--

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.100
Dave Mustaine--

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.760
his favorite book is Sun Tzu's
"The Art of War." And their

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.580
upcoming album is called
"End Game." It's a

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.530
reference to chess.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.195
And so to of the songs, he
says, is based off of Sun

00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:22.325
Tzu's "The Art of War." So make
sure you check that out

00:14:22.325 --> 00:14:26.260
on September the 15th.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:26.660
OK.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:32.790
So we talked about famous people
and high-level stuff

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.520
like military.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.030
But how does it apply to you
on an individual level?

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.330
So what I'll do is I'll start in
general, the general sense,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.860
and then narrow it down
a little bit.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:49.820
So the logic is this.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.610
We all experience conflicts and
competition in our lives.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:57.250
And we will continue to
experience competition and

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.330
conflicts in our lives.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.640
That, I believe, is true.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.830
So Sun Tzu had experienced war,
which is the ultimate

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.160
test of conflicts
and competition.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.440
This is--

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.640
you have to win it.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.750
There's no leeway.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.910
There's no second chances,
because you're talking about

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.160
people's lives here.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.030
And because Sun Tzu has
succeeded at warfare, the

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.030
ultimate contest--

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.850
and if anybody has gone through
warfare, you would

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.410
think everything else related
to conflict and competition

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.820
would be a walk in the park.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.130
And so at the very least,
let's see what--

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.681
I'm sure we can learn a thing
or two about it from him.

00:15:43.681 --> 00:15:44.635
So let's--

00:15:44.635 --> 00:15:48.930
I'm going to narrow it down a
little bit for you, and how

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.490
the stuff that Sun Tzu dealt
with are pretty much the stuff

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.870
that you guys have dealt with.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:02.250
And so I'm trying to relate to
what he has gone through to

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.150
what you are going through
right now.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.860
He wasn't the CEO.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.660
He wasn't the ultimate decision
maker, as I was

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.340
telling you.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.780
He reported to the
ruler of Wu.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.530
But he also reported to a
higher ranking general.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.440
I don't know if you
guys know that.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.620
So he has to work with
superiors, like a lot of us.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.830
And like a lot of us, we have
people reporting to us.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.610
And so he had to motivate
them to--

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.290
especially on things that your
employees, your direct reports

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.630
don't like to do.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.280
If you think about it, you're
talking about sending--

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.080
in his case, you're send people
out into battle to risk

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.870
their lives.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.350
I don't think there's any
situation in business that you

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.780
have to motivate people
that much.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.220
But if he can handle it, I'm
sure he can teach us a thing

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.680
or two about motivation.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.780
He had limited resources.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.990
Like I was telling you, he was
working for the state of Wu.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.290
If he was working for the
largest state, you would say,

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.630
yeah, he was successful because
he had vast resources.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.685
But he didn't.

00:17:18.685 --> 00:17:19.935
Yet he was successful.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.660
And he also wanted the
boss off his back.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.089
This is something that he
actually talked about in "The

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:29.890
Art of War." He says,
no meddling rulers.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.950
He thinks that the general
has the best

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.540
knowledge out in the field.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.770
He doesn't want anybody up in
the ivory tower to tell him

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.020
what to do.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.430
So given all that--

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.190
the constraints and also
the opportunities--

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.620
he had to produce results, like
I think every one of us

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.780
are expected to achieve our
goals and objectives.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.250
And so no excuses allowed.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.970
So because he has dealt with a
lot of the stuff that I'm sure

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.680
a lot of us have dealt with,
maybe we should listen.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.340
OK, so we're at a stage where
I'm sure you're probably

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:14.050
thinking there are some things
that you've heard about "The

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.610
Art of War." And so I'm going
to address two concerns.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.550
One is a very common one, which
is "The Art of War" is

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.190
about ruthlessness.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.210
Why are you promoting a
book that's ruthless?

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.381
And here's how I feel
about that.

00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:31.150
In internet terms, he's a
complete newbie, because

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.210
apparently this person has
not read the book.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.710
Probably heard a little
bit about it.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.580
And certainly if that person has
read it, he or she didn't

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.930
understand it, because I will
present to you three quotes

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.850
from "The Art of War" that
will counter this

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.490
ruthlessness claim.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.960
He says the good general
looks upon his

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.400
troops as his own children.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.650
I want to clarify
something here.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.530
He's not talking about
treating your

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.185
employees like children.

00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:09.140
He's talking about treating them
like your own children.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.810
When you're sending them out
into battle, you want to make

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.210
sure they're prepared and
that they'll come back.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.970
They're your own children,
for goodness' sake.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:21.573
So you're always looking out
for their best interest.

00:19:21.573 --> 00:19:28.080
The second one is, treat the
captured soldiers well.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.670
This is prisoners of war that
we're talking about here.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.650
This is 1949 Geneva Convention
stuff in a

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.440
2,500-year-old book.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.810
And in 500 BC, when Sun Tzu was
living, you have 13 states

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.020
fighting for power.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.880
At any time, any one of
them can be attacked.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.410
If there was a time where
ruthlessness is justified,

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.970
that was the time.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.510
Yet, he still believes in
this principle, which is

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.760
extraordinary.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.340
Do not thwart an enemy
retreating home.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:11.420
This is him letting his enemy
escape because he believes in

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.340
the long term.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.346
He doesn't believe in
the short term.

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:16.050
His thinking is this.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.430
He has already accomplished
his mission

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.830
by winning the battle.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.800
There's no point in emphasizing
revenge--

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.300
emphasizing the emotional
aspects of things.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:31.210
Let them go, because long term,
he's not creating any

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.020
more enemies.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.470
Short term, yes.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.630
They might be causing him
trouble later on.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.350
But long term, he's not creating
any more enemies and

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.160
not inciting hatred.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.650
A lot of cynics might say, the
reason why he's letting them

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.040
go is because it's very hard to
destroy them because they

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.710
will fight to the death.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.730
But my point is--

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.300
my reply to that would be you
can still destroy them because

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.730
they'll cause you trouble
later on.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.540
But again, Sun Tzu was
thinking long term.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.235
And I believe this is the
problem in the Middle East, by

00:21:03.235 --> 00:21:07.030
the way, because a lot of people
now are so focused on

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.490
the short term, killing
as many of

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.560
their people as possible.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.800
But they don't realize the
long term, inciting and

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.090
creating generations
of hatred.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.920
So Sun Tzu was very well
aware of this.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.400
And I think it would have been
good were a lot more people

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.705
can listen to Sun Tzu here.

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:31.855
OK, the second concern might
be about deception.

00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:34.230
Yes, "The Art of War" talks
about deception.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.990
And this is--

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:40.600
I'm going to illustrate why it
would still be justified.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.340
OK, scenario number
one is this.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.900
You trick the enemy into not

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.090
attacking you through deception.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.490
You're appearing stronger than
you really are, let's say--

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.890
something like that.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.110
OK, so that's deception.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.880
Scenario number two is
you're completely

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.800
honest about things.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.450
Hey, here, look at me.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.650
And if you happen to be weaker
than your enemy, he's going to

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:06.990
go attack you.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.683
So which scenario
is most humane?

00:22:10.683 --> 00:22:13.570
The point I'm trying to
drive here is this.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.610
Deception itself is not bad.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.265
It just depends on
the situation.

00:22:18.265 --> 00:22:24.370
And this is analogous to the
game of basketball, because if

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.870
you're trying to go for the
basket and you're going to

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:28.920
faint to the right--

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.640
and so it draws all of your
opponents to the right.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.490
But then you go into sidestep
to the left to go to the

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.365
basket like Michael
Jordan untouched.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.700
That's deception.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.930
Or you can be completely
honest and go

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.570
straight to the basket.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.030
And so that would require you to
elbow your way in, knocking

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.480
people down.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.580
And if you're lucky, you're
going to get to the basket.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.630
Well, which method is
most effective?

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.370
Which is most elegant
and would draw the

00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.620
least amount of hatred?

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.510
OK, so don't get me wrong.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.930
Sun Tzu is all about winning.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.110
But only winning wisely.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.440
Because here's why.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.650
Short term, not at
any and all cost.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:23.510
When you're presented with an
opportunity to gain victory,

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.040
but if it's costly, he would
say, just wait it out.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.730
Make sure the timing's right.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.261
Just wait for the
right moment.

00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:33.506
No Pyrrhic victories.

00:23:33.506 --> 00:23:36.140
Pyrrhic victories are victories
that you gain--

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.770
you still have victory, but
it's going to cost you.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.070
He doesn't believe in that.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.430
There has to be a net
benefit there.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:47.947
So I thought I'd quote this
from "The Art of War." "To

00:23:47.947 --> 00:23:50.857
gain a hundred victories in a
hundred battles is not the

00:23:50.857 --> 00:23:51.585
highest excellence.

00:23:51.585 --> 00:23:55.222
To subjugate the enemy's army
without doing battle is the

00:23:55.222 --> 00:24:00.770
highest of excellence." So by
anybody's account, winning a

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:01.705
hundred battles straight--

00:24:01.705 --> 00:24:04.090
I mean, how much better
can you do than that?

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.990
That's extraordinary.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.930
But Sun Tzu says, there
is something better.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.950
It's winning without
ever fighting.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.470
I think that's both humane
and smart, because--

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.830
here's why.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.530
When you're winning a hundred
battles straight, which is

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.830
pretty extraordinary, are you
really gaining all that much--

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.690
meaning there's a huge
cost to battling.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.600
There's always a cost.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.910
All you know sure is this-- if
you can win without resorting

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.560
to battle, your gains
are full.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.030
And if there's cost, there's
going to be very little cost.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.180
So your gains are
almost all full.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.290
So in business terms, this is
almost like, do you want to

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.030
run a big company or
do you want to run

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.420
a profitable company?

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:55.030
This is like return on
investment, return on assets,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.950
and capital.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.580
So that's what he's talking
about here.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.440
OK, so just to drive
home the point.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.240
So you have sales of
a billion dollars.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.430
That's awesome.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.395
But what's the cost?

00:25:07.395 --> 00:25:10.538
If the cost is a billion and
one, not as impressive.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:25.890
Sun Tzu starts out "The Art of
War" discussing five factors.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:30.390
And these are the factors which
would determine whether

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.350
you will win or face defeat.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.020
And I thought it would be
interesting to review them

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.932
with you here.

00:25:36.932 --> 00:25:40.260
OK, the first factor is
the way, or the Tao.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.470
I don't know if you guys
know about the Tao.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.640
This is Sun Tzu's own
definition of

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.000
the Tao, or the way.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.560
This is you, your superiors, and
the people who report to

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.580
you all on the same page.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.970
You're all aligned to go towards
this single mission.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.930
So if you're all doing
that, guess what?

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.296
The chances of gaining
victory is increased.

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:09.830
The second factor is heaven,
which is an environment.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.650
Sun Tzu's heaven is more into
weather, because it's a

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.400
military issue.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.990
But in business, it might
be about the US economy,

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:22.590
something you have completely no
control over but something

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:23.840
that you have to deal with.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.150
Ground.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.750
This is your environment,
but it's more immediate.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.740
This is your market,
your industry--

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.000
so even though you can't really
control it, you can

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.490
maneuver around it, meaning--

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.890
Google's not going
to be in clothing

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.900
retailing anytime soon.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.100
That's not your strength.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.300
That's not your weaknesses.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.090
It won't accentuate your
strengths or negate your

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.040
weaknesses.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.950
You're going to focus
on search.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:27:00.400
You're going to focus on cloud
computing, that type of thing.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.620
So it's within your control
in that sense.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.600
OK, so the fourth factor
is the general.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.880
That's you, the leader.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.565
And I bolded it because we'll
discuss it in the next slide.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.940
The fifth factor's law.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.650
This is whether everybody's
trained, whether they've been

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.250
practicing in controlling
down expenses.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.570
So that's what law is about.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.780
So OK-- so let's talk about
general a little bit.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.490
This is the leader.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.470
And I thought it would be cool
to highlight this, because I

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:41.670
believe it's the centerpiece
of the five factors.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:46.000
So here are the five attributes
of general.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.220
Wisdom, credibility,
benevolence, courage, and

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.640
discipline.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.640
When's the last time you've
seen something like this?

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.480
If someone were to have these
five attributes, would you not

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.680
follow this person to the
ends of the Earth?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.390
And if you have these five
attributes, wouldn't anyone

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.370
want to follow you to the
ends of the Earth?

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:14.820
And so formally or informally,
CEO or not, if you have these

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.370
five attributes, you are
indeed the leader.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.710
And you're helping drive the
company towards victory.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.700
I thought I'd highlight
this as well.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:33.180
OK, here's another reason why
Sun Tzu can help you.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.940
He also discusses
ego and emotion.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.700
If you've been in business,
and you've been around the

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.720
block in business a few times,
you know ego and emotions at

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.780
inappropriate levels can
kill your career.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.200
And if you run your
own business, it

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.680
can kill your fortune.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.450
And so this is what
Sun Tzu says.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.857
"Those angry will be happy again
and those wrathful will

00:29:00.857 --> 00:29:02.072
be cheerful again.

00:29:02.072 --> 00:29:05.578
But a destroyed nation
cannot exist again.

00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:08.760
The dead cannot be brought
back to life."

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.810
What he's saying here is this.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.940
Your emotions and your egos
are all temporary.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.060
And he says don't act upon it
immediately, because if you do

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.800
act upon it, those actions
will create permanent

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.100
consequences.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.820
Yeah, you might say you're
sorry, but you know nobody

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.910
would forget.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.695
But there might be even worse
consequences later one.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.940
He's also saying this.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.796
"Before doing battle, in the
temple one calculates and will

00:29:38.796 --> 00:29:44.265
win." This is meaning, if you
have a major decision you need

00:29:44.265 --> 00:29:49.550
to make, go to a quiet place
like the grotto over here,

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.440
somewhere quiet, because it is
literally impossible for you

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.620
to make a rash decision there.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.650
You will be more aligned with
reality, and so you can make

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.130
better decisions there.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.805
So the takeaway is this.

00:30:04.805 --> 00:30:09.490
You might have a very tough
problem ahead of you.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.870
You might face a
lot of issues.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.810
But Sun Tzu says you can handle
it, because if you stay

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:21.265
calm and cool in a quiet place,
you can handle it.

00:30:21.265 --> 00:30:23.810
And even if you don't feel like
it-- because it's worse

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.980
enough that you have all
these enemies out there

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.120
competing with you.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.430
The worst thing you can do
is become your own enemy.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.910
He also discusses
the environment.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.770
He thinks it's so important
that he devotes two entire

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.390
chapters out of 13 chapters
on the environment--

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:49.560
mostly on ground, as I
discussed previously.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.550
So basically, what he's
saying is here.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.517
Study it, know it, and most
of all, adapt to it.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.610
So in these two chapters, he's
discussing about 16 grounds.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.800
And he says, OK, here's
the specific grounds.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.880
Here's the description
of this ground.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.350
Here's how you can react
to it and approach it.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.700
So very specific.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.050
But then he has this chapter
called "Nine Changes"--

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.690
nine changes meaning
infinite changes.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.860
He's saying there will be times
when you will experience

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.130
something that is
unprecedented--

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.310
you've never seen it before.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.370
What he's saying is this.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.290
Do what's most appropriate.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.510
And if need be to be effective,
break the rules to

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.896
be effective.

00:31:36.896 --> 00:31:38.500
And so the takeaway is this.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.150
Yes, learn from history.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.630
Understand history and
learn from it.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.780
But make sure you use your brain
in unprecedented future

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.030
situations.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.400
So I thought I'd conclude and
summarize by putting Sun Tzu

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.150
in a nutshell.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.810
And I'll be talking about
three concepts here.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:05.500
So the first concept is to
control yourself, because

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.960
there's nobody else you can
control but yourself.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.940
You can't control
other people.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.415
Certainly, you can't control
the environment.

00:32:12.415 --> 00:32:15.790
But if you can control yourself,
you can have

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:20.920
influence on people around
you, weather they're your

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.170
friends or your enemies.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.060
You adapt to your environment.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.520
And you know you're adapting to
your environment well if it

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.030
accentuates your strengths and
it negates or minimizes your

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.460
weaknesses.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.230
And so what it does is it
gives you power and

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.070
effectiveness to deal with all
the things you have to deal

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.516
with, especially around
other people.

00:32:46.516 --> 00:32:50.700
OK, the third one, I think, is
most important-- is you never

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.540
sell off your principles.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.360
These are the non-negotiables
that you go

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.410
into a mission before.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.920
There's a reason why you're
accomplishing this mission,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.700
but you're not going to ever
touch this non-negotiable

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.460
island, whatever it might be.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.700
Here's what he says.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.695
He says, "The general who does
not advance to seek glory or

00:33:10.695 --> 00:33:13.837
does not withdraw to avoid
punishment, but appears for

00:33:13.837 --> 00:33:16.590
only the people's security
and promotes the people's

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.090
interests is the nation's
treasure." What he's saying

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.470
here is this.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.230
Set aside your ego.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.090
Set aside your emotions.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.440
Focus on your goal.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.090
Focus on gaining that victory,
because guess what?

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.580
Once you get that victory, your
reputation is secure.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.950
It'll take care of itself.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.430
So in other words, and in
Google's terms, you can--

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.660
fill in the blank-- or
you can be successful

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.380
without doing evil.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.880
And the bottom line is this.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.810
Do what works for you and
vanquish the critics, the

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:52.700
naysayers, and the evil doers,
because the best way to answer

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.720
and vanquish a critic is to win,
or obtain victory, under

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.970
your own terms.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.830
Anyways, to learn more about
Sun Tzu's "The Art of War,"

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:06.080
make sure you check
out sonshi.com.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.820
We've been doing this for
10 years now and I hope

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.375
you can stop by.

00:34:11.375 --> 00:34:16.670
Anyways, so this is the question
and answer section.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.580
I know one person
has a question.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.589
But anyways, does anybody
have questions?

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.214
AUDIENCE: Well, mine's kind
of vague and broad.

00:34:28.214 --> 00:34:31.294
I was just wondering about-- you
mentioned that you think

00:34:31.294 --> 00:34:34.320
the principles in Sun Tzu's
book could end war.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.980
So I'm curious to hear you
elaborate on that, I guess.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.239
THOMAS HUYNH: I'm sorry?

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.449
The principles are
on war, you said?

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.590
AUDIENCE: Could eliminate war.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.110
THOMAS HUYNH: Oh, could
eliminate war.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:55.630
I think I quoted a few quotes
from "The Art of War" where it

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.030
can help end warfare.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.050
But here it is.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.450
I mean, OK, we'll always
have conflicts.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.480
We'll always have competition.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.730
You can't prevent anger.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.980
You can't prevent
a lot of these.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.980
What "The Art of War" does,
and what Sun Tzu is really

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.960
good at, is he approaches it
from the reality standpoint.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.270
He's not a tree hugger or
a peace-loving guy.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:27.690
What he does is he describes
it, he studies it, and by

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.770
knowing what conflict and what
causes conflict, he's showing

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.370
you how to best approach it--
how to end it, and not only

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:39.110
that, how to prevent it.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.520
Excuse me.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.360
It's not unlike cancer.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.280
You ever seen these cancer
research places, they're

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.530
studying the cancer.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:52.145
They're not talking about all
these things-- well, no.

00:35:52.145 --> 00:35:53.230
They're studying the cancer.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.830
They're studying the problem,
like Sun Tzu is

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.120
studying the conflict.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.810
That's how you'll get
to the answer.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.940
That's how you'll
find a cure for

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.040
whatever is ailing society.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.220
So that's why I believe, even
though it is on the art of

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.020
war-- it is on war--

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.890
certainly it is about war.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.460
It doesn't just describe war,
but it also gives you a

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.260
solution to war.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.733
AUDIENCE: So are you saying that
you believe that there is

00:36:19.733 --> 00:36:23.880
an actual solution available
to eliminate war?

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.620
THOMAS HUYNH: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.495
AUDIENCE: Or you think that this
is just something that

00:36:26.495 --> 00:36:29.910
could be figured out
by studying war.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.980
THOMAS HUYNH: Well, I mean, I
think a lot of people can

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.580
resolve conflicts and
competition, and succeed at

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.900
competition, without ever having
to read this book.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.570
I'm not saying that you
have to read this

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.870
book to know the answer.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:48.365
All I'm saying is this is a way
for you to learn about it

00:36:48.365 --> 00:36:50.510
in a more structured manner.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.905
You certainly, through
your experience--

00:36:52.905 --> 00:36:56.440
and these are fundamental
truths, as I would say.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.730
It's been tested through
2,500 years.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.290
So by this time, if it's still
being used, there's something

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.340
to it that just-- oh,
it sounds nice.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.090
Because like I said, this
is the US military

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.750
still using this book.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.375
And it gives them a pretty good
approach as to warfare.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.420
Yes, sir?

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.876
AUDIENCE: Now, I think that
as a kid I read this book.

00:37:19.876 --> 00:37:20.854
It's not really that
long, is it?

00:37:20.854 --> 00:37:23.790
It's really approachable.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:24.810
THOMAS HUYNH: Absolutely.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.120
It is 13 chapters.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.160
And you can literally read
it in an afternoon.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:36.260
But like a game of Go or a game
of anything, it's very

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.570
easy to learn and read it.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:44.390
I'd say it's straightforward
enough for you to understand

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.320
it, but there are some nuances
to it where it

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.315
will take some time.

00:37:49.315 --> 00:37:52.400
But yes, it's straightforward
enough for you to read it in

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.900
an afternoon.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.370
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.350
THOMAS HUYNH: Yes, sir.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:59.065
AUDIENCE: I don't know if you're
associated with any

00:37:59.065 --> 00:38:01.270
existing book out
there or not.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:03.720
So maybe it's not a
valid question.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.710
But the last time I tried to
read Sun Tzu, it was actually

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.740
quite a heavy read, because the
version that I picked up

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.870
had included all the historical
references.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.340
So you're reading it, but then
it's always placing it in

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.260
context of everything that was
going on in China at the time.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:23.730
It made it--

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.690
it kind of felt like you
got lost in the book.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:27.978
Which version would
you recommend?

00:38:27.978 --> 00:38:29.760
I know there's several.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.320
THOMAS HUYNH: Yes.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.310
I might be biased, because I
actually have my own version.

00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:41.820
That book that Mike was holding
up was created by me

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.000
and the editors of sonshi.com,
because we know what that's

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.880
like, because that's why we
created sonshi.com in the

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.640
first place.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.850
Like I said, I'm more of the
user, the liaison between the

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.710
scholars and the
general reader.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.110
As far as--

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:03.440
basically, we have all
of the top scholars--

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.035
was it a red book
that you were--

00:39:05.035 --> 00:39:06.230
AUDIENCE: Yes, with
the black writing.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.800
THOMAS HUYNH: Ralph Sawyer.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.160
He is part of sonshi.com.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.170
Basically, every scholar that's
ever written "The Art

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.955
of War"-- the major ones, the
ones that you see out in the

00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:20.270
bookstore-- they have
helped us or are

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.000
supportive of our website.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.030
So anybody alive out there--

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.910
except Samuel Griffith is
another one, but of course, he

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.510
died already.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.270
Anyways, yes.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:36.100
I know what you mean.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.380
But I think in those type of
books, it's great, because for

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.280
someone like me who's read
"The Art of War" so many

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.270
times, those type of things
are really great.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.270
But for a beginner, it would be

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.680
better to have it annotated.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.260
And that's what a lot of
books are about too.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.370
Something that we've done in
2008 is for every verse, we

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.960
actually explain what
this verse means--

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.950
and not only that,
but how it can be

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:08.470
applicable to everyday life.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:09.660
So I understand.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:13.050
But there are certain people
that really would appreciate

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:16.690
the historical background on
"The Art of War." It might not

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.826
be the best book
to start with.

00:40:18.826 --> 00:40:19.322
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.

00:40:19.322 --> 00:40:20.810
I got about halfway through
it and I was like--

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.870
THOMAS HUYNH: Oh, Ralph Sawyer,
boy--he went to MIT.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:28.310
He went through Harvard.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:29.930
You know, so he's a
regular scholar.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.182
AUDIENCE: It was way--

00:40:31.182 --> 00:40:34.630
yeah, I think it'd be better
as a secondary reference.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.480
THOMAS HUYNH: Oh, absolutely.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.970
He's great, yeah.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.330
Anybody else?

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.440
Oh, yes.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.122
Yes, ma'am.

00:40:43.122 --> 00:40:45.390
AUDIENCE: So what was your
interest in this to begin

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.960
with-- like, how did you sort of
start on this journey that

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.210
now you've been doing
for 20 years?

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.430
THOMAS HUYNH: Like I quickly
mentioned, Vietnam was a

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.710
war-torn country.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:03.850
And so the subject of war
had fascinated me.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.500
Although, when I was young,
when I first picked up the

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.430
book, it wasn't a heavy interest
of mine, because I

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.480
was still a teenager
at the time.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.070
But I'll tell you, once I
picked it up and once I

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.740
started reading it, you get a
sense that, wow, this is an

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.890
incredible book, because not
only does it talk about

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:24.420
warfare, which is--

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.160
it turns a lot of people off.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:32.900
I mean, I can understand
that very much.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.730
But at the same time, the book
has this strange way of

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.480
turning it around, say, hey,
I understand this stuff.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.470
I understand the conflict
and the competition.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.790
But here's how you
can approach it

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.050
in a peaceful manner.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:47.990
And that's really what
Sun Tzu is about.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.350
I mean, who else would promote
something like winning without

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.370
doing battle?

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.900
And say, this is
the best skill.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.525
Never mind about this guy
who's won 100 battles

00:41:56.525 --> 00:42:00.000
straight, because he's not the
highest skilled general.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.180
Someone who's--

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.280
probably not be as famous,
because he's not winning all

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.510
these huge battles.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.630
That's what Sun Tzu--

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.310
that's the type of person
Sun Tzu would value.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:13.220
So a lot of times in the history
books, you might be

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.470
hearing about all these great
generals winning all these

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:18.690
great battles.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.760
But a lot of times, you have
to wonder to yourself, are

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.170
they really the best?

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:28.160
In Sun Tzu's mind, that
might not be the case.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.170
So in a way, that's how
I got interested.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.170
And then it kind of build
up from there.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:37.780
And it actually took me 10
years to actually fully

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:38.970
understand it.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.840
Even then, I'm still learning
from other people.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.976
And so after 10 years, this is
in 1999, I started sonshi.com.

00:42:46.976 --> 00:42:50.750
And so it's been now a
total of 20 years.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:54.550
So it's just something that,
hey, this is a great book.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.290
I thought it was
very important.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.790
And so we got together with
a bunch of people.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:01.980
And so we're still there.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.490
Yes, sir?

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.980
AUDIENCE: I noticed the
title of the talk.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.550
The subtitle is spirituality
of conflict.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:13.090
I was wondering, is that related
to the effect of going

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:13.700
through conflict?

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.805
Like, the experience of it on
the individual in terms of

00:43:16.805 --> 00:43:17.546
growth and development?

00:43:17.546 --> 00:43:20.016
I was curious what
the aspect was.

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.490
THOMAS HUYNH: It's interesting,
because that is

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.700
the subtitle of my book.
"The Art of War--

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:33.350
Spirituality for Conflict."
You know, it's probably--

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.830
the way I was thinking about
it is a lot more mundane.

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.900
It's like, OK, so here's
a very tough

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.360
topic, which is conflict.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.700
It's something that you don't
normally talk about.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.840
But that's part of life, you
see, because that's-- because

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.290
if you win all--

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:54.210
I think there was a "Twilight
Zone" show about this.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.050
This guy was winning
all the time.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:58.840
And he got so bored.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.280
It's not a very fun
life, but--

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.110
conflict is part of life.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:07.030
And how you approach it--

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:10.850
you can approach it in an angry
way, in a very emotional

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.360
and egotistical way.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.260
Or you can approach it
spiritually, which is a lot

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.720
more holistic, where you
can kind of separate

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.020
yourself from the event.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.450
It's kind of like, hm, how
can I describe it?

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.500
It's almost like a video game.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.350
You're presented with all these
issues and problems.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.260
How can you approach it?

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.750
And so that's what spirituality
is about.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.470
It's not some metaphysical
stuff.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:40.770
I'm not into that.

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.130
I'm more into the
practical stuff.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.680
AUDIENCE: Right, sure.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.930
But I mean, as a practical
matter, do you address or deal

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.720
with the fact that--in my mind,
conflict in some way is

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.270
almost like doing strength
training for the muscles is.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:59.010
It's something that's difficult
that you engage in.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.790
And it, in a way, breaks you
down, but also grows you at

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:02.820
the same time.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.090
To me, I guess, conflict seems
like it could have that effect

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.060
on you as a person.

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.220
THOMAS HUYNH: Oh, yes.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.210
Absolutely.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:12.290
Absolutely.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.610
I think the worst thing
that you can do--

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.190
I have a child.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:22.050
The worst thing you can do is
to put your kid in a bubble.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.380
That person needs to be
prepared, because--

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.950
so when you're experiencing all
sorts of conflicts, kind

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:33.090
of like what Sun Tzu
went through.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:37.020
The more conflicts you go
through, the better you are at

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:37.885
approaching it--

00:45:37.885 --> 00:45:42.550
at fine tuning your approach
to conflicts, especially

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.540
intense competition.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.170
And so nobody's perfect
the first time.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.035
And I'm not saying that for you
to master it, you have to

00:45:50.035 --> 00:45:51.200
read "The Art of War"--

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.680
I mean, this stuff has been
around forever and ever.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.830
But Sun Tzu had his approach.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.430
And he was very successful
at doing that.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.080
And here's how he learned
it through all of his

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.290
experiences.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:08.350
Why don't you learn that and
then, obviously, learn from

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:09.520
your experiences?

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.620
That's why he has that chapter,
"Nine Changes." He's

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.130
saying, OK, here's what I'm
describing to you--

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:16.150
all these grounds.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:17.200
But you know what?

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.800
Ignore all that if you find
something that is completely

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.750
different from these
16 grounds.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.130
And use your brain and do what's
most appropriate, even

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.860
if you have to break
the rules.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.810
And that's the beauty of "The
Art of War." He's not into

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:34.240
this dogma or doctrine
type of thing.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.410
And that's the beauty of that
one chapter, is do what is

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:41.590
most appropriate, because you
have the ability to know what

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.710
the answer is.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:46.168
It's just being in a quiet place
and not reacting to it

00:46:46.168 --> 00:46:47.418
immediately.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.370
Anybody else?

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.851
Come on, these are easy
answers here.

00:46:58.851 --> 00:46:59.833
OK.

00:46:59.833 --> 00:47:02.290
AUDIENCE: Did you grow
up in Atlanta?

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:03.170
THOMAS HUYNH: I actually--

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:06.580
I was born in Saigon, like what
I said, and I came here

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:10.470
when I was seven years old
to Seattle, Washington.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.610
That's where I got my bachelor's
degree, is at the

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:16.250
University of Washington.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:21.460
And then later on, I worked
at Georgia Pacific.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:24.130
They actually have
a GP center.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:26.746
Their headquarters is
here in Atlanta.

00:47:26.746 --> 00:47:28.505
That's how I ended up
here in Atlanta.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.470
Thank you, everybody.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.370
I appreciate it.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.670
[APPLAUSE]
