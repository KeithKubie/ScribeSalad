00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.380
 Lee: Korean water is very dark and very cold. 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.720
 People don't usually dive there for fun, but that's what I do. 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.040
 Today's water is calm 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.280
 and we're going to do a wreck dive. 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.640
 It looks so dangerous 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.680
 but when your eyes become accustomed to the environment 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.960
 and you realize that things are moving, 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.320
 It's great to watch them. 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.950
 I saw a fish - so big - and it's absolutely incredible. 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.080
 Then I get very good 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.020
 what I never expected there, 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.110
 such as instant coffee cups, stickers. 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.760
 It's disturbing. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.040
 We must think about conserving the ocean. 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.160
 Diving into the water completely releases me 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
 of the world in which I live; 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.250
 with 20 million people living in and around the city. 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.310
 This again gives me a sense of connection with nature.
