WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.070
Yeah,
I get the same thing where I get people now,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.750
they asked me a question and I give them the answer to exact new,

3
00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:09.660
you're going to say that?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I know.
I know.
I'm one of those people,

4
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:13.080
by the way,
he does that from time to time.
Also,

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.020
how you were talking about kind of breaking the loop in your behavior.
Like,
oh,

6
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:18.540
I want to make a change to that one thing,
you know,

7
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.150
to break the loo and then you start with something small and then it ends up

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.013
affecting more things.

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.270
And you mentioned sometimes it's hard because you don't get pats on the back for

10
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.160
those little things,
you know?
Yeah.

11
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.630
So small that it's humiliating that you even have to do the,
yeah,
yeah.

12
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.890
But in a lot of time,
like to yourself,
it's like kind of big.
Like I'm like,
Oh,

13
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.770
I'm going to drink eight glasses of water a day now.
You know?

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.860
And then it's almost like you're seeking that pat on the back.

15
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:48.240
Like you want to tell your friend like,
hey,
I drink eight glasses of water now.

16
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.650
And they're just like,
yeah.
So,
yeah,
right.
And you're like,
why do I even party?

17
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:56.260
You kind of like,
why do I even do it then if no one's gonna care,
you know?

18
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.091
Well you know there,

19
00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:01.020
there's a lesson to be drawn from that too in terms of relationships that's

20
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.760
really useful psychologically is,

21
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.730
and this is a big mistake that people won't make.

22
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.750
It's like if you want to have a good long term relationship with someone,

23
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.710
then you watch them constantly and when they do something that you like,

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.800
you let them know even if it's a small thing because they're way more likely to

25
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:19.860
do it again.
You know?

26
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:23.520
And so sometimes a personal have kind of an inkling about what they might do

27
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.640
that's good or that would be good for your release,
their relationship with you.

28
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.000
Or that might even just be pleasing to you,
but they won't say anything.

29
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.350
They're like afraid because maybe they won't get attention for it and,

30
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.410
but then they do it and you notice it's like man,
that's super powerful.

31
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.060
Like you have to be really attentive though.

32
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:43.650
Cause the good things that people do don't stand out the mistakes they make,

33
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.430
stand out and then you say,
well you made a mistake.
Yeah.
But to,

34
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:51.270
to watch and to reward someone for doing something small.
Right.
That's,

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.500
that's a step in the right direction.
That is a killer strategy.

36
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.150
I found that to be true with my daughter.
She's four and a half now,
but oh yeah,

37
00:01:59.151 --> 00:01:59.580
like that.

38
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.570
Some kids really like some kids are tough and they don't respond to punishment

39
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:06.930
at all.
You just can't.
You can't,
you can't,

40
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.700
you can't intimidate them.
My daughter,
if I just pointed at her,
she would stop.

41
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.300
But my son,
it was like,
that was just rough one.
He just laughed.

42
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.880
He just laughed and run away.
Yeah.
So,

43
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:21.990
but he responded to reward like mad if I watched him and he did something that

44
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:25.320
was good and I told him that it was like he was just,
yes.

45
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.490
So Dan is good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's reward is harder to use,

46
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.190
but it's more effective if you can manage it.
Yeah.

47
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.160
And then that's not like Kinda how you say,
where you're like,

48
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:38.400
be careful with the reward when you give like too much for you word for these

49
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:40.770
small things,
you know?
And then they can't expect.

50
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:43.590
You can think that that's a problem with the self esteem movement,
you know?

51
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.180
Oh yeah.
Every,
every kid gets a trophy day.
It's snow.

52
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.880
It's like inflating the currency.
If everything is good,

53
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.200
then nothing is good because their house,
there has to be a distinction.
So yeah,

54
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:59.440
you want to watch and you want to see when the person's made an effort and you

55
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.250
want to see when they've gone beyond the call of duty and then you want to say,

56
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:05.700
Hey,
I noticed that that was really good.
Yeah.
And the,

57
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.400
and it is scarcity really matters in those situations because otherwise it just

58
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.960
turns into noise.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Patronizing noise even,
which is even worse.

59
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.630
It's like all you're doing well,
doing well.
It's like leave me alone.
You know?

60
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.690
It's such a lie.

61
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.230
<v 1>Yeah.
I have a fun time with that actually.
I'll put,</v>

62
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:25.660
like if I have to judge and all through my kids' lives,

63
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.620
if I had to judge them in their friends and I have three daughters and one son,

64
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.440
usually it was the daughters.
I was being some kind of a judge.

65
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.150
I'm going to judge the dance,

66
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.570
I'm going to judge the little play that they put together.

67
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:39.050
I'm going to judge the,
uh,

68
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.090
acrobatic routine that they're doing in the backyard that always be judging

69
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:43.924
these things.

70
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.950
And I would have so much fun because I would say they'd do their little

71
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:52.930
performance there,
one minute performance,
and they'd come out table,

72
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.910
how was it?
And I said,
okay,
first of all,
presentation overall,

73
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:02.650
I'm giving you a 4.2 I didn't see one smile until you actually got on stage.

74
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:03.190
That's wrong.

75
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.310
And I would just go through and give them these really shrong critique yards

76
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.650
and,
and they loved it.
They loved it.
That's a tension.

77
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:15.460
Mad they would be happy to,
and they'd go try it again.
Try the race.

78
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:20.461
That 4.3 to a 4.5 they'd be smiles like you could see from a mile away.

79
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.510
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I just got done.
I was at a,

80
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.160
at a pool party with a bunch of little kids running around and I ended up

81
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.430
judging the diving competition and all the parents were watching and they were

82
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.640
aghast at what I was doing.
Yeah.
That was at my house by the way.
Oh,

83
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:39.550
I did it there too.
No,
I do it on a regular basis,
but I did it at your house too,

84
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:44.080
right?
Yeah.
You've seen it in action.
I give the kids a little nicknames and then,

85
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.180
and then I say,
you know,

86
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.870
you were completely unbalanced when you left the board.

87
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.950
It was almost embarrassing for me to watch you go try it again.

88
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:55.780
I'm giving you a 2.2 yeah,

89
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.540
go try it again and see if he can pump that up a of it.
Yeah.

90
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.540
And the kids get all motivated to go up there and I

91
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.970
<v 0>2.5 or they're not treated them like someone who could improve.
Right.</v>

92
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.010
So that's a big deal.
That's,
that's better than,

93
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.470
that's better than a pat on the back.
It's like,

94
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:14.360
because everyone's flawed and everyone needs to improve.
Well,

95
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.030
so when my kids were little,
I taught them how to speak in public.

96
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.690
It took about an hour.
That was it.
So I had them,

97
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.170
they had to read something,
you know?

98
00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:28.830
And so they'd read it and I was across the room and say,
well,

99
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.250
that's not loud enough.
It's like,
I can't hear you.
It's like belt it out.

100
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.650
And then they get a lot of little louder and said,
no,
no,
no,

101
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:38.940
I that doesn't want to mean read it way louder than you think you should.

102
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.250
And so they did that.
And I said,
well,
that's about right,

103
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:44.520
because there's nothing more appalling than listening to some speaker that you

104
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:47.670
can't hear.
It's like,
there's just no excuse for that.
And then like,

105
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.720
make it clearer,
put some passion into it,
you know?
And it was,

106
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.990
it was unbelievable how quickly they would pick that up,
you know?
And,
and,
uh,

107
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:58.110
that also made me sad because eat,

108
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.160
because it took so little time to get them to do that,
and then they had it,

109
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.150
you know?
And so,
and that,

110
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.800
that like a critic is your best friend if the critic isn't destructive.

111
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.630
Cause it quite a critic does is say,

112
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.880
look you did 10 things and like these five things,

113
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.490
you need some work on those,
they're not good.

114
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:21.650
And here's some things you could do that would make them better.

115
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.480
And here's two things that you got.

116
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:27.290
All right and here's three things that you did pretty well at.
And so then,

117
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.020
well what's the message?
The message is,
hey,

118
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:34.550
you can handle some actual criticism so you're not some little,
you know,
useless,

119
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:35.930
wimpy thing that's going to die.

120
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.440
Just because someone isn't telling you that you're already wonderful,

121
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.100
plus you're not already what,
not nearly as wonderful as you could get.

122
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.800
So let's keep that in mind.
And then,
you know,

123
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:49.220
you lay out a pathway for improvement and then you treat the kid with some

124
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:50.090
respect and,

125
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.470
and you also show that being an adult means that you know more than being a kid.

126
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.380
Cause you,
you know,
the kid does something,
you say,
oh that was really good.

127
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:59.720
It's like,
what are you saying?
Well as an adult,

128
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:01.760
I don't know any better than you do.

129
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.840
And that's pretty dismal message because the kid is going to be an adult for a

130
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:06.800
very long time.

131
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.970
And one of the things we do really badly in our culture is model.

132
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.470
Why being an adult is better than being a child because it is better.

133
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.010
You have freedom and you have responsibility and you have autonomy.

134
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.180
And so we're always so concerned about making our kids feel good about

135
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:23.661
themselves.

136
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:27.920
It's like they should be feel good about becoming responsible adults because

137
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:30.770
they're going to be adults for like 80 years and they're going to be kids for

138
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:34.910
like 20 years.
So
the adults the goal.

139
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.420
So
yeah.

140
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.900
That was interesting when you started doing that because the kids are like seven

141
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:45.200
years old and under.
But anyway.
Yeah.
And he's like letting them have it.

142
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:47.660
But you youth funny,
you have this kind of tone about you though.

143
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.100
When you talk to kids that it's like,

144
00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:52.520
it's almost like lists that much over theatrical in just that one.

145
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:56.300
So you can tell he's like playing a character.
Right.
And the kids love it.

146
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.210
It's so funny.
My daughter like loves him.
Um,

147
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.050
and the kids are just scrambling around wanting to do it again and like,

148
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:06.620
let me do this.
Let me do the,
your daughter's all youth do it.
She's like,
okay,

149
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.830
okay,
sure.
So fun.
So plenty kids though,
you know,

150
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.150
big Jocko like ordering these kids.
You kids love attention.
Yeah.

151
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:18.620
It's their currency and they want attention because adults actually know more

152
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:21.500
than they do.
And so if you pay careful attention,

153
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.620
like I get along really well with little kids and it's because I pay attention

154
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:29.510
to them and if they do something good then we had this kid over at our house

155
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:33.930
once.
This is a sad story,
I told it in my new book.
Um,

156
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.150
so this kid was bout four really cute kid,

157
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.300
really nice looking kid and his nanny had been hurting it car accident.

158
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:46.110
So he was kinda being shuffled around the neighborhood for,

159
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.160
for daycare for like a week or solely.
And I'd heard some,

160
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:54.150
not some rumors about this kid and so I was kinda curious.
And so anyways,

161
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.220
he came over to our house.
My,
my,

162
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.670
my wife was also taken care of some other kids at this time.
Um,

163
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.360
and I came home and he was standing,

164
00:09:02.361 --> 00:09:06.090
the other kids were playing in the living room and he was standing in the porch,

165
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:09.330
sort of in the corner,
you know,
kind of just wandering around back and forth.

166
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.060
And I looked at him and I thought,
that's not so good.

167
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:13.590
So I kind of poked him a bit,
you know,

168
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.660
and I was poking them and trying to get him to play.

169
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:20.030
And he had this like really mask of a face on unhappy and I poke him and he kind

170
00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:23.580
of jerk away and all that.
And I couldn't get him to smile.

171
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.760
I couldn't get them to play it.
I thought,
that's not good.
That's not good.

172
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:30.510
Because he's four,
like he should have,
you know,

173
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.320
acted unhappy for two or three pokes and then kind of laughed and then we would

174
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:38.490
kind of get into it,
you know,
so,
so that,
that wasn't so good.

175
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.490
So then we had lunch and the rule at our house was eat your damn lunch and say

176
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.930
thank you to the person who made it because otherwise they'll cook you horrible

177
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:53.370
things and you'll die.
So,
so it's like,

178
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.000
it's hard to cook lunch for.
You have some gratitude,
your little monsters.

179
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.840
And so you ate what was there.
And so his mother,

180
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:05.490
when she dropped him off said he probably won't eat anything all day,

181
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.600
but that's all right.
And we thought,
well actually no,

182
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:12.780
that's not all right because he needs to eat and,
and it's,

183
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.840
and it's not all right that he doesn't eat wrong.

184
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.880
And so we'd learned how to feed recalcitrance children by that point.

185
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.160
And so all the kids were at the table and they were eating and my wife had made

186
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:30.630
some chicken stew and he wasn't eating.
And so she was trying to feed them.

187
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.490
And so we were watching him very carefully and so she bring up the spoon to his

188
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:38.700
mouth and he'd move his head back and forth,
you know,
to refuse it.

189
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.540
And it was just like about a nine month old would do that a when you're trying

190
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:46.500
to,
that's their,
their first trick.
And so that's a nine month old trick.

191
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:47.191
And we thought,
okay,

192
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:50.400
well something happened when he was nine months old and he never really got

193
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:53.850
beyond that.
And so,
um,
you know,

194
00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:58.670
my wife was fairly persistent with the spoon and um,
he'd get annoyed,

195
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.130
you know,
squawk bit and she'd put some food in and then he'd swallow it.

196
00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:02.730
And then,

197
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.810
and then as soon as he took a little bit of food and she'd pat him and tell him

198
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:09.700
that he was being a good kid and she,
man today was not a game.
Like she,

199
00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:13.620
she was really intent on getting this kid to have lunch and so,

200
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.300
so that's fine and he's moving his,
his head back and forth.

201
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:21.390
But what was cool as she kept patting him on the head and telling me was good

202
00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:23.010
kid.
He was opening his mouth more often,

203
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.410
even though he was still moving his head back and forth.

204
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.500
And so it took about 10 minutes or so,

205
00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:31.830
and she had fed him the whole bowl of chicken stew,
and she said,

206
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.310
she showed him and he said,
look,
you're a good boy.
You ate all of it.

207
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:39.690
And that horrible mask that he was wearing,
you know,
that massive on happiness.

208
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.800
It just fell off of him.
And he had this great smile.
It was just,

209
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.060
it just made the hair on the back of my neck stand up because you could see that

210
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:52.860
was the first damn thing that he did being allowed to succeed at,
you know,

211
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.630
and so he was thrilled.
