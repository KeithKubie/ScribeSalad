00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.590
The position of a
particle moving along

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.730
a number line is
given by s of t is

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.810
equal to 2/3 t to the third
minus 6t squared plus 10t,

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.600
for t is greater
than or equal to 0,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.850
where t is time in seconds.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.340
The particle moves both left and
right in the first 6 seconds.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.640
What is the total distance
traveled by the particle for 0

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.042
is less than or equal to t
is less than or equal to 6?

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.500
So let's just remind
ourselves what

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.990
they mean by total distance.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.280
If I were to say
start there, and if I

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.689
were to move 3
units to the right

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.270
and then I were to move
4 units to the left,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.370
and I'll say negative 4 to show
that I'm moving to the left,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.002
then my total distance
right over here is 7.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.720
3 to the right
and 4 to the left.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.560
Even though my position
right over here

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.075
is going to be negative 1.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.240
Or you could say
my net distance,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.490
or you could say my
displacement is negative 1.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.990
I'm 1 to the left
of where I started.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.030
The total distance is 7.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.370
So now we've clarified that.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.379
I encourage you to
now pause this video

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:07.670
and try to answer the question.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.260
What is the total
distance traveled

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.930
by the particle in
these first 6 seconds?

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.244
So the easiest way I
can think of addressing

00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:17.660
this is to think
about, well, when

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.034
is this thing
moving to the right

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:20.590
and when is it
moving to the left?

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.320
And it's going to be
moving to the right

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.020
when the velocity is
positive, and it's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.639
going to be moving to the left
when the velocity is negative.

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:28.180
So this really boils
down to thinking

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.265
about when is the velocity
positive or negative.

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:31.890
And to think about
that, let's actually

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.996
graph the velocity function
or make a rough sketch of it.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:36.370
So this is the
position function.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.869
The velocity function
is going to be

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.510
the derivative of the position
function with respect to time.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.110
So the derivative of
2/3 t to the third

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.100
is going to be 2t squared.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.100
And then we have
minus 12t plus 10.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.580
And so let's just
try to graph this.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.840
This is going to be an
upward opening parabola.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.520
This is clearly a quadratic.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.720
And the coefficient on
the second degree term,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.580
on the t squared term,
is a positive number,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.538
so it's going to be an
upward opening parabola.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:10.630
It's going to look
something like this.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.636
And we're assuming that
it switches direction.

00:02:12.636 --> 00:02:14.510
So it's going to be
positive some of the time

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.350
and negative for
some of the time.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.370
So it should intersect the
t-axis where it's negative.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.620
The function is going to be
negative in that interval,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.630
and it's going to be positive
outside of that interval.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.550
So the easiest thing
I could think of doing

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.480
is let's try to find
what the 0's are.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.300
Then we can draw this
upward opening parabola.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.700
So to find its 0's, let's
just set this thing equal to 0

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.620
so we get 2t squared minus
12t plus 10 is equal to 0.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.234
Divide both sides by 2
just to get rid of this 2,

00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:47.650
make this leading
coefficient a 1.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.890
We get t squared minus
6t plus 5 is equal to 0.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.440
That made it a lot
easier to factor.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.920
This can be factored into
t minus 1 times t minus 5.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.110
Negative 1 times
negative 5 is 5.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.190
Negative 1 plus negative
5 is negative 6.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.730
This is equal to 0.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.640
So this left hand
side of the equation

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.150
is going to be equal to 0 if
either one of these things

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.110
is equal to 0.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.160
Take the product of
two things equaling 0,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.440
well, you get 0 if
either one of them is 0.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.160
So either t is equal to
1 or t is equal to 5.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.860
So now let's graph it.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.960
So let's draw our axes.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.340
So I could say that's
my velocity axis.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.450
And let me draw
the-- we only care

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.910
for positive values of time.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.300
So let's draw
something like this.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.975
Positive time.

00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:39.800
And let's see.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.750
Let's take that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.010
We could keep going.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.530
So this is t equals 1.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.130
This is t is equal to 5.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.960
This is our t-axis.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.972
And let's graph it.

00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:53.930
So it's going to be an
upward opening parabola.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.609
It's going to intersect
both of these points.

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.150
And so its vertex
is going to be when

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.220
t is equal to 3 right
in between those points.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.452
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:05.910
That's the only way to make an
upward opening parabola that

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.140
intersects the t-axis
at both of these points.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.200
So it'll go like that,
and it'll go like this.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.316
It'll intersect.

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:16.149
When t equals 0, we
actually can figure out.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.950
When t equals 0
our velocity is 10.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.930
So the v-intercept, we could
say, is 10 right over here.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.660
So that's what it looks like.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.840
So we see that the velocity
is positive for time

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.430
between 0 and 1.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.250
And it's also positive for
time is greater than 5 seconds.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.450
And we see that our
velocity is negative,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.000
or that we're moving to the
left, between 1 and 5 seconds.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.720
The velocity is below the
t-axis right over here.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.644
It is negative.

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:52.560
So let's just think about
what our position is

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.580
at each of these points, at
time 0, at time 1, at time 5,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.100
and what we care about time 6.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.150
And then think about
what the distance

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.290
it would have had to
travel between those times.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.780
So let's think about it.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.660
So let's make a
little table here.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.240
Let's make a little table.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.430
So this is time, and this is
our position at that time.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.470
So we care about time 0,
time 1, time 5 seconds,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.730
and time 6 seconds.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.910
So at 0 seconds, we know
that our position is 0.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.310
S of 0 is 0.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.490
At 1 second, this is going
to be 2/3 minus 6 plus 10.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.720
So it's going to be 4 and 2/3.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.530
So I'll write down 4 and 2/3.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.865
At 5 seconds, let's
see, it's 2/3 times--

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:46.240
I'm going to write
this one down.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.720
So it's going to
be 2/3 times 125.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.690
That's the same
thing as 250 over 3,

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.520
which is the same thing.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.270
Let's see, 250 over 3.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.960
That's the same.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.100
83 times 3 is 249, so
this is 83 and 1/3.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.100
That's this first term.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.360
Minus 6 times 25.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.850
So that's going to be
minus 150 plus 10 times 5.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.800
So plus 50.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.410
So this is going to simplify.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.125
Minus 150 plus 50, that's
going to be minus 100.

00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:42.400
83 and 1/3 minus 100.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.730
That's going to be
negative 16 and 2/3.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.920
So negative 16 and 2/3 is
its position after 5 seconds.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.010
And then at the 6
seconds, it's going

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.570
to be 2/3 times 6 to the third.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.870
I have to write this one down.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:05.900
2/3 times 6 to the third
minus 6 times 6 squared.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.460
Well, that's just going to be
minus 6 to the third again.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.107
6 times 6 squared plus 60.

00:07:15.107 --> 00:07:15.690
And let's see.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.950
How can we simplify
this right over here?

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.820
Well, this part
right over here we

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.170
can rewrite as-- we could
factor out as 6 to the third.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.389
This is 6 to the third
times 2/3 minus 1 plus 60.

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.430
Scroll down a little bit
and get some more space.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.600
So it's going to be 6 to
the third times negative 1/3

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.130
plus 60.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.601
And let's see.

00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:38.600
Let's write it this way.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.510
This is going to be 6 squared
times 6 times negative 1/3

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.290
plus 60.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.130
This right over
here is negative 2.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.630
So it's negative 2 times 36.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.675
This is negative 72 plus 60.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.154
So this is going to be
negative 12 right over there.

00:08:01.154 --> 00:08:03.320
So now we just have to
think, how far did it travel?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.150
Well, it starts
traveling to the right.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.699
It's going to travel
to the right 4 and 2/3.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:08.740
So let's write this down.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.090
So we're going to
have 4 and 2/3.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.320
And then it's going
to travel to the left.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.510
Let's see, to go from 4 and
2/3 to negative 16 and 2/3,

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.050
that means you traveled
4 and 2/3 again.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.240
You traveled 4 and
2/3 to the left,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.110
and then you traveled another
16 and 2/3 to the left.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.709
Just a reminder, we're 4
and 2/3 to the right now.

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:34.000
We have to go 4 and 2/3 to
the left back to the origin,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.840
and then we have to go 16
and 2/3 again to the left.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.070
So that's why this
move from here to here

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.100
is going to be 4 and 2/3 to
the left followed by 16 and 2/3

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.035
to the left.

00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:45.910
Another way to think
about it, the difference

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.120
between these two
points is what?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.500
It's going to be 4 and
2/3 plus 16 and 2/3.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.597
If you do 4 and 2/3 minus
negative 16 and 2/3,

00:08:55.597 --> 00:08:57.930
you're going to have, that's
the same thing as 4 and 2/3

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.230
plus 16 and 2/3.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:10.060
And then to go from negative
16 and 2/3 to negative 12,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.150
that means you went another
4 and 2/3 now to the right.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.750
So now this is 4 and 2/3.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.370
Now you're moving 4
and 2/3 to the right.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.850
And so we just have to
add up all of these.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.580
We just have to add up
all of these values.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.070
So what is this going to be?

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:34.352
So this is going to be 2/3
times 4, so this part of it

00:09:34.352 --> 00:09:36.060
right over here, the
fraction part of it.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.860
2/3 times 4 is 8 over 3.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.840
And let's see, 4 plus
4 plus 16 plus 4 is 28.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.390
So 28 and 8/3, that's a very
strange way to write it.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:54.320
Because 8/3 is the same
thing as 2 and 2/3.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.790
So 28 plus 2 and
2/3 is 30 and 2/3.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.190
So the total distance
traveled over those 6 seconds

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:07.931
is 30 and 2/3 units.
