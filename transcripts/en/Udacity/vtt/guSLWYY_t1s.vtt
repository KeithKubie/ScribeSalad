00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.819
My name's Ben Halperin.

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.830
I'm originally from New Jersey.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.630
Been living in Columbus, Ohio for
the last two and a half years now.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.360
When I was learning through Udacity,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.690
I was working full time
as a mechanical engineer.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.670
At that point I was looking for
a way to change careers.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.220
I ended up taking
the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.980
Probably the biggest doubt I had
during the whole experience was,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.000
will I be able to get a job?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.120
I graduated from
the Nanodegree late December.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.480
After that, I took maybe a week or

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.860
two to update my resume, portfolio,
LinkedIn, everything like that.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.500
Started applying to jobs.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.470
I wanted to move back to either New York
or Boston and be closer to my family.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.090
I started getting responses back, had
some interviews, basically went through

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.960
their whole process, the same process
anyone else would go through.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.350
Ended up getting an on-site interview.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.650
Went through that, went really well.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.080
I really liked the people I met, and

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.650
then I heard back the next
week that I got the job.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.940
But I think the portfolio of projects is
really what got my resume to stand out

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.670
among the other ones,
considering I didn't have a CS degree or

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.240
any work experience as
a software developer.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.170
I think the problems they gave me during
the technical interview, I wouldn't have

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.820
been able to solve if I hadn't
taken the courses through Udacity,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.700
if I hadn't gone through the nanodegree.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.240
I guess Udacity's way of teaching,
I think,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.930
just gives you a really good basis for

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.930
learning something else or tackling
a problem you haven't seen before.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.234
I think it definitely
helped me get the job.

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:35.159
