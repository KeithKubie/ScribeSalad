00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.890
As the old saying goes, "Haters be hatin'."
Obviously, we'd like them to knock it off;

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.890
but science may have provided us with a health
bonus for breaking the hate!

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.240
Hey all you sexual beings out there, I'm Trace
and this is DNews, thanks for tuning in!

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.300
Homosexuality and homophobia is a topic of
discussion around many a dinner table in the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.160
United States and elsewhere *cough* Russia
*cough* and though many feel they're in the

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.460
right on both sides, there's a definite scientific
angle to be taken to simply let the homophobia

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.460
battle go. Science says, homophobia is killing
you. Yeah. To a tune of about two and a half

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.980
years of your life.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.870
A study done in the United States and published
in the American Journal of Public Health wanted

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.809
to determine "whether individuals who harbor
antigay prejudice experience elevated mortality

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.829
risk." Turns out, yep. They do. All things
controlled for being equal in their study,

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.010
people who are prejudiced against the LGBTQ
community will die two-and-a-half years earlier

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.440
than an equally healthy person of the same
age -- likely of a cardiovascular-related

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.440
cause.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.690
We've known for a long while prejudice can
fester in the mind, but this adds to the growing

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:04.769
number of studies showing haters are also
dying faster... Keeping all that anger is

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.920
stressing them out! Right out of their lives!
And sadly the stress isn't only on the bigots,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.640
it spreads to their targets too.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.000
Columbia University's Mailman School of Public
Health completed a separate study which found

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.810
bixsexual, gay, and lesbian individuals living
in communities with a high level of anti-gay

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.650
prejudice had higher mortality as well! They
found, when controlling for the normal variables

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.820
of a community, people in the sexual minority
died 12-years sooner on average usually by

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.340
suicide, homicide, violence, or cardiovascular
diseases.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.729
LGB people living in high-prejudice communities
were THREE TIMES more likely to be murdered

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.509
than in low-prejudice communities! That's
astounding. A key point in their study, was

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.170
they assessed the community as a WHOLE rather
than the experiences of individuals. It wasn't

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.090
THESE LGB people who FELT persecuted, the
community was experiencing high-prejudice

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.340
as a whole.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.130
I don't have a research study to cite, but
it seems to me it's rarely only the bigot

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.270
and their target who are victims of the stress
involved. The hate is probably felt by their

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.890
families, their neighbors and their friends
as well. I wonder what THEIR health effects

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.170
are...

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.399
