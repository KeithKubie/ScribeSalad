00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.684
Welcome to Google Developers
Weekly for November 4, 2013.

00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:08.600
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.849
of what's happening in the
world of Google Developers,

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.170
on the set and off.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.620
We start the week in New York,
with Eric Koleda and Arun

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.820
Nagarajan, who team up
to take on your questions

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.130
on Apps Script, and
deliver the latest updates.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.860
If automated workflows
and ERPs are your thing,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.830
make sure you don't miss it.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.550
We were also delighted to host
a five-part series focused

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.850
on Apps Script for Google
Developers Hackademy,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.090
for all of our Spanish-speaking
coders around the world.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.537
Together, Antonio Guzman and
our very own Francisco Solsona

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:37.370
produce all the lecciones
and introducciones

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.110
that you need para iniciar.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.100
From Italy, Mario Viviani
introduces us to the cool new

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.830
card layout UI for Android,
which you can see in many

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.700
different Google applications,
including Google Now, Google+,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.750
and Google Play.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.000
And have you ever
had a crazy idea?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.915
Sure you have.

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:55.790
Sometimes your idea is
great, but the world's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.060
not ready for it yet.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.566
Don Dodge and I-- that's
me up there-- talked

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.940
about our own
experiences and how

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.350
we've seen companies
and technologies that

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.950
were ready for the
world of the future,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.116
and others that just managed
to get the timing right

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:07.240
and hit it big.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.420
In the second Root Access
episode of the week,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.610
Don stuck around and
took viewer questions,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.140
focusing on whether
revenue matters

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.810
when it comes to startups.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.800
Should your startup go for
revenue or for innovation?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.870
Don is here with
all those answers.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.790
And here at GDL, we
upload large videos

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.200
to YouTube every single day.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.180
Ibrahim Ulukaya tells us how
to work with resumable uploads

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.040
and use them in your code, so
you can get to your big data

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560
in the right place.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.710
I'm also excited to debut our
first show from GDL India,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.460
in Hyderabad.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.970
Uttam Tripathy and
David McLaughlin

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.928
introduce us to the large,
community-run events

00:01:37.928 --> 00:01:39.804
that we call GDG DevFests.

00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:42.220
DevFests can offer speaker
sessions, hackathons, code labs

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.140
and more, so we can get
together with our fellow geeks.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.330
And back in Mountain View,
Wallet Wizard Peng Ying

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.620
join up with Maru
Bouza for a deep dive

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.640
into the Wallet Objects API
Java Quick Start sample.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.530
The video highlights
authorizing access

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.690
using the Save Wallet API, as
well as enabling instant signup

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.500
and linking from the Wallet app.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.630
If you are one of those
geodevelopers wondering

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.660
what was new in Google
Earth Enterprise 5.0,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.310
this is the show for you.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.954
Dylan Thomas and
Avnish Bhatnagar

00:02:07.954 --> 00:02:10.370
focus on the release highlights
and all those new features

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.900
that you've been asking for.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.600
In addition to all these great
pieces, the big news for Google

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.860
this week came from Android,
who satisfied our sweet tooth

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.370
with the sugary goodness
of Android 4.4 KitKat.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.410
Reto Meier summarizes some of
the most significant developer

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.150
features in this release,
including new ways

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.450
to make your apps beautiful,
and my personal favorite,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.500
step counter sensors.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.920
If you use AdSense,
here's one for you.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.950
This week, we added AdSense data
to the Google Analytics core

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.940
reporting API.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.910
You can now use this API
to answer questions like,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.460
which pages contribute the
most to my AdSense revenue?

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.210
And, which traffic sources
contribute the most

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.307
to my revenue?

00:02:49.307 --> 00:02:51.890
You can check out our blog posts
on the Google Developers blog

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.940
for the scoop and links to
all of the documentation.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.860
We're also happy to say the
Google API's console is dead.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.760
Long live Google Cloud
console, the next generation

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.570
of dashboards for managing
your Google API usage.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.190
This new console has a visual
refresh and tight integration

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.710
with our cloud
platform services.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.200
See for yourself at
cloud.google.com/console.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.610
Hopping over to the next
cloud for more news, this week

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.750
we've launched support for
native MySQL connections

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.410
in Google Cloud SQL.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.700
Now you can access your
Cloud SQL database from just

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.092
about any application, using
the MySQL wire protocol.

00:03:24.092 --> 00:03:25.800
Take a look at our
blog posts to find out

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.860
more, including
links to a case study

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.630
and all of the documentation.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.200

miss a thing from the world

see you in the studio.
