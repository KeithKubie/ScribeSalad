00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, this 355 m is pretty good.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That's far for a bow and arrow.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But my question is how can we shoot farther?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If we want to shoot our arrow even farther, what would we do?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, maybe it's the case that we just can't shoot any farther.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Maybe we should aim straight up into the sky

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or maybe we should just aim slightly higher,

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so we shoot at some angle. What do you think is the best answer?
