1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.140
They,
apple acts like it cares about privacy,

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.830
which maybe it doesn't turn certain over things to the FBI.

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:12.420
I don't know exactly what,
but we don't know what the apple phones are doing.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.140
Right.
Apple is all locked down,
closed source.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.210
And additionally I,

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.950
there was a creepy speech that Tim Cook just just gave creepy.
Did you see it?

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.960
No.
Let's listen to it.
Yeah.
Let's listen to [inaudible] music with Adl speech.

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.450
Do you have any spooky music you could play in the background while he's doing

9
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:34.020
this speech?
One thing we might get in trouble for that.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.350
So again,
it's good intentions.

11
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:40.560
Like people who want less hate speech,

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.240
we all want less h beach was,
we want people to get along better.
Yeah.

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.330
Right.
But this idea that,

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.970
I don't want to give too much away,
but you know,

15
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:55.971
he's acting as if they are going to be the moral authority about the types of

16
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:00.090
content that can exist on the APP store.
Yeah.

17
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.460
So I just don't know how that's scalable.
Yeah.
What does that mean?

18
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.850
Like let's hear what you said.
I was just hoping this is the right one.
Is it?

19
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.620
It says a CEO,

20
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:14.880
Tim Cook banning hate division is the right thing to do.

21
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:18.780
12 three 2018 is that it?
December.
That's it.
Okay.
Let's hear it.

22
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.560
Hello,
Tim.
Volume please.
Our devices connected

23
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.820
<v 1>did to the humanity that makes us us.</v>

24
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.000
We do that in many ways.

25
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.720
What are the most important is how we honor a teaching that can be found in

26
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:42.860
Judaism,
but it's shared across all faiths and traditions.

27
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.970
It's a lesson that was carried forward by the late Elie was make his memory be a

28
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.544
blessing.

29
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.570
It's a lesson put into practice by America's Muslim community who raised

30
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:03.620
thousands for the victims of the tree of life killings,
Lowe,

31
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.200
Tom Mode.
I'll dom Rebecca,

32
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.370
do not be indifferent to the bloodshed of your fellow man.

33
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.940
Do not be indifferent.

34
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.163
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.450
<v 1>This mandate moves us to speak up for immigrants and for,</v>

36
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.970
for those who seek opportunity in the United States,

37
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.190
we do it not only because they're individual dignity,

38
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.220
creativity and ingenuity have the power to make this country and even better

39
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:36.304
place,

40
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.090
but because our own humanity commands us to welcome those who knew need welcome.

41
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.350
It moves us to speak up for the Lgbtq community for those whose differences can

42
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:56.270
make them a target for violence and scorn.
We do so.

43
00:02:56.271 --> 00:03:01.271
Not only because these unique and uncommon perspectives can open our eyes to new

44
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:03.400
ways of thinking,

45
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.300
but because their own dignity moves us to see the dignity and others.

46
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.560
Perhaps most importantly,
it drives us not to be bystanders.

47
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.641
Bystanders,

48
00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:21.960
as hate tries to make its headquarters in the digital world

49
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.790
at apple,

50
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.350
we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on this

51
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:33.520
challenge.
There is no time to get tied up in knots.

52
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.840
That's why we only have one message for those who seek to push hate division and

53
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:44.020
violence.

54
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.550
You have no place on our platforms.

55
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.050
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

56
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.840
<v 1>you have no home here from the earliest days of Itunes to apple music today.</v>

57
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.390
We have always prohibited music with a message of white supremacy.

58
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.553
Hold on.
Sorry.

59
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.840
<v 0>Um,
what,
what do you think there's signaling here?</v>

60
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.170
Like are they signaling that they're about to start censoring things?

61
00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:24.560
Like what do you,
what do use any,
are they already,
are they okay?

62
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.610
I agree with you.
Shit.
You probably shouldn't put white supremacy music on,

63
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.450
but there's a lot of like really violent stuff that you can get on iTunes.
Right?

64
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.430
I mean if you go back to the old Nwa albums,
there's some that's available,
right?

65
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.630
Sure.
I guess I would,
I'm assuming.
Yeah,
I saw that.
It is for sure.
But yeah,

66
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.710
like straight Outta Compton,
uh,
some violence shit.

67
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.900
And then how about the films that they have?

68
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.070
How about the films that you can get on the iTunes store?
There is a lot of very,

69
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:56.000
very,
very violent films,
like extremely violent.

70
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.040
There's a lot of films that like,

71
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.810
is it that they're making the distinction between something that's fiction that

72
00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:04.430
although it may be disturbing,

73
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.110
you understand that this is a movie and this is something someone wrote versus

74
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.610
someone art versus,
yeah.
Versus someone with commentary,

75
00:05:13.611 --> 00:05:15.830
their commentaries here.
And then here's the other thing.

76
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.910
Well he was saying hate and division,

77
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.750
they won't promote division,
but that's a weird one.
Yeah.

78
00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:27.000
That means like what does that mean?
People who disagree with you?
Yeah,

79
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:30.010
what does division has good intentions.
You can sort of feel it.
Yeah,

80
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.290
that's the problem with this,
right,
that it's,

81
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.290
he's not allowing the conversation to take place.

82
00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:41.291
So this is in direct conflict with the Daryl Davis is with confronting these

83
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:47.630
issues.
Right?
So w we can kill it,
but I think,
uh,

84
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.400
when,
when,
when he's saying you have no place on our platform,

85
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.980
they probably feel like you can go somewhere else.
He's building a wall.

86
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.710
Yeah.
I mean,
but this is what I'm saying.

87
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.660
Like everybody kind of feels like you can go somewhere else.

88
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.620
That's what happens though.

89
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.010
And that's how things get more radicalized and everybody goes down.

90
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.110
So I don't know,
you know,
look,
the conversation needs to take place.

91
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.990
People on the left,

92
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.750
he's acting like he's speaking for all Lgbtq people.

93
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.943
He's not,

94
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160
there's lots of people on the left and Lgbtq people aren't always on the left

95
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.860
and not all of them want that.
Well,
not only that,

96
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.300
there's division in LBGT and cue,

97
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.411
like there's a,

98
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.040
there's a big issue right now with Martina Navratilova that was going on about

99
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.070
her discussing the reality of Trans Women competing against biological women and

100
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.840
that she opposes it and she thinks it is.
There's some fundamental advantages,

101
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:52.400
which is leading to a lot of weight lifting world records being broken by Trans

102
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.170
Women.
And she's like,
this is fucking preposterous.

103
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.880
Including Trans Women with penises and now they're attacking her for being trans

104
00:06:57.881 --> 00:06:58.161
phobic.

105
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:03.161
So there's not even a United need knighted opinion in the Lbgtq community for

106
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:09.500
sure.
And that's why that uh,
Megan Murphy I think,
yes.
The,

107
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.240
I go to this restaurant in Bridgeport,
Connecticut called blood root,

108
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.830
which is like sort of an old school feminist like vegetarian Vegan spot and in

109
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:23.360
Bridgeport.
In Bridgeport,
yeah.
Bridgeport's con no,
no offense.

110
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.270
I know it's kind of a dump.
Wild place.
Yeah.

111
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.150
We would have a gathering in the vibe of music festivals.
I helped organize,

112
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.530
I used to stand up in Bridgeport.
Please call the joker's wild.

113
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.050
It was a comedy club.
So,
so the OAA beat a guy with a shoe there,

114
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.500
beat a guy in the face with a shoe,
pull the shoe off and intervene.

115
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.650
I was 24 I know what the fuck was going on.
So anyway though,

116
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.060
that restaurant that you know,
they get called,
um,
what is it?
Turf.

117
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.190
Uh,
turf.
Yeah.
Trans exclusionary radical feminists.

118
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.440
And so again,
you know,
they're the old school ones and they're saying,
look,

119
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:07.550
you know,
we're not against your,
your battle right now.
We're not against trans.

120
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.840
Right.
It's obvious who would be against trans.
Yeah.

121
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.590
But they're just saying that's not our thing.
So again,

122
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.120
there's diversity and they're trying to clump everyone together and the whole

123
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.230
intersectional world.
And I look,
people want to band together.

124
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.160
This oppress groups want to band together.
They should.
Yeah.
But like,

125
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.290
it's not that simple.
Well,

126
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.430
there's always going to be differing opinions and especially when you have

127
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:33.110
something like,
you know,

128
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.300
Trans Women competing against biological women and you know,

129
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:41.090
you have someone like Martina Navratilova that made her,

130
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.960
her life's work and her career competing as a biological woman.

131
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.050
Um,
she's going to have some opposition to that.

132
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.200
And then the idea that everyone's supposed to be lumped in together with some

133
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.830
mandate that no one has really openly discussed and you're supposed to agree and

134
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:58.560
it fluctuates and moves like the tide,
you know,

135
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.510
like what is and isn't moves like the tide.
It changes.

136
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.870
It's like this court of public opinion.
It's,

137
00:09:05.871 --> 00:09:10.470
it's constantly rendering new verdicts and you have to keep up and catch up.

138
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.280
Things that were acceptable just a few years ago are totally unacceptable.

139
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.880
I mean,
comedy is,
is the key area too.
Yeah.

140
00:09:18.881 --> 00:09:21.900
That is not what's happening on social media now.

141
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:26.430
Not Sustainable for comedy because it's fine.
Oh really?
Yeah,

142
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.440
it is.
It is.
How?
Because it creates outrage and then comedy,

143
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.190
it relieves that,
that pressure,
like,
believe me,

144
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.590
there's a lot of blow back and believe me,

145
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:40.230
there's a lot of debate and discussion,
but also,
believe me,

146
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.520
when someone does do some politically incorrect,

147
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:49.080
really good standup people go fucking bonkers.
They love it.
It's going,

148
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.400
it's like one of the best times ever right now to do stand up people go fucking

149
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.920
ape.
Yeah,
no,
it's incredible material.

150
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:58.940
But I'm just saying for you know,

151
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.750
comics that are running into issues with getting banned or whatnot.
I mean,

152
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:09.090
well,
who's running the issues with getting banned?
I mean,
I think,

153
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:13.620
you know,
one oh one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
And has some issues.
Yeah.

154
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.810
Um,
and you know,

155
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:19.170
you can make some arguments at Owens not doing so well right now.
Um,

156
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.360
but he's also developing his following because of the fact there's people that

157
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:29.010
don't agree with him being banned.
He's,
he's a very specific example.
Um,

158
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.200
other people that are being banned.

159
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.710
Do you know of other who,

160
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.560
what other standup comedian you've done a bunch of comics on?

161
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.600
Maybe they haven't been fully been from social media,

162
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:42.900
but they've had their performances,
uh,
shutdown.

163
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.960
Who's that one guy who was at oh no mesh,
no mesh hotel.

164
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.940
But that was at a college see you the same.
It's the same thing.

165
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.680
Yes.
But universities have been bad for that for a long time.
Uh,

166
00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.720
they're the most sensitive of all audiences and they're the ones who are the

167
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:02.970
most,
uh,
they believe the most,

168
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:06.330
that they're going to change the world and that their ideals are,

169
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.010
their ideals are rock solid and they have to push back against anything that

170
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:15.510
opposes them.
Ari was temporarily banned.
That was an accident.
Yeah.
Yeah.

171
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:19.020
The Ra thing was he was joking around and they thought he was making legitimate

172
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:19.910
death threat could,

173
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.480
that could happen just jacking around with a good friend of ours,
the,

174
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.400
the algorithms or are in the moderators are just not right.

175
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.810
We can't just be having this happen all the time and then they just keep saying,

176
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.760
oh,
sorry.
Yeah,
sorry.
There has to be a new approach completely.

177
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.390
It can't just be,
oh,
let them back on and,

178
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.640
and just keep doing what they're doing.

179
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.970
Like we need to completely reapproach how moderation is happening.

180
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.390
The whole policies situation,
that transparency situation,

181
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:55.900
it's not just a matter of
going to the overlords and saying,

182
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.880
can I,
can I please come back?
Right.
It's,
that's not that,

183
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.100
that's not suitable for the communication structure of the planet earth.

184
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.861
Well,

185
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:10.861
I think what's not suitable is that commerce should not dictate how human beings

186
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:12.640
are allowed to openly communicate with each other.

187
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.270
And one of the things that Jack said that's kind of contrary to his company's

188
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:19.900
actions was that he believes that the ability to communicate as a fundamental

189
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:23.290
right,
like the ability to get electricity.
Like if you're in the KKK,

190
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.570
you could still order electricity,
you know?

191
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:29.110
So should you be able to just distribute information?
If people say no,

192
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.400
then you have to say,
okay,

193
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:34.450
well who's to decide what can and cannot be distributed?

194
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.810
And then who's to decide if they can go somewhere else.

195
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.660
And then what happens if you tell a person they can't go anywhere?

196
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.040
Done things get really weird.
