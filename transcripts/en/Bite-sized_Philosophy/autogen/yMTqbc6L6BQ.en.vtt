solve your problems because problems are
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149
solve your problems because problems are
hard to solve and sometimes you can't

hard to solve and sometimes you can't
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.520
hard to solve and sometimes you can't
solve them I was just pointing out what

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
solve them I was just pointing out what

the cost of leaving the back door Oh

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
the cost of leaving the back door Oh
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690
the cost of leaving the back door Oh
what the cost of leaving the back door

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
what the cost of leaving the back door
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.630
what the cost of leaving the back door
open is and it's a big cost and you know

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
open is and it's a big cost and you know
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249
open is and it's a big cost and you know
one of the things I see too is that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
one of the things I see too is that
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.710
one of the things I see too is that
people's identities fragment

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720
people's identities fragment
 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.600
people's identities fragment
increasingly across time you know one of

increasingly across time you know one of
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.770
increasingly across time you know one of
the things that you have as you age is

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780
the things that you have as you age is
 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.210
the things that you have as you age is
something like the continuity of your

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
something like the continuity of your
 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.210
something like the continuity of your
life you know you you have someone that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
life you know you you have someone that
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710
life you know you you have someone that
you're with you've tied your story

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
you're with you've tied your story
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.899
you're with you've tied your story
together with theirs you have children

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
together with theirs you have children
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609
together with theirs you have children
maybe they have children it's like

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
maybe they have children it's like
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.090
maybe they have children it's like
there's this continual payoff so to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
there's this continual payoff so to
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.140
there's this continual payoff so to
speak in quality that you obtain from

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150
speak in quality that you obtain from
 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.190
speak in quality that you obtain from
staying within that frame and you can

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
staying within that frame and you can
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.810
staying within that frame and you can
jump out of that and I suppose to some

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
jump out of that and I suppose to some
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580
jump out of that and I suppose to some
degree that that provides freedom but it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
degree that that provides freedom but it
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.929
degree that that provides freedom but it
isn't obvious to me that it does that

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
isn't obvious to me that it does that
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050
isn't obvious to me that it does that
for people they usually that was the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
for people they usually that was the
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.880
for people they usually that was the
things with

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890
things with
 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.380
things with
it's my bloody email no but but but it's

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390
it's my bloody email no but but but it's
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.700
it's my bloody email no but but but it's
also the case that sequential

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710
also the case that sequential
 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.139
also the case that sequential
relationships are unlikely to be that so

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149
relationships are unlikely to be that so
 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.350
relationships are unlikely to be that so
look I'm not a not make I'm definitely

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
look I'm not a not make I'm definitely
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.100
look I'm not a not make I'm definitely
not making a utopian case for marriage

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110
not making a utopian case for marriage
 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.680
not making a utopian case for marriage
so again I would like to give you a verb

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690
so again I would like to give you a verb
 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.050
so again I would like to give you a verb
with from you because it'd be really

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
with from you because it'd be really
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.540
with from you because it'd be really
interesting right it is top point but at

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550
interesting right it is top point but at
 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.030
interesting right it is top point but at
the same time I think there are

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
the same time I think there are
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.760
the same time I think there are
creations that are regional quality

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770
creations that are regional quality
 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.699
creations that are regional quality
young and we keep that the case then in

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709
young and we keep that the case then in
 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.150
young and we keep that the case then in
1501 cannot be good

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160
1501 cannot be good
 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.830
1501 cannot be good
yeah well that's that's definitely the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840
yeah well that's that's definitely the
 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.140
yeah well that's that's definitely the
alternative argument and of course there

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
alternative argument and of course there
 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.820
alternative argument and of course there
are strong things to be said on both

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830
are strong things to be said on both
 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:51.690
are strong things to be said on both
sides but

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700
 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.640
see there's some additional problems

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650
see there's some additional problems
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.080
see there's some additional problems
with divorce that people don't really

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
with divorce that people don't really
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.070
with divorce that people don't really
grasp when they're young like the idea

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080
grasp when they're young like the idea
 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.510
grasp when they're young like the idea
that you can be divorced once you have

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520
that you can be divorced once you have
 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.550
that you can be divorced once you have
children that's kind of a stupid idea

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
children that's kind of a stupid idea
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.450
children that's kind of a stupid idea
because you can't you can you can you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460
because you can't you can you can you
 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.680
because you can't you can you can you
can find a limited substitute for your

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690
can find a limited substitute for your
 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.890
can find a limited substitute for your
initial freedom but if you if you have

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900
initial freedom but if you if you have
 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.510
initial freedom but if you if you have
kids and you try to get divorced the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520
kids and you try to get divorced the
 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.710
kids and you try to get divorced the
probability that that's going to

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720
probability that that's going to
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.830
probability that that's going to
demolish your life is very very high

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
demolish your life is very very high
 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.300
demolish your life is very very high
first of all it's incredibly expensive

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310
first of all it's incredibly expensive
 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.820
first of all it's incredibly expensive
so one or both of you is going to come

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830
so one or both of you is going to come
 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.310
so one or both of you is going to come
out of that poor and your market value

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320
out of that poor and your market value
 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.530
out of that poor and your market value
has declined let's say you're the woman

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540
has declined let's say you're the woman
 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.200
has declined let's say you're the woman
who takes the kids your market value has

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210
who takes the kids your market value has
 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.180
who takes the kids your market value has
declined radically you're going to be

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190
declined radically you're going to be
 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.500
declined radically you're going to be
poorer the man is just as screwed

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510
poorer the man is just as screwed
 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.790
poorer the man is just as screwed
because he is now an indentured servant

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800
because he is now an indentured servant
 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.900
because he is now an indentured servant
and there's no escape from it so it's an

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910
and there's no escape from it so it's an
 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.300
and there's no escape from it so it's an
it's not so bad if you can negotiate a

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310
it's not so bad if you can negotiate a
 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.250
it's not so bad if you can negotiate a
peaceful separation and some people can

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260
peaceful separation and some people can
 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
peaceful separation and some people can
but lots of times if you have a terrible

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270
but lots of times if you have a terrible
 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.390
but lots of times if you have a terrible
relationship it's not like negotiating a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400
relationship it's not like negotiating a
 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.790
relationship it's not like negotiating a
peaceful separation is all that easy but

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800
peaceful separation is all that easy but
 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.160
peaceful separation is all that easy but
if you're at each other's throats good

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170
if you're at each other's throats good
 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.110
if you're at each other's throats good
luck to you I think it's roughly

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120
luck to you I think it's roughly
 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.290
luck to you I think it's roughly
equivalent to having non fatal cancer it

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300
equivalent to having non fatal cancer it
 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.990
equivalent to having non fatal cancer it
is not pleasant it's a 10-year process

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
is not pleasant it's a 10-year process
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.910
is not pleasant it's a 10-year process
15 year process will cost you two

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920
15 year process will cost you two
 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.290
15 year process will cost you two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars and

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300
hundred and fifty thousand dollars and
 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.540
hundred and fifty thousand dollars and
it'll tear a big chunk out of your life

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550
it'll tear a big chunk out of your life
 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.880
