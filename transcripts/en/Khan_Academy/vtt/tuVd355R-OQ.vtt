00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's do a few more examples
of solving equations.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.000
And I think you're going to
see that these equations

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.640
require a few more steps
than the ones we

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.490
did in the last video.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.420
But the fun thing about these is
that there's more than one

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.060
way to do it.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.260
But as long as you do legitimate
steps, as long as

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.760
anything you do to the left-hand
side, you also do to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.760
the right-hand side, you should
move in the correct

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.100
direction, or you shouldn't
get the wrong answer.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.990
So let's do a couple of these.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.870
So the first one says-- I'll
rewrite it-- 1.3 times x minus

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.280
0.7 times x is equal to 12.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.080
Well, here the first thing that
my instinct is to do, is

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.900
to merge these two terms.
Because I have 1.3 of

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.020
something minus 0.7 of
that same something.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.180
This is the same variable.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.340
If I have 1.3 apples minus 0.7
apples, well, why don't I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.840
subtract 0.7 from 1.3?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:01.530
And I will get 1.3 minus 0.7
x's, or apples, or whatever

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.610
you want to call them.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.720
So is equal to 12.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.800
You could imagine that I did
the reverse distributive

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.430
property out here.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.080
I factored out an x.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.610
But the way my head thinks about
it is, I have 1.3 of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.180
something minus 0.7 of
something, that's going to be

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.240
equal to 1.3 minus 0.7 of those
somethings, that x.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:30.570
And of course 1.3 minus 0.7 is
0.6 times x of my somethings

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.750
is equal to 12.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.970
And now, this looks just like
one of the problems we did in

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.690
the last video.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.450
We have a coefficient times x is
equal to some other number.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140
Well, let's divide both sides
of this equation by that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.870
coefficient.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.310
Divide both sides by 0.6.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.970
So the left-hand side will
just become an x.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.700
X is equal to-- and what
is 12 divided by 0.6?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.160
0.6 goes into 12-- let's add
some decimal points here--

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.870
that's the same thing
as 6 going into 120.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.320
6 goes into 12.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.630
2 times 2, times 6 is 12.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.280
Subtract, you get a 0.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.570
6 goes into 0 0 times.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.840
So it's going to go 20 times.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.090
12 divided by 0.6 is 20.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.070
And we can verify.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.080
Let's verify this.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.760
1.3, let's substitute it back.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.090
1.3 times 20, minus
0.7, times 20.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.110
Let's verify that that
is equal to 12.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.760
So I'll take the calculator out,
just so you don't have to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.590
trust my math.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.940
So we have 1.3 times
20 is equal to 26.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.960
So this piece right
here is 26.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.640
And then 0.7 times 20.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.920
I don't need a calculator
for that.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.990
That is 14.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.440
26 minus 14 is 12.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.400
So it checks out.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.590
We got the right answer
for this equation.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.590
x is equal to 20.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.210
Let's do this one right here.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.640
5x minus 3x plus 2
is equal to 1.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.860
This looks very complicated.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.420
And whenever something looks
daunting, just do steps that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.280
look like they're simplifying
the equation.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.610
And over time, as long as you
do legitimate steps, you

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.520
should be able to make
some progress.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.530
So the first thing I want to
do, is I want to distribute

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.780
this negative 1 over here.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.150
So this is the same thing
as 5x minus 3x, minus 2.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.390
Right?

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.530
I just did the distributive
property on the 3x and the 2.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.960
This is a negative 1
times 3x plus 2.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.270
So it's negative 1 times 3x,
plus negative 1 times 2.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.460
Or negative 3x minus 2.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.440
And that is going to
be equal to 1.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.500
Now, I have 5 of something
minus 3

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.720
of that same something.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.490
So that's going to be equal
to 2 of that something.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.080
5x minus 3x is 2x.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.370
5 minus 3 is 2.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.570
And then I have the minus
2 is equal to 1.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.470
And now, I like to get into the
form where I have 2x, or I

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.370
have something times x is
equal to something.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.070
So I want to get rid of
this negative 2 on

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.390
the left-hand side.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.880
The best way I know how
to do that is to

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.470
add 2 to both sides.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.209
So add a 2 on the
left-hand side.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.930
If I do it to the left-hand
side, I've got to do it to the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.440
right-hand side.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.870
Plus 2 on the right-hand side.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.780
These two guys will cancel out,
and you're going to get

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.910
2x is equal to 1 plus
2, is equal to 3.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.550
And now you can divide both
sides by 2, and you get x is

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.680
equal to 3/2.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.910
And I'll leave it for you to
verify that this is indeed the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.900
correct answer.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.040
Let me draw a little line here
so that our work doesn't get

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.490
messy, although that might have
made it even messier.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.600
So here we have to
solve for s.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.850
And look, we have a fraction
and 2 s terms.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.030
How do we do that?

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.120
Well, just do it the same way.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.010
We have 1 times s minus-- you
can view this as 3/8 times s

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.500
is equal to 5/6.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.970
You could view this as 1 times
s, minus 3/8 times

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.800
s is equal to 5/6.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.920
You could factor out
an s, if you like.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.750
Maybe I'll do it this way.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.680
I'll factor it onto the
left-hand side.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.440
This is the same thing
as s times 1, minus

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.520
3/8 is equal to 5/6.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.730
And 1 minus 3/8, what is that?

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.930
That 1, I can rewrite as 8/8.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.030
That's 1.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.980
So this is the same thing as 8/8
minus 3/8 is 5/8, times s.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.680
You could switch the order
of multiplication.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.510
5/8 times s is equal to 5/6.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.020
And you might be able to
go straight from that.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.100
If I have 1 of something minus
3/8 of that something, I have

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.980
8/8 of that something minus
3/8 of that something, I'm

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.340
going to have 5/8 of
that something.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.450
And now, to solve for s, I can
multiply both sides by the

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.120
inverse of this coefficient.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.900
So I multiply 8 over
5 times 5/8s.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.790
If I do it to the left-hand
side, I have to do it to the

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.650
right-hand side.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.370
8 over 5.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.100
I multiplied by 8 over 5 so
that those cancel out and

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.380
those cancel out.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.660
And you are left with s is equal
to-- right, this is just

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.750
a 1-- is equal to-- well,
the 5's we can divide.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.910
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 5.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.140
Divide the numerator by 2 and
the denominator by 2.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.890
You're left with-- sorry, divide
the denominator by 2,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.890
you get 6 divided by 2 is 3.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.740
You're left with 4/3.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.860
s is equal to 4/3.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.010
Let's do one more of these.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.640
So here I have 5 times q minus
7 over 12 is equal to 2/3.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.570
So let me write this.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.290
And I could rewrite this as just
5 over 12 times q minus 7

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.890
is equal to 2/3.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.390
And what I want to do with this
video, is to show you

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.330
that I can do it two
different ways.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.210
But as long as I do legitimate
operations, I should get the

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.240
same answer.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.670
So the first way I'm going
to do it, is I'm going to

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.500
multiply both sides of
this equation by

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.040
the inverse of 5/12.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.460
So I'm going to multiply both
sides by 12 over 5.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.200
Because I wanted to get
rid of this 5/12 on

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.820
the left-hand side.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.510
It makes everything look
a little bit messy.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.470
And I multiply it by 12 over 5,
because these are going to

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:30.960
cancel out.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960
The 5 and the 5 cancel out, the
12 and the 12 cancel out.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.190
So the left-hand side of my
equation becomes q minus 7 is

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.860
equal to the right-hand
side, 2/3 times 5/12.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.450
If you divide the 12
by 3, you get a 4.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.190
You divide the 3 by
3, you get a 1.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:52.080
So 2 times 4 is 8 over 5.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.960
And now we can add 7 to both
sides of this equation.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.490
So let's add-- I want to do that
in a different color--

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.340
add 7 to both sides
of this equation.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.880
These two 7's cancel out.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.080
That was the whole point
of adding the 7.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.650
And you are left with q is
equal to 8/5 plus 7.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:22.270
Or we could write 8/5 plus
7 can be written as 35/5.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.075
And so this is going to be
equal to 8-- well, the

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:27.720
denominator is 5.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.490
8 plus 35 is 43.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.990
So my answer, going this way,
is q is equal to 43/5.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.250
And I said I would
do it two ways.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.520
Let's do it another way.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.240
So let me write the
same problem down.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.310
So I have 5/12-- actually, let
me just do it a completely

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.240
different way.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.890
Let me write it the
way they wrote it.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:58.590
5 times q minus 7, over
12 is equal to 2/3.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.410
Let me just get rid of the 12
first. Let me multiply both

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.890
sides of this equation by 12.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.830
I just don't like that 12
sitting there, so I'm going to

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.530
multiply both sides by 12.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.430
So these are going to cancel
out, and you're going to be

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:17.440
left with 5 times q minus 7
is equal to 2/3 times 12.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.020
That's the same thing
as 24 over 3.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.620
So this is, let me write this.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.570
2 over 3 times 12 over 1 is
equal to-- if you divide that

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.610
by 3, you get a 4, divide
that by 3, you get a

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.590
1-- is equal to 8.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.700
So you get 5 times q minus
7 is equal to 8.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.140
And then instead of dividing
both sides by 5, which would

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.090
get us pretty close to what we
were doing over here, let me

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.510
distribute this 5, I just want
to show you, you can do it

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.210
multiple legitimate ways.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.830
So 5 times q is 5q.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:53.130
5 times negative 7 is minus, or
negative 35, is equal to 8.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.030
5q minus 35 is equal to 8.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.630
Now, if I want to get rid of
that minus 35, or that

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.230
negative 35, the best
way to do it is to

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.750
add 35 to both sides.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.650
I did that so that these cancel
out, and I'm left with

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:15.120
5q is equal to 8 plus
35, which is 43.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.110
Now I can multiply both sides of
this equation by 1/5, which

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.720
is the same thing as dividing
both sides by 5.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.970
And these cancel out.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.340
You get q is equal
to 43 over 5.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.410
So there's a bunch of ways you
can do these problems. But as

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.410
long as you do legitimate
steps, you will

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.150
get the right answer.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.140
And I'll leave it to you to
verify that this truly is the

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.240
right answer for q.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.310
This is the q that will
satisfy this equation.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.240
Let's do one word
problem here.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.710
Jade is stranded downtown with
only $10 to get home.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:57.880
Taxis cost $0.75 per mile, but
there's an additional $2.35

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.380
hire charge.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.080
Write a formula and use it to
calculate how many miles she

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.290
can travel with her money.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:05.790
All right.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.250
So the total cost of a cab ride
is going to be equal to

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:18.960
just the initial hire charge,
which is $2.35, plus the $0.75

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.010
per mile, times the
number of miles.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.780
We're letting m is equal to
the miles she travels.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.030
Miles traveled.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.710
So this is the equation.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.700
We know that she only
has $10 to get home.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.890
So her cost has to be $10.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.210
So we have to say, the
cost has to be $10.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:52.370
So 10 is equal to
2.35 plus 0.75m.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.320
So how do we solve for
m, or the number of

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.815
miles Jade can travel?

00:11:56.815 --> 00:12:00.150
Well, we can get rid of the 2.35
on this right-hand side

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.830
by subtracting that
amount from both

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.860
sides of this equation.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.900
So let's do that.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:13.020
So let's subtract minus
2.35 from both sides.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.470
These will cancel out.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.620
That was the point.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:25.880
The left-hand side-- what
is 10 minus 2.35?

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.390
Now, these will cancel out.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.040
Now what is 10 minus 2.35?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.070
10 minus 2 is 8.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.580
10 minus 2.3 is 7.7.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.620
So it's going to be 7.65.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.270
If you want to believe
me, let's do it.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.150
10 minus 2.35.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.220
7.65.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:56.220
And that is going to
be equal to 0.75m.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.480
Let me write that in
that same color.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.050
It's nice to see where different
things came from.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.360
0.75m.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.930
I have, like, five shades
of this purple here.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.770
so this is that, that is that,
and then these two guys

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.970
canceled out.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.682
Now to solve for m, I can just
divide both sides by 0.75.

00:13:16.682 --> 00:13:20.340
So if I divide that side by
0.75, I have to do it to the

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.350
left-hand side as well.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.430
0.75.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.990
That cancels out, so on the
right-hand side, I'm left

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.380
with just an m.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.540
And on the left-hand side-- I'll
have to get my calculator

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:37.350
out for this one-- I have 7.65
divided by 0.75, which is

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:42.320
equal to 10.2.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.930
m is 10.2, so Jade can
travel 10.2 miles.
