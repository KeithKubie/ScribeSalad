1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,350
December,
1944

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:07,720
yeah.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,610
In the city of Bastogne,
Belgium during the battle of the bulge,

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,200
the American soldiers primarily from
the hundred and first airborne division,

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,530
but also from the nine 69th artillery
battalion and Combat Command B of the 10th

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:29,230
Armored Division.
We're surrounded by Germans.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,670
They were outnumbered by
approximately five to one.

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,440
They were lacking in cold weather gear.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,010
They were short on ammunition and
low on food and medical supplies.

10
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,440
The weather was horrible

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,620
due to heavy cloud cover.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,800
Resupply from the air was not possible.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,890
They appeared to be doomed.

14
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,530
That is certainly what
the Germans thought.

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,240
So on the 22nd of December,

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,170
the German sent a message with two young
German officers offering an opportunity

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,360
for the Americans to surrender
the message.

18
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,373
Read

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,850
to the u s a commander of the
encircled town of Bastogne.

20
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,460
The fortune of war is changing
this time.

21
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,670
The USA forces in [inaudible]
near Bastogne have been
encircled by strong German

22
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,900
armored units.

23
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,290
Yeah.

24
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,290
More German armored units have crossed
the river or Fu near or Fruitville have

25
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,700
taken marsh.

26
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,290
I have reached st who bear by
passing through on Bray Cbrei Tla.

27
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,990
Libra mall is in German hands.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,160
There was only one possibility
to save the Incircl,

29
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:13,380
the USA troops from total annihilation.

30
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,350
That is honorable surrender
of the encircled town.

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,863
Yeah.

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,800
In order to think it
over a term of two hours,

33
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:27,820
we'll be granted beginning with
the presentation of this note.

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,890
If this proposal should be rejected,

35
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,070
one German artillery core and six heavy
a battalion's are ready to annihilate

36
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,370
the USA troops in and near Bastogne.

37
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,170
The order for firing will be given
immediately after this two hours term.

38
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,630
All the serious civilian losses caused
by this artillery fire would not

39
00:02:56,331 --> 00:03:00,040
correspond with the well
known American humanity

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,450
signed the German commander,

41
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,300
the American commander
General Anthony Mcauliffe.

42
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,170
Upon hearing this offer
didn't like the idea at all.

43
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,370
In fact,
his initial response was simply nuts.

44
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,990
After a little discussion with his staff
on what the proper written response

45
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:30,890
would be,
they decided that was the proper response.

46
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,730
So they put together a formal note
on letterhead to return to the German

47
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,470
commander.
It red

48
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,140
22 December,

49
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,080
1944 to the German commander nuts

50
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,170
signed the American
commander on Christmas Eve.

51
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,410
General Mcauliffe sent out a message
to his troops in the besieged city.

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,353
It red

53
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,010
headquarters hundred and first Airborne
Division Office of the Division

54
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:17,380
Commander 24 December, 1944

55
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,140
what's Mary about all this you ask,
we're fighting.

56
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,660
It's cold. We aren't home. All true,

57
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,020
but what has the Proud Eagle Division
accomplished with its worthy comrades of

58
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:40,640
the 10th Armored Division, the
705th tank, destroyer battalion,

59
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:45,050
and all the rest? Just
this. We have stopped cold.

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,580
Everything that has been thrown
at us from the north, east, south,

61
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,540
and West.

62
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,710
We have identifications from four German
Panzer divisions to German infantry

63
00:04:57,351 --> 00:05:00,380
divisions and one German
parachute division.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,410
These units spearheading the
last desperate German lunge.

65
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,320
We're headed straight west for key points.
When the Eagle Division was heard,

66
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,370
the ordered to stem the advance,

67
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,790
how effectively this was done
will be written in history,

68
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,860
not alone in our divisions, glorious
history, but in world history.

69
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,430
Okay.

70
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,280
The Germans actually did surround us.

71
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,910
Their radios blared our doom.

72
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,140
Their commander demanded our surrender
in the following in Putin arrogance

73
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,160
and that's when the general added in the
note of the German surrender demand and

74
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:50,490
he gave his response,
the simple response of nuts,

75
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,790
do you want it all the troops to know?

76
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,950
And then he closed out the memo explaining
their current situation on the ground.

77
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,450
The message continued.

78
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,410
Allied troops are counter
attacking in force.

79
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,400
We continued to hold
Bastogne by holding Bastogne.

80
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,700
We assure the success
of the allied armies.

81
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,010
We know that our division commander
General Taylor will say, well done.

82
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,390
We are giving our country
and our loved ones at home,

83
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:33,391
a worthy Christmas present
at being privileged to take
part in this gallon feet

84
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,870
of arms are truly making for ourselves.
Well,

85
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:38,890
merry Christmas.

86
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,880
A C McAuliffe.

87
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,683
Well,

88
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,860
the Germans did attack Bastogne on
Christmas Day and they did initially break

89
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,050
through the American perimeter,

90
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,000
but the American soldiers stood
their ground and defeated the attack,

91
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,790
eventually destroying
all the German tanks.

92
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,080
Then the next day, the 26th
of December, General Patents,

93
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:16,990
Fourth Armored Division along
with the 26th infantry division,

94
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,140
broke through to Bastogne and opened up
a quarter to relieve the embattled but

95
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:23,620
Victoria's troops.

96
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,730
It was a glorious example of will and
defiance and undaunted courage in the face

97
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,300
of seemingly insurmountable odds.

98
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,430
And it was an example
of the victory of light

99
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,070
over darkness.

100
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,660
But let us never forget
that forever you victory.

101
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,440
There is a cost.

102
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,530
There is sacrifice.

103
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,740
And one letter home

104
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,860
also written on Christmas Eve,

105
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,790
December 24th,

106
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,790
1944 from the battle of the bulge
by Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Blair,

107
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,450
the commanding officer.

108
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,310
Yeah.

109
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,310
Of the 268 field artillery battalion who
was born in New Orleans and raised in

110
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:33,954
Mississippi.

111
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,280
This letter shows some of that sacrifice.

112
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,260
The letter was written to
Colonel Blair's parents,

113
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,960
but in the letter he also speaks of his
young wife Mary and their three year old

114
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,220
daughter Susan.

115
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,790
This is what he wrote.

116
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,030
Do Your folks
well,

117
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,600
so this is Christmas Eve.

118
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,780
I've spent a lot of lonely ones. Those
when I've been away from you and Mary.

119
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:19,940
Yeah,

120
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,280
but I've never spent
one quite this lonely.

121
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,520
Yeah,

122
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,230
and one in which the Christmas spirit
seems so lacking in the surroundings.

123
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,480
Even the first one,

124
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:35,530
if the war with Mary leaving the
next day was not so bad as this one,

125
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,680
then I had things to worry
about and lots of work to do,

126
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,010
but here everything is as it has been

127
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,550
the same day in day out routine and all
I have to think of is how much I miss

128
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:56,491
you and Mary and Suzy and what
fund and how comfortable and right

129
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,103
it would be

130
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,510
if we were all spending Christmas
Eve and Christmas together.

131
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,620
We will have Turkey tomorrow.

132
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:12,770
Yeah.

133
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,120
Then some of the men will have received
Christmas packages and that will be the

134
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:18,680
extent of our Christmas.

135
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,020
There is no peace around us,
no peace in our hearts.

136
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,360
The Christmas star is an airplane flair.

137
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,100
The three wise men,
where are they now?

138
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,200
There's nothing here,
but anger and men's hearts.

139
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,130
The wisest men are those who do the best
job of killing the enemy while avoiding

140
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,910
death themselves.

141
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,740
The mangers are corrupt with dead and
rotting cattle and the village ends gape

142
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:07,160
at the night through the glass list,
windows and tireless roofs.

143
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,670
The gifts of the Maggi

144
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,000
are steel and flame

145
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,090
and high explosives,

146
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,370
but deep in my heart,

147
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,313
yeah,

148
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,640
I know that peace will come again
and families will again be together

149
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,720
for God and his son are watching over
us and protecting us all as well as we

150
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,164
will let them.

151
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,730
So
in the hope of tomorrow

152
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,180
then the piece to dear

153
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,070
dad and mom,
merry Christmas to you

154
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,810
and a happy and peaceful new year.

155
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,710
All my love.
Your son

156
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,223
Arthur.

157
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,013
Well,

158
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,550
Arthur did not make it home
to be with his family again

159
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,613
the next day,

160
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,190
Christmas 1944 as he was
wishing the officers and men
of his battalion and Merry

161
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,350
Christmas, a German shell hit
wounding several of the men

162
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,940
and killing Colonel Arthur W.
Blair.

163
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,970
He was one of the 19,000 Americans
killed in the battle of the bulge.

164
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,480
Then one of the thousands
upon thousands upon thousands

165
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,290
that have died for our flag

166
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,560
and the ideals of freedom

167
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,880
that it represents.

168
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,750
Carnal. Blair's executive officer
wrote a letter to the family

169
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,703
and said,

170
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,860
the memory of the kernel is one that will
always be kept green by those who knew

171
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:46,940
him,
had served with him.

172
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,110
He was an outstandingly gallon officer,
a fine leader,

173
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,680
and above all else,
a true gentleman

174
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,320
on the field of battle
where there can be no sham.

175
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,770
He proved it beyond the
question of a doubt.

176
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,610
Okay?

177
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,080
And the executive officer signed
off the letter quoting Shakespeare

178
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,670
when her ratio bid,

179
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,850
a final farewell to his friend Hamlet.

180
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,990
Now cracks and noble heart.
Good night,

181
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:35,991
sweet prince and flights of
angels sing the to thy rest,

182
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,690
to all those noble souls
that left us too young.

183
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,570
Third cracked our hearts.

184
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,670
We bid you the same goodbye.

185
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,100
May flights of angels
send you to your arrest.

186
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,980
We will remember you always,

187
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,700
and we are thinking of you
this holiday season.

188
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,320
Merry Christmas.
Have a happy new year to all

189
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,630
and may there be peace on earth.
