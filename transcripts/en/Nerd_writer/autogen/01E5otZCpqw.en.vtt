00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.340
 When I write these movie analysis, I usually read the movie again. 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.220
 Write down what I think is interesting 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.700
 When I started watching Wang Jiawei’s "In the Mood for Love" 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 The first thing I wrote was 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.620
 Actor characteristics of each shot 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.320
 Not only created by the composition of the film 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.700
 But through the details 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.520
 This is the visual technology that filmmakers have used for decades. 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.180
 My favorite example is the last shot of John Ford's masterpiece, "Searcher." 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.000
 But rarely used so widely 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.180
 With the development of the film, I recorded five points in my notebook. 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.120
 And changed to six ⋯ seven ⋯ nine ⋯ 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.440
 I didn’t see the first mirror until the 12th minute. 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.220
 No foreground obstacles 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.800
 This mirror, the key is not to take the two main axes as the axis 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.240
 Wait a minute, I am surpassing myself. 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.660
 "In the Mood for Love" tells the story of two married couples 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.100
 They rented a house in the old couple's home in Hong Kong in the 1960s. 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.220
 The film focuses on a husband and wife husband Mr. Zhou 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.800
 And Mrs. Chen, the wife of another couple 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 They gradually discovered that their spouse was cheating them. 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.500
 Then the two innocent victims 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.300
 Face this pain together 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.120
 The film is deeply interested in the topic 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.740
 At the same time, it is presented in colorful film photography. 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.740
 Story timing jump 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.120
 Because people will recall the story in memory 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.780
 The audience is often confused about the transition between scenes 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.620
 This prompts that there is a strong need to pay attention to the film. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.200
 But it also reflects the film making process 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.480
 When Wang Jiawei and his staff started shooting, there was only a piecemeal idea. 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.800
 Lasted 15 months 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.980
 The script and personal scene are also impromptu 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.360
 By the director and the actor 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.440
 This is amazing because watching a movie 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.600
 You will feel completely controlled 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.700
 In the visual and emotional aspects, "In the Mood for Love" is completely consistent. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.100
 This movie is so independent that there are only a few locations 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.600
 Shooting from the same angle 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.060
 Let you experience the cycle of returning to the same thing again and again 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.760
 This technique does not sluggish or repeat and is not a fixed background 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.420
 What is actually changing in the movie - the inner life of the two main lines 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.820
 In most cases, these inner lives are silent explorations. 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.060
 Real action through gestures and contact 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.220
 By limiting the language, Wang Jiawei responded to the restrictions of action 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.680
 Mr. Zhou and Mrs. Chen, bothering the 1960s 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.100
 They have been threatened by rumors 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.800
 a surveillance from homeowners and the entire community 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.460
 This is why everything is a double framework 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.020
 By placing objects in the foreground, the director can enhance the feeling of the character. 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.280
 Observed by us 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.980
 Repeated observations to see our desire for others and the desire of others for us 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.080
 This is the theme of "In the Mood for Love" 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.080
 I think the most extraordinary element in the movie is what I just introduced. 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.320
 The two protagonists admit each other: their spouse is kicking 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.640
 Their goal is not to face this situation but to understand 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.040
 How does this happen? 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.300
 So we saw this incredible scene and they re-enacted their spouse 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.960
 Each of them tries to embody the spouse of the other party and is guided by the other party. 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.880
 They think that the spouse will really do this or not 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.260
 This becomes very complicated and an illegitimate interaction 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.680
 Although this film only focuses on Mr. Zhou and Mrs. Chen. 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.900
 Even the spouse who never showed up 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.500
 But we always know that there are four people involved here, not just two people. 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.100
 But this is not four real people. It is two people and two imaginations. 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.380
 Think about the requirements for Zhou and Chen in the temptation scene. 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.160
 In order to understand what happened, they all tried to seduce each other. 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
 In the form of the other’s spouse 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.500
 It must be done from the beginning because the matter itself means 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.320
 No matter whether it is Zhou or Chen, they can no longer violate the desire they want to recreate. 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.900
 You can describe this behavior as masochistic 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.940
 And Wang Jiawei makes us feel this when they 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.380
 Are themselves or each other’s spouse 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.100
 Before reality, we tend to be only one-sided interpretation 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.380
 Or maybe the current unreal is like a shock 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.320
 But they constantly guide each other so they can build a fantasy in it. 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.840
 They control their betrayal 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.660
 And never made them love each other, Mr. Zhou and Mrs. Chen. 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.820
 Infinite delay, they must see the moment of truth 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.060
 Still staying in their fantasy 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.780
 This is a tragic and distorted state of affairs and Wang Jiawei said if 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.680
 Liang Chaowei and Maggie Cheung are not so beautiful actors. 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.660
 Their darkness and fantasy are obvious 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.640
 Of course they can't keep it forever and in the scene where Mr. Zhou finally admits his love for Mrs. Chen. 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.840
 Most of the fantasies are shattered 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:45.020
 As he said they are like their spouse means something they have been refusing to see. 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.440
 Their shortcoming is that they are no longer the object of the spouse’s love but rush into consciousness. 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.040
 Like the waves 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.440
 However, they did not take action 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.400
 They can only let this cruel truth swell 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.980
 For life, for the future, Mr. Zhou and Mrs. Chen are not willing to miss the relationship. 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.580
 That's why the last movie showed us that they missed each other twice. 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:18.020
 Just missing the other party is only the possibility of connection, not the connection itself 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.920
 Is the thing that supports them now. 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.040
 Everyone is living in the framework of fantasy 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.680
 Sometimes the frame is made by us and sometimes made by others 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.520
 Sometimes we need to believe that what we do is created by others 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.400
 But there is no way to get rid of the framework anyway. 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.580
 When the fantasy rupture completely collapses, it is trauma 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.400
 Like living temporarily in the storm 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.360
 Wang Jiawei’s "In the Mood for Love" is a gorgeous quiet and painful exploration of what will happen at that time. 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.340
 You create a false fantasy for yourself 

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.020
 When it's just to stop you from avoiding the pain of creating it 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:09.200
 And this movie is so heartbreaking because of this distortion 

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.940
 It’s too common for everyone 

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.540
