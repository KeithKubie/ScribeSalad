00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:09.526
&gt;&gt;Chris Kelly: I'll give you guys
a short overview of your choices.

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:11.736
You then will go into the survey
and figure out what's going

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:12.956
to be the best use of your time.

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:16.466
Once I get your info, then we'll be
able to figure out what the geography

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.466
of the room is going to be.

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:21.786
&gt;&gt;By having access to lots of different
sources of data I'm able to set students

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:25.606
up with learning situations
in which no student feels

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:29.736
like they are over-challenged
or feels like they're way ahead

00:00:29.736 --> 00:00:30.926
and there's nothing of value.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.186
In short, the student's time
has purpose and allows them

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:36.366
to be able to reach mastery.

00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:45.366
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen: Here at Summit
we serve a wide range of students

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.586
and we want to make sure that the
expectations are exactly the same

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:51.786
for students, regardless of their
background or their prior preparation.

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:56.626
In order for us to be effective
educators we need to see real-time data

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.526
to ensure that the way
that I am spending my time

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.276
as a teacher is actually
meeting the goals

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:04.616
of all the kids that
are in my classroom.

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.256
&gt;&gt;Chris Kelly: So, in terms of
choices, and this has a lot to do

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:10.976
with the survey I sent out
yesterday around office hours,

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:15.556
about half of you said that
you wanted a lesson on skills.

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:17.526
&gt;&gt;I do remember my own
high school experience.

00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:19.986
If I was ahead I'm thinking
to myself, "How am I going

00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:21.286
to kill fifty-five minutes?"

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:25.756
And if I was behind, I felt frustrated
and I felt like I was wasting my time

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:29.276
because I wasn't getting the
support or the help I needed.

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:32.226
So, a survey can give you
really valuable information

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.486
about what those needs
so you can meet them.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.066
&gt;&gt;You guys can go ahead and go into
your Chromebooks, go to your email,

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:41.506
and then there is the Day 7 survey.

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:46.656
&gt;&gt;Kayla: At the beginning of
every class we take a survey

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:50.786
and it just helps us determine where we
are in the project and then he'll set

00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:55.046
up workshops and places for people to go
based on where they are on the survey.

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:57.216
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen:
It could be a Google survey

00:01:57.246 --> 00:02:01.346
or a quick thumbs up-thumbs
down to a mini-quiz to ensure

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:04.516
that we actually know what
our kids need that day

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:06.686
and that we are giving them
exactly what they need.

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:09.866
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: You are going
to write three different facts

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:14.376
that you could include in a introduction
paragraph for this lab report.

00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:19.536
You guys have two minutes and thirty
seconds to come up with three things.

00:02:19.816 --> 00:02:22.836
Pass those sheet of papers forward.

00:02:22.836 --> 00:02:26.666
&gt;&gt;Knowing where every single student
is at all times in the day allows me

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:29.676
to deliver the support
that each child needs.

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:32.546
Some of the ways that I build
that into my classroom are

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:35.106
by doing pre-assessments in class.

00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:38.886
So, the warm-up will be of an
activity that the students can fill out

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:43.886
and then I can just differentiate the
class based on those stacks of paper.

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:47.446
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: So, if your name is in
a gray box I would like to guide you

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:50.126
through an annotation where
you check yourself to see

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.446
if you have all the information
required to get a seven.

00:02:52.446 --> 00:02:55.036
Can I have you guys move now?

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:56.946
&gt;&gt;Armando: The teachers here
they always know where you're at,

00:02:56.946 --> 00:02:59.106
so I think it's a great
thing that they could, like,

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:01.406
constantly see where your grades
are at, what you're struggling with.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.896
If you need, like, help with a specific
grade, they could help you with that.

00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:13.916
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen: We have
an online platform where all

00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:17.756
of the curriculum lives and
where students take assessments

00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:19.376
that show their mastery.

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:22.166
It also gives the same
data to their teachers.

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:25.656
And, so, the teachers can use
the platform to make decisions

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:28.026
about how they want to use
their instructional time.

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:29.806
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: Go ahead
and open you computers.

00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:33.886
There's tons of other readings
that we uploaded into the PLP.

00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:36.106
They're based on your reading level.

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:38.976
&gt;&gt;PLP stands for Personalized
Learning Plan

00:03:39.116 --> 00:03:44.096
and the PLP tool is the technology
platform that students are using

00:03:44.196 --> 00:03:49.716
to learn content to get
feedback and to complete work.

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:53.696
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: So, you are ready for the
Level 5 or comparing and contrasting--

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:56.116
&gt;&gt;Students and teachers have access
to the same Google documents.

00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:57.756
So, everything is real-time.

00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:02.606
&gt;&gt;Chrystal: In the PLP is where we are
able to see our progress and our grades.

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:06.216
Because I'm able to request feedback,
I'm able to understand what I need to do

00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:07.456
in order to improve my grade.

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:11.266
And I'm also able to see where I'm
going to be on track and, like,

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:15.436
what I need to do in order
to be more on top of my work.

00:04:15.916 --> 00:04:17.566
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: I'm able to know
where they are and further,

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:21.966
I can deliver that message about
how they're doing in class,

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:25.006
what they need to work
on, so much more quickly

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:26.526
than I could before the use of the plan.

00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:30.406
&gt;&gt;Chris Kelly: With all these different
data streams that I've got coming in,

00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:36.126
whether it's the survey or a PLP, I've
got access to information that allows me

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:40.496
to set students up with the learning
situations, with the sorts of choices

00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:43.636
that they need to make in order
to get a first-class education.

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:47.726
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen: So, I think the
most important thing that we do here is

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:52.726
to ensure that our teaching is
personalized to really build outcomes

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:56.886
that are appropriate to your
learners and create an action plan

00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:59.266
where your feedback is
meeting them where they are at

00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:01.006
and pushing them to where
they need to go.

00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:01.516
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: Chairs up.

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:01.996
Bye, guys.

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:02.076
Bye.

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.076
&gt;&gt;Student: Thank you!

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:04.516
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: Bye!
