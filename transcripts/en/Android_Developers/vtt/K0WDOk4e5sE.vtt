00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.309
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Ahoy me hearties, it's Wednesday
afternoon and welcome to your International

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.490
Talk Like a Pirate Day edition of
the Android Developers Office Hours EMEA edition.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.490
[laughter]

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.490
&gt;&gt;Al: Argh!

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.970
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Drinking your first mate here. [Laughter]

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.430
&gt;&gt;Rich: [unintelligible chatter] Go Sparky!
Was it a late night last night?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.180
&gt;&gt;Sparky: We're here to, we’re here to talk
about anything and everything related to Android

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.060
development. So, Rich, do you
want to give your standard disclaimer?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.580
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes. Questions asked in a pirate fashion
will be taken twice as seriously as any other

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.050
questions. We're wearing
clashing--rather matching t-shirts by accident.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.260
It's certainly not planned and we won't be
talking about any future events product

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.590
releases hence events--anything that hasn't
been previously announced so please don't

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.000
ask, and that's the standard stuff.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
[throbbing sound]

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.439
We've got quite a few people in the Hangout
with us today so I'll just run through, so

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.439
I'll say "Hello Al, good to see you here
today."

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.439
[crashing sound]

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.439
&gt;&gt;Al: Hey guys.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.439
&gt;&gt;Nick: How are you today?

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.719
&gt;&gt;Rich: Is that Andrew Kelly next to Al there,
can we have a little a cursor on that?

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:17.719
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.180
&gt;&gt;Rich: Andrew Kelly, one man moderator machine,
good to see you--

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.060
[weird robotic noises]

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.310
[Unintelligible speech]

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.810
&gt;&gt;Rich: Um right--that window

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.810
[Laughter]

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.810
Marc: Argh!

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.130
Go to the next one. Hi, Marc as well, you
seem to know Sparky already. Paul, Richard

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.350
Thompson, Sparky of course and Tom. Glad to
see you all.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.579
So before we kick off into the moderator today.
Obviously I'm here with Matt and Nick. You

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.609
must know these guys well.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:47.609
&gt;&gt;Nick: Hello.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:48.609
&gt;&gt;Matt: Hi.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:49.609
[laughter]

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.850
&gt;&gt;Rich: Does anyone have any questions?

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.850
&gt;&gt;Marc: Yeah?

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.710
&gt;&gt;Rich: Go for it.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.619
&gt;&gt;Marc: Shall we start?

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.380
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah yeah, if you've got a question
let's go for it.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.710
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Please do.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.399
&gt;&gt;Marc: Okay, then I'll start maybe. Yeah,
I'll ask question maybe about the assets--assets

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.560
folder on the library project. I
already asked that on the moderator regarding

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.580
the inheritance of the assets because we have
some, like for example, some

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.020
refuse--just some HTML files and some graphics--jpeg
files--not fancy stuff and we have for example

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.640
the library project with common
HTML files and common images and now we always

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.610
need to copy this assets over to the final
projects in order to get the stuff done

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.580
but I think this would be a really nice thing
to let the SDK tools do it because it is plain

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.870
simple to just copy the assets
over and do a simple inheritance and I'm just

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.040
asking why it isn't there because it's an
easy feature in my opinion.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.860
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I think it's because assets are--it's
a folder location--

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.860
&gt;&gt;Marc: Exactly.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.020
&gt;&gt;Sparky:--and it's relative to the directed
space location. If you read the documentation

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.680
carefully, it says that although raw
assets are not supported for library projects,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.950
that raw resources are so anything you drop
into 'res'--

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.950
&gt;&gt;Marc: I know.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.050
&gt;&gt;Sparky:--'res' raw should be okay. I mean,
there's really, apart from a minor API difference

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.210
in how you access it, there's not a
lot of difference between how you deal with

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.630
a raw resource versus an asset resource.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.110
&gt;&gt;Al: I had a quick look around on this one
and there is a post from Zapia from ADT team

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.000
and basically what is says is that he's
not come up with enough time to work on an

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.410
intelligent solution for collisions between
assets that are in the library project and

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.290
assets which are in your actual application
project. So I think it's one of those things

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.640
that's on the list and just hasn't been
got round to yet.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.990
&gt;&gt;Marc: Oh, okay. That would be a good explanation
because it's--I don't know where there's so

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.210
many collisions for example you
have the order of the library projects defined

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.240
and you have also the inheritance of the library
projects defined and I think

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.621
because it's just a simple folder with files
in it, you could just copy them over into

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:22.130
the right folder and you're done basically.
I don't know what they really mean with this

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.130
conflict--collisions.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.410
&gt;&gt;Al: The problem comes if any of the libraries
require honor of an asset of a certain name

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.000
and if a library further up the chain
uses that same name for a different type of

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.630
asset you then get undefined behaviors in
one of your libraries because it doesn't know--it's

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.650
not getting the correct asset under that name.
So if you have a chat project that has a list

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.030
called "Blah" and something else that
has a graphic called "Blah" you'll find that

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.770
your chat library gets a graphic rather than
the list it expects and probably throw

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.600
out errors that you shouldn't normally see.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.430
&gt;&gt;Marc: Okay.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.770
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Sounds convincing to me.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.380
&gt;&gt;Marc: I know we could just do this in the
raw resources and then we're done but basically

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.961
you can't access the raw resources so
[unintelligible] with a web view which is

00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:20.160
plain awful, and if you do html pages, it's
a little bit harder.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.630
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Hmm.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:29.620
&gt;&gt;Marc: So in the assets folder you can just
load a web view called "file//assets" and

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.850
so on and then you can just load the html
file

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.590
and it loads the images automatically and
you're done and the other way around you would

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.650
have to--yeah, basically plain harder to do
with

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.420
the raw resources instead of using assets
for this case.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.430
&gt;&gt;Al: If you want a quick and dirty hack,
you can use a class in a library file that

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.490
actually just contains a string which is the
HTML you want to render in the web view.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.560
&gt;&gt;Marc: I know. I know. It’s basically what
I want to do now but it's basically a hack

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.030
to get to the assets in the correct--

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.680
&gt;&gt;Sparky: It's not really friendly to your
work flow is it?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.680
&gt;&gt;Al: I'll put a link to the ADT group in
the comments for this Hangouts post and then

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.639
you can join and see if there's anything that
those guys can do for you in order to get

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.750
thing sped up and get you a solution.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.980
&gt;&gt;Marc: Okay. Great.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.120
&gt;&gt;Nick: Whenever you work around this, depending
on your build system, do you script it? It

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.790
might move the assets into the right
place for you of whatever you build.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.360
&gt;&gt;Marc: So what now, we have the [unintelligible]
and we just have our projects and then every

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.020
project we copy over the first
asset folder from one library project then

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.750
the second assets folder, third one, basically
what the SDK tools should be doing.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.930
&gt;&gt;Nick: You say you manually copy them or
you have a place in your ant build.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.440
&gt;&gt;Marc: We manually copy them in our ant build
xml but of course now the problem is Eclipse

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.000
AD--the APK file built from
the [unintelligible] and the Eclipse APK differ

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.590
and it's not so easy to get the APK file to
the Eclipse file with

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:19.820
the right stuff. So right now we do it manually,
yeah. So basically that's what we're doing,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:28.220
yeah, but it could be much easier with
some SDK tools update. I also had viewed some--there

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.930
was some patches online in Garrett before
the transition to the new Garrett

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.520
server and there were some patches on line
doing exactly this and updating the SDK tools,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.169
but nobody 'res' them yet so they're not
in there yet.

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.889
&gt;&gt;Al: Are they in the new Garrett or they
still just in the old Garrett?

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:49.930
&gt;&gt;Marc: I think it was in the old Garrett.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.900
&gt;&gt;Al: You might want to see who submitted
them and ask them to resubmit them to the

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.729
new Garrett because I think the old Garrett
has

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:57.940
been pretty much abandoned now.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:10.020
&gt;&gt;Marc: I know. Okay, basically I will do
the hacking for now, but could be easier also

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.020
for other developers.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:17.919
&gt;&gt;Nick: Okay, do you have any more live questions
in the Hangout or should we move onto the

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:18.919
moderator?

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:21.650
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I think we've got some more questions
in the moderator from people who are in the

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.750
Hangout. Paul is this yours about the

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.470
loaders do you want to ask that question?

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.470
[pause]

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.470
Maybe I will--

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.720
&gt;&gt;Rich: "Yes, but I have no microphone."

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:39.560
&gt;&gt;Sparky: No microphone okay. So so. Paul
Blundell in Liverpool wants to know: "Loaders

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.430
seem to the new 'in' thing to use when
developing an app, can we explain the use

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.960
cases and some of the benefits of using a
loader over the alternative?"

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.520
Mmm...anybody want to take that one? Should
I take it?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:02.630
Basically the cool thing about loaders is
it's the simplest way to keep the contents

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:08.860
of your view in sync with its data source.
So, back before loaders, you had to actually

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:15.240
watch for callbacks and events regarding whether
or not your data had been changed

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.029
and updated and now the loaders will take
care of that for you. So you make a list view

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:28.270
or a list fragment and you implement the loader
interface and and say you have a content provider

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.361
that’s feeding data into that loader, you
stuff something new into the content

00:09:31.361 --> 00:09:35.170
provider and your list view just magically
updates and you never have to worry about

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.810
callbacks or synchronization or anything like
that.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:47.140
Anyone want to add anything to that?

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:54.350
&gt;&gt;Nick: With lifecycle events as well...I
think it really implements well with the life

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.940
cycles, it handles all your pauses and
resumes for you and it reconnects to the data

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:03.450
source and handles any changes so essentially
you write this code and it does all

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.380
that life cycle stuff for you so it's less
to maintain and debug.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.520
&gt;&gt;Rich: I also think they are very good for
making sure your data was loaded off the main

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.040
thread as well. So, it all happens in the
background out of the main thread and keeps

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.800
your application UI running nice and smoothly
whilst the loading's happening as

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800
opposed to --

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.800
&gt;&gt;Nick: Of course, most of what we're talk
about is specific to the cursor loader concrete

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.110
class, but it's also the loader
framework is more generic so you could extend

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.750
async loader to do other stuff as well which
isn't just [unintelligible] and you

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:40.960
still benefit from all the framework integration
as well. That has its benefits.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.690
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay. Hey Johan.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.110
&gt;&gt;Nick: "Nice one," he says.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:53.890
&gt;&gt;Sparky: "I'm convinced. I will use loaders
from now on. Thanks guys."

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.070
&gt;&gt;Rich: What's up next?

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:02.500
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Anyone want to jump in? Anyone want
to jump in with a question? Someone who just

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.990
came on? Johan do you have a question
for us?

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.850
&gt;&gt;Rich: You have no microphone--

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.500
&gt;&gt;Nick: We can't hear you--you need to--do
you have--

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.280
&gt;&gt;Rich: He's very good at mime.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.350
&gt;&gt;Nick: Are you miming?

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.220
&gt;&gt;Johan: Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I thought
I had it on, I'm on now. Okay. Hey guys, just

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.600
want to say 'Hi.' I don't have any
particular thing I'm wrestling with, but maybe

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:31.340
I was thinking about one thing for in case
I have something like a bubble dialog

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:43.750
with small selection, of course you know that
there are some context menus or smaller--how

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:49.700
do you say it--what's the term?--maybe
small dialogs which hang to a component and

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.779
it shows little section of choices--

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:52.779
&gt;&gt;Matt: Bar---

00:11:52.779 --> 00:12:00.430
&gt;&gt;Johan: But of course you have the popup
big views--what's kind of the way to go? I'm

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.860
tempted to just sort of go with the default
selection list mechanism--

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:10.980
&gt;&gt;Nick: Can you give me a little context about
what you're trying to do?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.980
&gt;&gt;Johan: Come again mate?

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.459
&gt;&gt;Nick: Can you give me a little context about
what you're trying to show?

00:12:15.459 --> 00:12:23.420
&gt;&gt;Johan: Well, it's basically I have a couple
of buttons on screen and if I press a button

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:29.450
there’s still a sub-selection to be done
before you go to the next activity, so I'm

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:35.830
kind of figuring out what's the best way to
go there. If I simply have a small pop up

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:41.899
menu which kind of hangs to that button --eh
the context, maybe the quick context is maybe

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:48.240
a bit of what I was looking at. So
what's the current design guideline on those

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.240
kind of contextual pop ups?

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.720
&gt;&gt;Nick: I would avoid a pop up if possible--

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720
&gt;&gt;Johan: Okay.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.950
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, you can do a design where you
hit a button and it reveals another choice

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:05.110
below it, now that could work fine. But
yeah, the pop up menu which you're talking

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.330
about is kind of similar to the overflow menu,
you know where you hit a button and it

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.570
expands down, that's also an option, but another
option could to just sort of move on to the

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.300
next action and sort of default
it to one of the choices and allow the users

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.300
to change to the other choice.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.300
&gt;&gt;Johan: Yep.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.140
&gt;&gt;Nick: So I think just trying to avoid this
modal dialogs is generally a good design rule.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.529
&gt;&gt;Johan: Okay, sounds fair. I think I'll go
with that to simply choose one of the options

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:33.589
and go for a selection for the other
options. Thanks so much.

00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:35.050
&gt;&gt;Nick: Cool. You're welcome

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.420
&gt;&gt;Rich: And great work with V-hack Netherlands.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.180
&gt;&gt;Johan: Yeah, it was good fun, good fun.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.480
&gt;&gt;Nick: Maybe you can tell us a little bit
about it for those who aren't familiar?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:51.320
&gt;&gt;Johan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you have some
time, I'll keep it short. A couple of user

00:13:51.320 --> 00:14:00.300
groups have found out that Android is five
years old. It was introduced on fifth of November

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:07.560
in 2007 and a couple of user groups in Europe
in the world have pick it up and were

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.970
trying to celebrate it with hack-a-thons around
Europe. They tried one in Amsterdam and one

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:21.990
in Bremen, but there's still a couple of
hack-a-thon in Belgium, Berlin and Paris is

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:30.500
also joining and Ankara and a couple of others
and so we had the first in Amsterdam. We

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:39.990
had a couple of teams simply hacking away
in a couple categories defined by the international

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:46.860
group and other cities are joining in
as well and there's one big finale in London

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:53.370
right after Droidcon. We will have, uh, older,
older

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:59.649
winners from the local 'hack-a-thons' competing
with the teams from the UK so if you are living

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.760
in the UK you have a kind of
advantage

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.450
[laughter]
because you can simply join the final immediately.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.490
[laughter]
No, it's going to be good fun with great prizes

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:15.341
so we got to give away some devices from Alcatel
so it's pretty good. Everybody

00:15:15.341 --> 00:15:18.513
walked away with a tablet or a phone so everybody
had a good time.

00:15:18.513 --> 00:15:22.010
&gt;&gt;Nick: Where's the best place to find out
more if people wanted to enter in?

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.620
&gt;&gt;Johan: I think it's simply vhackandroid.org.
I'll put it in the chat.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.620
&gt;&gt;Nick: Excellent.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.620
&gt;&gt;Rich: Thanks so much Johan.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.920
&gt;&gt;Nick: Thanks so much for the summary. Sounds
like awesome hacker fun for everybody.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.950
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah. All of us will be there.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.470
&gt;&gt;Johan: Yeah, great fun.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.470
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.149
&gt;&gt;Marc: I will have to go back to work soon,
so have fun and Sparky, have fun on Oktoberfest

00:15:44.149 --> 00:15:45.750
on the first.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.950
[laughter]

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.339
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Dankeschön.

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:56.389
&gt;&gt;Marc: So have a good beer--maybe we'll see
each other there. So bye.

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:57.880
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Auf wiedersehen.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.370
So, anybody else?

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:06.329
I see we have Andrew Kelly on the line. I
think you've got a question or two in the

00:16:06.329 --> 00:16:08.610
moderator, did you want to ask those yourself?

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:16.240
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yeah, I don't mind. Let me just
bring up the page. I guess this first one

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:23.510
was to do with taking pictures with the camera.
I was having some trouble getting the photos

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:31.303
to be stored in a private area of my app rather
than on the SD card and I was just

00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:34.080
wondering if there was any special trick that
I needed to do to get that to happen?

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.760
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Are you talking about that you want
to put them on an internal storage?

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.279
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yes.

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:45.839
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Ooo, ur. I honestly never tried
to do that.

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:50.240
&gt;&gt;Al: I think there's a problem with trying
to do that because the camera is a separate

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.150
application so any area that it would be
able to--that it would write to would have

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.100
to be a publicly writable area.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:02.470
&gt;&gt;Andrew: There is but you can actually pass
where you launch the intent, the permission

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:08.380
to say--you can inherit the permissions
of the parent app so I was thinking that might

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.100
give the camera app permission to write to
my private storage.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.920
&gt;&gt;Sparky: But you would still have to make
the final roll writable---

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.860
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think the grant permission just
grants permission to read--I don't think it

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.579
can grant permission to write, can it there?

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:25.650
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yeah, there's two. There's a grant
to write and a grant to read URI.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.189
&gt;&gt;Rich: Have you checked on Stack Overflow

00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:29.390
&gt;&gt;Andrew: But they don't seem to work. There's
no URI.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.210
&gt;&gt;Rich: And there was not help on Stack Overflow
on that one?

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.400
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Eh, no. Not really.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.710
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, could ask the question---

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.710
[soft chuckling]

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.650
&gt;&gt;Andrew: That's why I came to you guys.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.720
[warbling voices, indistinct chatter]

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:49.059
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I think every example that I've
seen just writes to the SD card because that's

00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:52.890
the standard media repository.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:59.430
&gt;&gt;Andrew: I don't want people to tweet with
the pictures that they've taken once they've

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.830
taken them from this free game that I'm
writing.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:08.130
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Now, you can, if you only want a
small picture--you could get a thumbnail back

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:14.700
and just not store it. In fact my little
demo app does that.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.690
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Nah, I'm after the big picture I'm
afraid.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.460
&gt;&gt;Nick: What about taking the photo and then
copying it or moving it into your--

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.650
&gt;&gt;Andrew: That was my sort of last resort
if there was no other way.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:34.990
&gt;&gt;Nick: Not sure if this is a solution, but
if there is a--I haven't used this for grant

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.400
write permission before--if that's not
working for you maybe you can send us link

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.910
to [unintelligible] with your question and
we can take a look into it further.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.130
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Okay, cool.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:49.050
&gt;&gt;Nick: Anyone else use the grant write permission?

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.050
No?

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:54.430
&gt;&gt;Nick: Not in this case?

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.430
[laughter]

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.210
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Trust me to find it.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.210
[laughter]

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.730
&gt;&gt;Matt: Do you have any more questions? I
think Sparky said there might be one or two?

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:10.291
&gt;&gt;Andrew: A couple--there was one about setting
the wallpaper. I was hoping to not have to

00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:17.640
request a permission to set a wallpaper
and to actually just sort of launch the wallpaper

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:25.680
intent somehow and to be able to pass an image
to that they can then say "yes" or

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.030
"no." Is that something that's possible?

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.870
&gt;&gt;Rich: Not that I know of, no.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:32.870
&gt;&gt;Matt: I don't know of any either.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.990
&gt;&gt;Rich: You can either send them to the wallpaper
chooser or you can use the intent but you

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.290
can't combine the two--to my knowledge.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.860
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yes, so I can register to be one
of the icons inside the wallpaper chooser

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.340
but I still kind of need the set wallpaper
permission to do the setting.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:54.140
&gt;&gt;Rich: That's correct as far as I know. I've
never seen anyone---it does seem like a work

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.540
around security to me.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.890
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yeah, well I was trying to think
if there might be a way that the wallpaper

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:05.120
chooser, when it launches, I can set the
image in a sort of "on results" and then the

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.090
wallpaper chooser can then sort of do something
with the permission--like show it to

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.090
the user or whatever.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:13.040
&gt;&gt;Rich: If your app is trying to set wallpapers,
why don't you just go ahead and use the permission?

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:19.230
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Well I've been watching my Google
IO "Reduce your number of permissions" video.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:24.250
&gt;&gt;Rich: But we'd rather you were explicit
about the actions you were going to do as

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.270
opposed to working around them and to try
and hide

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.270
the permissions.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:34.700
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Well, I'm not trying to hide--I'm
trying to be the receiver of the intent's

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:40.370
pay. I'm just--one of the things, just like
the sort of live wallpaper gallery. My app

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.660
can also show you a list of images that come
from Flickr or somewhere like that. You

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:51.919
choose the image from my stream and then it's
up to you to say set wall paper, as a user,

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:53.460
to make it turn into the background.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.760
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah. Okay.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.280
&gt;&gt;Andrew: So rather than kind of circumvent,
I was just trying to alleviate the need for

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.980
me to actually set permission.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.550
&gt;&gt;Rich: But you've tried and it doesn't work
I take it without the permission?

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.250
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yes. Yeah.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.260
&gt;&gt;Nick: It definitely in the source of wallpaper
lists, there's a [unintelligible] that pops

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.770
up and says "wallpaper gallery "
[intelligible] on that list, I've seen apps

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.950
do that.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: yeah, I think that's what he's saying.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:26.540
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yeah, so I'm in the list but I still
need to set wallpaper permission to set the

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.540
wallpaper.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.590
&gt;&gt;Matt: The impression I got from the IO talk
was [unintelligible] refuse permissions that

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.720
you need in terms of ones that you
actually require versus ones that you're just

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.130
doing as a 'nice to have 'em'. I mean, my
[AdMob] is a prime example of that. If you

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:47.550
need a lot of advertising it would make a
lot of sense but it's up to you as a developer

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:53.010
to allow that or not. And yeah, I think
games are the worst for that. There are some

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:58.300
games out there which have a horrific amount
of permissions that really aren't needed.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.690
So I
think at the end of the day you've got a perfect

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.419
kind of use case for it, so I don't think
any user would sit there and see

00:22:04.419 --> 00:22:06.990
that permission and get up and run away scared
so that's the main thing.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.990
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Cool. Okay.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.820
&gt;&gt;Rich: So regardless of whether you've arranged
it to be in that list, you still would have

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.309
the ability to set wallpapers, right?

00:22:14.309 --> 00:22:18.870
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yes. I've got a button inside my
app that when you're viewing a photo, you

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.330
can click that button and it says, you know,
'set wallpaper’ and it just sets it in the

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:27.730
background so when you actually exit the app,
the wallpaper is there.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:34.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah. Fair enough. But no, we don't
know a way of not doing that.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:35.970
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Cool.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:36.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:42.750
&gt;&gt;Matt: Anyone want to ask the next question?

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:43.990
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah--

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:48.200
&gt;&gt;Nick: Hey [Rand] I didn't see you sneak
into the Hangout.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.900
&gt;&gt;Rand: Hi. How are you doing Rich and Nick?

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:58.100
&gt;&gt;Rich: Pretty good. Nick has got us together--he's
got his Android with him as well.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.760
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, we're good.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.160
&gt;&gt;Rand: Actually, I got a couple of questions
if you guys got time.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.280
&gt;&gt;Nick: Please.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.010
&gt;&gt;Rand: Okay. One should be pretty easy, I
am trying to do audio manager set microphone

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.010
muted?

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.010
&gt;&gt;Nick: Uh huh.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:18.809
&gt;&gt;Rand: Microphone. The problem is that API
works on some devices and doesn’t work on

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:23.500
other devices, and other than try and pick
on

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:30.810
all devices I don't know how can I tell in
advance what device will it work on what and

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:31.810
what API should I use?

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:38.360
&gt;&gt;Al: Is that microphone muted?

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:47.090
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male: Are the devices under the
same company or is it dif--you know same company

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.559
for one device the works and others
that don't?

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:57.580
&gt;&gt;Rand: I can tell you on that on a Galaxy
S2, it doesn't work; on a Galaxy Nexus, it

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:03.080
doesn't work; on a Galaxy S3, it does work;
on

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:09.309
some HTC that we've tested, it works. I can
do a whole list. I don't have the list right

00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:18.299
here in front of me, but on some devices
it worked, some it didn't. The Galaxy S2 the

00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:28.549
US model it works just fine, the European
model it doesn't work. Things like that. I

00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:31.860
can see the link. Let me see what they're
saying at Stack Overflow.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.740
&gt;&gt;Al: There's a--one of the answers there
which is an interesting one--is simulating

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.460
a mute button on a handset being pressed.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:49.290
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, I see that. It's just that works
for all of them, it's unfortunate--

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's interesting it doesn't work on
the Galaxy Nexus, which was my big surprise.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.740
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I wouldn't--I would probably draw
a distinction between muting the input for

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.919
an application versus muting input for a
phone call as well. I think any time that

00:25:05.919 --> 00:25:09.809
you begin talking about a telephony stream
it just gets that much more complicated.

00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:16.940
&gt;&gt;Rand: I'm not talking about a telephony
stream. Um, just trying the mute the microphone.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:25.480
I'm doing how to record, well I'm doing
SIP Voice over IP phone call, but that's my

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:31.020
application and it works on the media stream
not the telephony stream.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.730
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah. Hmm. Hmm.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:38.070
&gt;&gt;Al: Wouldn't Android think it's the same
thing though?

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.820
&gt;&gt;Rand: What?

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:47.900
&gt;&gt;Al: Wouldn't Android think it's the same
thing whether it's a VOIP call or a standard

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.130
call? It's the same API's really.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:57.140
&gt;&gt;Rand: It's the same API when we're talking
about the Audio manager but first you set

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:04.520
the audio manager and then audio stream to
work on whatever it is you want it to work

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
on.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:12.169
&gt;&gt;Al: When this app does the volume, can you
use, you know, just the regular volume for

00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:18.600
that? There are some phones however that
that doesn't work with. I remember that issue

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.049
coming up when I was reading about it. I don't
think it's really going to matter whether

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:28.450
it's a VOIP
call or whether it's a a standard call. It's

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:33.820
the same --basically the same things, so--

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:43.610
&gt;&gt;Rand: Oh, as far as for the Android OS,
it doesn't know that I am doing a VOIP call.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:48.980
My application is doing all that stuff,
I'm not using the Android OS SIP interface

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:55.630
or anything like that. I just--I need--I opened
the microphone to try for the audio

00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:03.370
packets, I do all the G729 compression, all
that stuff. So far as for Android, it doesn't

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.289
know what I am doing with the audio
unit--I'm recording.

00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:13.300
&gt;&gt;Rich: The API doc says you shouldn't be
using this method. So the hack into the Stack

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.240
Overflow questions to get the manager to--the
platform audio manager to mute itself--by

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.810
pretending to be headset actually is reasonable,
uh, the API doc says, "This method should

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.460
only
be used by applications that are replacing

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.740
platform wide management of audio settings."

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.080
&gt;&gt;Rand: Oh, okay.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.120
&gt;&gt;Rich: So if you're replacing the entire
audio layer platform, then maybe you can use

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.490
it, because you're the only person trying
to

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:43.890
control it I guess. But otherwise, getting
the --I don't know if there's another method

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.820
to ask the platform to mute the microphone
but faking the handset mute, which asks the

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.020
platform to mute it, doesn't seem like a bad
solution.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:55.960
It would be interesting to have a look into
the source code for it and see what it actually

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960
does.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.410
&gt;&gt;Nick: And if you're in control of what you
with audio stream and auto compression and

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.830
sending it down your SIP channel, can you
just not send it?

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:12.620
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah, that's a work around. I just
want to avoid that question, because all the

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:20.960
CODEC is done in NDK, is done in with it
down there. I want the application to catch

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.740
whether I'm muted or not muted; to display
the right user interface to the user; stuff

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.700
like that. If I don't have any choice, then
yeah, I will do it down there in the CODEC

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.960
itself --I will just ignore that information,
I will not

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:43.110
compress it and I will not send it. But I'd
rather to have it done --to do just an application

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:51.070
layer and first save logic from the
CODEC which is complex enough as it is and

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:55.809
again to be synchronized with what the user
sees. If he sees his microphone muted or not

00:28:55.809 --> 00:29:00.419
muted and so on.

00:29:00.419 --> 00:29:07.900
Okay. I guess there is no easy path here.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:14.650
&gt;&gt;Nick: Rich is [looking into] the source
code.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:19.299
&gt;&gt;Rand: Okay. Can I get another one or is
there somebody else?

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:23.490
&gt;&gt;Al: I've had quick look in the source code
and basically the mute microphone calls down

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.549
to native codes that can vary by
platform.

00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:36.570
&gt;&gt;Rand: Mmm. Okay. So I have to implement
entire audio management system for the entire

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.570
system?

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:43.290
&gt;&gt;Rich: You mute your own stream so you don't
send it through when it's muted.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.890
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah. I'll look in on it.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.490
&gt;&gt;Rich: Thanks.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:55.240
&gt;&gt;Nick: And as always, my kind of first reaction
here is platform specific like it worked with

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240
one--

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:02.549
&gt;&gt;Rand: All right. I think London just fell.

00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:09.530
&gt;&gt;Al: Yep. They seem pretty frozen.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.620
&gt;&gt;Rand: No, I'm still alive.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.409
&gt;&gt;Al: London drops off every now and again.

00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:18.900
&gt;&gt;Rand: The Bridge is not that strong sometimes.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.080
&gt;&gt;Al: Have we got Sparky?

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.230
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Are you saying that London Bridge
is falling down?

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:28.130
&gt;&gt;Al: Arrr, we are me heartie!

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.420
[Laughter]

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:34.200
&gt;&gt;Rand: It's hard but they build it really
fast quite surprisingly.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:41.080
&gt;&gt;Al: I'm not singing the next part of that
song because calling you my fair lady could

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.230
be taken very much the wrong way. ARRR!

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:50.279
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Should we move on to another question?
Does anyone else have want to ask some?

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:55.000
&gt;&gt;Rand: I've got one--we are thinking about
develop--

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.919
[pause, video and audio cut out]

00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:09.690
a device and we are thinking on doing a native
versus web if you see what I mean. Web view

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.490
I mean. The
web view versus Java.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.260
&gt;&gt;Rich: HTML 5?

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.429
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah.

00:31:15.429 --> 00:31:21.470
&gt;&gt;Al: Read Marc Thibault's comments--I think
that's all that needs to be said.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:22.940
[laughter]

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:29.340
&gt;&gt;Rand: Actually one of the Facebook guys
just posted in W3org all the problems that

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.530
they had with HTML 5. I can look up for it
if

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.750
you want.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:40.280
&gt;&gt;Al: One of the biggest ones seems to be
that people write HTML 5 for mobile assuming

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.010
that it's going to be the same as [est Top]
and

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:46.600
have the same processing power and it always
falls short.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.130
&gt;&gt;Rand: Um--

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:53.560
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: It's not a lot of
processing, it's more like acquiring your

00:31:53.560 --> 00:32:01.000
information from a server and basically
showing it to the user. It's not a big app,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.279
it's a smaller . It's not something that needs
to use a lot of resources but you know they

00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:11.429
want
to make it fast and work on both the desktop

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:14.230
and the mobile.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.179
&gt;&gt;Nick: If you want to go fast, use Java.

00:32:17.179 --> 00:32:19.220
&gt;&gt;Al: That's a bit weak in mobile--

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.950
&gt;&gt;Sparky: If you mean run fast, but I think
he means write it fast.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:32.570
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah, to write it. In development
fast, but to work fast--to work fast I know

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.480
I need native.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:41.880
&gt;&gt;Sparky: You know, I would say for a quick
and dirty first draft to see if it actually

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:50.490
works--yeah--go ahead and use a web view.
Uh, but I wouldn't pour a whole ton of resources

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:56.290
trying to make a super good UI in a web view.
You know it's like, if you just want basic

00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:02.659
form, get a little data--you'll display it
but don't--don't expect too much from it I

00:33:02.659 --> 00:33:03.659
would say.

00:33:03.659 --> 00:33:11.220
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: Okay, what is this,
like when did web view start in Android versions?

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.070
Which API did it start from?

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.070
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Ooh--

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:17.270
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: [Must have come from
the same cupboard]

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.420
&gt;&gt;Al: It was in one point oh, so I think--

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:23.380
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: So it doesn't really
matter? Yeah, that covers it. Just want to

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.679
make sure it's a Gingerbread and above.

00:33:26.679 --> 00:33:32.290
&gt;&gt;Al: Definitely a Gingerbread and above.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:37.860
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male speaker: They say Gingerbread
holds the--

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:46.910
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Actually my little RSS reader sample
that I threw together last spring, it runs

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.191
all the way back to one point six and I think
it

00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:52.809
actually works on a G1 and it uses a web view.

00:33:52.809 --> 00:34:00.090
&gt;&gt;Al: Web view is listed as being around since
API level one so it's a good safe bet, the

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:04.610
only thing I'd say, it's a bit of a
risky pass unless they are willing to throw

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.770
away the whole app if they want to expand
the functionality. That's the danger of

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:13.200
starting off doing it in HTML 5 and then you
end up with bits of organic growth and you

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.109
end up finding that you've written a whole
app in HTML 5 and you're hitting the performance

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:18.109
barriers.

00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:21.559
&gt;&gt;Nick: Or you turn around [unintelligible]
and say I need to spend a month to get back

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:26.429
to where you already are up to--

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.429
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:33.480
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, that's why I was sort of careful
to say don't expect too much from your HTML

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.919
5 version and don't pour too many
resources into trying to gold plate it.

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:42.950
&gt;&gt; Matt: I think one of the biggest risks
as well is it's very easy to sit there and

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:48.529
develop this sites on a desktop browser and
then kind of look at it in Chrome on the mobile

00:34:48.529 --> 00:34:52.909
device and see it's okay, carry on, and then
when you actually move it to web view

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:58.940
then suddenly thing start breaking. It's something
I've seen numerous people do on the T.V. site

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.740
and it's kind of heartbreaking to
see--they get so far but then it just has

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:10.220
to kind of stop and have to go over everything
to do it exactly the same.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:17.021
&gt;&gt;Sparky: That said, I suppose if you don't
try to go too fancy with the HTML 5, if you

00:35:17.021 --> 00:35:25.380
really stick to basic HTML and not a lot of
JavaScript, client side stuff, you know, there's

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.849
a certain limit on how much damage you can
do to yourself.

00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:29.849
[laughter]

00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:33.339
&gt;&gt;Al: And limit your use of CSS. There's a
lot of things you can do in CSS that tend

00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:35.260
to be pretty processor heavy these days.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:40.209
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Well you know, now
phones are also getting faster so I think

00:35:40.209 --> 00:35:42.579
you need to take that into consideration.
You

00:35:42.579 --> 00:35:48.000
know it's quite funny that some phones are
better than some desktops and laptops.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.509
&gt;&gt;Al: You ought to see these statistics for
the number of people who actually own phones

00:35:52.509 --> 00:35:54.989
like that. They're a very limited unless you're
saying

00:35:54.989 --> 00:35:59.559
Gingerbread phones are predominate at the
moment and they tend to be at least a generation

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:02.599
behind the current kind of Ice Cream Sandwich
and Jellybean phones are.

00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:03.650
[children playing in background]

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:07.910
&gt;&gt;Unknown Speaker: Well I guess when Ice cream
becomes the---

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:15.670
[pause, video cuts out]

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:23.589
&gt;&gt;Al: --a bit more power but the other thing
is there's always going to be a need for budget

00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:26.910
phones and people will buy budget phones
so you're always going to fighting against

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:27.910
that kind of trend.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:33.499
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I mean, you look at some of the
other companies in the electronics space and

00:36:33.499 --> 00:36:36.819
they figured out years ago that basically
at

00:36:36.819 --> 00:36:41.670
any given point and time, you've got certain
price buckets that people will buy from. Now

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:46.279
say with personal computers, you've got your
under five hundred bucks, your thousand buck,

00:36:46.279 --> 00:36:52.539
two thousand, three thousand-- and they will
build the best device that they can

00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:58.479
build to fit that price bucket so no matter
what, you're always going to have a phone

00:36:58.479 --> 00:37:02.509
maker who's trying to hit a fifty dollar
price point and a hundred dollar price point

00:37:02.509 --> 00:37:07.190
and so if you want the mass adoption of Ice
Cream Sandwich, you've got to have the

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:12.140
hardware capability to run Ice Cream Sandwich
shrunk down to the point where you can actually

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.839
put it into a hundred dollar form
factor.

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:19.269
&gt;&gt;Unknown male: There is such thing as one
hundred dollar phone? I don't really know

00:37:19.269 --> 00:37:23.260
any of those, but that's for a
different day--discussion.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:29.119
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Actually that was--this was in the
news maybe a year ago that there was a line

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:34.390
of Android phones, I think maybe
Gingerbread that was being sold in Kenya--

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.390
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yep.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.230
&gt;&gt;Sparky:--that was about a hundred bucks.

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.050
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male speaker: Really? Wow!

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.400
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Subsidized--a hundred bucks.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.589
&gt;&gt;Nick: They have them in the UK for one hundred
pounds, right so that was like--

00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:44.809
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah the Huaweis--

00:37:44.809 --> 00:37:46.709
&gt;&gt;Nick: The [unintelligible]

00:37:46.709 --> 00:37:51.789
&gt;&gt;Rich: Which range in Kenya for about a hundred
dollars--sixty pounds.

00:37:51.789 --> 00:37:57.170
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male speaker: I know here it is
quite a--for example the HTC Wildfire, the

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.410
old one, costs-what is it-I think it's around
two hundred

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:06.749
fifty dollars. So we are a bit far off on
that.

00:38:06.749 --> 00:38:14.119
&gt;&gt;Sparky: That's because all the prices look
bigger when you read them from right to left.

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:15.589
[laughter]

00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:17.779
&gt;&gt; Matt: They arrr.

00:38:17.779 --> 00:38:18.779
[laughter]

00:38:18.779 --> 00:38:22.099
&gt;&gt;Sparky: That really wasn't funny.

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:25.039
&gt;&gt;Al: For that one you should walk the plank.

00:38:25.039 --> 00:38:26.660
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Arrr.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.660
[laughter]

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:37.059
&gt;&gt;Nick: Are there any more questions in the
moderator or live? There's one in the G+ chat

00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:38.059
we wanted---

00:38:38.059 --> 00:38:39.059
[laughter]

00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:45.999
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Let's see what we've got in the
moderator--we've got--we did that one. Loaders--we

00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:46.999
did that one--

00:38:46.999 --> 00:38:52.130
"When might we expect a public release of
the Google Play Services--" Yes, moving on.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.130
Uh--

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.130
[laughter]

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.130
Wallpaper--

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.130
&gt;&gt;Al: The answer's always soon.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: Definitely soon.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:02.579
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Were you looking at the heterogeneous
[unintelligible] question?

00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:12.229
&gt;&gt;Nick: I was looking at--there was one in
the G force comments from Kristal O'Hare asking

00:39:12.229 --> 00:39:19.549
when and if you could use alternative
pay providers on Google Play.

00:39:19.549 --> 00:39:24.920
So--the answer is see the content policy.
Content policy says you must always use Google

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.869
Play payment provider, which is Wallet, except
for and it makes two exceptions. The first

00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:36.569
one is if you're paying for physical goods,
so concert tickets and like that.

00:39:36.569 --> 00:39:38.710
&gt;&gt;Rich: It's quite the opposite--you can't
use Google Wallet to sell those.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:43.479
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, then you have to use your own
pay provider and the second one--it says--I'm

00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:49.839
just going from memory here--if you're
buying additional content which available

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:54.269
beyond the application--I think an example
there is mp3, Amazon mp3 where you buy access

00:39:54.269 --> 00:39:59.670
to an mp3 track and then you can then access
that track on your iPad,

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:08.020
&gt;&gt;Rich: Same for Kindle as well, you might
read it on here, you might read it on your

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:14.489
Kindle, but it also then says you must not
use this to get around using Google Play payments.

00:40:14.489 --> 00:40:18.209
So you can't just suddenly decide to you want
to make your digital assets, or whatever

00:40:18.209 --> 00:40:24.890
inside your game, run a website so you don't
have to use our payment mechanism.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:31.839
&gt;&gt;Nick: Plus it comes down to our policy team's
interpretation of this fairly nebulous description

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:36.630
of additional content and
available beyond. I think the key thing is

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:39.680
if the primary use case is that you're buying
something and you're going to use it

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.609
in the application and always in the application
and there may be some other method to access

00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:47.579
in the browser, but you never expect
someone to use it, then that--I would consider

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:52.450
that trying to work around the policy and
that probably wouldn't be allowed.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.630
So those are two cases I know where you can
provide your own payment provider.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.880
&gt;&gt;Rich: Definitely it's always safest to use
Google Play payments.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.979
&gt;&gt;Andrew: How does carrier billing fit into
that? Does that just come up as another option

00:41:03.979 --> 00:41:06.029
in Google Wallet next to your credit
card?

00:41:06.029 --> 00:41:10.859
&gt;&gt;Rich: Forty percent of Google Play users
can access carrier billing, in many countries

00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:15.359
in the world, many operators and yeah it
just comes up as another option.

00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:16.670
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Cool.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:22.481
&gt;&gt;Nick: Same with gift cards in the US and
if you buy access and you get this kind of

00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:26.381
balance that you get with it so it just comes
up as other options with which you can use

00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:27.589
to pay for the goods.

00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:31.199
&gt;&gt;Rich: Which reminds me, if you're going
to buy a Nexus 7, do it very very soon. I

00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:34.279
think the original twenty-five dollar credit
promotion

00:41:34.279 --> 00:41:38.170
is expiring at the end of September. So you
need to receive your Nexus 7 --

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:47.109
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: Is this twenty-five
dollars only for US Nexus 7 or also Europe

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:48.109
ones?

00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:49.109
[several talking at once]

00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:54.009
&gt;&gt;Rich: UK, France, Germany--all the official
countries that were supported got it--Canada--

00:41:54.009 --> 00:41:57.579
&gt;&gt;Rand: You need to add US credit card to
get those twenty-five dollars.

00:41:57.579 --> 00:42:01.949
&gt;&gt;Rich: No, in the UK, it was a UK credit
card; in France it was a French--

00:42:01.949 --> 00:42:02.949
&gt;&gt;Rand: Maybe the UK [mumbles] yeah.

00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:07.470
&gt;&gt;Rich: In the large countries, you use your
local country credit card and get your stuff

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.609
that way.

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:12.039
&gt;&gt;Andrew: It worked fine here in Australia.

00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:13.180
&gt;&gt;Rand: [unintelligible]

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.799
&gt;&gt;Rich: I can't tell what he's saying.

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:17.859
&gt;&gt;Nick: You used it now twice right? With
the replacement Nexus 7?

00:42:17.859 --> 00:42:20.549
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah, I did it twice, yeah.

00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:21.549
[laughter]

00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:22.930
&gt;&gt;Rich: He did it twice huh---

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:24.390
&gt;&gt;Rand: Let me show you, just a second.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.390
[laughter]

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:26.390
&gt;&gt;Nick: He dropped his one week old Nexus
7--

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.349
&gt;&gt;Rich: Ahh. So he had to buy another one.

00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:36.239
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: Well I got the Nexus
7 which is a pretty nice ..I messed with--Oh--two

00:42:36.239 --> 00:42:37.239
Nexus 7--well--

00:42:37.239 --> 00:42:43.150
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah, well, this one is broken. Ah,
you can't see it really. There's part of the

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:47.110
glass--there's part of it's broken. But I
couldn't resist--I swapped the covers.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:48.150
&gt;&gt;Nick: Aw, you swapped the white back. Nice.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.900
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah, I had to stay with the white.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:56.019
&gt;&gt;Nick: So what are you going to do with broken
one, does it still work except for the screen?

00:42:56.019 --> 00:43:02.670
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah, it works, the screen works.
This is the broken one. It's just broken and

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:06.180
the touch doesn't work all around the
screen, so I guess I'll just make it, so you

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:11.710
know, maybe an ADK controller or a music streamer
or something.

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:13.190
I'll make use of it.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.609
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Well, they're starting
to [unintelligible] in Israel for Asus, so

00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:19.059
maybe they'll be able to fix it for you or
at least some..

00:43:19.059 --> 00:43:25.940
&gt;&gt;Rand: Actually there is an Asus importers
in Israel and they provide service for the

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:26.940
Nexus 7 right now.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.759
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Really? Wow.

00:43:28.759 --> 00:43:39.229
&gt;&gt;Rand: And uh the International Warranty
works so they accept it, but that's very nice.

00:43:39.229 --> 00:43:43.359
But then again I couldn't resist, I just got
a

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:44.709
new one.

00:43:44.709 --> 00:43:45.709
[laughter]

00:43:45.709 --> 00:43:49.820
&gt;&gt;Sparky: That's the nice thing about the
lower price point, it almost comes down to

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:55.240
the "oh what the heck, I'll just buy it"
level.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.719
&gt;&gt;Rand: Well it makes it less painful.

00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:01.759
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Well it's really cheap--eh--not--

00:44:01.759 --> 00:44:05.660
&gt;&gt;Rand: Not expensive is the word you were
looking for.

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.229
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Yeah. Where did you
buy it from?

00:44:08.229 --> 00:44:09.619
&gt;&gt;Rand: Directly from Google Play.

00:44:09.619 --> 00:44:12.400
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: But from UK or US
?

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400
&gt;&gt;Rand: US.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.979
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Hmm.

00:44:14.979 --> 00:44:19.160
&gt;&gt;Rand: I got an office there and cards and
all that stuff so--

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.819
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Well I use other methods,
but I'll not explain for today.

00:44:22.819 --> 00:44:26.569
&gt;&gt;Rand: All right. [laughter] Don't go there.

00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:31.819
Um, can I have another question about some
issue that I'm facing with?

00:44:31.819 --> 00:44:33.209
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yes, please.

00:44:33.209 --> 00:44:34.609
&gt;&gt;Rand: Thank you.

00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:45.749
I'm trying to do my own exception catcher.
To catch all on card exceptions--if my application

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:52.509
will crash--my applications never
crash but IF it will happen and it will crash,

00:44:52.509 --> 00:45:02.700
I'll be to catch it and maybe recover from
it without the user noticing and all that

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.670
stuff and if I can't recover, I want to grab
all the logs, I want to grab the system logs,

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:15.459
I want to grab my own DP or something
and send it over to my CRM server.

00:45:15.459 --> 00:45:22.289
The thing that I've seen is that when I have
my own handler which implements an on card

00:45:22.289 --> 00:45:31.349
exception handler. I'm using the old school
'set default' on caught exception. My handler

00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:38.459
is being called when there is an exception
and I can run my code, but for some reason

00:45:38.459 --> 00:45:45.249
I either need to re-throw the exception and
then Android always will kill my application

00:45:45.249 --> 00:45:52.130
or I need to do system exit myself, and
kill the application otherwise it looks like

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:58.480
for some reason the UI thread it just gets
stuck. It doesn't go back to the event loop

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.539
or something. I don't know.

00:46:00.539 --> 00:46:08.190
So is there a work around around it or in
such a case I have to shut down my process

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.540
and restart it?

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:18.469
&gt;&gt;Al: It's probably worth saying at this point,
Jellybean has tighter restrictions on what

00:46:18.469 --> 00:46:21.719
logging information you can access. Um,
so--

00:46:21.719 --> 00:46:23.130
&gt;&gt;Rand: My logs only.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.130
&gt;&gt;Al: Oh.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.900
&gt;&gt;Rand: I'm not looking for any other application
log or--looking for my log, my own internal

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.380
DB and stuff that I'm saving. Only my
information.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.980
&gt;&gt;Al: You mentioned the system logs you were
thinking of accessing so you're okay without

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:36.980
doing that.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:42.150
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah. Right now I'm simply reading
the log starting with Jellybean, and the log

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:48.809
will only show me my log lines and I'm fine
with it. I have no problem. That's great.

00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:50.309
&gt;&gt;Al: Cool.

00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:58.749
&gt;&gt;Rich: So, how are you going to know--I mean,
what kind of--

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:06.949
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Ugh. I think London
the bridge is falling again. Oh maybe not.

00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:07.949
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh--hello?

00:47:07.949 --> 00:47:10.749
&gt;&gt;Rand: We've got London twice here.

00:47:10.749 --> 00:47:16.150
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh my God. We should have gone back
to the studio, but we didn't. We've got a

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.019
black curtain, but we're not inside the
studio today.

00:47:18.019 --> 00:47:21.099
Yeah, you're trying to catch an exception
from somewhere in your application, how do

00:47:21.099 --> 00:47:25.009
you know you're going to be able to recover
from it without having to kill the app?

00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:31.980
&gt;&gt;Rand: I can--first, I can query the application
and understand which model had that exception,

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:37.109
maybe I can just restart that
model or maybe I cannot recover and I have

00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:41.759
to shut down my application and restart. But
in many cases, I can recover, for example

00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:47.359
if the user presses a button and for some
reason I can't process that event--instead

00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:53.789
of crashing the application I can just display
a simple toast message or open windows saying,

00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:56.969
"Sorry we cannot do this in that--

00:47:56.969 --> 00:47:58.989
[pause, video cuts out briefly]

00:47:58.989 --> 00:48:06.259
&gt;&gt;Rich: I think your app is going to be in
a slightly unstable state at that point and

00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:10.369
the recommendation we have to pass on:
either close down or pass it on to the default

00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:15.459
exception handler to finish off cleaning up.
It's just to be assumed that you're not

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:17.519
going to be able to recover from this position.
If you--

00:48:17.519 --> 00:48:22.229
&gt;&gt;Rand: So that's the basic assumption that
I won't be able to recover and--

00:48:22.229 --> 00:48:26.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: This is an uncaught exception. You
can deal with this exception, you should deal

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:31.109
with it in the place where it was
originally caught and carry on. But you've

00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:34.609
jumped from the main thread now, the main
thread's gone to the exception handler and

00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:37.249
the
exception handler is now working away at just

00:48:37.249 --> 00:48:41.039
logging this and killing the app so the system
can continue.

00:48:41.039 --> 00:48:47.660
&gt;&gt;Andrew: There is a tool called Jira Mobile
Connect which is written by the guys at Atlassian

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:53.309
here in Sydney which is a sort of
open sourcing that does exactly what this

00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:58.369
guy's talking about. It sort of catches exceptions
and then lets the user leave a message

00:48:58.369 --> 00:49:03.660
for the developer staff and then it goes back
and hooks into Jira and the tracking tool

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.400
and keeps logs for you [unintelligible].

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.839
&gt;&gt;Rich: And it will close down, right?

00:49:06.839 --> 00:49:07.839
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yeah.

00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:10.299
&gt;&gt;Rich: It's just a nice way of tracking the
exception when it does.

00:49:10.299 --> 00:49:11.559
&gt;&gt;Nick: Here's what I know of--

00:49:11.559 --> 00:49:12.559
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yeah.

00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:21.549
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah. I used to use [Acron]--just
trying to improve it and avoid having my application--

00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:25.430
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sorry. The thing to do is when you
log it make sure you get the details of it

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:30.719
and make sure you catch it in the right place
next time just do an update to patch and catch.

00:49:30.719 --> 00:49:35.220
'Cause as soon as the application is leaving
its running state to go into the

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.589
exception handling state, it's on its way
down.

00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:38.589
&gt;&gt;Rand: I understand.

00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:41.859
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think [unintelligible] the exception
handler, I mean that's the thing which tears

00:49:41.859 --> 00:49:46.950
down, right? And cleans up after you.
Hold on to reference to that call in--

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:50.559
&gt;&gt;Rich: You have to pass it on to the exception
handler after you're done to finish off. Or

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:54.269
close it up yourself. I think the
system wants you to--

00:49:54.269 --> 00:50:02.160
&gt;&gt;Al: Augh. They're gone again. The uncaught
exception handler at javadocs for Android

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:06.650
actually saves a notification when the
application has been terminated. I don't think

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:10.209
there's anyway you can recover, but what you
might want to think about is you could

00:50:10.209 --> 00:50:15.269
try using a broadcast intent loop so in your
uncaught exception handler you could fire

00:50:15.269 --> 00:50:19.829
off a broadcast intent and have a broadcast
intent receiver which restarts your app.

00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:26.839
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah, I'm trying to do that, but in
some cases even my intent is not being broadcasted

00:50:26.839 --> 00:50:28.769
unless I kill my own process.

00:50:28.769 --> 00:50:35.369
&gt;&gt;Rich: Have a service to restart your app
again. Umm I don't know why. If we drop out

00:50:35.369 --> 00:50:39.450
more frequently, we might actually get three
or four at one time. [laughs]

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:40.450
&gt;&gt;Matt: Nice.

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:45.049
&gt;&gt;Nick: I don't know what all of these drop
outs are for.

00:50:45.049 --> 00:50:49.269
&gt;&gt;Rich: Um,okay. Is Sparky still with us?

00:50:49.269 --> 00:50:51.700
&gt;&gt;Rand: No, they dropped out.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:55.400
&gt;&gt;Rich: One, two, three, four, five, six--

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.509
[video cuts out briefly]

00:50:57.509 --> 00:51:05.039
&gt;&gt;Al: There's a follow up question about the
payments in Google Market. The situation the

00:51:05.039 --> 00:51:10.119
guy's given is, if he has an existing web
based game and he's developing an Android

00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:15.589
client for it, and wants to allow people to
purchase digital goods for use in that web

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:20.660
based game but via the Android app, do you
see that as allowed or not. I don't know if

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.289
you guys can actually answer that one or
whether you should just refer straight to

00:51:23.289 --> 00:51:24.529
the Play store guys.

00:51:24.529 --> 00:51:31.099
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, that is one of the things we
refer to the Play store guys to get a definitive

00:51:31.099 --> 00:51:32.099
answer on.

00:51:32.099 --> 00:51:36.579
&gt;Nick: Yeah, it comes down to where it falls
under that definition of digital content doesn't

00:51:36.579 --> 00:51:40.160
it? Which I'm not in a place to rule
on.

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.160
[chuckles]

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.239
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, and if they think that the majority
of people are just--You're getting [unintelligible]

00:51:44.239 --> 00:51:49.200
from the Play store--installing the
app from the Play store getting--seeing it

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.579
at the play store, downloading it and only
using it on the device then they may

00:51:53.579 --> 00:51:59.749
consider that the web version is a work around.
And why wouldn't you just our in app payments

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:02.289
for purchase those items anyway?
Why would you want to work around it when

00:52:02.289 --> 00:52:04.549
you're getting the distribution and the extra
users?

00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:09.690
&gt;&gt;Al: His thing is that his primary game is
already web based; the Android app is an extension

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:10.690
to that so--

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:16.950
&gt;&gt;Rich: He can choose in that case not to
have any payment at all and then people can

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:21.709
buy their things on the web if they want but
he still shouldn't link back to the web version

00:52:21.709 --> 00:52:26.420
to buy those things. It would be the safe
option. If he does do it the other way

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:34.920
around and the Play team decides it is infringement-they
can just take you down. Or he can request

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.469
support. He can go through
other channels and ask for support, file a

00:52:38.469 --> 00:52:46.140
ticket and hopefully they'll make a decision
before he actually builds the app.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:52.999
Okay. Hello, welcome back Sparky--[unintelligible]
We've had more drop outs than--

00:52:52.999 --> 00:52:59.140
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, it's not too often that I
lose my connection here, it's usually more

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:00.789
often the case that I simply can't make it
in

00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:01.789
the first place.

00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:06.299
&gt;&gt;Rich: You just went off so you could take
your pirate hat off.

00:53:06.299 --> 00:53:10.029
&gt;&gt;Nick: There's five minutes left today. Are
there any more questions we want to go through

00:53:10.029 --> 00:53:14.799
today, live in the room or in the
moderator?

00:53:14.799 --> 00:53:18.261
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Did you answer any questions in
the moderator while I was out?

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:19.589
&gt;&gt;Nick: I don't think so.

00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:23.380
&gt;&gt;Rich: We didn't answer well, we just left
the community up to it.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.049
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Oh okay.

00:53:25.049 --> 00:53:30.739
&gt;&gt;Al: Here's a quick question. Nick, when
can I see the next installment of your redesigned

00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:32.390
broadcast on YouTube?

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:38.069
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well Al--[laughter]--thanks for asking.
For those who don't know, we've gotten up

00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:44.900
a new show called Android Design in
Action, where we take an existing application

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:51.170
which is reviewed in the App Clinic on a Friday
and give it a re-imagining applying

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:58.470
Android Design Principles to it. You can tune
in every Tuesday at three-thirty GMT and so

00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:59.470
yeah, it'll be back next week.

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:00.470
&gt;&gt;Rich: Thanks Nick.

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.809
&gt;&gt;Nick: Do you watch it Al?

00:54:01.809 --> 00:54:06.390
&gt;&gt;Al: I do watch it. I'm looking forward to
it. I particularly like the brown and orange

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:10.380
coloring to the stopwatch app this week.
I've always tried to stick close to the HOLO

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:14.339
colors of using blue so it's quite good to
see something that's drifted a bit farther

00:54:14.339 --> 00:54:15.339
apart.

00:54:15.339 --> 00:54:19.799
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, Roman did a great job on that.
It was beautiful. I think he [unintelligible]

00:54:19.799 --> 00:54:23.479
photo there and we had about a
hundred comments saying "Please, where can

00:54:23.479 --> 00:54:24.920
I get that app?"

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920
[laughter]

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.809
&gt;&gt;Nick: They like good designers.

00:54:27.809 --> 00:54:30.299
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male speaker: Well, I--

00:54:30.299 --> 00:54:33.549
&gt;&gt;Nick: We shouldn't let them have anything

00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:35.759
&gt;&gt;Rich: A redesign of the ultimate stopwatch--

00:54:35.759 --> 00:54:36.789
&gt;&gt;Nick: Oh I see.

00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:40.589
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, yeah, since you guys didn't
redesign it for me.

00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:41.589
[laughter]

00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:44.400
&gt;&gt;Al: Was that payback for not implementing
rich notifications, Rich?

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:50.400
&gt;&gt;Rich: It might be I don't know. I just took
out my name and ignored the rest of the app.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.599
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: I also wanted to tell
you, in Israel they're started doing a--I

00:54:55.599 --> 00:55:02.390
don't know in which language they are doing
it--but they're doing reviews on start ups

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:04.880
on Google+ every Wednesday at--

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.579
&gt;&gt;Rand: Ido. Ido Green is doing it.

00:55:07.579 --> 00:55:10.670
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: Yeah. Does he do it
in English or Hebrew?

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:15.900
&gt;&gt;Rand: Most of it is in English like--it's
going to be eighty percent English, twenty

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:20.990
percent Hebrew. He took the first shot two
weeks ago I think.

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.990
&gt;&gt;Rich: Cool.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:28.289
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: So if anybody wants
to watch it is on Wednesday at two P.M. Israel

00:55:28.289 --> 00:55:32.650
time so that's basically twelve GMT or
something like that.

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:33.749
&gt;&gt;Rand: Two-thirty.

00:55:33.749 --> 00:55:34.859
&gt;&gt;Nick: Cool.

00:55:34.859 --> 00:55:43.109
We're almost going to a, you know, full schedule
of programming of developers-- if you go to

00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:48.989
Google+ live there's tons and tons of
programming popping up every day.

00:55:48.989 --> 00:55:50.609
&gt;&gt;Rand: Right.

00:55:50.609 --> 00:55:53.869
&gt;&gt;Matt: Any other questions?

00:55:53.869 --> 00:55:59.380
&gt;&gt;Unknown speaker: Are you coming to Israel
again? I thought Rich said something didn't

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.819
you about coming again in October?

00:56:01.819 --> 00:56:06.020
&gt;&gt;Rich: That was for another event and I was
going to be in Israel at the same time, but

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:09.809
unfortunately the other event has been
canceled so I won't be going to Israel in

00:56:09.809 --> 00:56:14.319
October. But I have to get back before the
end of the year. Travel around Europe a bit

00:56:14.319 --> 00:56:16.119
more as well.

00:56:16.119 --> 00:56:22.239
The next things we will be at are Droidcon
London and Droidcon Amsterdam I think we'll

00:56:22.239 --> 00:56:28.589
be attending but maybe it's be better
if--it's dead set--we're seeing what we can

00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:36.650
do. Amongst our project work and other things.
It's always good to come out and--

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:39.170
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: All right.

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:42.510
&gt;&gt;Rand: We're planning Andcon on October twenty-third.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:43.750
&gt;&gt;Rich: Andcon?

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:44.990
&gt;&gt;Matt: Andcon?

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:50.859
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah, we can't use Droidcon here so
we use Andcon. We had one in June and we're

00:56:50.859 --> 00:56:54.460
going to have another one in October
twenty-third probably.

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.079
&gt;&gt;Rich: Excellent.

00:56:56.079 --> 00:57:01.209
&gt;&gt;Al: Droidcon London's the twenty-fifth through
the twenty-seventh of October so it will be

00:57:01.209 --> 00:57:02.489
a busy week.

00:57:02.489 --> 00:57:03.829
&gt;&gt;Rand: Yeah.

00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:10.289
&gt;&gt;Al: It might also be worth mentioning that
on developers.google.com/live if you put /android

00:57:10.289 --> 00:57:12.559
after that you can get just the
Android events.

00:57:12.559 --> 00:57:15.289
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah. That'd be good.

00:57:15.289 --> 00:57:16.390
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:19.509
&gt;&gt;Andrew: So what was that link again?

00:57:19.509 --> 00:57:23.499
&gt;&gt;Rich: Can you put it in the chat?

00:57:23.499 --> 00:57:28.209
&gt;&gt;Nick: Developers.google.com/live and if
you want just Android you add /android.

00:57:28.209 --> 00:57:31.670
&gt;&gt;Al: I'll put it in the chat.

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:33.640
&gt;&gt;Matt: Are we done?

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:39.819
&gt;&gt;Nick: So unless there's any burning issues
in the room, brings us to the end of our time

00:57:39.819 --> 00:57:41.920
today. Nothing going once--

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:48.230
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There's a couple of questions left
in the moderator but either I don't know the

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:53.009
answer or I already answered them and if
if the person who asked a question once wants

00:57:53.009 --> 00:57:58.460
to talk about it on the air then just let
us know offline and we can copy the

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.519
questions over to next week or something like
that.

00:58:00.519 --> 00:58:06.249
&gt;&gt;Nick: Sorry about that problem with us dropping
in and out today. We'll try and find out what's

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:07.249
going on--

00:58:07.249 --> 00:58:08.249
&gt;&gt;Rich: We'll try and go back to the studio
again next week.

00:58:08.249 --> 00:58:12.160
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah. If the quality was worse this
week, we were in the studio last week it was

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.160
a bit better then.

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:18.519
&gt;&gt;Unknown Male Speaker: When you were in the
studio, you dropped a bit less than what happened

00:58:18.519 --> 00:58:19.599
today.

00:58:19.599 --> 00:58:26.869
&gt;&gt;Al: Video quality seems a little lower and
blurs particularly when you move for me , so--

00:58:26.869 --> 00:58:27.869
[laughter]

00:58:27.869 --> 00:58:29.209
Thanks guys!

00:58:29.209 --> 00:58:32.420
&gt;&gt;Nick: We're a bit unpredictable.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:36.549
&gt;&gt;Al: Yes, you scurvy dogs!

00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:37.549
[laughter]

00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:39.410
&gt;&gt;Rich: Why are pirates called pirates?

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:40.410
&gt;&gt;Nick: They just Arrr.

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:41.410
&gt;&gt;Rich: 'Cause they just Arr.

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.410
[laughter]

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:46.730
&gt;&gt;Al: And on that I think you've sunk the
ship.

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:51.400
&gt;&gt;Nick: So thanks for tuning us in and keep
the questions coming into the moderator for

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:54.920
next week and we will see you same time
next week.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:55.920
&gt;&gt;Al: Thanks guys.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.920
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Cheers.

00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.199
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: Cheers.
