00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:12.460
From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.230
Hi, I'm Anya Creighney,
and this is the Letters

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.380
About Literature Video Series.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.330
Today we'll be exploring
some techniques

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.960
to make your letters both
successful and appealing

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.820
for the Letters About
Literature program.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.340
The Letters About Literature
program is a writing competition

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.840
for students in grades four

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.490
through twelve wherein
participants polish their

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.750
reflective skills
by writing a letter

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.610
to an author -living or dead-.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.530
Students' letters explain how
an author's work changed his

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.220
or her view of themselves
and/or the world.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.270
Now, let's start with
the workshop, shall we?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.780
One of the most common
oversights students make while

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.490
writing for Letters
About Literature,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.610
is complimenting the author
instead of corresponding.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.960
Let's look at an example:
I am writing this letter

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.990
to you as a pleased reader.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.630
As I dove into your
book, Sea Jade,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.520
I felt both humbled
and inspired.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.370
Sometimes I feel confused
at how an author can pack

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.580
so much emotion into
one small book.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.020
It's like a new world is opened
at just the flipping of a page.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.640
Speaking from a future
author's point of view,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.140
I can tell you your book
was a great creation.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.610
Yours was truly a wonderful
tale of adventure, excitement,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.870
and wonder that I
found incredible.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.740
Good job! Keep writing!

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.470
In the letter we just read,
the student-writer is guilty

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.810
of complimenting,
instead of corresponding.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.800
The letter, dedicated
to Phyllis Whitney,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.770
was more a fan letter rather
than a reflective letter

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.670
about the personal impact
of Ms. Whitney's book.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.250
The key to avoiding this error
is through a reader's response.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.620
This response can describe
many things: new emotions,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.040
memories, goals or activities.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.920
A reader's response can also
describe sudden understanding

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.510
or insight.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.160
Identifying your reader's
response is the first step

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.480
in your letter writing process.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.450
The next step is sharing your
response by explaining it,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.680
retelling it, putting
it into your own words.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.800
Remember to really develop the
ways the book made you feel

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.580
and think.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.520
Now, let's look at
another example.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.620
I will never forget the night

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.180
that my grandpa read me almost
every poem that he could find.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.590
It was a cool summer night

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.880
and I was sitting on
the deck with him.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.540
Then he read me your
poem, Birches,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.160
I instantly fell in love.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.440
Your poem is like
a friend to me.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.430
When I am stressed out or bored,
I recite a line in your poem

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.970
that will stick with me forever.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.390
Now, whenever I am able to write
anything we want to in school

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.360
for a project, I write poems.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.120
Poems that I share
with my grandpa

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.070
and that I could one
day share with others.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.190
If I had never read your poem,
I wouldn't have the relationship

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.850
with my grandpa that I have now.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.530
Comparing this excerpt
to the previous excerpt,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.180
the difference is clear.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.510
The first excerpt focuses
on complimenting the author,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.120
while the second
analyzes the book

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.360
and illustrates the
student-writer's feelings

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.060
and experiences.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.560
Now, I am going to
leave you with a task:

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.860
List three books you read

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.560
at three different
periods of your childhood.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.810
Consider, for example, a book
you or a parent read to you

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.120
when you were seven
years or younger.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.680
Then move forward to a book
you read two years later,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.910
and finally to a book
you read recently.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.980
After you have your list,
answer these questions:

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.960
How do the books' characters
and conflicts differ?

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.530
What did you find
appealing in each book?

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.650
How do the books you like change
as you changed and grew older?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.010
By answering these questions,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.550
you are practicing
your reader's response

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.750
and you might find a book
and an author to write to!

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.980
This will be all
for this lesson,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.280
hope you have learned how

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.230
to correspond instead
of compliment!

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.260
If you have any questions
or doubts, or if you feel

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.830
like you need more guidance
to reader's response,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.200
feel free to ask your
teachers and librarians.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.340
I am sure they are more
than happy to help!

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.660
