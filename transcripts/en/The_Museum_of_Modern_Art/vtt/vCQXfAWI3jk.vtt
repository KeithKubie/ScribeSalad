00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.783
When you restore old movies

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:05.465
normally...

00:00:06.653 --> 00:00:09.953
the people who made
those movies are no longer there.

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:11.553
So you can’t really ask them,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.265
"What was your original
intention here?"

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.145
In our case, I was lucky,
I knew the original intention.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.440
And in the case of let’s say
"Alice in the Cities" I knew...

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.068
that Robby and I
had dreamt to shoot it in 35mm.

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:28.823
That year was the very first year...

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.616
the self-blimped 35mm camera
came out, the Arriflex BL.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.326
But they only had prototypes.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:36.203
We couldn’t get
our hands on one.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.956
Because we were shooting
with direct sound,

00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:40.625
we had to shoot on 16mm.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:42.126
And we hated it.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.756
Because our dream was
to shoot it in large screen, 1.66,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.343
which at the time was a regular
format in Europe. Not anymore.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.888
But at the time we dreamt
of shooting in large screens.

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:58.100
So on that crummy 16mm camera
we had in the window

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:02.063
we had marks where 1.66 would be.

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.441
And so we framed for that.

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:09.486
Of course we had to shoot
full frame also for television.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.531
And then as things go
you make prints,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.160
nobody cares the director
initially wanted

00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:16.953
to have it in 1.66.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.391
It was always screened
in 16, in 3x4 full frame.

00:01:21.558 --> 00:01:23.333
Now, we suffered,
because I always

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.795
saw our original
intention in there.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.088
So when we restored it now

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.300
went back
to the original negative,

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:34.053
scanned it,
meticulously restored it,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.263
"Alice in the Cities" was dead.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:37.556
The negative was dead,

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:40.768
they had made 160 prints
of a 16mm negative,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.103
it was dead.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.731
There was nothing left,
and it was so scratched and torn,

00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:47.441
and had so many wounds,

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.360
it was unbelievable, but still...

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:51.653
we were able to restore it,

00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:54.740
took the longest time
of all the films.

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.035
And in the end, I said, “Well...

00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.661
if we’ve done all of this already

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.246
and it looks so good again,

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:04.125
then I’d like
to have it in that format

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.460
that I was dreaming
of already at that time.”

00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:10.130
So we radically went for 1.66,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.383
the frame
we had initially in mind.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:17.471
And I know that maybe
some conservative restorators will...

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:21.183
whine and say,
“We only know this film in 3x4.”

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.351
And I would say, “Unfortunately.

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:25.730
But now you see it
as I meant it.”

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.975
And that’s the advantage
if you do it yourself.
