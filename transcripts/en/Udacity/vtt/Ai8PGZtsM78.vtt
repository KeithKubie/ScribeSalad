00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.740
And in terms of

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.260
looking at the idea itself-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.300
&gt;&gt; What would be, if you had two ideas,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.050
what would you look in terms of this
is a better idea than the other idea?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.770
&gt;&gt; For me, it changes.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.260
I don't think I can just
say this idea or that idea.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.230
I think one of the things I really look
for is someone building a product or

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.790
a company that's focused on
a market that's growing, or

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.780
that will grow because
that product exists.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.570
I don't really love products that are
entering super mature markets because,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.600
at that point, startups lose
a lot of their nimbleness and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.710
a lot of their advantages.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.820
Because if you're going
into a mature market,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.920
basically what gets you noticed
is advertising dollars.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.440
And you're just fighting for
a slice of a pre-existing pie.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.170
But if you build something that's
going to cause a market to grow or

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.680
building something for a market that
is growing, you're fighting for

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.080
a slice of an ever expanding pie.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.020
And that is so much more interesting.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.099
It let's you play around more.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.129
The rules aren't written.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.480
There's all these things you can do.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.370
So I like those kinds of things more.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.060
But that's not to say that there aren't
great businesses to be built in mature

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.080
markets, as well.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.780
And it also depends on how you
think about what's a mature market,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.220
what's not.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.513
And I also like companies
that make me think honestly,

00:01:23.513 --> 00:01:27.070
that make me look at a problem
from a brand new perspective.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.100
Something that makes me say, huh,
I didn't realize you could do that.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.930
&gt;&gt; Very Cool.
&gt;&gt; You know,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.420
and that's tough to do, right,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.670
because we spend all day thinking about
ideas and thinking about new companies.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.390
But when you see one of those,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.390
that's the kind of thing that
you get really excited about.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.580
&gt;&gt; So, what would be an example
of an early stage market versus

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.250
a mature market?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.190
&gt;&gt; So, mature market, and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.960
this is kind of a silly example, but
junk food or something like that.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.180
It's like a pretty mature market, right?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.530
So, if a company came to us and said I'm
going to make a new kind of potato chip.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.710
Now, there's a bunch of reasons
we probably wouldn't fund it.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.740
But one of the things is, all right,
it's potato chips, what more can you do?

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.790
Now, you look at the last 10 years and
well, look at Pringles, right?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.520
They built a really big company,
I think,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.460
I actually don't know how big they are.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.770
They built a big company but
it's primarily a marketing challenge.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.980
In software, there’s some things
that are also mature markets.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.870
So CRM, right.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.675
Customer Relationship Management
software.

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:30.890
It's actually a pretty mature market.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.910
Now Salesforce disrupted it, in a lot
ways, to build a very large company.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.770
And there’s still things
that can be done.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.770
But it takes something
really insightful and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.570
really new to figure how to build
the next great CRM company.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.250
And I think there will be more of them.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.678
It's a lot harder.

00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:51.530
Not to say it's a bad idea but
it takes a little more thinking and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.230
a little more, I think,
a much deeper insight.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.190
Some newer markets that
are really immature.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.029
One that I like to think about, drones.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.790
&gt;&gt; Drones.
&gt;&gt; Everyone likes to talk about them but

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.070
I think it was something like
500,000 drones were sold last year.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.280
And the market's growing by some
ridiculous percentage every single year.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.710
That is such an underdeveloped market,
and

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.120
we think about all the applications
that drone have yet to touch.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.385
It's kind of mind-boggling.

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:26.900
I mean we're talking everything
from crop analysis, right.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.970
Flying a drone over a field which they
typically do with fixed-wing aircraft

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.680
now, just to see how healthy crops are,
all the way to tracking shots in movies.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.120
There's all these things and
we don't know what that's going to do.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.120
Not to mention unmanned
drones giving the Internet

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.190
to places which Facebook and Google are
both working on, or transporting people.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.990
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.510
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.210
&gt;&gt; That's going to be cool.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.421
&gt;&gt; It's going to be really cool.
