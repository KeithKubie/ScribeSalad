[Road sounds]

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.720
Mohit Agrawal:
We were invited to
Ghana in 2008 by an associate

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.210
Mohit Agrawal:
of Professor Gregory van der Vink.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210 position:77%
Mohit Agrawal:
When we were driving through Ashaiman we realized

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.530
Mohit Agrawal:
immediately that this was an
in-need location, and so we

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.800
Mohit Agrawal:
decided to actually stop
and look around and see

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.080
Mohit Agrawal:
what we could do.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.890
Mohit Agrawal:
We found our way to the EP
school, which is well regarded

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.390
Mohit Agrawal:
here in Ashaiman.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.860
Mohit Agrawal:
And we hit it off well with the
administration and got in

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.100
Mohit Agrawal:
contact with them about
what they would need.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.120
Mohit Agrawal:
They were ecstatic about using--
about our helping,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.510
Mohit Agrawal:
building a library.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.620
Mohit Agrawal:
The school has a long-term plan
to build a library and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.010
Mohit Agrawal:
our involvement actually meant
the library will get done now.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.580
Mohit Agrawal:
So this summer our budget
had three components.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.900
Mohit Agrawal:
The first component was bringing
in lots and lots and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.960
Mohit Agrawal:
lots of books.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.080
Mohit Agrawal:
And we did that successfully
after a little bit of hassle

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020
Mohit Agrawal:
at the port.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.180
Mohit Agrawal:
And we've set up a temporary
library here which will be in

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.150 position:56%
Mohit Agrawal:
use during the school year until the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.510
Mohit Agrawal:
main facility is complete.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.230
Nizette Edwards:
Here is the temporary library.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.890
Nizette Edwards:
It was built to house the books
while the library is

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.410
Nizette Edwards:
under construction.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.910
Nizette Edwards:
You can come in.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.270
Nizette Edwards:
We've sorted the books according
to age level so here

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.080
Nizette Edwards:
we have early readers, lower
primary, upper primary, young

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.680
Nizette Edwards:
adults, adults and nonfiction.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.510
Mohit Agrawal:
The second component
of the project is

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.020
Mohit Agrawal:
actually building part
of the library.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.210
Mohit Agrawal:
This summer we only have about
five weeks for construction,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.070
Mohit Agrawal:
which is not enough time to put
up the entire building,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.360 position:69%
Mohit Agrawal:
however, we should be able to
finish the reinforced concrete substructure.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.430
Mohit Agrawal:
The third component is to
evaluate netbooks and to

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.540
Mohit Agrawal:
evaluate the kind of structure
we can use for the digital

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.950
Mohit Agrawal:
literacy component of the project.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.990
Nizette Edwards:
We also have to
communicate with the leaders

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.640
Nizette Edwards:
of the community, the teachers,
the parents, so that

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.680
Nizette Edwards:
they know that the library is
for them and not just for us,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.860
Nizette Edwards:
that we're not giving money
for them, but they need to

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.650
Nizette Edwards:
take ownership of the library.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.930
Jane Yang:
Well, I'm very happy that after
a year, a year and a

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.270
Jane Yang:
half worth of work we're
actually physically putting up

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.860
Jane Yang:
the library structure.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.930
Jane Yang:
After being with the kids for
nearly two months and seeing

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.340
Jane Yang:
how voraciously they read when
given the temporary library

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.140
Jane Yang:
just now, I'm really excited
about when we can actually

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.780
Jane Yang:
open the Achieving Greater
Heights Community Library.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.580
Nizette Edwards:
This is what being an
engineer is about.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.780
Nizette Edwards:
It's about helping people,
making things easier and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.630
Nizette Edwards:
better for them.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:03:18.390
