&gt;&gt; Hello everyone.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.580
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.000
My name is Rob Casper.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.240
I'm the head of the Poetry and
Literature Center and I'm thrilled

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.720
to welcome you to this afternoon's
event, celebrating the poetry

First, let me ask you to
do what I'm going to do,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.580
which is to turn those wonderful
electronic devices that you have

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.490
to make sure that they
don't interfere

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.210
with this afternoon's event.

in welcoming Forrest
Gander and Marjorie Agosín.

Thank you.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.680
One more thing before I forget,
we will have questions at the end

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.630
of the program and Forrest will
be reading some poems for us now.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.930
Thank you.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.230
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: When
we start these readings,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.850
one will we do the poem
in English and then

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.670
after we read it in Spanish.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.150
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: So one person

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.180
who wasn't introduced
here is Georgette Dorn,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:21.150
who has been like the anchor of the
Hispanic Literature Program here

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:26.510
at the Library of Congress
for a very long time.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:35.070
[ Applause ]

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.150
I'm really glad to be
here with Marjorie,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:44.140
who has also been a really
significant figure as both a poet

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.300
and a translator, and
an advocate for poetry

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:57.200
and her Latin American poetry
for as long as I've been writing.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.430
So Happy Valentine's Day.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:07.820
I love that you came out to listen
to Neruda on Valentine's Day.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.170
So, yeah, we'll read
a couple of poems.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:16.620
I think we need to start,
Marjorie, no, with a love poem?

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:25.570
So this is a poem --
let's see -- I'm not sure.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.610
My numbers are going to
be different than yours.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.460
Never Alone with You.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.530
One of the things l like in
this poem a lot is the way

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:41.560 position:56%
that the figure of the beloved mixes
with the figure of the landscape

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:47.310
and this is something for someone
as heterosexual as Pablo Neruda,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.920
it's kind of interesting to think
that one way of reading his work is

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.330
that the two greatest influences on
him were a gay man and a gay women,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:05.350
Walt Whitman and Gabriela
Mistral and it's Gabriela Mistral,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:11.990 position:56%
some of her more complex poetry that
mixes landscape and psychy in a way

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.910
that I think influences Neruda.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.240
So these poems, as
Georgette asks me to tell you,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.990
were just discovered
three years ago.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.980
Matilda Rutia, Neruda's wife, had
been through all of his stuff,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.450
but not as carefully
as Dariel Oasis,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.570
the head of the Neruda
Foundation, in Chile,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:43.010 position:56%
who after Neruda widow's death
began to go through and document all

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.940
of the materials and began to
find things, written on the backs

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.410
of napkins, written on menus,

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.940
stuffed in other manuscripts
that no one had seen.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:00.280
They were completely unseen
poems and when I heard about it,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.170
I thought, "Oh, this is terrible,"

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:08.980 position:56%
and when they published a book three
years ago in Spain, Latin America,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.960 position:56%
I thought, "Oh, they're just
squeezing stuff Neruda really didn't

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.010
want to have published and
making a dollar on it."

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:22.040
And then I saw the reviews and
the reviews were startling good

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.870
and then I had the opportunity
to translate the work and looked

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.800
at it, and it was Neruda.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.910
It was the real thing.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:40.000
So I was really pleased
to get to do it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.650
This one, listen to how the
erotism is mixed the landscape.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.460
"Never alone, with
you over the earth,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.510
crossing through fire, never alone.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:59.190
With you in the forest, finding
again dawn's stiff arrow,

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.820
the tender moss of spring.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:07.500
With you in my struggle, not the
one I chose, but the only one,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.400
with you through the streets
and sand, with you, my love,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:17.060
my exhaustion, the bread, the wine,
poverty and glint of one coin,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.210
wounds, sorrow, happiness.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.010
All the light, shadow,
stars, all the cut wheat,

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:28.770
the corellas of giant sun flowers,
defeated by their very fullness,

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:34.260
the cormorant's flight nailed to
the sky like a coastline cross,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:40.050
all the space, the autumn, the
carnations, never alone, with you.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.380
Never alone, with you, earth.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:50.540
With, the sea, my life, all I am,
all I give and everything I sign,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:13:02.200
the substance of this love, the
earth, the sea, bread, a life."

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.340
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín:
Thank you very much.

grape," that's uva agria.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.970
He crossed that out and started
again with that "Never alone

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.200
with you," which worked way better.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:32.220
I think we'll just finish here with
one of the last poems in the book,

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:40.960 position:56%
which Neruda writes during the space
arrays and he has gotten a chance

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.850
to meet a few of the cosmonauts
and he is fascinated, of course,

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.770
at the beginning of this
time, as everyone was then

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:57.530
with the notion what's beyond
the earth, of men going away

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:04.660 position:56%
from the earth into galactic space
and he has an opportunity to ask one

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:11.850
of the cosmonauts, Herman Titov,
if he could see Chile from up there

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:18.530
and Titov said, "Well, you
know, I saw some mountains

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.330
down in the southern
part of the continent.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.190
I'm sure that was Chile," and
Neruda was really satisfied

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.450
that Chile could be
seen from deep space.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.400
Neruda also had the hots

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.360
for a cosmonaut named
Valentina Tereshkova.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:44.870
So this really beautiful
poem about imaging that space

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.770
and the first people there.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:54.310
"Those two solitary men,
those first men up there.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.100
What of ours did they bring them?

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.570
What from us, the men of earth?

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.040
It occurs to me that the
light was fresh then,

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.450
that an unwinking star
journeyed along, cutting short

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:14.570
and linking distances, their faces
unused to the awesome desolation,

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:20.380
in pure space among astral bodies
polished and glistening like grass

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:27.850
at dawn, something new came from
the earth, wings or bone coldness,

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:34.720 position:56%
enormous drops of water or surprised
thought, a strange bird throbbing

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:42.280
to the distant human heart and
not only that but cities, smoke,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.240
the roar of crowds,
bells and violins,

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.910 position:56%
the feet of children leaving school.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.200
All of that is alive
in space from now

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.570
on because the astronauts
didn't go by themselves.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:02.650
They brought our earth, the
odors of moss and forest,

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:08.490
love the crisscrossed limbs of
men and women, terrestrial rains

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.510 position:56%
over the prairies, something floated

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:16.740
up like a wedding dress
behind the two spaceships.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:22.500
It was our spring on earth
blooming for the first time

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.830
that conquered an inanimate heaven,

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:34.510
depositing in those altitudes
the seed of our kind.

Georgette Dorn has asked us

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.450
to read one more so
why don't we do that.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:44.960
This is dated January 10th 1973,

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:52.050
so it's just before the poet
dies and he wrote "La Negra."

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:59.300
I've seen -- if you go visit
Neruda's houses, three of them,

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.110
lived well for a communist.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:13.260
You'll see this old fashion phone
that we remember from like the 50s

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.360
and 60s that he's talking
about here.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.040
So we'll throw this poem in.

you a sense of his sense of humor

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:31.270 position:56%
and the lost that it would have been
if this poem was never recovered.

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:36.920
It's found in a notebook on which
the first page, the poet writes,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.320
" I began on the first
days of January 1973,

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:46.720
sick in bed with a bad hip, this
book titled, "Chosen Defects

without wanting to at first,

some advice through a wire,
a metallic transmission,

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:29.220
until finally I took leave
from myself and raising my arms

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.380
as though before a pointed gun,

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:36.630

of the telephone.

to see some black apparatus that
even with its silence, insults me.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:36:00.610
Me, a poet clumsy as a duck on
land, degrading myself to the point

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:06.270
of yielding my superior ear, which
I consecrated innocently to birds

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:12.390
and music, to this everyday
prostitution of fixing my ear

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.820
to an enemy trying to
take control of my being.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:21.740
I came to be a telefiend, a
telephony, a sacred telephant,

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.470
I prostrated myself
whenever the ringing

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:30.130
of that horrid despot demanded
my attention, my ears and blood,

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:35.330
when a voice mistakenly asked for
technical information or an escort,

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:39.990
or it was a relative I
detested, a forgotten aunt,

This very afternoon, Georgette
said how did you become a poet,

I think really it is fate, it
is a form of destiny, of birth

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.350
and consider all the
other professions

that [inaudible] vocation,
this is an amazing one.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:04.750
I used to spend summer in a
small [inaudible] village called,

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:11.040
"El Quisco," which is very close
to Isla Negra and my mother --

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:18.400
I always asked my mother to take
me to see the poet, el poeta.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.890
So I was about eight years old and
I saw this enormous human being

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:27.020
who was in a poncho and I was
fascinated by his notebook

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.780
and a green pen, sitting
on the rock,

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.010
looking at the sea and writing.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.510
I thought, as a young girl, that
that was an extraordinary to look

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:43.630

he inspired me to invite

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:51.310
or imagine and to be a poet.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.480
Was it easy?

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.780
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: No,
it wasn't easy at all.

I mean, you know, living by the
sea, he makes up words, "el córelo,"

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.190
you know like "el mar
caracol [inaudible],"

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:41.380
the snail [inaudible] the sea,
some idiosyncratic vernacular

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.320
that was only used
for a short period.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.430
In fact, I was going
to ask you, Marjorie,

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:54.060
if you knew what he was talking
about, or vivías en Argentina, no?

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.360
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín: Si.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.660
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander:
¿Cerca del mar, o no?

00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:00.740
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín: No,
o sea es cerca del rio.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:06.000
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: So Neruda has
the shortest poem in the book.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.300
It's a [inaudible]
to his wife's ear.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:14.910
It's starts out, you know, "oreja
maravillosa," marvelous ear,

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:21.850 position:56%
double butterfly, let me praise, and
then the next line are [inaudible].

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:27.290
"Yo hablo de la pequeña oreja mas
amada, hecha tal vez de nácar,

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:31.090
amasada con arena de rosa, no.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:34.000
Yo quiero celebrar una reja."

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.440 position:56%
So for those who don't have Spanish,
so it's like, it starts out,

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.750
"My lover's ear, marvelous ear."

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:50.350
Then he says, "I'm not talking
about la pequeña," "the little ear,

00:44:50.350 --> 00:45:03.920
most beloved, hecha tal vez de
nácar," kneaded perhaps with nicker

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:10.470
"con harina de rosa," with
rose flower; it's like what?

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:11.770
Where is he going?

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:14.070
He's like cooking his lover's ear.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.840
Do you know the vernacular?

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.690
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín: Arina de rosa.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.820

"oreja del mar," yeah.

I think it's a fish.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.090
Yeah, I do know [inaudible]
in the Caribbean, [inaudible].

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.840
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Well,
it turns out in the 50s,

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.260
but just for about 10 years.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.490
None of my friends in Chile --

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:58.830
and Marjorie is from
my age don't know it.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:05.720
Raúl Zurita didn't know it, but
people's grandmother's knew that

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.010
"oreja del mar" for a brief period
was what they called "abalone."

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.730
Abalone is little ear of the sea.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:16.480
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Yeah, at one
point in my life, I heard that.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.580

talking about the little ear

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:22.790

cook, that are so tasty.

[ Inaudible ]

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:29.940
Marjorie in terms of
Neruda, how is it possible

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.070
that these poems were
not found by anybody

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:37.330
or that he didn't want
to publish them?

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.330
How do you explain that?

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.730
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín: Maybe
Forrest can answer better,

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.830
but he didn't want to publish.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:50.060
I think a lot of people, you
know, because he's perfect

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.610
and he's imperfect and that's what
so beautiful about him, right?

00:46:53.610 --> 00:47:00.830
Some people published too
much but I think it happened.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.960
I don't know.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.790
Some people may think that it
was destiny that they were found

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:11.920
so many years after Neruda's death
and his beloved, [inaudible],

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:17.310
Matilde, but I think it was like
a flaw; they were not found.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.170
Matilde missed it but
I think that it's not

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.170
that he didn't want to publish.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.470
What do you think?

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.850
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: No,
de acuerdo contigo.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:29.800 position:56%
Like Marjorie shows up in Isla Negra

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.720
and there's this guy
on a stone writing.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.250
He was always writing and stuffing
the papers in different places

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:44.090
and so it was -- it's easy for some
of that work to have been hidden.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:48.530
It's voluminous, so many,
so many boxes of his work,

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:52.210
so many things stuffed
into the backs of books.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.280
His library was enormous.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.330
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: It's
very good that people spoke.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:57.630
I mean he would talk to people.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.920
He would sign anything, servilleta.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.220
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Yeah,
that's right, that's right.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.520
He would sign napkins.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.690
I mean he had a real
competition with Pablo DeRoca,

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:09.250
who considered himself
the people's poet.

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:13.470
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín:
I think, for example,

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:21.910
I'm sorry the poem was too long
but it's always an epic long poem

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.810
and these poems are really --

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:26.500
so they are one of the
best of Neruda's work.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:32.600
So they are part of this
tremendous "obra" literary work.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.590
So it is strange and
perhaps so Nerudian

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:42.620
that nobody saw them really
except the eye of the [inaudible]

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.400
and who knows, you know --

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:52.350
Matilde was very careful
with her husband's work,

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:55.260
[inaudible] she admits this,
which his totally human

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.760
and this is maybe what
Neruda wanted to happen.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.060
Thank you.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.930
&gt;&gt; So when did find out that they
were available for translation?

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:04.230
What was the process?

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:05.530
I was just curious.

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.400
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: It
was a crazy process.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.160
It was very under lock and key.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.270
It was sort of very secretive.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:20.400
Yeah. And so when the publishers
were bidding the English contract

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.800
and the publisher that put
the twice a day together,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.480
the [inaudible] together, Cooper
Canyon, which has a long tradition

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:39.020
of promoting [inaudible] books sent
a number of translators this lock

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:43.300
and key manuscript and then
we submitted translations

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:51.030
and mine ended up being picked, but
the way the manuscript came to me,

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:55.500
I could open it and read it but
I couldn't select any part of it.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.250
I couldn't alter any part of it.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.840
I couldn't copy any part.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.330
I couldn't send it to anyone.

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:04.140
I'd never seen such security.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:15.070
Yeah. So I worked laboriously
on this but also

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.360
at an increasingly excited state.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.340
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn:
It's a very good read.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:26.550
Would it late in life you
think or was it early in life?

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:30.340
Do you any idea when
these were written?

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:37.190
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Yeah, they
were written from about 1952 to,

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:47.390
we just heard one right
before he dies, 1973,

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.650
so about a 25-year period there.

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.400
It's midstride Neruda.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:07.190
[Inaudible] Nobel prize and
everybody knew in the 1971s.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.860
So it's amazing how much
appeal to the common person.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:14.120
I also think about when I walked
down the street here in Washington

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:20.330 position:56%
and [inaudible] and if I ask anybody
in the street, nobody would know.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:21.630
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Yeah.

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:25.880
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: But in Latin
America, if you walk the down

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.110
and someone won the Nobel Prize,
you were sure somebody would know.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:34.710
It is an interesting observation.

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:36.230
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín: I
also think towards later

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:41.940
in his life he made a conscious
decision and he wanted to write

in a way that people would find joy
in poetry and all the things he had.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.910

[inaudible] have torras

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:54.720
to look a [inaudible], you know

the french fries.

that he was interested in food.

&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Yes
and in animals too.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:00.090
He would write on frogs
and all the animals, yeah.

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:01.390

human beings are interested

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.190
in food and animals.

think we are going to open it

to the public with questions.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:27.190
Will you identify yourself
when you ask a question

We appreciate the reading
with Marjorie.

We are family [inaudible] and I
[inaudible] about the translation

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:55.530
about the manuscript that you found
and so the evolution and some lines

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:59.720
that are erased, so [inaudible].

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.390
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Yeah, so
that's part of why it's so useful

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:10.470 position:56%
to have the holographic text because
in the poems that I'm looking

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:12.920
at there are lines crossed out,

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:19.940
which then I don't include I
think about honoring the poet.

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:25.900
If I have lines crossed out, I
don't want Rob publishing them,

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.250
but it's really interesting to
see it because it's the process

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:32.240
of his thinking through
and so you get to see

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.660
that with the holographic type.

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:39.330

to the Industria Chile
is, of course, a writer.

out to its ambassador.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.030
I got to [inaudible].

00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:02.320
So Neruda -- after Neruda,
it takes Nicanor Parra

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:10.230
to re-energize Chilean poetry and
maybe after Parra, Raúl Zurita,

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:16.520
who's still alive and has
Parkinson's and I was with Zurita

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.630
in Chile last year with my wife.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:26.480
It was the last thing we did
together and walking up the street,

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:34.260
past a bunch of bars, and someone
at a bar recognized Zurita --

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.670
it gives you a sense of poetry's
place like Marjorie was saying

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:45.480
in Chile, stood up and began an
ovation, saying "Zurita, Zurita,"

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:49.120

also started clapping just

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.940
because this man was walking by.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.540 position:56%
And then Zurita who has
Parkinsons' froze because that's one

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:59.260
of the things that happens; you get
nervous, your body suddenly freezes

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:04.070
and he couldn't move, and the man
was shouting, "Go forward, Zurita.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:25.440
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Oh,
yeah, just like this.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:31.180
This was his the translator
with the Professor [inaudible].

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:36.770
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: [Inaudible] who
is a great translator who lives

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:44.950 position:56%
in that city and just published an
edition of Zurita [inaudible] poems.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:46.250
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn:
Any more questions?

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:48.990
Yes. Okay.

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:52.320
&gt;&gt; My name is Win Chi Chen,
I'm a [inaudible] poet.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:57.600
So may I ask an outside question?

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:05.140
How do we translate
the sounds and rhymes

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:12.400
of the original Spanish
into English?

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:17.630
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Okay and
Marjorie was also a translator

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:19.850
and a really good one.

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:23.430
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín:
I'm so glad you think

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:29.780
so because I don't consider
myself as a translator.

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:32.250
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander:
But you have, yeah.

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:37.250
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín: Quickly, I just
want to say or mention, you know,

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:46.000
[inaudible] had to walk away from
Isla Negra because he didn't want

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.470
to be called the poet of Isla Negra

00:56:52.470 --> 00:57:06.670
because he said there was
already a poet in Isla Negra,

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.160
so you can see the
strange [inaudible]

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.780
that happens in literature.

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:17.310
So he moved to a little nearby
town called " La cruces,"

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:22.830
but I would also like
to mention Enrique Lihn.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:27.480
He was an extraordinary
Chilean poet,

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.100
a combination of [inaudible]
almost at the same time.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:36.230
English, of course, even though
I was born in the United States,

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:43.620
I could be reported now
because I have an accent,

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:51.180
so English is not my native,
but I lived here long enough

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:54.900
to also embrace English and
love the English language

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.180
but I have translated from
the Spanish into the English.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:04.590
I have translated from my
language to another language

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:13.200
and it's not exactly my
own, but I know it well.

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:19.210
So I think a poet like
Forrest, who writes in English,

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:21.220
has another sensibility

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.700
when he translates
Spanish-speaking poem [inaudible].

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:30.840
I think because you
master already the language

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:36.540
when you are translating a poem,

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:42.180
it's a different experience
than mine.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:49.290
I think that I have borrowed
a little bit of the English

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:50.590
to convey the Spanish --

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:54.660
that English, I do not feel it
completely my own in a deep way

00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:57.400 position:56%
and perhaps the contribution to this
conversation in order to translate,

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.200
you have to be enamored of your own
native language and I am enamored

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.500
of Spanish, not English,
so I'm halfway translator.

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:01.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: The question that
you asked, for most of the poets

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:03.490 position:56%
that I love, the sound and the
rhyme make meaning equally important

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:04.790
to the semantic meanings.

00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:06.090
So sometimes I'll even risk going
away from a liberal translation

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:07.390
in order to capture a sound pattern

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:08.690
that I feel carries an emotional
weight that's more important

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:09.990
and that gets even harder
with Chinese and both the play

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:11.290
that you can have with
the way a character looks

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:12.590
and the way it can be
pronounced and the rhyme

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:13.890
of Chinese is the easiest
language in the world to rhyme in.

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:15.190
It's not even fun to
rhyme in Chinese.

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:16.490
It's too easy, but in Spanish, I'm
really listening for the sounds

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:17.790
and the rhythms and
trying to get those.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:19.090
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: How is that
some people translate informants?

00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:20.410
American poets translates Spanish
but he does not know any Spanish.

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:21.710
I've known somebody like that.

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:23.510
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Yeah, we've
all known somebody like that.

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:26.050
[ Laughter ]

00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:30.880
Well, you know I think in the
old days, it was more justifiable

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.130
so that [inaudible]
Merwin, who is still alive.

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:35.960
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: That's
the one I was thinking about.

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.910
He was one of our poet visitors.

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.210
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Yeah.

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:44.770 position:56%
Yeah, and he's a grand poet and he's
translated from a lot of languages

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:49.080
that he doesn't speak,
including Russian and a number

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:54.380
of Asian languages with
informants and those were important

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.470
because there has been
a lot of attention.

00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:01.320
So that happened a lot in the 60s
when suddenly America was waking

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.160
up to the fact that there were
other languages in the world

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:11.450
and we might translate some, you
know, our literary production

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:13.400
of translated works is one

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.830
of the lowest percentage
wise in the world, 3%.

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.130
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn:
I didn't know that.

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:21.430
That's interesting.

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.730
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander:
Yeah and [inaudible].

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:25.660
So his translations were really
important that they got done

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:30.080
and now there are more and more
poets who do speak other languages

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.390
who are capable of sort of,
you know, taking the lead.

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:39.930
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: What do
you translate, Marjorie?

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:42.940
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín: I have
translated for Gabriela Mistral,

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.480
which I think -- when Forrest
was talking about [inaudible],

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:52.970
she uses a lot of almost
19th century Spanish spoken

01:00:52.970 --> 01:01:01.540
in rural communities in Chile,
especially Monte [inaudible],

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.340
Monte grande where she lived.

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:08.610
And I think I've never attempted
to translate [inaudible]

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:15.410
and I have also done some
translation of Nicanor Parra,

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:20.920
which is also [inaudible]
because to convey corrupt

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.210
and [inaudible] of [inaudible].

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:24.510
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: I was going

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:30.040
to ask you how did you get the
rights to translate Gabriela?

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.340
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín:

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.640
I just [inaudible] they
never answered the letters.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.130
You know, this is an
interesting story.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:42.820
After [inaudible], I thought that
Gabriela could have been here,

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:47.770
all her work and her polished
work that did in Chile that I know

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:51.080
that all of you would agree that
that is where she should be,

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:57.880
but I think this is a
complex conversation,

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.790
but I think you'll understand
that it's really not a poems

01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:05.610
that people read that much maybe
it was because of the complaints

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:09.900
to Chile, because she was a woman.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:15.110
Neruda, somehow, [inaudible] he
was man and he would market himself

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:18.880
and men do that better than us.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.320
So Gabriela was, unread,
almost invisible

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.230
and then she had this very long
and passionate relationship

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:28.840
with [inaudible], an
executor to her estate,

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:36.830 position:56%
and when Gabriela Mistral died, her
poetry died with her and [inaudible]

01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:39.490
because unfortunately
she [inaudible] most

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:45.790
of her unpublished work and
she never answered the ledgers.

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:50.760
So a very wonderful
publishers, small presses,

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.990
which are really the
backbone of American Poetry,

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:56.990
White [inaudible] press, let's
sent three to [inaudible]

01:02:56.990 --> 01:03:03.610
and if she doesn't answer,
we acted in good faith

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:06.450
and we'll just go ahead and do it.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:10.800
So people are not spies and they're
not that important and [inaudible]

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.580
on the poetry but somehow
we just published part

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.430
of the first translation
of this [inaudible] poetry

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:21.770
after this beautiful
translation done [inaudible] Huey

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:25.910
and now Gabriela is back in Chile.

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:28.700
She's [inaudible] and I hope
many, many people read her

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:32.670
and translate her because
she is [inaudible]

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.670
for multiple translations.

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:38.830
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn:
Gabriela recorded here

01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:44.170
in the Library of Congress in 1952.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:50.220
That's the only real recording
that she has made in her life.

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:55.510
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: Oh so
great, Library of Congress.

01:03:55.510 --> 01:04:05.540
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.230
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: This had to
be recorded many times because,

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:15.920
at one point, year of the woman
in 1975, so we made her record

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.110
into a [inaudible] and
"suspiros," and she would say, "Oh,

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:21.910
I'm so tired, can we take a break?"

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:41.050
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:44.240
I think there are still more
things that needs to be --

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.770
you know she was a
tremendous correspondent

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:48.070
in spite of [inaudible].

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:49.370
What do you think, Roberto?

01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:50.670
There is a need for more of
Gabriela to be translated?

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:52.820
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Si,
more to translate.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:05:01.140
&gt;&gt; I thought it was interesting
the underlying intent,

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.720
I'm sorry the comment
that [inaudible] had.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.770
I just thought that
this was interesting.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:14.620
I haven't read much of Neruda
but I thought it was interesting

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.850
and I did see the film yesterday,
which was good, but the comments

01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:24.500
that were made about the 3% are
translated, poet of the people.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:29.670
It seems to me different art
form or different cultures, etc.,

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:35.980
in this country, there
doesn't seem to be as much

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:42.600
of a resonance towards culture but
in Britain, they have more written,

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:51.710
you have Shakespeare and you
don't have as many opera stars

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:57.160
or operas created and
I wondered what is it

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.360
that makes a culture
create a poet of the people

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:09.780 position:56%
because it's not just Latin in South
America, the Ireland has its call

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.380
and Irish side resinates
with me, but in America,

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.250
it does seem that there's
not as faithful at looking

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.600
at the present administration,
there has been lots

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.190
of call [inaudible] Tiffany to come
out of it, but it's been translated

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.810
into humor that's very [inaudible]
and visceral, and invisible and not

01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:20.250
into [inaudible] a lot of the
nuance that Neruda during his time.

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:21.550
Is that a time thing?

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:22.850
Is that a culture thing?

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:24.150
Is it all of the above?

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:25.450
What other elements do
you see created in Neruda

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:27.750
or the absence of a Neruda?

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:42.810
&gt;&gt; Marjorie Agosín: This is a
question for seminar discussion.

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:46.080
So what you say Ireland,
[inaudible], Russia, Chile,

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:53.790
so many countries that have
famous poets and how do you refer

01:06:53.790 --> 01:07:00.870 position:56%
to the United States, which also has
an extraordinary literary tradition

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:08.550
that is intertwined, [inaudible],
the Children's English Literature

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:13.000
and you're saying why their poetry
doesn't have the same resonance?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:20.480
This is very personal response.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.040
I'd like to use just
one word, "greed."

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.440
Poetry doesn't make money and this
is a highly capitalistic society,

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.270
always a penny.

01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:34.470
So the vocation of poetry
doesn't sell, really.

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:38.230
I think it's very sad to
speak this way but if you look

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:43.340
at how much money we pay
as taxpayers for the war

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:47.420
and how little we pay for the
National Endowment for the Arts,

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:54.160
it may explain and how I think a
lot of poets, including myself,

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.370
have to earn a living
as a college professor

01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:00.410
because no one can
survive as a poet.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:05.650
So I think they can at least
maintain this excentric poets

01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:09.660
and do poetry reading
for academic elite

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:15.480
but somehow I do not see
poetry in the streets,

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.730
a poetry that people seen
it and people remember it.

01:08:19.730 --> 01:08:23.280
This is a highly isolation
vocation, individualistic

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:29.560
and it has a very beautiful
side and an extremely dark one

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:36.760 position:56%
and the dark one perhaps is the fact
that words don't matter that much,

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:42.630
that maybe [inaudible] matters
more, maybe stores matters more

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:48.700
and other countries value
words in a different way.

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:55.620
Countries like Finland or Israel,
which are relatively country,

01:08:55.620 --> 01:09:00.890
have one of the largest
publishing industries

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:08.450
and especially the countries that
have more words in translation.

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.540
So I don't know.

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:15.490
I think we all know [inaudible],
our politics, our history.

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:19.840
In the 60s, there was
poetry and more songs.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.880
Who knows maybe now there will
be more poetry and more songs

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:27.380
because I think it humanizes
people more the Arts.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.540
I think that poetry -- we are
interested in what is more suitable

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:36.610
and I think we have to
change and look for the food

01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:40.510
that will sustain your soul and
believe me, poetry is also food.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:10:02.400
[ Inaudible ]

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.700
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Am I right?

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.000
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: I agree

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.840
with absolutely everything
that Marjorie said.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.920
Another trajectory to answering
your question is, dude,

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:17.670
you're not hanging out
with the right people.

01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:21.070
I mean, one, we had Whitman --

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:25.130
Whitman and Dickenson who are sure
the diastolic and systolic pulse

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:31.430
of American Literature and who
have international literature

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:36.450
in every other country and then
that poetry is really alive

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.550
in every city in the country.

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:40.920
Every night, there
are poetry reading,

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.710
one for Juan Herrera is a
hugely popular poet and hundreds

01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:48.040
of people come to his reading.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.340 position:56%
Robert [inaudible] who is just died,

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.830
people couldn't get
into readings of him.

01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:56.440
There would 800 people and people
standing in another room to try

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.430
to hear, and [inaudible]
Rich also a really popular,

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:03.220
really influential poet.

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:08.550
I think we have them, but
we get distracted especially

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:10.360
in the United States.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:17.560 position:56%
It's an epic of the spectacle and in
a way, poetry is the anti-spectacle.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:24.570 position:56%
It's this thing that can happen all
alone with you in a room with a page

01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:29.720
in front of you and like Marjorie
said, your soul can open up.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.040
Like "¡Que Milagro!"

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.740
What an amazing in
this age of spectacle

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:43.220
that that private intimate activity
can still be so powerful and it is.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.330
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: They have poetry
prizes in -- [inaudible] sector,

01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:51.020
they began in the 30s here.

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:55.780
Am I right about that in the 1930s?

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:59.380
And so I think there's been some
interest Washington at least.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.480
My hometown in Modesto,
has a little poetry center.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.780
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander:
That's a famous one.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.080
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Little house.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.380
&gt;&gt; Forrest Gander: The
writing center, yeah.

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.140
&gt;&gt; I think we are finished.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:14.040
We are going to thank
our poets and Georgette

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.840
for these wonderful conversations.
