this whole like in the end it doesn't

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:19.300
this whole like in the end it doesn't
 

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.719
this whole like in the end it doesn't
give you the answer it still kind of

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:21.729
give you the answer it still kind of
 

00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:22.980

we're almost programmed to do
 

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.449
we're almost programmed to do
no that's that's a lot better than what

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:54.459

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:12.780
all of that is yeah it feels very on the
money and yeah and again like I the way

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:12.790
money and yeah and again like I the way
 

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.269
money and yeah and again like I the way
you say and even him seeing this an

was kind of like yeah so they're like

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:34.930
was kind of like yeah so they're like
 

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.050
was kind of like yeah so they're like
ones he can touch that was kind of

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:37.060
ones he can touch that was kind of
 

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.550
ones he can touch that was kind of
interesting so or it couldn't be taken

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560
interesting so or it couldn't be taken
 

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.980
interesting so or it couldn't be taken
that maybe they weren't seeing him he

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:43.990
that maybe they weren't seeing him he
 

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.150

just happened to be in the right spot

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160
just happened to be in the right spot
 

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.420
just happened to be in the right spot
when they you know do the laser thing

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.430
when they you know do the laser thing
 

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.949
when they you know do the laser thing
and do the birth and everything and then

00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959
and do the birth and everything and then
 

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:51.810
and do the birth and everything and then
fly up although he said you know can you

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:51.820
fly up although he said you know can you
 

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.300
fly up although he said you know can you
see me it's I think they're hinting that

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.310
see me it's I think they're hinting that
 

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.040
see me it's I think they're hinting that

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.050
they can't but they never fully say so
 

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.449
they can't but they never fully say so
basically if you break it down you have

00:09:57.449 --> 00:09:57.459
basically if you break it down you have
 

00:09:57.459 --> 00:10:00.210
basically if you break it down you have
the Fox who's in his own astral state

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:00.220
the Fox who's in his own astral state
 

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.579
the Fox who's in his own astral state
can see him cuz they're same plane of

00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:02.589
can see him cuz they're same plane of
 

00:10:02.589 --> 00:10:05.790
can see him cuz they're same plane of
existence and then God God grab you know

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800
existence and then God God grab you know
 

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.420
existence and then God God grab you know
that can see him because he's gob gob

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:09.430
that can see him because he's gob gob
 

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.920
that can see him because he's gob gob
gob well that you know and grab so

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:13.930
gob well that you know and grab so
 

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.630
gob well that you know and grab so
there's that but yeah maybe with the

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640
there's that but yeah maybe with the
 

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.060
there's that but yeah maybe with the
large it could just be literally like

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:18.070
large it could just be literally like
 

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.769
large it could just be literally like
you said just happen to be at the right

00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:19.779
you said just happen to be at the right
 

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:21.630
you said just happen to be at the right
spot at the right time they don't

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640
spot at the right time they don't
 

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.920
spot at the right time they don't
actually see him they don't actually you

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:22.930
actually see him they don't actually you
 

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.439
actually see him they don't actually you
know hear him and the big boost was just

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:25.449
know hear him and the big boost was just
 

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:27.630
know hear him and the big boost was just
kind of on accident yeah like if he just

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640
kind of on accident yeah like if he just
 

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.430
kind of on accident yeah like if he just
have any right in the center when they

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440
have any right in the center when they
 

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.470
have any right in the center when they
