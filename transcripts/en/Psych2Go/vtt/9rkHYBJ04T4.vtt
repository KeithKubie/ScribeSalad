00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.280
Trauma occurs in many forms, ranging
from verbal to physical and our sexual.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.660
Whether you've personally experienced abuse
or have witnessed it, we want you to know

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.020
that it's not your fault nor are you alone.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.439
Not only is it hard to talk about, but it
follows you even after it's over.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.200
We hope wherever you are today that you're
in a safer place.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.149
Our hearts go out to anyone who's been a victim
of childhood abuse.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.809
In our description box below, we've included
a few hotlines in case you need to contact

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.050
someone for help.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.230
As always, you can also reach out in the comment

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.149
Here are 7 ways childhood trauma follows you
into adulthood.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.160
1: You can't seem to remember much of your
younger years at all.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.660
Do your high school years feel like a blur?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.929
You might find yourself drawing a blank when
someone brings up a childhood memory and you

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.640
can't recall the same one.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.230
People with childhood trauma may experience
flashbulb memories in which they remember

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.280
vivid moments but not the full event.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.850
When you look back on the past, it's made
up of more black holes than fully written

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.850
chapters.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.320
You might even feel like someone or something
has stolen your childhood depending on the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.090
severity of the events.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.659
2: You find yourself in toxic relationships.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.770
If you've ever watched or read "The Perks of
Being a Wallflower", you'd be familiar with

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.860
the quote "we accept the love we think we
deserve".

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.110
When you grow up in a household devoid of
love and emotional support, healthy relationships

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.860
are a foreign concept to you.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.380
In fact, many people who face childhood trauma
often adopt the fearful avoidant attachment

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.469
style, where they want emotionally close relationships
but find it hard to trust or depend on others

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:47.549
completely.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.909
Consequently, without knowing it, you might
seek destructive relationships, mistaking

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.160
the mistreatment and uncertainty for excitement.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.060
3: Or you feel like you don't deserve love
at all.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.640
People who experienced abuse in their childhoods
might avoid romantic relationships altogether

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.390
believing they can't be loved by others.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.080
This is known as the anxious preoccupied attachment
where the individual wants to establish emotional

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.860
intimacy with others but often fears rejection.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.830
As a result, vulnerability is usually avoided
when they've only been hurt by people they

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.440
once trusted.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.840
This kind of trauma doesn't just ache, it
ruins you.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.140
4: You develop passive aggressiveness.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.611
Did you grow up in a household with anger
all the time?

00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:40.230
It can be so scarring that you might even
grow fearful of this emotion.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.370
You learned at a young age that none of your
emotional needs were important, so you've

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.330
only resorted to buring or suppressing them.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.650
As you reach adulthood, you'll continue to
exercise passive aggressive behavior because

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.620
straightforward communication was avoided
when you were a child.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.220
5: Negative self-talk is amplified.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.770
Childhood trauma gets into victims heads and
makes them believe they won't ever be good

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.770
enough.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.620
It's not something they can just snap out
of or fix with positivity.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.880
It's scary and real how convincing their parents
might have been when their words and actions

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.670
cut them deep.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.070
6: You ride an emotional roller coaster.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.220
You might either feel too much or not enough
at all.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.480
Trauma can cause a disruption in your emotional
well-being.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.390
Signs include trouble making decisions, impulsive
behavior and random outbursts of anger or

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.390
frustration.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.520
7: You don't know who you are.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.310
Identity is difficult, but it seems more impossible
to grasp or pin down when you face childhood

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.360
trauma.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.820
Its slippery like a fish and the more you
try to see yourself, the less you begin to

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.190
recognize who you thought you were.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.080

of these symptoms?
