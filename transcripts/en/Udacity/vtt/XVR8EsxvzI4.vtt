00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.480
These are some ways that you can use the
technology we discussed in this course.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.580
And what I love about
each of these examples,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.440
is that you can hardly
see the technology.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.110
Some people think that the future of
computing is keeping you immersed, and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.910
keeping you away from you life.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.750
But as it turns out,
with ubiquitous computing, less is more.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.960
It's where we,
as developers and designers,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.410
put the user before the technology.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.200
As we remove the abstract barriers,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.100
such as what functionality
resides on what device.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.920
Our users can focus more
on what they're doing, and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.170
less on how to start doing it.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.420
Now, this simple core philosophy
to ubiquitous computing

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.810
is what you see over and
over again in terms like seamless,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.060
simple, microinteraction,
and glanceable.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.560
And it's not new.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.680
It's the idea that success isn't
measured by how long the user is engaged

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.100
with the interface, but how quickly
we can get them to what they need.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.090
Now there's a website that's been
around for just over 15 years,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.890
that was built with that
philosophy in mind.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.650
Google.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.010
This kind of user
interaction is in our DNA.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.380
Back at a time when the search engine
philosophy was to keep the user

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.340
on the page as long as possible,
Google went the other direction.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.890
And as it turns out,
that's exactly what users wanted.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.780
And that's why it made sense for
us to recognize that as a core

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.340
philosophy across all
these new form factors.
