- And that's what my mom
got at the house.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.574
At my mama's house, it's black
Jesus, my dead grandma,

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:11.344
me at graduation,
and fucking Rod Stewart.

I'm your host, Roy Wood Jr.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.520
We all have that special woman
in our life,

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.355
the one we like to put up
on a pedestal.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.023
- Finger sandwiches, boys?

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.425
- Aw, thank you, Mom.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.493
- Go on, little Roy,
make it rain.

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.363

You know this man
from his work

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.299
[cheers and applause]

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.134
I love my mom.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:12.572
I love my mom,
but my mom hates everything.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.207
Like, whatever it is,
my mom has the gift,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.876
like most mothers,
to just find the flaw

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.611
in whatever you think
is perfect.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:19.879
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.481
It doesn't matter if it's food,

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.216
television, whatever,
your outfit--

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.919
she will break it down
and find the one thing wrong.

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.921
I took my mom to see
the movie "Gravity."

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.723
Sandra Bullock
and George Clooney,

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.425
beautiful film.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.060
A woman lost up there in space,

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.995
trying to figure out how
to get back down to Earth.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.798
I take my mom to see
this Oscar-winning masterpiece.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.266
We're walking out the theater.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.001
She boils it down
to one sentence:

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:45.238
"It's just a movie about
a bitch flipping and crying."

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.475
[laughter]

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:56.983
I said, "What?

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.086
"This movie is about
a beautiful internal struggle,

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.457
"the desire to live when
all the odds are against you.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.791
That's what the film"--

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:07.160
"No, it's just a bitch
flipping.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.829
"She crying.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:11.998
"Bitch wouldn't be flipping
if she'd stopped crying.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.366
"Stop crying,

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.800
"and figure out
why you flipping

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.135
"and then you stop flipping,
bitch.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:17.971
Stop flipping."

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:21.874
That's what my mom does
to things.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:23.976
I'm not--like, she--
she hates everything.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.646
I can't even explain to you
how much she--

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.481
I'm not even my mama's
favorite comedian.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:31.150
I'm not even in her top five.

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:32.318
That's not even a lie.

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.819
Like, I don't curse enough.

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:36.656
That was her note to me
as a performer.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.823
You don't curse enough.

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:39.325
You ain't no Katt Williams,

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.994
I tell you that.

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:43.996
My mom's Mount Rushmore
of comedy

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.199
is Ron White, Katt Williams,

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.634
Wanda Sykes,
and barely Chris Rock

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.403
because he walks
too damn much.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.672
That's what she said.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.474
Why he got to walk
back and forth

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:57.376
while he tell the joke?

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.644
Can't he stand still?

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.112
See, Ron White--
I like Ron White

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:02.748
'cause he stands still
so you can hear the joke.

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:04.684
He stands still
'cause he's drunk, Joyce.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:08.254
That's why he doesn't walk.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:15.695
She loves Rod Stewart though.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.833
Never heard her say a bad word
about Rod Stewart.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.702
My mama got a ton
of favorite musicians.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:25.004
She like all the Hall of Fame
black people,

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:26.606
but there's something
about Rod Stewart.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.741
I don't know what it is.

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.243
She loves that dude,
and when my mama die,

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.111
that's what I'm playing
at her funeral.

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:35.348
I'ma put a Amazon Echo next
to her casket, and...

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.782
[laughter]

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:40.119

my mom likes Rod Stewart.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:50.963
She has all his albums.

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:55.534
She loves Rod Stewart.

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:56.936
She went to New York.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.537
Her and her girlfriends
every year,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.905
they go to New York,
and they go

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:01.440
on this big
theater-hopping tour.

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:03.643
They block out four days,
and they go watch, like,

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.244
eight, nine Broadway musicals.

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:06.912
One in the morning,
one in the evening.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.748
Some sort of
old lady Coachella,

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.750
I don't know what they...

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:13.719
You know--
like, you know how you barhop?

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:15.821
Like, they do that,
but with theater shows

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:17.256
in Times Square,

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.625
so they're leaving
a show one night,

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:20.660
and my mom calls me,
just, just--

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:21.894
[hyperventilating]

00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:24.096
Just breathing into the phone.

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.898
Which is scary, when you get
a call from a loved one,

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.500
and all you hear is breathing.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.403
You don't know if it's
good news or a kidnapping.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.004
You don't know.

00:04:32.037 --> 00:04:33.272
I answer the phone.
I go, "Hello?"

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:34.273
I just hear...

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:37.343
[hyperventilating]

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:45.017
"Roy, Roy, Roy..."

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.519
I go, "Mama, what's going on?"

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:47.787
"I took--I took a picture
with Rod.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.455
"I took a picture.

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:52.792

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:05.371
[laughter]

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:08.674
My mama met Rod Stewart,
took a picture with him,

00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:13.145
took the picture home,
put it on top of the fireplace.

00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:14.947
Like, I don't know
where you from,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.651
but down south,
that is the most sacred place

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:20.953
for a picture to be put,
above the fire--

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:24.056
he went straight
to above the fireplace.

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.825
You supposed to earn
the fireplace.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:27.126
You supposed to work
your way up.

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:28.694
You got to be
on the end table

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:31.664
in the hallway
for a little while.

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.299
You do good,
then you get promoted

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:37.503
to the top of the piano,

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.705
and you either die
or graduate from college,

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:44.210
and you get
above the fireplace.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:46.178
And that's what my mom
got at the house.

00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:48.714
At my mama's house, it's black

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:54.920
[laughter]

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:59.892
And she loves Rod Stewart.

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:05.364
I get home a couple weeks after
this whole shit went down,

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:07.933
and I go and look
at the picture,

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:12.872
and I start peeping some
discrepancies in the photo.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:14.540
First of all,
there's a knife and fork

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:16.275
in the background.

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:19.011
I go, "Where--where are you
in the theater that there's

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:21.781
a knife and fork?"

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:24.450
There's some red and white,
like, wallpaper,

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:28.020
and I look closer.
I go, "Mama, you took

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:31.724
this picture
at a TGI Friday's."

00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:33.893
And she said, "Yeah, that's
where I met Rod Stewart."

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:38.898
I said, "Mama, I'm pretty sure
Rod Stewart ain't

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.902
"swinging by TGI Friday's

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:44.904

That's not how Rod Stewart
rolls."

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.109
And I go, "Give me some more
details of the story.

00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:51.944
Tell me about
when you saw him."

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:53.579
"Well, he walked in,
and he was walking around."

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:55.147
I go, "Who was with him?"

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.416
"Well, nobody."
"Well, then this definitely

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.452
was not Rod Stewart!"

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.288
You telling me Rod Stewart,
fucking billionaire musician

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.623

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:06.258

I'm like, "This is not

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.105
We argued back and forth
about this shit.

00:07:20.138 --> 00:07:21.273
"It is Rod Stewart."

00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:23.075
I go, "Mama, I really think

"Oh, he didn't charge me."

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.655
I was like, "What?"

00:07:36.688 --> 00:07:38.324
Which made me even more upset,

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:42.661

this person is crazy.

and puts on the Rod Stewart,

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.374
puts on the mullet
and the sequined jacket

00:07:55.407 --> 00:07:59.945

00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:11.824
But just to do it
so you can take selfies

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:15.227
with 60-year-old women,
that's foul.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.064
That's some creepy-ass
behavior, man.

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:21.867
Me and my mom, we still going
back and forth about it.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.402
"It is Rod Stewart.

00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:25.204
"Y'all just don't want to
acknowledge the fact

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:26.539
"that I met Rod Stewart.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:29.008
Y'all jealous."

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:31.310
So I laid down
the gauntlet,

00:08:31.343 --> 00:08:33.178
and I print up a picture
of Rod Stewart,

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:35.147
the real Rod Stewart,
and I bring it

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.849
into the kitchen,
and I lay it down

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:40.486
on the counter next to
the TGI Friday's Rod Stewart.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.521
[laughter]

00:08:42.554 --> 00:08:44.657
I did. I laid the real
Rod Stewart here,

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.358
and then next to him

00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:50.196
was the Jack Daniel's
chicken and shrimp Rod Stewart.

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:54.733
And my mama looks
at the pictures,

00:08:54.766 --> 00:08:57.736
and she look, and she look...

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:01.040
And then her face dropped.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:03.609
And...

00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:04.877
and...

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.680
[laughter]

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.882
You evil as fuck over there.

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:12.551
[laughter]

00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:14.920
My mama is sad,
and you're laughing.

00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:17.990
[laughter]

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.795
And I felt bad.

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.296
Like, I legitimately felt
bad because the truth

00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:25.731
of the matter is
it didn't matter

00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:27.066
if it was Rod Stewart or not.

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.567
She believed
it was Rod Stewart.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.570
The shit made her happy.
Let her have her moment.

00:09:31.603 --> 00:09:33.639
But I was so determined
to be right

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:36.575
that, in the process,
I hurt my mom's feelings,

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:40.245
and, thankfully,
it would be a couple years,

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:44.650
but I got a shot
at redemption because

00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:48.420
I did some shows in London,
and my mom asked me, you know,

00:09:48.453 --> 00:09:49.722
"Hey, I've never been
to England.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.090
Can I roll with you?"

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.424
And I was like, you know,
"Fuck it--

00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:54.126
you a good wingman.
Let's roll."

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:56.261
[laughter]

00:09:56.294 --> 00:09:57.663
Shit, my mom cool as hell.

00:09:57.696 --> 00:10:00.899
I was like,
"Let's go to England."

00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:06.605
And we're in this department
store in London called Harrods.

00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:08.340
Harrods of London.

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:10.843
It's one of the most
prestigious department stores.

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:12.978
It's like nothing you--
there's nothing in America

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:14.580
that even compares to it.

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:16.415
I don't even know how
to put it into words.

00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:19.585
It's like, take the biggest
shopping center you know

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:22.421
and on top of that,
put another shopping center

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:24.490
and then on top of that,
put luxury goods,

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:26.191
and on top of that,
put a pet store,

00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:29.461
and then on top of that,
put a grocery store.

00:10:29.494 --> 00:10:31.430
Like, you can get everything
in the store.

00:10:31.463 --> 00:10:33.465
It's just a prestigious
asshole, like, there's floors

00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:37.302
of this place where it's just
literally $20,000 dresses.

00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:40.939
That's every rack.
It's just $20,000 dresses.

00:10:40.972 --> 00:10:42.808
Like, you got off the elevator,
and you just like,

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:46.779
"This is not my floor,"
then you step back on.

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.981
You go, ding, ding.
[mimics elevator door closing]

00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:52.651
[laughter]

00:10:52.684 --> 00:10:55.320
Well, me and my mom got
a pastime that we do together.

00:10:55.353 --> 00:10:58.657
We go and we look at shit
we can't afford.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.026
So we on the expensive
dress floor,

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:04.396
and my mom was looking
at all these gowns or whatever,

00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:06.632
and one of the sales associates
from Harrods comes over,

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.400
talks to me and my mom.
She goes...

00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:09.902
[with British accent]
"Pardon me, we're gonna

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:11.336
have to ask"--
first of all,

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:14.206
my British accent is horrible,
okay?

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:17.176
Accents ain't what I do,
all right?

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.244
"Pardon me,
we're gonna have to ask you

00:11:19.277 --> 00:11:21.714
politely to leave."

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.682
Yeah, so, at first, I thought
it was on some race shit.

00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:25.684
I'm like, "Whatchu mean,
white lady?"

00:11:25.717 --> 00:11:27.419
[laughter]

00:11:27.452 --> 00:11:29.388
"First show I did,
Oprah Winfrey liked that,

00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:31.356
"and now you're gonna--
you think I ain't got the money

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:34.326
"to buy one of these dresses?

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:35.894
"Bitch, I've been on
BET 'Comic View.'

00:11:35.927 --> 00:11:38.097
You know how much money I got?"

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.865
Like...

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:41.767
just making up credits,

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.070
arguing with this lady.

00:11:46.438 --> 00:11:48.340
And she goes...
[with British accent]

00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:50.709
"No, no, no, no, you're welcome
to come back in a couple

00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:54.079
"of hours, yeah, but we have
a shopper who has reserved

00:11:54.112 --> 00:11:58.083
this entire floor to shop
with a little bit of privacy."

00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:01.086
[laughter]

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:04.089
I go, "Who?
Who the fuck can afford

00:12:04.122 --> 00:12:09.228
to reserve
the $20,000 dress floor?"

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:10.896
She goes, "Rod Stewart."

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:15.134
[laughter]

00:12:17.302 --> 00:12:19.872
And I turn to my mom,

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.708
and she heard it.

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:24.576
And she had this look
on her face, and I can't--

00:12:24.609 --> 00:12:27.412
I don't even know how to
describe this look, but it's--

00:12:27.445 --> 00:12:31.550
when you see the toy
you really want for Christmas

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:33.218
and you're trying to get
your mama to--

00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:35.053
[stammering]

00:12:35.086 --> 00:12:36.488
Like, that's how
my mama looked.

00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:38.957
Like Denzel before he cries
in movies.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.293
[whimpering]

00:12:43.862 --> 00:12:44.830
Fucking bottom lip.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:47.933
[stammering]

00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:52.004
I go, "I got you, Joyce.

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:54.807
I got you."

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.942
So I turn over.

00:12:56.975 --> 00:12:58.177
I see Rod Stewart approaching,

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.112
and Rod Stewart looks exactly

00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:01.780
how you think he looks
in person:

00:13:01.813 --> 00:13:05.417
fucking amazing.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.451
He didn't even touch the floor.

00:13:06.484 --> 00:13:07.619
This nigga was floating.

00:13:07.652 --> 00:13:10.255
He was just floating through..

00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:12.291
[as Rod Stewart]
♪ If you like my body ♪

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:14.193
Like, I do, Rod.
I like your body.

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:16.128
Like, I get it now.

00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:20.132
[laughter]

00:13:20.165 --> 00:13:21.433
He had his own breeze.

00:13:21.466 --> 00:13:23.302
You know how rich
you got to be

00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:26.172
to have a breeze
that precedes you?

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.876
Nigga, I smelled Rod Stewart
before I saw him.

00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:32.144
It was...

00:13:32.177 --> 00:13:35.214
[laughter]

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:37.316
Rod Stewart is 30 feet
off of me.

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:39.651
His security detail is
10 feet ahead of him,

00:13:39.684 --> 00:13:41.353
and I'm trying to figure out

00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:44.489
how I'm gonna get through
these fucking dudes,

00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:47.526
and I try to get--get up
with one of 'em.

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:50.195
And he goes, "No, mate."

00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:52.231
I ain't even
opened my mouth yet.

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.900
Security dude says,
"No, mate."

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:57.002
I go, "Listen, man."

00:13:57.035 --> 00:13:58.670
[sighs]

00:13:58.703 --> 00:14:00.305
[laughter]

00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:02.007
"I don't know how to explain
this to you,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.509
"but that's my mama over there.

00:14:04.542 --> 00:14:06.678
She's a huge fan."

00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:08.680
"I said no, mate.
Keep it moving, yeah?

00:14:08.713 --> 00:14:11.516
All right.
No worries."

00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:14.686
No, that's the trick shit
British people do.

00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:16.355
They say something fucked up
to you,

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:19.691
then they say "no worries"
right behind it.

00:14:19.724 --> 00:14:21.193
And I'm like, "No, bitch.
Yes worries.

00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:24.329
Yes worries.
I have worries."

00:14:24.362 --> 00:14:27.566
[laughter]

00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:31.003
And it's getting a little testy
between me and this dude,

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.604
so I already know the picture
ain't gonna happen,

00:14:32.637 --> 00:14:34.406
'cause I'm an asshole
at this point.

00:14:34.439 --> 00:14:35.874
And--and in Rod Stewart's
defense,

00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:37.542
this dude is in
full family mode.

00:14:37.575 --> 00:14:39.111
This is not the time
to disturb anybody

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:40.579
while they're out shopping.

00:14:40.612 --> 00:14:42.681
The dude literally
reserved an entire floor

00:14:42.714 --> 00:14:44.449
so he could avoid
motherfuckers like me.

00:14:44.482 --> 00:14:46.184
So...
[laughter]

00:14:46.217 --> 00:14:48.520
I understand--I wasn't mad
at him, but we locked eyes

00:14:48.553 --> 00:14:50.055
for a second--
for a brief second.

00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:53.892
For three seconds,

00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:58.397
I was eye to eye with
the only thing my mother

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.100
has never spoken
negatively about.

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:05.404
[laughter]

00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:09.207
And I know I'm not getting
a picture,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.544
so I just said, "Hey, man, did
you ever eat at a TGI Friday's

00:15:12.577 --> 00:15:14.279
in Times Square?"

00:15:14.312 --> 00:15:17.783
[laughter]

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:20.586
I told you that wasn't
Rod Stewart!

00:15:23.254 --> 00:15:25.424
I'm Roy Wood Jr.

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:26.525
Thank you very much.
