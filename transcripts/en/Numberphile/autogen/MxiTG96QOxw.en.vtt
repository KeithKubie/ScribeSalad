00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.640
prime eight nine 10 I'm not primes and
11 is a prime let's put it too and just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
11 is a prime let's put it too and just
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.030
11 is a prime let's put it too and just
a please pretty because 2 is a prime why

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
a please pretty because 2 is a prime why
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.330
a please pretty because 2 is a prime why
should we discriminate against 2 so here

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
should we discriminate against 2 so here
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.760
should we discriminate against 2 so here
I'll put 2 on the other side as well 2

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
I'll put 2 on the other side as well 2
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.899
I'll put 2 on the other side as well 2
is a prime 3 is a prime 4 is still not a

problem 5 and we could go on so this is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
problem 5 and we could go on so this is
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.399
problem 5 and we could go on so this is
an infinite game and now let's draw

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
an infinite game and now let's draw
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.810
an infinite game and now let's draw
lines that connect the side so I'm going

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
lines that connect the side so I'm going
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.880
lines that connect the side so I'm going
to try my best to draw a line parallel

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
to try my best to draw a line parallel
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650
to try my best to draw a line parallel
to the lines

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
to the lines
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.500
to the lines
drawn in Evin now let's look where these

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
drawn in Evin now let's look where these
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.600
drawn in Evin now let's look where these
lines intersect and write down the sums

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
lines intersect and write down the sums
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.060
lines intersect and write down the sums
of the two prime that are coming through

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070
of the two prime that are coming through
 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.440
of the two prime that are coming through
here's four that's the two plus two

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450
here's four that's the two plus two
 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.380
here's four that's the two plus two
three plus two is five well that's not

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
three plus two is five well that's not
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.360
three plus two is five well that's not
even but we'll put it down anyway just

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
even but we'll put it down anyway just
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.880
even but we'll put it down anyway just
for the sake of having something there

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
for the sake of having something there
 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.590
for the sake of having something there
and of course we have seven and nine now

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
and of course we have seven and nine now
 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.880
and of course we have seven and nine now
three plus three is the first

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890
three plus three is the first
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.000
three plus three is the first
interesting one here's six and then

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
interesting one here's six and then
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.760
interesting one here's six and then
let's see what else do we have we have 5

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770
let's see what else do we have we have 5
 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.550
let's see what else do we have we have 5
plus 3 is 8 and 7 plus 3 is 10 and 11

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
plus 3 is 8 and 7 plus 3 is 10 and 11
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.910
plus 3 is 8 and 7 plus 3 is 10 and 11
plus 3 is 14 that's a bit of a skip it

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
plus 3 is 14 that's a bit of a skip it
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.740
plus 3 is 14 that's a bit of a skip it
might be worried about that one in 13

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
might be worried about that one in 13
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.010
might be worried about that one in 13
plus 3 and 16 remains across we just fix

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020
plus 3 and 16 remains across we just fix
 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.770
plus 3 and 16 remains across we just fix
12 we've skipped 12 do we get at 12 well

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780
12 we've skipped 12 do we get at 12 well
 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.980
12 we've skipped 12 do we get at 12 well
yes of course we do we get 5 plus 7 is

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990
yes of course we do we get 5 plus 7 is
 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.700
yes of course we do we get 5 plus 7 is
12 and here's 7 plus 5 s and other 12

this is a symmetric picture so it's not

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
this is a symmetric picture so it's not
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.690
this is a symmetric picture so it's not
too surprising when we get the same

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700
too surprising when we get the same
 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.410
too surprising when we get the same
thing both ways seven and seven we saw

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420
thing both ways seven and seven we saw
 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.270

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.740
114 before this is a really different 14
we had 3 plus 11 or 7 plus 7 what's this

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
we had 3 plus 11 or 7 plus 7 what's this
 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.110
we had 3 plus 11 or 7 plus 7 what's this
one 11 + 5 another 16 years 5 plus 11 is

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
one 11 + 5 another 16 years 5 plus 11 is
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.680
one 11 + 5 another 16 years 5 plus 11 is
another 16 and then here is 5 plus 13 is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
another 16 and then here is 5 plus 13 is
 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.170
another 16 and then here is 5 plus 13 is
18 and 7 plus 11 another 18 really

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180
18 and 7 plus 11 another 18 really
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.780
18 and 7 plus 11 another 18 really
different 18 I have 13 plus 720 here's

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790
different 18 I have 13 plus 720 here's
 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.160
different 18 I have 13 plus 720 here's
11 and 11 22 and you can see as it goes

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170
11 and 11 22 and you can see as it goes
 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.320
11 and 11 22 and you can see as it goes
down I sort of fill things out now what

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330
down I sort of fill things out now what
 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.240
down I sort of fill things out now what
you don't see from this picture so well

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
you don't see from this picture so well
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.490
you don't see from this picture so well
is that actually as the numbers get big

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
is that actually as the numbers get big
 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.010
is that actually as the numbers get big
there are really a lot of ways of

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020
there are really a lot of ways of
 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.660
there are really a lot of ways of
writing your numbers and sum of two

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670
writing your numbers and sum of two
 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.510
writing your numbers and sum of two
primes and in fact you can estimate how

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520
primes and in fact you can estimate how
 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.930
primes and in fact you can estimate how
many in a very crude simple-minded way

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940
many in a very crude simple-minded way
 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.790
many in a very crude simple-minded way
and it turns out to me that you're

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800
and it turns out to me that you're
 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.740
and it turns out to me that you're
really pretty close for big numbers so

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750
really pretty close for big numbers so
 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.620
really pretty close for big numbers so
let's let's do a little calculation one

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630
let's let's do a little calculation one
 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.420
let's let's do a little calculation one
of the most famous theorems in number

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430
of the most famous theorems in number
 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.910
of the most famous theorems in number
theory is the prime number theorem and

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920
theory is the prime number theorem and
 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.610
theory is the prime number theorem and
it says that the density of the primes

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620
