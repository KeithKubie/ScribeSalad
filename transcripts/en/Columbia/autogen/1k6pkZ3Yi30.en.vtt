thirty years ago etc that was not

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330
thirty years ago etc that was not
 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.170
thirty years ago etc that was not
necessarily true a long time ago but

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180
necessarily true a long time ago but
 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.290
necessarily true a long time ago but
it's become absolutely essential now and

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300
it's become absolutely essential now and
 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.340
it's become absolutely essential now and
the reason for it is that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350
the reason for it is that
 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.430
 
the media play a significantly bigger

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.790
the media play a significantly bigger

role in corporate control transactions
 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.120
role in corporate control transactions
one of the reasons for that I would

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130
one of the reasons for that I would
 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.610
one of the reasons for that I would
suggest is that corporate control

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620
suggest is that corporate control
 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.510
suggest is that corporate control
transactions have really changed in the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520
transactions have really changed in the
 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.760
transactions have really changed in the
last 30 years so back in 1985 the

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770
last 30 years so back in 1985 the
 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.220
last 30 years so back in 1985 the

it clear that poison pills are entirely
 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.380
it clear that poison pills are entirely
legitimate and the effect of that and

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390
legitimate and the effect of that and
 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.020
legitimate and the effect of that and

about the legal evolution in this area

opposed to the hostile takeover where

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950
opposed to the hostile takeover where

there were two thresholds which the

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450
there were two thresholds which the
 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.950
there were two thresholds which the
poison pill took place that it seems to

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960
poison pill took place that it seems to
 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.450
poison pill took place that it seems to
me that we may be in a moment

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460
me that we may be in a moment
 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.029
me that we may be in a moment
now we're Delaware law to be sure is now

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039
now we're Delaware law to be sure is now

now we're Delaware law to be sure is now
starting to try to try to grapple with

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169
starting to try to try to grapple with
 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:34.870
starting to try to try to grapple with
some of these defensive measures in the

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880
some of these defensive measures in the
 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.629
some of these defensive measures in the
context of activism as opposed to the

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639
context of activism as opposed to the
 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.120
context of activism as opposed to the
context of hostile bid how do you see

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130
context of hostile bid how do you see
 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.350
context of hostile bid how do you see
this playing out over the next couple of

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360
this playing out over the next couple of
 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.460
this playing out over the next couple of
years so I I don't see the courts

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470
years so I I don't see the courts
 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.520
years so I I don't see the courts
playing as big a role dealing with

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530
playing as big a role dealing with
 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.790
playing as big a role dealing with
shareholder activism and dealing with

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800
shareholder activism and dealing with
 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.620
shareholder activism and dealing with
elections and I don't see them playing

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630
elections and I don't see them playing
 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.839
elections and I don't see them playing
as big a role there as they did in the

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849
as big a role there as they did in the
 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.350
as big a role there as they did in the
M&amp;A context because when the courts

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360
M&amp;A context because when the courts
 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.700
M&amp;A context because when the courts
decided that they were going to let

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710
decided that they were going to let
 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.219
decided that they were going to let
boards adopt structural defenses that

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:03.229
boards adopt structural defenses that
 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:04.810
boards adopt structural defenses that
would be able to keep the company

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820
would be able to keep the company
 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.420
would be able to keep the company
independent unless the board decided to

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430
independent unless the board decided to
 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.070
independent unless the board decided to
sell the company i think that was done

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080
sell the company i think that was done
 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.830
sell the company i think that was done
cautiously with a view that they were

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840
cautiously with a view that they were
 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.290
cautiously with a view that they were
going to permit shareholders of the

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300
going to permit shareholders of the
 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.540
going to permit shareholders of the
franchise to have the ability to vote

the directors out of office if the

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680
the directors out of office if the
 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.770
the directors out of office if the
shareholders disagreed with what the

shareholders disagreed with what the
 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.180
shareholders disagreed with what the
board was doing and so I expect the

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190
board was doing and so I expect the
 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.950

Delaware courts although they're not

between the lines and some of the

friendly to activists but I don't

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080
friendly to activists but I don't
 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.010
friendly to activists but I don't

big companies use stock watch services I

00:31:02.339 --> 00:31:02.349
big companies use stock watch services I

big companies use stock watch services I
have no idea how those stock watch

00:31:04.289 --> 00:31:04.299
have no idea how those stock watch
 

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:07.879
have no idea how those stock watch
services work but I'm concerned that

they provide the information to the

00:31:14.849 --> 00:31:14.859
company and so I don't think it's a
 

00:31:14.859 --> 00:31:18.449

can say readable and and put them online

00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839
can say readable and and put them online
 

00:37:52.839 --> 00:37:55.650
can say readable and and put them online
in a way that that more people see them

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:55.660
in a way that that more people see them

conversation more but but so so i don't

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:01.750
conversation more but but so so i don't
 

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.599
