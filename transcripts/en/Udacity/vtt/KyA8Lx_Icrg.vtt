00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.493
Let's start with an example. Let's say your in the shower and as your turning

00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:08.074
the shower handle off and the water stops, the shower handle breaks off. Now

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.666
you immediately assess what this event means to you. You might become very

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.997
stressed out when you realize that your going to have to call a plumber, that's

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.106
going to be expensive, your going to have to make time to meet the plumber,

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:18.363
your going to have to clean your apartment to make it presentable, you had to

00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:20.657
find a place to put your cat, so the cat doesn't attack the plumber, when the

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:25.425
plumber comes in. And the list goes on, and on, and on, about what stress

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:29.398
results just from breaking off your shower handle. This was the primary

00:00:29.398 --> 00:00:32.302
appraisal, you quickly assessed what happened and your emotional response to

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:35.294
it, which most certainly would have been a negative emotional response, because

00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:40.069
you're stressed about everything you have to do, just to fix the shower handle.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.210
However, when this actually did happen to me, I stopped, took a second to think

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.452
about it, and my stress level actually decreased. First, I thought, this is a

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:53.568
great opportunity to get a new shower handle and new shower head. Second, I

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.192
thought, how lucky I was the shower handle didn't break off when the water was

00:00:56.192 --> 00:01:00.013
still running, because I don't know how to turn the water off in my apartment.

00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:02.418
So, I would've just been standing there with a broken shower handle in my hand,

00:01:02.418 --> 00:01:06.510
and the water just running, I wouldn't have known what to do. Third, I thought

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.030
that I needed to clean my apartment anyway, so this is a great opportunity to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.010
make it nice and presentable.
