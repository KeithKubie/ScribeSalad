00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.992
Now let us consider analogical transfer. So, given this target problem,

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:07.689
analogical retrieval has led to this source case.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.000
Given a model of the target problem and a model of the source case,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.860
analogical mapping has also occurred, correspondence has been established.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.270
This we now know that a king corresponds to the tumor, not to the patient.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.270
And that the rebel army corresponds to laser beam. For the source case we

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.930
also know the solution. The rebel army divided itself into smaller groups, and

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.670
the smaller groups all arrived at the fort at the same time. Now the question

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.421
becomes how can we transfer this solution to our original target problem.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.690
&gt;From the source case now, we're inducing a pattern of relationships, a strategy.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.583
In this case the pattern is that if there is a goal, capturing the king, and

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:54.560
a resource, the rebel army and an obstacle between the resource and the goal.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.970
They march on the road, then decompose the resource into several smaller

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.190
resources. And send them to the goal from different directions at the same time.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.420
This abstract pattern is now transferred to the target problem and instantiated.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.380
Because we know that the goal is the tumor, the resource is the laser gun, and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.670
the obstacle is the healthy tissue, we know what to do.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.720
We must decompose the resource, the laser gun, into smaller pieces,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.740
smaller, less intense laser beams, and send them to the tumor, the goal,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.620
at the same time from different directions. This is how we can transfer

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.355
the problem solving strategy, from the source case to the target problem.

00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:38.650
Note that this transfer depended upon the correct mapping,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.510
the correct alignment between the target problem and the source case,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.240
which in turn depended upon the retrieval of the source case corresponding to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.300
this target problem. Note the important rule or goal here. The goal was to

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.310
capture the king. So this is an example of pragmatic similarity. With a lot of

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.410
similarities at the level of the goal, capturing the king, curing the tumor.
