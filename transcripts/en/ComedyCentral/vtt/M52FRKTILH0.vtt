00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.969
So, this week....

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:07.373
this week, America chose
our next president-- a hat.

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.442
(laughter)

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:11.444
If that's not disturbing enough,
we just realized that

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.880
while we were immersed
in the year-long Army crawl

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.482
through diarrhea
that was the 2016 campaign,

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.051
that really kind of feels like,

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.386
"All that (bleep)
Andy Dufresne crawled through

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.321
-to get out of prison."
-(laughter)

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:24.624
There was a bunch
of piping-hot fire emoji

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.593
content from the World Wide Web
that we didn't get to cover,

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.695
like Vladimir Putin
awarding Steven Seagal

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:32.198
-Russian citizenship, huh?
-(audience groaning)

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.400
And you didn't even know.
Now you do.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.437
This daring heist to steal 50
grand worth of bull semen, huh?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.372
(laughter and groaning)

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:40.807
Very exciting.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.909
I hope it was already
out of the bull

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.644
-when they tried to steal it.
-(laughter)

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.814
And this nightmare-inducing
Lego man cosplay.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.449
(laughter and groaning)

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.819
This looks like
a Batman villain happened.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:56.756
It was just like he fell
into a vat at the Lego factory,

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.025
and then became this guy.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.194
So, tonight, we're gonna revisit
some of the comedy gold

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.795
we failed to mine
during the election

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.097
because we're pretty
(bleep) tired

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.598
about talking
about this (bleep) election.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.600
Like, we totally
missed this one.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.268
-(person clapping) -Elon Musk...
Thank you, one guy.

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.937
-We totally missed...
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.238
Elon Musk...

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:15.575
I know, you guys want
to still keep talking about it.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.176
Elon Musk, the handsome
billionaire inventor

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.811
who's one-accident-in-a-lab fire
away

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:20.279
from being
his own origin story...

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:21.948
Maybe he's that guy.
I don't know.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.650
Maybe... maybe this is Elon
Musk, 2025. We don't know.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.886
But he said
that we are definitely living

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.688
in a Matrix-style simulation.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.090
<i> The Telegraph</i> quoted him
as saying, "Maybe we should be

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.459
"hopeful this is a simulation
because otherwise,

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:36.329
"we're gonna create simulations
indistinguishable from reality,

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.564
or civilization ceases
to exist."

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.366
So, let me ask you this.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.002
If this is a simulated reality,

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:47.073
why in the world would someone
virtually create

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.342
-this, a blobfish? Why?
-KIRKMAN: Ah.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.477
-(laughter and groaning)
-HARDWICK: Why?

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.879
And why does it look so sad?

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.947
-It's like a...
-(laughter)

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.483
It's like a grumpy catfish,
or...

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.186
or he looks like the Ziggy
comics, but, like, really old.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.755
-(laughter)
-I think Elon Musk

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.223
could be onto something
with the<i> Matrix</i> theory.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:07.260
So, comedians, what other movie
could we use to explain reality?

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.529
Jen Kirkman.

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.297
Um,<i> Back to the Future, </i>
because the Cubs won,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.132
a fascist is running things,
and hoverboards look stupid.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:16.068
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.303
Points. Points.

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:20.206
It's technically
<i> Back to the Future II,</i>

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.542
-but that's all right.
-(laughter)

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.744
-KIRKMAN: Sorry.
-Sean.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.979
Uh,<i> Gigli,</i> because it sucks,
and I make no money.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:28.814
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.683
Matt Braunger.

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:33.586
In two years,<i> The Hunger Games. </i>
Right now,<i> Titanic.</i>

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.588
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(audience groaning, applause)

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.991
"Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure
working with you."

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.494
-(Hardwick humming like violin)
-Let's hope...

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:44.630
(laughter)

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:47.333
(imitates water gurgling)

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:49.832
-(laughter)
-(imitates water gurgling)
