00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.000
male narrator: When it comes
to making money from your app,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.900
always start
by focusing on quality.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.133
A high-quality app
will get better ratings,

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.800
which will lead to
more downloads,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.100
which will result in
more revenue.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.866
Here are ten tips
that successful developers use

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.700
once their app is ready.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.533
The developer console
can automatically convert

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.233
your app price
to local currencies worldwide,

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.900
but exchange rates don't reflect
local expectations

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.400
and purchasing power,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.200
so research
local economic conditions

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.833
and interests thoroughly.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.500
If you think users may be put
off by the price of your app,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.833
but you know they'll see
the value in it once they're in,

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.700
make it free to download
and try the app.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.333
After a set time, you can offer
them a one-time purchase

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.200
to unlock the app forever.

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.766
A free app is a great way
to overcome any barriers

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.133
created by price,

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.200
and you can offer extras
to users for a price

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.666
once they're engaged.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.566
Create a free app
with core features

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.866
to engage the user

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.800
and then offer extended features
using in-app purchases

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.366
such as removing ads,

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.400
adding enhanced functionality,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.466
adding in-game items.

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.700
As an alternative to selling
digital goods in your apps,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.533
particularly where you have
recurring content costs,

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:31.066
you can sell content and
features with a subscription.

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.866
You can offer your users
a free trial to introduce them,

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.966
followed by
a recurring subscription

00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.600
at a variety of intervals,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.300
like weekly, monthly,
or annually.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.133
If you offer a subscription
in your app,

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.433
providing users with additional
content or features on your site

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:49.833
can add value
to your subscription

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.433
and make it more appealing.

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:53.033
Sign users into your website

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.766
and then verify their
Google Play subscription details

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:59.033
to enable features
or content on the web.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.966
Google Analytics provides
invaluable information

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:06.033
on the behavior of users
in your app.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.600
You can use behavior flows

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.766
to understand how users are
navigating through your app

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.266
and where they drop off.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.400
This information can help
e-commerce apps

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.866
optimize purchase flow

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.266
or game app developers see
which levels are too difficult

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.166
and when players
should be offered help.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:23.333
You can use this information to
make your app experience better,

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.500
while increasing conversions
of install to paying users.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.133
Users can discover your app
in many ways

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.300
and now you can find out
exactly which source

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.833
is proving the most effective.

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:39.166
The user acquisition performance
report in the developer console

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:41.700
will show you how many users
visit your store listing,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.633
how many go on
to install your app,

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:45.000
and how many make purchases.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.300
You'll see where your most
valuable users come from

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.733
so you know where to focus
your efforts.

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:54.433
Users who are already familiar
with your apps

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:57.266
are great prospects
for your other offerings.

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.933
If you generate revenue
from displaying AdMob ads

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.266
in your apps,

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.400
you can take advantage
of the House Ads feature,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.066
which lets you take part
of your advertising inventory

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:09.833
and use that to cross-promote
your own apps and games.

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:15.233
Users who have already bought
in-app products

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.400
are good prospects
for future purchases,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.133
so let them know
what's on offer.

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.133
Do this using free AdMob
House Ads.

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:23.866
Create in-app House Ads

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.833
and AdMob will automatically
figure out

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.100
which of your users
are likely to spend

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.533
and show them these ads.

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:33.266
AdMob will continue to show
standard ads to other users.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.900
Retaining your existing users

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.166
can be an effective use
of marketing dollars.

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:42.400
With AdWords reengagement
campaigns,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.033
you can reach users
who have installed your app

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.400
but not used it lately,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.900
or active users who haven't
fully explored it yet.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.533
As users search Google,

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:51.400
AdWords displays your ads
to them

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.266
so you can remind them
of key features

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.500
or show them special offers.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.866
And with app indexing,

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:58.566
you can link the user to the
specific page in your app

00:03:58.566 --> 00:03:59.966
that's relevant to them.

00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:01.333

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:03.433
