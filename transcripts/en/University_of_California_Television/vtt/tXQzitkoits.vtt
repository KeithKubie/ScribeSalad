there are actually two speakers here. I'm

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.530
going to speak out of both sides of my
mouth. The other speaker listed here is

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:19.480
Carol Padden who was summoned to
Sacramento in her deaconal duties. And so,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.160
Carol asked me to present the work. Carol
and I have known each other since she was

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.860
a toddler and we've been doing this. This
particular work is joint work of a large

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.280
number of people spread around the world
and I happen to be the other member of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.010
this group present here and so I've been
given this honor. Here are some of the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.280
other places. There's UCSD here of course,
Tufts University in Boston, and the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.910
University of Haifa in Israel. If you look
very carefully, you can see me. Let me

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.460

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:13.830
years has been to drive the van because
that's a man's job and that's what I do.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.270
Okay. I'll talk very briefly about sign
languages of the world. First really most

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.860
important thing is that there is no single
universal sign language. There are many

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.510
sign languages and we've actually learned
a little bit about Nicaraguan sign

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.780
language. Sign languages in general are
young languages. They're usually small

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.890
languages. There are some very large ones
like American sign language, but American

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.320
sign language or Japanese sign language,
those are actually atypical in terms of

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.830
their size. What are these languages used
for? Well, they're used for social

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.290
communication like any other language.
Most sign languages are actually quite

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.260
young. The ones we're going to be talking
about are very new and were actually

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.040
created spontaneously in much the same way
as Nicaraguan sign language.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.110
Others, the oldest sign language for which
we have actual records is French sign

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.730
language from which American sign language
comes. But we actually have records from

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.500
classical Greek times indicating that
people were signing back the. And there is

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.590
a wonderful picture that I don't have here
of a Greek vase that seems to indicate

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.670
people signing thousands of years ago.
Most sign languages are fairly small

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.840
languages and those are the ones that
we're going to be kind of concentrating on

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.240
here. We're also interested in new sign
languages, sign languages that are

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.310
emerging, and this is very much within the
spirit of what we're talking about here.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.300
You can actually watch languages evolve.
You can't watch language as a human

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.290
ability evolve, but individual languages
you can actually watch. Now, these new

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:15.140
sign languages they're created under a
variety of conditions, villages, schools,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.260
wherever deaf people can find each other,
they will pretty much create a sign

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.170
language. And the patterns that how these
sign languages are transmitted, vary quite

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.810
widely among each other. But what really
matters is that sign languages usually

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:40.810
start off as being iconic. So we're very
much within some of the stuff that Kenny

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:48.610
showed you, where you start off with some
sort of iconic patterns. Eventually they

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.000
become less iconic and this is something I
could show you examples of later. It's

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.390
really quite wonderful. But they are all
built on the resources of the body, so

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.280
people have a body and they use this
physical body in order to communicate

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.820
visually with one another.
All right. Sign languages of the world,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.480
there are many and there are many
different types. Home sign, this is the

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.290
language of the individual who grows up in
a household where everyone else is

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.280
hearing. There are family sign languages.
A case that's just emerged recently is

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.760
something that's called natural sign
language. It's just a sign language that

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.060
has grown up in Nepal, among a community
of people. It's called natural because it

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.220
grew up by itself, not under any kind of
forced circumstances. Village sign

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.180
languages, that's a very recent, I'd say
the last 20 years or so people have begun

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.780
interested in that and our work basically
is we work with village sign languages.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.380
And then of course, the Nicaraguan sign
language which grew up in a near urban

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.780
environment but which is also very new.
The point is there are these many, many

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:16.610
different kinds of sign languages.
So our question is, well, how did they get

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:24.090
that way? We know what they're for and we
know quite vividly as we've seen examples

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.580
alread, these people can communicate quite
well. But how did they get there? And how

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.910
did they get there so quickly? Even the
youngest sign languages have grammatical

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.320
categories. They have fairly well defined
word orders. They have modifiers, these

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:51.370
kind of trappings of fully evolved sign
languages. So how did they get there?

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.580
Well, the way they get there is basically
as we said by using the body and

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.000
originally by using the body in iconic
ways.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:09.430
Now I'm going to talking to you about a
very, very small type of organization, but

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:16.930
I think it is emblematic of how sign
languages can use iconic patterns to

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:25.530
organize themselves. Okay. So we have to
make a distinction between two different

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:31.740
types of iconicity. I'll get to you in a
second how that works. So, what we're

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.050
going to do is we're kind of combining, I
think, two of the sorts of presentations

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.360
that you've seen here. We're going to be
looking at gesturers, non-signing hearing

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:54.040
gestures, and we're going to compare what
their gestures look like with the signs of

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:01.380
signers of new sign languages. In this
particular test, we're going to

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.070
concentrate on a fairly narrow task in
which we ask people, both hearing

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:13.220
gesturers and signers, to identify objects
in a picture task. So we show them a

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.000
picture and then we just ask them to
describe that picture.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:23.620
For the hearing people we just say,
"Please gesture. Do not speak." And for

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:30.830
the signers we just ask them to sign the
thing for us. Okay, so that's the task. We

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.700
showed them pictures of tools and you'll
see why it's important. We vary the number

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.320
of tools so they don't worry about whether
the task, we kind of are distracting them

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.100
in a way. So they think we care about how
many but we don't really care about how

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.970
many. We just care about what it is. All
right. Now, very important point, we're

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.400
going to distinguish two types of
iconicity. The first we're calling here

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.980
imagistic iconicity and that is simply to
depict something.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.730
But what we're really interested in is
patterned iconicity and this is again

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:15.670
within the spirit of what you've seen so
far today. The point is that when

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:21.900
languages emerge, patterns emerge, right?
So we're interested in the emergence of

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.980
patterns. We'll see here that this is a
very surprising pattern that's going to

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:34.610
emerge here and it's very small. It's not
a big pattern, just a small pattern. But I

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:41.070
hope you'll see that it's a pretty cool
pattern. Okay, all right. So, what we're

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:48.600
going to show you is we show a picture of
three paintbrushes and we asked UCSD

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.695
undergraduates to depict those in gesture.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.207
You can see what they're depicting

00:11:09.207 --> 00:11:16.240
is how the hand holds the object, that's
what they're doing, right? So these are

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.674
handling.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:31.500
They're not very well dressed
but we'll have to ignore that. Your basic

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:45.230
UCSD undergraduates.
This guy is quite animated. All right. So

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.890
everybody sees what they do. Now what
we're going to do is we're going to show

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:57.540
you the same task except these are young
signers of Al-Sayyid Bedouin sign language

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.310
which we have talked about at previous
CARTA meetings.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:10.830
This is a brand new sign language that was
created in an isolated Bedouin village by

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:17.030
a population initially of four siblings.
This is a village with a very high rate of

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:24.570
recessive deafness. Okay. And you're going
to see a big difference. What you're going

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.830
to see is that these people don't just
depict how you handle the object, but they

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:36.730
actually show what the shape of this tool
is, right? All of them. And by the way, we

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:52.280
haven't selected this. This is what they
do. People of different ages. Oh, let me

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.890
ask this question, did anybody notice the
word order difference between the two

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:04.310
populations? Right. So the UCSD
undergraduates do the number first and

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:09.580
then the thing and the Bedouin signers do
the thing first and then the number. So

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.310
they actually have a different word order
which I think is very cool. That's the

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:21.260
sort of thing that linguists think is
cool, right? Okay.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.260
So we have these two terms. We have this
term handling to talk about what people

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.380
are doing and then we have this term
instrument to talk about showing the

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.880
actual thing. So what we're going to show
you is there's actually a difference

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.730
between the two groups. Basically, the
gesturers concentrate on simply the

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:48.150
handling, how you use it whereas the
signers will depict this as an instrument.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.080
In other words, they show you how you use
it but they're most interested in how to

00:13:53.260 --> 00:14:02.000
depict what the thing is. Okay. All right.
And we're looking at this in terms of a

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:11.340
pattern of iconicity that these things
share. Okay. All right. And you can see

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:20.140
this, actually not just across communities
but even within a community. So what we

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:29.940
have here is a hearing Bedouin gesturer
and he will tend to use the handling

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:37.880
whereas the deaf member of the same
community will also depict the object as

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:49.340
an instrument. Handling versus instrument.
Okay. Now, question is do we get

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:55.510
differences across groups? And that is of
course what happens. So here are hearing

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:01.230
Americans. They are overwhelmingly
handling, hearing Bedouins show almost the

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:10.120
same distribution. Here is the Bedouin
signers, right? The opposite. And guess

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:18.150
what, we get almost the same pattern for
American sign language. So hearing

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:27.500
gesturers concentrate on handling whereas
the deaf signers concentrate on the

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.910
instruments. And again we've given you the
same graph but in a slightly different

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:38.560
format to see how this works. Okay. Now
I'm going to show you another experiment

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:49.810
that actually I think gives you maybe a
slightly more subtle insight into how all

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:56.420
of this works. So what we do in this
experiment is we compare responses to

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:03.220
pictures with responses to video clips.
By the way, just a small autobiographical

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.360
point here, we used to use pictures all
the time when we first went into the

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:13.290
Bedouin village. We would just show people
pictures and the older Bedouin signers

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.530
really had no idea what to do. And we
thought that, "Well, it's just a picture.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.400
Doesn't everybody know how to name a
picture? I mean, after all, you do that at

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.600
first grade." And then it suddenly
emerged. "Duh, first grade. These people

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.130
never got to first grade."
It turns out that picture naming is a

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:36.040
learned kind of task. There's nothing
natural about naming pictures. People

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.750
living out there in the wild don't have
pictures that they could point at. So this

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:50.350
was really a lesson, a cross-cultural
lesson, to us. We were interested in

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:56.050
whether simply showing people a static
picture versus showing people a video

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.880
would have an effect. And of course it
did, otherwise we wouldn't bother to show

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:08.200
it to you, right? Okay. So this is what we
showed people. So here is simply a brush

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:16.837
and here is a video clip of somebody using
the brush.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:24.290
Everybody sees that? Okay. And we compare
people's responses to those and it is of

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:30.540
course actually what you might expect. So
when you show people a video, even

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:40.300
gesturers, they're much more likely to use
handling. But when you show gesturers a

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:49.150
picture then they are much more likely to
use instruments. Now a little bit of

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:58.820
tortured reasoning here, but the fact that
they were responding so overwhelmingly to

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.410
the handling response, the gesturers were
responding so overwhelmingly to the

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:10.420
handling response even with the pictures,
shows you that there is this major

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:18.620
difference between how the gesturers are
organizing their signal and how the

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.040
signers are organizing their symbol,
right.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:29.960
So what we see is that there is this
difference, right? That it's been somehow

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:37.820
conventionalized and amplified in this one
sign language which is the Bedouin sign

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.430
language and even more so in the sign
language, in American sign language. I'm

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.440
not going to talk about it here, but it
turns out that when you look at other sign

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.690
languages, we looked at Israeli sign
language, it doesn't work that way. So I

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.720
think what's going on is that signers pick
up, they pick up on these patterns, this

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:04.400
is what we've seen before in earlier
presentations. They're picking up on these

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:10.670
patterns and what matters more is the
consistency of the abstract underlying

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:17.064
pattern.
This is a very abstract notion of handling

00:19:17.064 --> 00:19:22.375
versus also depicting the instrument that
they are picking up on. And, by the way,

00:19:22.375 --> 00:19:28.430
when you show people pieces of fruit, this
doesn't happen because of course pieces of

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:40.332
fruit are not instruments, at least
not usually. Okay. All right. I think the

00:19:40.332 --> 00:19:46.918
one takeaway lesson that is really
important is that people have a drive to

00:19:46.918 --> 00:19:52.509
communicate. We've talked about this. They
have a drive to share which Tecumseh Fitch

00:19:52.509 --> 00:19:59.204
coined this wonderful German word which is
mitteilungsbedürfnis which. . . only in

00:19:59.204 --> 00:20:03.449
German, right? But it basically means a
need to share. And what we're seeing in

00:20:03.449 --> 00:20:09.804
all of these cases is that you can
increase the power of your sharing by

00:20:09.804 --> 00:20:15.650
organizing your system and that's what is
going on here. So, thank you, and Carol

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.443
thanks you as well.
