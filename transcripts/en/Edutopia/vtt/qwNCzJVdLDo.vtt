00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:15.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like many
of his classmates

00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:18.926
at the Boston Arts Academy,
Marvin Balan is a gifted musician.

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:23.496
&gt;&gt;Student band: [playing Jazz]

00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:27.946
&gt;&gt;Ironically his passion for music
grew out of his dread of math class.

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:31.946
&gt;&gt;Marvin: I was in sixth grade
and a couple friends of mine,

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:34.296
they was like "Oh, guess what?

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:36.836
I get to miss math class for music."

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:38.166
And I'm like "Really?"

00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:42.606
So, and so I was like "So
who's the music teacher again?"

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:45.756
And so I will go up to him like
wondering if I could participate

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:48.566
in the band, and in my head I'm just
like so I can get out of math class.

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.356
The funny thing is I
love math nowadays.

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.976
&gt;&gt;More than one third of
incoming freshmen test

00:00:56.976 --> 00:01:00.686
at least two years below
grade level, but as seniors,

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:04.646
97 percent of them graduate
and go on to college.

00:01:04.826 --> 00:01:06.776
&gt;&gt;Up, push through.

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:11.436
&gt;&gt;The intention behind this school
is to take their main passion

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:13.666
and to say okay, now you've got this.

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.096
&gt;&gt;We'll grow this with you.

00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:19.466
We'll allow you to use this, but we
still want you to do the literacy,

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.826
the numeracy, the science,
the humanities,

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:22.796
all of those other things.

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:25.296
&gt;&gt;There's a number of
experiments that was conducted

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:28.566
in which they found that the
temporal lobe which is the side

00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:32.786
of the brain right here is
responsible for processing the music.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:39.586
&gt;&gt;I wouldn't say that my dance
is separate from my academics.

00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:40.556
&gt;&gt;I guess it makes everything,

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:43.886
it makes the whole high
school experience easier

00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:44.636
because you're doing--

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:46.976
you're learning and you're
also doing what you love.

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:56.566
&gt;&gt;Apollo: [singing "Unforgettable"]

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Only 25
percent of those who try

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.976
out pass the artistic audition.

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:03.546
[singing "Unforgettable"]

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:09.096
&gt;&gt;Once accepted, they choose a major:
visual arts, theater, music or dance

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.916
and spend the next four
years honing their skills

00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:14.276
for several hours each day on top

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:16.256
of the school's rigorous
academic program.

00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:18.916
&gt;&gt;We're going to continue
our South Africa unit today.

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:21.516
&gt;&gt;I think our school
works because for

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.806
at least half the day
students feel successful.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:27.736
If a student is struggling
in my academic class,

00:02:28.256 --> 00:02:30.556
I can go down the hall
to his or her arts block

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:32.056
and see them being that genius.

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:37.446
So the trick is to use that
artistic passion and power

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:41.976
to get them through their academics.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.436
&gt;&gt;One of the values, the main
values that I see in music for all

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.356
of our students are some of the
life skills that it teaches you.

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:51.976
I mean you can't be a good musician
without practice, without discipline,

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.586
without responsibility,
without dedication,

00:02:54.586 --> 00:02:56.656
without all of those things.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.986
&gt;&gt;I really just walked in with my
eyes closed hoping that I was going

00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:05.776
to meet you know some teachers that
would really just help me to grow

00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:08.846
as a person, as a leader,
and as a musician.

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:11.096
Luckily for me I found
that in both aspects

00:03:11.096 --> 00:03:14.226
of my academics and my music classes.

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:16.266
&gt;&gt;Think slowing down
and really be thoughtful

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:17.496
about what note you're going to do.

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:20.106
Because you only have
to do like half-steps.

00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:24.356
&gt;&gt;Arts is important to keep
students engaged, number one,

00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:28.646
but arts for artistic
students is a way of being.

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:30.516
Is a way of thinking.

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:40.496
And art isn't, instead
of math, art is math.

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:43.626
If you look at for example what
our visual artists are doing

00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:46.786
with perspective and
design that is math.

00:03:47.106 --> 00:03:50.196
&gt;&gt;No matter what major they
pursue, students are held

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.616
to high standards here
in arts and academics.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.456
&gt;&gt;The idea is good so
you want to make sure

00:03:55.456 --> 00:03:56.906
that you don't lose momentum.

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:59.786
&gt;&gt;I think too many people make
the standards lower for students

00:03:59.786 --> 00:04:01.786
who actually need higher standards.

00:04:02.246 --> 00:04:04.536
They need more support to get
to those higher standards,

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:05.666
but they need higher standards

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:08.336
because the world keeps
making the standard higher.

00:04:08.526 --> 00:04:10.196
The jobs that they need in order

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:15.016
to pay their bills require higher
standards evermore increasingly,

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:18.186
and these students really
need to be challenged.

00:04:18.186 --> 00:04:20.876
And even in their personal
development they need higher

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:23.326
standards and they need to
internalize the principle of rigor.

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:25.866
&gt;&gt;A little bit-- challenge
yourselves a little bit quicker.

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:26.936
One and two and uh-uh-uh.

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:30.436
&gt;&gt;We do music that
oftentimes is more advanced

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:33.956
than what the students are capable
of doing and that's on purpose.

00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:37.386
We do that so that-- so the kids
can see that with hard work,

00:04:37.386 --> 00:04:40.026
with dedication, with all of
those adjectives that you use,

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:45.286
that they can go, they can succeed,
and they can create excellence.

00:04:45.286 --> 00:04:45.846
&gt;&gt;That was great.

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:48.686
You notice how easy it was
to come in when you do that?

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:49.406
Oh, Beautiful.

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:53.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In order to graduate,
students must write a grant proposal

00:04:53.366 --> 00:04:55.566
for their senior portfolio project

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:59.786
that ties together their artistic
passion with a community service.

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:04.796
&gt;&gt;They propose some artistic
community service project

00:05:04.796 --> 00:05:06.406
and they must present it-

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:10.206
&gt;&gt;The real way which is by
putting together a budget,

00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:13.136
putting together a presentation,
putting together a visual

00:05:13.136 --> 00:05:14.556
and selling it to funders.

00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:18.196
And the point of that is
that that's a way to assess

00:05:18.486 --> 00:05:23.006
and to understand real knowledge and
those skills are just as important

00:05:23.206 --> 00:05:26.066
as anything that you would
assess through a bubble.

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:33.196
&gt;&gt;I will create art in the future
that is a representation of me,

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:39.056
my culture, my political views
and everything that has to do

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:43.066
with what I think about life.

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:47.286
&gt;&gt;A big part of our thesis for why
this school works is art is a power

00:05:47.756 --> 00:05:51.586
in society and students who
find their power as artists,

00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:53.896
go on to be powerful
members of society.

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:03.106
&gt;&gt;If you want to get something done
in the world you need to be able

00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:07.876
to not only have something to
say but have a way to say it

00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:10.946
and make sure that you're heard.

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:13.496
