00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.160
Two of the points that define
a certain quadrilateral

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.250
are 0 comma 9 and 3 comma 4.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.960
The quadrilateral is left
unchanged by a reflection

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.400
over the line y is
equal to 3 minus x.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.124
Draw and classify
the quadrilateral.

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:19.790
Now, I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.760
and try to draw and
classify it on your own

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.230
before I'm about to explain it.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.880
So let's at least plot the
information they give us.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.400
So the point 0
comma 9, that's one

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.160
of the vertices of
the quadrilateral.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.360
So 0 comma 9.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.450
That's that point
right over there.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.290
And another one of the
vertices is 3 comma 4.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.850
That's that right over there.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.020
And then they tell us
that the quadrilateral

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.200
is left unchanged by reflection
over the line y is equal to

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.000
3 minus x.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.890
So when x is 0, y is 3--
that's our y-intercept--

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.810
and it has a slope
of negative 1.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.290
You could view
this as 3 minus 1x.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.640
So it has a slope of negative 1.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.690
So the line looks like this.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.250
So every time we increase our
x by 1, we decrease our y by 1.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.260
So the line looks something like
this. y is equal to 3 minus x.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.180
Try to draw it relatively,
pretty carefully.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210
So that's what it looks like.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.320
y is equal to 3 minus x.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.240
So that's my best attempt
at drawing it. y is equal to

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.430
3 minus x.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.650
So the quadrilateral is
left unchanged by reflection

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.490
over this.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.999
So that means if I were to
reflect each of these vertices,

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.540
I would, essentially,
end up with one

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.415
of the other vertices
on it, and if those get

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:42.498
reflected you're going to
end up with one of these

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.600
so the thing is not
going to be different.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.660
So let's think about
where these other two

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.670
vertices of this
quadrilateral need to be.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.420
So this point, let's just
reflect it over this line,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.150
over y is equal to 3 minus x.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.090
So if we were to try to drop
a perpendicular to this line--

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.860
notice, we have gone
diagonally across one,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.830
two, three of
these squares so we

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.580
need to go diagonally
across three of them

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.039
on the left-hand side.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.830
So one, two, three gets
us right over there.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.010
This is the reflection of
this point across that line.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.970
Now, let's do the same
thing for this blue point.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.560
To drop a perpendicular
to this line,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.410
we have to go diagonally
across two of these squares.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.690
So let's go diagonally across
two more of these squares just

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.740
like that to get to that
point right over there.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.370
And now we've defined
our quadrilateral.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.970
Our quadrilateral
looks like this.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.940
Both of these lines
are perpendicular

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.600
to that original
line, so they're

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.210
going to have the same slope.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.090
So that line is parallel
to that line over there.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.850
And then we have this line
and then we have this line.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.940
So what type of
quadrilateral is this?

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.260
Well, I have one pair
of parallel sides,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.200
so this is a trapezoid.
