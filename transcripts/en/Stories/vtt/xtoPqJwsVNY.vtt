00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.070
INTERVIEWER: The Charles Bridge
in Prague, Czech Republic,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.320
is one of the more
heavily trafficked tourist

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.630
destinations in central Europe.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.480
Each year countless visitors
walk across the bridge,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.820
take pictures of the ornate
statues lining the causeway,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.270
and move on.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.600
But this picture is
a little different.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.720
It's a photo that tells
the story of Prague's

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.390
tumultuous history through
the eyes of one man for whom

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.160
that history was
very real, and it's

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.480
a photo 44 years in the taking.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.693
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.330
This is the man in question.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.210
ROMAN BOED: Hello.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.670
My name is Roman Boed.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.100
I'm an international lawyer
and an amateur photographer

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.770
living in the Netherlands.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.240
I was born in the predecessor
to the Czech Republic,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.740
Czechoslovakia,
during communism.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.970
When I was 14, I escaped
with a part of my family,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.270
becoming a refugee and
leaving the rest of my family

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.654
and my friends behind.

00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:58.320
INTERVIEWER: Roman
fled his home country

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.550
and its oppressive
communist government.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.940
There had been a few attempts to
push back against that regime.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.740
The Prague Spring in
1968 saw a new leader

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.590
trying to democratize
the government

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.770
and give the people
more personal freedom,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.900
but that was quickly stamped out
when the Soviet Union enacted

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.100
the Brezhnev Doctrine,
which gave them the right

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.280
to intervene in any
Eastern Bloc country

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.750
with capitalist sympathies.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.080
The Soviets and their allies
launched a bloody invasion.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.730
Times were dark, and Roman's
family felt the strain.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.020
ROMAN BOED: I left
Czechoslovakia in 1979.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.910
My father, who traveled
abroad as part of his work

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.260
as an engineer, was increasingly
pressured by the secret police

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.220
to collaborate with
them, to report

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.760
what he had seen in the West,
and with whom he met and spoke.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.630
He knew that refusing
collaboration

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.680
would set the regime
against him and his family,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.710
so he decided to escape.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.470
He didn't tell me
all this until we

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.760
were on our way in
neighboring Hungary.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.760
There he explained
to me his decision

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.930
and gave me the choice to
return to Czechoslovakia alone

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.280
to join my mother and brother
or continue as refugee with him

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.080
and my sister.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.930
INTERVIEWER: Roman
continued with his father

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.680
and found refuge at the Austrian
consulate in Yugoslavia,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.420
but he didn't forget
about his home.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.090
As a refugee, he kept a close
watch on Czechoslovakia,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.370
waiting for something
good to happen.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.240
And 18 years later while he
was living in Chicago, it did.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.900
ROMAN BOED: You can imagine how
transfixed I was by the news

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.010
when I started to hear
about demonstrations

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.450
against the communist
regime in the fall of 1989.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.310
INTERVIEWER: This was
the Velvet Revolution,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.460
which started as a small
peaceful student protest

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.680
but soon became violent at
the hands of the police, which

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.690
in turn fueled outrage.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.600
A half a million people
joined the movement.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.800
A week later, 75% of the country
went on a general strike,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.392
and the communist regime was
finally forced to step down.

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:53.100
ROMAN BOED: I returned
for the first time

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.490
13 years later with
my fiance Molly

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.580
after the fall of
the communist regime.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.654
It was the first time I saw my
mother and my brother again.

00:03:01.654 --> 00:03:04.070
INTERVIEWER: And for Roman,
that homecoming meant a return

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.840
to the Charles Bridge too.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.480
ROMAN BOED: Since then, Molly
and I and our three sons

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.600
return to the Czech
Republic often,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.680
always visiting
Prague and always

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.750
making it a point to
visit the bridge, which

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.360
seems like the center
of the whole country.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.950
The fog made the
streets look and feel

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.080
monochrome, just the way
Prague lives in my mind

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.679
and the way I had imagined it
all those years I could not

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:25.178
visit.

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:30.820
INTERVIEWER: Of course,
the spirit of protest

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.600
is very much alive today.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.780
It just looks a
little different.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.660
Check out this next video
on protest in London

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.740
that may or may not be
over a bowl of cereal.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.410
[VIDEO PLAYBACK] So now imagine
walking down a street at night

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.440
in one of the most
vibrant city in the world,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.410
only to find it's eerily quiet.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.900
There are no lights on in the
houses because, well, nobody

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.580
is home.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.471
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:56.720
INTERVIEWER: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.553
Thanks for watching.
