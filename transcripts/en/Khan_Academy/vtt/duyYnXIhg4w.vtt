00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.790
- [Voiceover] Now that
we've read this passage,

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.530
let's see if we can answer the questions.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.630
So the first question:

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.150
The stance Jordan takes in the passage

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.830
is best described as that of

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.550
an idealist setting forth principles.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.270
Now that seems actually not too bad.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.290
She talks about that
it's actually the role

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.570
of the congress to be the inquisitors,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.770
the role to kind of impeach the President,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.731
but sets up principles
when it's appropriate

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.610
and when it's not.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.910
It shouldn't be for petty reasons.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.190
It shouldn't be for party reasons.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.950
It shouldn't be just
because the President,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.330
the Congress thinks the
President did a bad job.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.470
It should be for major offenses,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.350
gross crimes and misdemeanors,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.110
so that's actually seems pretty good.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.970
Let's see these other ones.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.010
An advocate seeking a
compromised position.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.470
There was nothing about this speech

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.850
that seemed like a compromise.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.970
She seemed like she was
stating some principles

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.370
and in a fairly strong way.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.270
An observer striving for neutrality.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.030
There is an aspect where she kind of says,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.510
"Look, this shouldn't be
about partisan bickering

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.450
"or, or, or about pettiness,"

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.070
so there is an element of,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.530
and she wants to be solemn

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.490
so she definitely wants to be neutral

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.370
in that she wants to take it seriously

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.330
but she also says, I mean
this is her first line,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.290
"Today, I am an inquisitor."

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.450
These are the people who are investigating

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.050
and might be accusing someone.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.550
And she also says, "And I
am not going to sit here

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.930
"and be an idle spectator."

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.090
That's what an observer is.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.750
An observer would be an idle spectator.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.930
She's not doing that, she's taking action.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.074
She is an inquisitor so I think

00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:45.844
because she's being so active,

00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:47.324
I think, and frankly idealist,

00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:49.844
I think this first A is a better choice.

00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:52.664
C, you know, I had to
think about it for a second

00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:54.504
but A feels better.

00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:56.925
A scholar researching a
historical controversy.

00:01:56.925 --> 00:02:00.244
No way, she's in, she's in it right now

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:01.544
and she's not a scholar.

00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:04.804
She's an active participant in the events

00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:06.104
and it's not a historical event.

00:02:06.104 --> 00:02:07.784
It's happening as she's speaking.

00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:09.244
Let's go to the next question.

00:02:11.554 --> 00:02:14.907
The main rhetorical effect of
the series of three phases,

00:02:15.897 --> 00:02:18.357
of three phrases in
lines five through six,

00:02:18.357 --> 00:02:22.177
the diminution, the subversion,
the destruction is to.

00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:24.797
So this is here, "And I
am not going to sit here

00:02:24.797 --> 00:02:27.677
"and be an idle spectator
to the diminution,

00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:31.417
"the subversion, the destruction
of the Constitution."

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.198
She's not messing around.

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:36.697
Convey with increasing
intensity the seriousness

00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:39.596
of the threat Jordan
sees to the Constitution.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.436
That looks pretty good.

00:02:41.436 --> 00:02:42.779
She's saying, "I'm not going to sit here

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.116
"and be an idle spectator
to the diminution,

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:48.276
"the subversion, the destruction
of the Constitution."

00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:50.317
So that seems like she's,

00:02:50.317 --> 00:02:53.237
she wants to communicate the intensity,

00:02:53.237 --> 00:02:54.876
the seriousness that she sees the threat

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:56.077
to the Constitution.

00:02:56.077 --> 00:02:58.496
Clarify that Jordan
believes the Constitution

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:01.036
was first weakened then
sabotaged then broken.

00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:03.257
No, she's just saying
she doesn't want to be

00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:05.037
the spectator to that happening.

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:06.410
She's not saying that it necessarily

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.317
already, already happened.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:12.919
Indicating, indicate that Jordan thinks

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.900
the Constitution is prone to failure

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.899
in three distinct ways.

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:16.719
No, no, not at all.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.279
In fact, later on, she talks about,

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:19.999
I mean she says, "My faith,"

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.479
not later on, actually right before that,

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.719
"My faith in the Constitution is whole,

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.339
"it is complete, it is total."

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.839
So she doesn't think that
it is prone to failure.

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.979
Propose a three-part agenda for rescuing

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.079
the Constitution from the current crisis.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.599
No, she doesn't start
breaking off in like,

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.799
"Step one, do this, step two, do this."

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.279
So I think it is the increasing intensity,

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.119
convey with increasing
intensity the seriousness

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.879
of the threat she sees
to the Constitution.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.859
As used in line 34,
"channeled" most nearly means.

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.179
So line 34, we saw it right over here.

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:56.719
"The nature of impeachment, a
narrowly channeled exception

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.119
"to the separation of powers maxim."

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.799
So a narrowly channeled exception.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.059
So impeachment it's this, it's this,

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:09.059
is this kind of a very limited exception,

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:13.699
narrowly channeled that allows
one branch of government

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:18.319
to essentially accuse or
potentially eventually remove

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:21.799
or start the process
to remove the President

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.259
and it's narrowly, it's constrained

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.419
and so over here, not worn.

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.979
It's not a, it's not something
that's actually done a lot

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.899
so it's not going to be worn
out or anything like that.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.979
Sent, a narrowly sent exception, no.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.119
A narrowly constrained exception

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:41.179
to the separation of the powers.

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:42.240
That sounds right.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.519
Narrowly siphoned exception to the,

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:47.839
no that seems, that
seems, that seems strange.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.480
She's talking about
look, there's a, there's,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.460
it's a very, it's a narrowly
constrained exception.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.619
It's a, to when one branch of government

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:00.659
can have a deep, direct impact on another

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.579
and potentially begin the proceedings

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:04.619
to remove or accuse another,

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.400
in this case, the President.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.859
Let's read the next one.

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.249
In lines 45 to 49, prosecutions,

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.509
so this is 45 to 49 so it's right here.

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.869
"Prosecutions of
impeachment will seldom fail

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:21.869
"to agitate the passions
of the whole community,

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:23.849
"said Hamilton in the Federalist papers,"

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.110
number 65,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.369
"We divide into parties
more or less friendly

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.109
"or inimical to the accused.

00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:35.369
"I do not mean political
parties in that sense."

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:36.309
So this is just saying hey look,

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:37.723
when you have an impeachment proceeding,

00:05:37.723 --> 00:05:39.223
people are going to get
passionate about it.

00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:41.563
Some people are going to be
sympathetic to the accuser,

00:05:41.563 --> 00:05:44.204
some people are going to be
sympathetic to the accused

00:05:44.204 --> 00:05:47.703
but it should not be along party lines.

00:05:48.863 --> 00:05:51.943
So let's see, in lines, what
is the most likely reason

00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:54.623
Jordan draws the distinction
between two types of parties?

00:05:54.623 --> 00:05:56.843
To counter the suggestion that impeachment

00:05:56.843 --> 00:05:59.023
is or should be about partisan politics.

00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:00.103
I think that's right.

00:06:00.103 --> 00:06:01.783
You can have two groups of people,

00:06:01.783 --> 00:06:03.883
some who are, who are
on one side or the other

00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:05.803
but it should not be along party lines.

00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:08.263
That's why she says, "I do not mean

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:10.703
"political parties in that sense."

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.663
To disagree with Hamilton's claim

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:15.163
that political proceedings
excite passions.

00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:16.723
No, they clearly do.

00:06:16.723 --> 00:06:18.843
To contend that Hamilton was too timid

00:06:18.843 --> 00:06:20.763
in his support for the
concept of impeachment?

00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:21.503
No.

00:06:21.503 --> 00:06:22.903
To argue that impeachment cases

00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:26.443
are decided more on the basis
of politics than on justice.

00:06:26.443 --> 00:06:28.763
No, and she's actually
arguing they need to be.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.443
They necessarily need
to be based on justice

00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:34.363
and they need to transcend party politics.

00:06:35.463 --> 00:06:37.143
Which choice provides the best evidence

00:06:37.143 --> 00:06:39.163
for the answer to the previous question?

00:06:39.163 --> 00:06:40.983
So remember the answer
to the previous question,

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:42.943
we're saying this is where
she's starting to say

00:06:42.943 --> 00:06:45.043
that impeachment should not be,

00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:48.223
that impeachment should not
be about partisan politics.

00:06:48.223 --> 00:06:50.543
She's countering the
suggestion that impeachment

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.163
should be about partisan politics.

00:06:52.163 --> 00:06:54.583
So which of these lines
give us further evidence?

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:58.343
So line 13 to 16, that's up here.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.223
That's unlikely to be it because we were

00:07:01.223 --> 00:07:02.063
already down in the passage

00:07:02.063 --> 00:07:03.583
and now to get further evidence of that,

00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:05.023
to go jump up, well let's see.

00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:07.363
"It is wrong, I suggest it is a misreading

00:07:07.363 --> 00:07:09.563
"of the Constitution for any member here

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.523
"to assert that for a member to vote

00:07:11.523 --> 00:07:12.703
"for an article of impeachment

00:07:12.703 --> 00:07:14.143
"means that the member must be convinced

00:07:14.143 --> 00:07:16.203
"that the President should
be removed from office."

00:07:16.203 --> 00:07:17.483
No, that's not saying that this

00:07:17.483 --> 00:07:19.183
should transcend party lines.

00:07:19.183 --> 00:07:23.063
Lines 20 to 22, lines 20 to 22.

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:25.863
"The division between the two branches

00:07:25.863 --> 00:07:27.763
"of the legislature, the House and Senate,

00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:29.963
"assigning to the one to right to accuse

00:07:29.963 --> 00:07:32.183
"and to the other, the right to judge.

00:07:32.183 --> 00:07:33.703
"The framers of this Constitution

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.923
"were very astute."

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:37.463
No, this just talks about that hey,

00:07:37.463 --> 00:07:38.603
the framers of the Constitution,

00:07:38.603 --> 00:07:39.623
they knew what they were doing

00:07:39.623 --> 00:07:43.023
by separating, by allowing one branch

00:07:43.023 --> 00:07:44.823
to accuse and one branch to judge.

00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:46.123
They're not talking about,
she's not talking about

00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:49.063
party politics here or the
need to transcend them.

00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:51.013
Lines 50 to 53.

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:54.523
"The drawing of political lines

00:07:54.523 --> 00:07:57.403
"goes to the motivation behind impeachment

00:07:57.403 --> 00:08:00.643
"but impeachment must
proceed within the confines

00:08:00.643 --> 00:08:04.343
"of the Constitutional term,
high crimes, and misdemeanors."

00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:07.483
So this is, this is an interesting one.

00:08:07.483 --> 00:08:09.223
She's kind of saying look, you know,

00:08:10.293 --> 00:08:14.883
political lines can help
motivate some of the impeachment

00:08:14.883 --> 00:08:17.963
but impeachment must
proceed within the confines

00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:19.623
of high crimes and misdemeanors.

00:08:19.623 --> 00:08:22.043
It needs to go beyond so, this one is,

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.463
this one is interesting.

00:08:23.463 --> 00:08:25.003
Let's see choice D.

00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:28.313
Choice D is lines 60 to 63.

00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:30.983
"Common sense would be revolted

00:08:30.983 --> 00:08:33.563
"if we engaged upon this
process for petty reasons."

00:08:33.563 --> 00:08:35.303
We actually want to
start at Congress though.

00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:38.763
"Congress has a lot to
do, appropriations,"

00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:39.823
so it goes all the way to,

00:08:41.263 --> 00:08:43.563
so the ones, the lines from
Congress to transportation,

00:08:43.563 --> 00:08:44.723
she's just citing all the things

00:08:44.723 --> 00:08:46.123
that Congress has to do.

00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:48.283
If they used, if it was these two lines,

00:08:48.283 --> 00:08:49.603
"Common sense would be revolted

00:08:49.603 --> 00:08:51.843
"if we engaged upon this
process for petty reasons,"

00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:54.283
that might elude a little bit to,

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:57.563
to the notion to transcend party politics

00:08:57.563 --> 00:08:59.763
but the one, this one right over here,

00:08:59.763 --> 00:09:01.123
this just lists kind of the other things

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.103
that Congress has to do that shouldn't

00:09:03.103 --> 00:09:04.603
get caught up in petty things.

00:09:04.603 --> 00:09:08.683
Line 50 to 53 directly
addresses the notion

00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:11.083
of political lines and the fact that,

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.423
or the need for impeachment to proceed

00:09:13.423 --> 00:09:17.123
within the confines of high
crimes and misdemeanors,

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.543
so to kind of go beyond,

00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:20.543
that it should not be politically based.

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:22.793
So I would go with C.
