00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.770
1/2 is equivalent to 8/16.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.990
3/4 is equivalent to 12/16.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.450
And 7/8 is equal to 14/16.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.890
For each of these fractions we
had to multiply the numerator in

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.580
the denominator, each by some number in
order to get our new numerator over 16.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.120
So, what did I multiply
by two to get 16?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.330
I know that two goes
into 16 eight times.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.231
Well if I do anything to the denominator
I have to do the same thing to

00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:37.380
the numerator in order for
it to be the same fraction.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.836
And then I get 1 x 8 = 8,
and that's my numerator.

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:46.650
And for 3/4 I had to find
some number to multiply it

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.570
by the denominator, 4,
to get the new denominator, 16.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.350
And I know that 4 goes into 16,
four times, and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.340
I do the same thing to the numerator.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.860
And then 3 x 4 gives me 12.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.260
And for 7/8, I know that
eight goes into 16 two times.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.170
Two over two.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.602
7 x 2 me 14.

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:10.040
It's okayif this is not
coming to you right away.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.750
We'll give you lots of practice,
so you can get more comfortable.
