ALI PASHA: Hi.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.780
I'm Ali Pasha, and I'm a product
manager at Google.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.520
I work on the Google Affiliate
Network team.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.650
And I've been at Google for the
last five years, and I've

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.820
worked on a variety of projects,
including Google

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.520
Code, some of the cloud
platform tools.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.600
And I started my career at
Google working on API's.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.980
SHAUN COX: And my name
is Shaun Cox.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.490
I'm a software engineer here at
Google, and I've been with

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.865
Google Affiliate Network
for the last two years.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:29.870
And before that I was working
with EA on a lot of their

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.390
massively multiplayer
online technologies.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.710
And what we're here today to
talk to you about is how to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.680
make money.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.510
In particular, how do
you make money in

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.860
the affiliate channel?

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.320
The affiliate channel is a
very unique channel to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.890
distribute advertisements.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.550
And so we just want to go
through, first, what websites

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.030
should be in the affiliate
channel?

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.610
Second, what things about the
affiliate channel can you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.470
leverage to more effectively
monetize your website?

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.950
And lastly, we hope
to show you how to

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.170
monetize your website.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950
We're going to take you step by
step through setting up an

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.300
account, getting links on your
site, and actually getting

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.170
conversion so that you
make some money.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.710
ALI PASHA: So let's start with
just a quick review of the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.180
affiliate channel, why it's
important, why you may be

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.570
interested in it, and its
potential moving forward.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.820
So let's just start with the
publisher landscape.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.870
If you have a website out
there, almost everyone's

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.320
already familiar with the
standard display ads.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.920
And display reaches about 83%
of the web, millions of

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.310
publisher websites.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.610
And the models that typical
display ads follow are based

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.210
on clicks and impressions.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.230
Affiliate ads are
very different.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.420
And here's an example of
an affiliate website,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.750
Savings.com, where the
ads are actually the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.710
content of the website.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.850
And these websites are almost
always commerce oriented, and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.310
they drive a lot
of conversions.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.360
And therefore the pricing models
aren't based on clicks

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.000
or impressions.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.590
They're really just based on
actions or actual conversions

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.979
that take place.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.570
And then affiliate as a
channel, therefore, is

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.920
actually one of the best ways
for a merchant to actually

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.695
increase the number of
conversions they get.

00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:20.600
And by conversions, I mean
sales or orders.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.470
And it's particularly important
for merchants during

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.280
the holiday season.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.200
It's one of the most impactful
ways for really making sure

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.310
that you and your online
website as a

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.530
merchant has a good year.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.490
And that's why almost all
merchants are either

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.970
continuing to invest in this
particular channel or actually

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.940
are going to increase their
investment in this channel.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.670
Some merchants like Target and
Walmart actually invest quite

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.530
heavily in this particular
channel already.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.880
And it's a key channel for
driving commerce online,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.120
largely because the number of
things that consumers are

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.260
actually looking at to make
their decisions is only

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.440
growing with time.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.050
And some of the most impactful
things that consumers look at

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.010
before they make their
decision actually are

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.320
affiliate websites.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.710
And some examples, which Shaun
will go through in more

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.360
detail, include comparison
shopping sites, blogs, product

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.780
reviews, and even searches
for coupons online.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.140
SHAUN COX: So let's take a
quick look at the most

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.890
successful affiliates inside
of this channel.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.350
First and foremost, we have
loyalty and reward sites.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.750
What loyalty and reward sites
do is based on conversions

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.790
that they drive.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.230
They reward their members
through points or cash back.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.850
If it's a point-driven system,
after the user accumulates so

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.980
many points, they can use
those points to spend on

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.290
additional discounts or cash
back or a variety of other

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.215
such things.

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:57.050
A very different space is the
shopping and promotion sites.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.440
At any one point there are
hundreds, thousands, tens of

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.520
thousands of promotions and
online offers spread across

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.640
the internet.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.820
What these sites do is go
through those offers and

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.570
aggregate them up and curate
them so they are a much more

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.300
digestible format
for those users.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.680
So instead of a user just
getting bombarded with tons of

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.329
offers that they cannot seem to
parse through, you can go

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.900
through these sites and very
quickly and easily find the

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.130
offers that are best
suited for you.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.860
Most of these sites also have
search capabilities so you can

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.890
actually search for an offer
that you are actively seeking.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.410
Next, we have community
and content sites.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.160
These are going to be more of
the blog and community aspects

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.870
of the affiliate channel.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.610
What's special about these
versus all other community

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.130
sites is they tend to be
commerce-oriented.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.940
Let's pretend you have a camera

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.230
or photography community.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.190
Most photography communities
will talk about which is the

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.770
best camera, whether it's Camera
1, point and shoot, all

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.030
these sort of different
aspects.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.020
It's really helpful to drive
conversions to have a deep

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.900
link from the camera that you're
talking about directly

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.820
to the purchase page of a
particular advertiser.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.230
The affiliate channel allows
you to do that.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.080
And since you're deep linking
directly to an advertiser's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.090
page, you're going to be driving
more conversions.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.980
And whenever you're driving more
conversions, you tend to

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.900
be a great fit for the
affiliate channel.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.300
Next we have comparison
shopping sites.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.150
These sites actually leverage
much of the same technologies

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.040
that we saw in the community and
content sites but do it in

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.830
a very different way.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.940
Instead of having a deep link
inside of a long blog or

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.760
product description or things
like that, they do side by

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.690
side comparisons, either of
two products or even two

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.820
merchant sites.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.660
So you can actually compare
various products across

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.890
merchant sites.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.510
And since they're a deep link,
those users are more likely to

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.360
convert than a typical user
on another display ad.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.700
And since you are driving more
conversions to an advertiser,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.920
advertisers are willing
to pay you more money.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.150
And the last phenomenon has been
this new social commerce.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.870
Going online is not an
individual thing anymore.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.650
Everything wants to converge
towards social.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.590
People want to do
things together.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.410
In particular, people want
to shop together.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.640
So what we are seeing is that
certain affiliates will

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.970
actually go and generate virtual
currency that you can

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.610
trade and even gift
to friends.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.060
So now shopping isn't
an isolated thing.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.680
It's a social experience where
I can give Ali some tokens

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.180
where he can go and spend
it on a discount.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.310
And now we're both shopping
together, we both feel very

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.740
engaged with the advertiser,
thereby driving a lot more

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.390
conversions and making the
advertiser more money.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.060
And whenever you're making the
advertiser more money, you're

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.130
generating much more revenue
for you and greater

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.630
opportunity to monetize.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.180
ALI PASHA: So one of the most
interesting things we've seen

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.710
in the last three years--

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.680
and this is research done by
Forrester for one of our

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.010
larger partners, Whale Shark
Media who run RetailMeNot--

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.910
is that the actual amount of
traffic that's coming from

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.010
merchants downstream to
affiliate sites is growing

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.940
quite dramatically.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.840
And it's grown by 69% over
the last 3 years.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.190
What that clearly shows is a new
phenomenon that consumers

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.520
are actually going through,
where they're actually

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.880
suspending their purchase.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.520
So they go onto a merchant's
website, they find the

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.940
products they want, they go to
the shopping cart, and they're

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.280
actually stopping that purchase
to go look for

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.130
coupons and go to other
websites, such as

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.460
RetailMeNot's website, to
find those coupons.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.450
And you may think, how is this

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.070
particularly valuable to merchants?

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.250
But part of this research has
also shown that those

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.780
consumers tend to spend more
money on those merchant

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.560
websites, and they tend to make
purchases more often.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.510
And having the right incentives
or the right offer

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.490
for a merchant is really
important, because you can

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.930
often acquire a consumer through
that particular offer.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.810
SHAUN COX: Now that we've gone
through who should be in the

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.920
affiliate channel, let's go
ahead and examine what the

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.610
affiliate channel has to offer
that you can leverage to

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.020
better monetize your website.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.140
First and foremost, the
affiliate channel gives you

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.540
direct control.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.370
We allow you to control which
advertisers you're in a

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.370
relationship with, and also
which actual links and ads

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.530
you're displaying
on your site.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.659
With this fine grain
control you

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.559
actually need better tracking.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.700
So the second thing
we provide is much

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.290
more flexible tracking.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.550
You are now able to track on a
per-user basis, on a per-click

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.600
basis, and even on a
per-conversion basis.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.980
So advertisers are much more
willing to give you

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.220
information, such as line item
level details of what

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.940
conversions you are driving.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.580
Since you know that information,
you can better

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.230
optimize your website to drive
conversions to there.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.200
In particular since we are
a pure CPA basis, a $10

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.470
conversion pays you
significantly less than a $100

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.270
conversion.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.920
So analyzing this data and
being able to modify your

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.290
website so that you can more
effectively monetize is a

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.310
great way to be successful
in this channel.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.760
Since you are so far down on
the purchase pipeline,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.720
advertisers are also willing
to pay you more dollars per

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.700
conversion.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.740
This is huge.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.290
So now all of a sudden, you are
able to make more money

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.650
per conversion and per action,
which allows you to truly

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.110
monetize your website to the
best of your ability.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.680
Also, as your brand starts
to become more and more

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.780
established because of that
control and because of that

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.200
per-relationship basis,
you are able to

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.060
get negotiated rates.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.640
So now instead of just getting
the default rate for an

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.530
advertiser, you can get a much
higher rate for an advertiser.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.250
So you can be a Target.com
exclusive advertiser, and

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:07.010
actually negotiate so that you
can monetize your website much

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.110
more effectively.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.480
ALI PASHA: And so now that we've
hopefully convinced you

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.760
about the potential of the
channel, the size of the

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.680
channel, why it's important
to merchants, and why it's

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.590
something that's going to only
grow in the coming years,

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.160
we're going to actually walk you
through the "how" portion

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.550
and spend more time on this than
we did on describing why

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.050
the channel is important.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.610
And the things that we're going
to walk you through are

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.410
we're going to really walk you
through three particular

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.650
scenarios and how most people
implement these.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.840
And we think that you can have
a very innovative model that

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.630
uses bits and pieces of all
the things that we're

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.130
describing in a variety
of ways.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.820
We've seen this across
the board.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.730
So the first is promotional.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.620
Promotional, I just mean just
the very plain vanilla, how do

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.170
you get links out of
our system and get

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.200
them on your website?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.650
Second one is, how do you do
comparison sites, and how

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.450
would you build one?

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.240
And then the third one is a
much more complex scenario

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.870
that the affiliate channel is
really good at handling, which

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.970
is sort of like loyalty.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.240
And by loyalty, I mean, when
a consumer goes and makes a

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.750
purchase, how do you track that
order and then pay back

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.640
that particular consumer in
terms of points or cash back?

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.240
So with that, let me
just start with

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.270
the most basic scenario.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.720
The first thing you need to do
and this isn't just for our

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.540
affiliate network but any
affiliate network out there is

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.730
you need to go to join the
affiliate network and then

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.780
join advertiser programs.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.580
So most affiliate networks will
have several advertisers,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.620
hundreds, thousands
of advertisers.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.520
And then once you join their
program, they'll accept you.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.630
And at that point, you can start
using their links and

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.880
then any time you drive a
conversion, you'll get

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.770
compensated.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.010
So that's the most
important part.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.270
Once you do that, then you
just get the links.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.880
And then you can put them
on your website.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.920
And there's a variety of
ways to get links.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.070
SHAUN COX: By far the easiest
way to get links to put on

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.815
your website is through a UI.

00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:08.030
So you can navigate to the links
page, check out the link

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.500
that you want to get,
copy, and just paste

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.850
it into your website.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.810
The problem with this is it
tends not to scale very well.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.630
You can do this for tens of
links, and even hundreds of

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.320
links, but doing it thousands
and tens of thousands of links

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.270
is just not feasible.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.190
So what we offer is something
called Link Subscriptions.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.090
What Link Subscriptions are is
a push mechanism, where we

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.750
will push link updates to you
that you could read through

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.180
either email or FTP.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.060
From there, you can go ahead
and keep your data store in

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.470
sync with ours, such that your
site is the most up to date

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.460
and effective at monetization.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.740
The second, more advanced
way is through our API.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.670
Through our API, it's more
of a pull mechanism.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.480
So you're able to actually ping
our system and figure out

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.880
what links you have available
inside of your data store.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.950
So let's go ahead and look
at some code sample.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.140
As you can see here,
the code sample is

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.660
actually fairly small.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.980
With as little as four or five
lines of code, you can go

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.620
ahead and query our system
for what links you

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.200
are interested in.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.910
The thing to keep in mind is
since you guys are mainly

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.500
affiliates, the role type that
you are going to be using is

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.330
publishers.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.400
Second, when you create
an account, you

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.310
will be given an ID.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.670
That is the ID that you're going
to use to interact with

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.750
our system throughout
all of our APIs.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.320
Now you're ready to do
a get_link call.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.900
So let's pretend you already
know what the link ID is.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.550
All you do is pass that link
ID, the role type, and that

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.030
role ID into our system,
and execute the query.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.180
From that, we'll hand
back a JSON object.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.840
But let's say you don't actually
know which link ID

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.480
you're talking about.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.980
Let's say you want to query
over a variety of links.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.350
We provide a query interface
that is called List which you

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.480
can use to refine your queries
based on a bunch of filters.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.060
All these filters are located
in our site of our

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.420
documentation at
developers.google.com.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.010
But for this case, what we are
doing is going through and

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.000
looking for advertisers in
the category computers.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.710
And then you can actually get
all the links from those

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.360
advertisers and figure out
what to do from there.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.250
So let's take a look, just
very quickly, at what is

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.810
actually returned from
these calls.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.550
You should get a JSON
object that looks

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.610
something like this.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.900
The most important thing
is the tracking URL.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.070
What a tracking URL does is
allow you to paste this onto

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.550
your website and get credit
for all clicks

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.190
that go through that.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.320
Next, the really important
thing is the end date.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.800
Certain links have duration,
so links are not forever.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.050
So it's good to actually be
aware of the end date and to

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.160
be aware of how to update
your website to

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.500
compensate for that.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.000
You're not going to get a whole
lot of credit if you're

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.570
using expired links
everywhere.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.030
ALI PASHA: So the next
thing to talk about

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.460
is what about products?

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.270
If you're building a comparison
site, you're going

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.190
to want to pull products, and
you're going to want to do

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.830
some comparison across them.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:25.090
So the nice thing is that you
can get affiliate links

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.810
through three means.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.130
One is directly through the UI,
but that doesn't really

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.790
scale very well unless you're a
blog and you just want to do

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.670
a review for one product.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.120
Or you can get a feed
subscription, again, e-mail

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.680
you a CSV file or we'll FTP you
the file, and then you can

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.270
just process that accordingly.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.710
Or the third one, which has
been there for a while, is

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.320
there is an integration
with the Search for

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.310
Shopping API as well too.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.910
And there have been some talks
about that at the conference.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.520
I'm not going to go into this
in too much detail.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.960
And really, the only thing you
need to provide that's

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.880
different from any other query
to the Search for Shopping API

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.110
is the GAN ID.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.930
And the GAN ID being your
own account ID.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.890
And once you provide that, the
results look identical to what

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.800
results you'd expect normally,
except the URLs that we return

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.190
back to you are going to be
tracking links instead of just

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.450
direct links to the
destination.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.790
And that allows you to put those
links on your site and

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.460
then whenever a user clicks
through them, get credit for

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.340
any conversions or
sales that occur.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.490
SHAUN COX: So now we know how to
handle it if a merchant has

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.100
already established a link that
you can just copy and

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.570
paste onto your site.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.730
But we actually run into a
problem with community and

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.250
content blog sites that actually
want to do deep

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.010
linking to direct
product pages.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.670
Advertisers will often not
actually give you all of those

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.590
links and all of those
destination URLs.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.440
So what we provide
is what is called

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.940
Publisher Specific Links.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.340
And what Publisher Specific
Links allow you to do is do

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.210
that deep linking directly to
any destination URL for that

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.370
advertiser.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.390
This allows you to more
effectively drive conversions.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.520
And whenever you're more
effectively driving

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.950
conversions, you are
making more money.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.200
So let's just take a
quick look at this.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.170
As you can see, you'll see a lot
of commonalities between

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.230
this API and the previous
API we just showed you.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.910
You still see the role type, as
well as you still see the

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.349
affiliate ID.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.970
But now you see what it's
called an Insert Body.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.370
In particular, an Insert Body
contains three main fields

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.770
that you need to populate.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.660
First and foremost, the
advertiser that you're

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.700
actually wanting to
deep link into.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.430
Second, a name for this
link so you can easily

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:43.260
search it in our UI.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.870
And finally, a destination
URL.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.640
This destination URL is the
place that you are actually

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.280
deep linking to.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.130
Finally, what you're going to
need to do is actually just

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:01.540
execute the query, just like you
normally would, just like

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.530
we showed in all the
previous slides.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.250
You go ahead and call Insert
with the role ID as well as

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.690
that Insert Body that
we just populated.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.030
Call execute on that, and
then you have yourself

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.070
your very own link.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.420
Paste that on your site, and now
you're going to get credit

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.910
for those deep links.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.470
So what can you do with this?

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.490
Like, why create this
sort of API?

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.630
So one of our tech leads had a
kind of interesting idea, and

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.220
he wanted to make a
Chrome extension.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.900
So what he did was he created a
Chrome extension that looks

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.370
something like this.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.540
It logs you into our system such
that when you're actually

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.000
browsing the web, if you find a
particular website that you

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.700
want to deep link into, you
just click on the Chrome

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.060
extension, type in a name
of the link, and

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.190
hit Generate Link.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.200
And from there, you have a
Publisher Specific Link

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.700
generated for you on the fly.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.230
You copy and paste into your
website, and you can very

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:58.690
quickly and easily access all
your publisher created links.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.040
Also, we're planning on open
sourcing this so that all of

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.450
you can actually leverage
that code.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.500
ALI PASHA: So now that we've
talked about the various links

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.630
that you can get out of the
system and the variety of

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.170
methods you can get them
through, I want to just talk

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.700
about the actual link structure
itself, and just

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.550
describe what's happening
here.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.650
So in a particular tracking
link, you'll

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.340
have a LID and a PUBID.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.710
The LID is your Link ID.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.300
Again, we'll pre-populate this
for you, it just allows us to

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.320
track the link.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.130
And the PUBID is your specific
account, that allows us to

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.750
track the conversion
back to you.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.080
And how tracking works is when a
user actually clicks through

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.200
that particular link,
we set a cookie.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.990
And when we set the cookie,
we set three things.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.340
We set the advertiser ID, that
allows us to look up very

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.840
quickly when a conversion
happens, who the advertiser

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.130
is, and find the click ID.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.210
And the click ID contains the

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.070
information about the publisher.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.940
Now, the way that the affiliate
channel works is

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.500
it's a last click attribution
model, which means that the

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.940
affiliate or affiliate publisher
whose site a

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.840
consumer went to and clicked
last gets credit for the

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.140
entire conversion.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.130
And that's why we store the last
click ID, because once we

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:21.730
track the last click ID, we can
find out who the publisher

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.780
was that the user
went through and

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.750
actually clicked on website.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.710
The third thing we store
is the cookie duration.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.810
And this is particularly
interesting because the cookie

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.640
duration is the session during
which any conversions that are

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.550
made through your website
will count.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.600
So if a user actually goes and
clicks through a link on your

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.590
website and then decides he
wants to go for coffee, shuts

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.750
down his browser, whatever
it is, it's still OK.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.500
Because if he comes back and
makes a purchase right after,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.290
and it's within the cookie
duration or the session that

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.500
the merchant set, then you will
still get credit for that

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.750
particular conversion.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.060
SHAUN COX: So we already
walked you through the

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.520
beginnings of this transaction
workflow.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.370
You grab your links, you
put them on your site.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.860
When the user clicks on that
link, it's directed to an

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.020
advertiser site, in which
then you get credit.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.430
So we just want to expand on
that and to show you how the

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.760
end of that pipeline works.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.390
So when a conversion happens on
a merchant's site, what a

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.530
merchant does is fires a
conversion pixel to us.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.980
And then we go ahead and do
that tracking for you.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.290
And so then you can go into
our UI and analyze your

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.450
traffic, analyze how
your monetization

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.000
strategies are working.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.760
So let's quickly look at what
is actually contained in a

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.970
merchant conversion pixel.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.780
This may seem a little daunting,
but the most

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.600
important part is the fact that,
as you can see there,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.930
that's product SKU.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.290
You are actually getting the
information of the exact

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.390
products purchased through
that conversion.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.540
From there, you can actually
analyze your site and decide

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.340
how to better drive traffic
to that merchant's sites.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:09.880
You also are receiving the
quantity, price, and right

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.020
below that, the category ID.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.300
Merchants are able to set up
very advanced commission

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.270
schedules based on these
conversions so that you are

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:21.370
rewarded in very
great bounties.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.850
ALI PASHA: So let me wrap up
the entire workflow for you

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.440
because there are a few more
steps that happen after the

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.000
conversion is actually
tracked.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.690
So, after the conversion is
tracked, most networks, what

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.800
they will do is they'll go in,
and they will calculate how

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.720
much is due to the particular
publisher.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.250
But they're not paid out
immediately, unlike other

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:41.310
forms of ads.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.580
What happens is at the end of
the month, typically there is

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.670
an 8-day reconciliation
window.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.960
And the reason why there's an
8-day day reconciliation

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.070
window is because all merchants
want the opportunity

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.860
to manage canceled orders
or returned goods

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.350
or things like that.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.830
And then once those are
accounted for at the end of

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.190
those 8 days, when the
reconciliation window is

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:07.520
closed, that's when we will
invoice, and most affiliate

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.110
networks will actually invoice
the merchants.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.920
And that's when publishers will
actually get paid out.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.160
Now, there are a few more steps
for loyalty workflow,

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.800
which I wanted to walk
through quickly.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.110
So one is, in the case of the
loyalty scenario, you actually

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.760
need to track this back to
a particular member.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.930
And once you track it back to
a member, you need to notify

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.520
the member that you're actually
tracking that order

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.450
and that they're going to get
their points and that they're

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.480
going to get their cash back
from that particular order.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.990
And then you also have to
do customer service.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.550
Largely because they're going to
find a lot of consumers who

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.320
come back to you and say, hey,
I purchased this particular

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.620
order on this site, and I didn't
get my points, or I

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.220
didn't get my cash back.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.380
Why didn't I?

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.270
And for most affiliate
publishers, you'll need to

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.850
have a good response or
a good answer to that.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.840
And I'll walk you through how
most affiliate network tools

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.120
will help you with that.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.600
So let's first start with
tracking a member.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.430
The reason I described the URL
earlier was because I wanted

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.560
to show some new variables
that you will have to add

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.740
yourself to be able
to track a member.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.670
So one of these is actually
the member ID.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.990
And the member ID is just an
obfuscated string that you can

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.030
provide in there to track
it back to a member.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.030
And we've seen some really
unique uses of this beyond

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.400
just the loyalty use case,
which this is primarily

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.470
designed for, where people have
tracked search terms that

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.190
they've used for search
ads, or A/B testing.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.590
But primarily, this is used
to track a member.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.280
My only word of caution is don't
put things like e-mail

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.580
or unobfuscated PII in there,
because Google doesn't want

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.830
that information.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:57.660
So once you do that, then the
next thing you can do-- and

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.000
this is something we haven't
launched yet,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.590
and it's coming soon--

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.350
is you can use the ximg tag.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.870
You can actually use the tag
today, the latency on this is

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.800
a little bit more
than 30 seconds.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.550
And what this does is this is
a pingback URL, and whenever

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.800
an order is made, what we'd like
this to do immediately

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.700
pingback that particular URL
with the order ID, so that you

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.270
can almost immediately tell your
members that, hey, you

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.220
just made this sale.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.570
We tracked it for you,
and so that they get

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:28.820
that immediate feedback.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.020
SHAUN COX: The next thing we
have is an events API.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.470
So oftentimes what you actually
want is, after the

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.780
fact, to analyze your data and
analyze your conversions and

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.890
what conversions you
are driving.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.970
So to accomplish this, what we
did is we went ahead and

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.080
implemented an events API.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.020
What this allows you to do is
much of the same things that

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.650
the link query API allows you
to do, but for events.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.250
So you can actually query our
database for things such as

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:03.070
Modify Date, as well as Event
Time, and then get a truer

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.100
picture of exactly which
events you are

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.970
driving over time.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.740
This allows you to keep in sync
your data stores with our

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.880
data stores.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.640
And just as before, what you
do is a very similar call.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.870
Just go ahead and call
Events.List, and then pass in

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.320
publishers, just like you did
before, as well as your

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.640
publisher ID.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.480
When you execute this query,
what you'll get back is a list

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.440
of results.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.440
From that list of results, you
can go ahead and iterate over

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.210
them and show all of the results
in whatever manner

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.500
that you want, whether that be
an internal tool, or keeping

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.266
your database in sync.

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:44.060
The next thing we have
is Saved Reports.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.960
Saved Reports are a hugely
powerful tool.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.950
What they allow you to do is
view aggregated data on a

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.570
periodic basis.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.410
So every morning before you
get into work, Google will

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:58.990
actually execute presaved
queries for you and email them

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.900
directly to you so that you can
see them and review them

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.820
early in the morning.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.900
ALI PASHA: So let me just walk
you through, quickly, how most

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.610
of these affiliate publishers or
loyalty publishers actually

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.080
pay back their members.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.430
So most of them make the
decision to actually just pay

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.730
out daily or weekly, because
that tends to be a better user

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.950
experience for their users.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.640
That doesn't mean they get
the money immediately.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.430
As I said before, they get paid
once a month, after the

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.330
reconciliation window is done.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.970
And most affiliate networks,
what they do is they all have

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.180
reports and APIs--

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.070
we don't have an API
for this yet--

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:43.460
but reports where you can go
in and to see what specific

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.520
orders were paid out, which
advertisers paid you out, and

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.460
how much money you got at
the end of the month.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.835
And what you will need to do as
a loyalty publisher is you

00:27:51.835 --> 00:27:55.160
will need to go and reconcile
that with what you've said to

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.680
your users or paid out to your
users and do the appropriate

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.850
credit/debit that
you need to do.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.500
So for example, if a user went
ahead and made a purchase, and

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.640
you give him points for that
purchase but then went back

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.680
and returned that order, then
you're going to have to

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.400
reconcile that later
as well, too.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.070
And then finally, customer
service, how do you manage a

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.010
conversion increase?

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:22.680
So almost all the networks do
this where if you have the

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.330
order IDs that are provided
to the actual consumer--

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.695
[CRICKET NOISES]

00:28:26.695 --> 00:28:28.060
[LAUGHS]

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.100
the order IDs that are provided
to the actual

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:37.210
consumer can be sent over to the
actual loyalty affiliate.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.710
And when the loyalty affiliate
gets that order ID, what they

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:42.650
can do is they can go into the
affiliate networks, plug that

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:47.040
order ID in, and actually look
and see if that order already

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.990
exists and if it's been
attributed to someone else.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.100
And if it's been attributed
to someone else, you will

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.990
immediately get feedback and
say, OK, this category of

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.930
publisher got the affiliate
sale, in which case you can go

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.470
back to your user, and
you can just tell

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.350
them, hey, I know you.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.390
You made this purchase.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.190
But you clicked on a link
on another site.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.940
Or in some cases, you used
a coupon, which made you

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.000
ineligible for points
or cash back.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.630
The other thing you can do is if
you don't find that order,

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.420
then you're going to have to
work through with the merchant

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.120
and figure out why the order
isn't there, especially if the

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.170
consumer or the user actually
has a receipt for that

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.460
particular order.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.380
In that case, you can file a
missing order report and just

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.870
provide all the details of
that particular order--

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.420
and this isn't live yet, we're
going to have this, but most

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.490
networks have something
like this--

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.870
and file the missing order.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.240
And then what happens is that
missing order will be sent

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.690
over to the merchant, and then
the merchants have a quick way

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.530
of reconciling that order and
telling you, yes, we see the

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:52.460
order in our system.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.270
For whatever reason, the
pixel didn't fire.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.000
It's approved, just please,
we apologize for the

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.980
inconvenience.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.550
And sites do go down, and pixels
sometimes don't fire

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.540
for whatever reason,
so this is a very

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.600
useful tool for that.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.050
And with that, I think I've
covered most of the scenarios.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.380
So now you should be able to
create your own promotional

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.160
website, your own comparison
website, or your own loyalty,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.940
and actually combine them in
various new and innovative

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.410
ways that even we haven't
thought of.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:24.260
So with that, I'm just going
to go through our closing

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:29.670
thoughts and summarize what we
went through in terms of why

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.170
the affiliate channel's
interesting and important.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:36.400
And the first is, again,
it's going to grow.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.050
All the merchants who are in the
channel are staying, and

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.260
most of them are going to grow
the channel and grow their

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.870
investment in the channel.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.940
This year alone, we're expecting
15%, 16% percent

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.540
growth in this channel.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.370
The other thing we're seeing is
we're seeing the emergence

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.050
of a whole bunch of new models
that are coming along,

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.150
specifically around the new
trends that we're seeing.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.700
We're seeing mobile- and
tablet-specific affiliates

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.930
that didn't exist before.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.150
We're seeing a lot of the
traditional affiliates who

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.460
feel challenged by that actually
now venturing into

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.520
mobile and tablet pretty
aggressively.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.160
We see a lot of publishers
leveraging social tools,

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.270
recommending offers, doing
things like that with their

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.940
friends and their extended
networks, which has been

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.850
pretty novel.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.610
And we're seeing the use of
virtual currency in very

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.610
unique ways.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.110
All of these things didn't
really exist several, four or

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.160
five years ago.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.910
So there's some dramatic
changes

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.260
underway in the channel.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:33.830
And then the one thing I think
isn't going to change is that

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.200
consumer behavior has changed.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.570
Consumers are more
deal-oriented, are looking for

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.660
deals, are looking for more
recommendations, more decision

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.540
points before they
make a purchase,

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.200
whether it's even offline.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.590
And affiliates have a really
strong role to play here, and

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.660
that's not going to change and
only get stronger with time.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.680
And if that isn't enough to
convince you, the market size,

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.900
which I haven't talked about
earlier, is estimated to be

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.990
about $4.5 billion by 2016.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.190
There's a recent study done by
Forrester where the expected

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:12.700
growth rates continue to be
around 17% compounded every

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.210
year between now and then.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.370
SHAUN COX: So if your website
or application is focused on

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.390
driving conversions to an
advertiser's website, and you

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:28.590
are interested in more rewards,
more control, and

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.380
more insight, you should
definitely take a look at the

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.530
Affiliate Channel.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.420
Here we have just general
information about the channel.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.670
You can go to www.google.com/a
ds/affiliatenetwork.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.260
Or if you're interested in the
APIs or a lot of their

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.220
documentation, you can also
check out our developers site

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:53.360
at developers.googl
e.com/affiliate-network.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.990
And I am Shaun Cox and this is
Ali Pasha, and thank you for

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.260
attending our talk.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.330
If there's any questions--

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.996
oh, sorry.

00:33:01.996 --> 00:33:07.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:08.440
ALI PASHA: I did--

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.950
so everything we talked
about is live.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:13.820
There's one thing that didn't
go live this week, which is

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.175
the documentation for the links
API, even though the

00:33:16.175 --> 00:33:18.470
links API is live already.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.320
And Shaun worked on that, so
you can assure to that.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.290
But the documentation for
how to use the links

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.950
API will be up soon.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.500
SHAUN COX: And I just want to
do a plug in general for the

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.890
Google Developers.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.940
There's something called
API Explorer.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.020
And if you're not familiar with
it, you should definitely

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:33.630
check it out.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.240
What it allows you to do is see
all the fields that you

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.160
need to populate during API
calls and actually just play

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.780
around them in real time
on a web forum.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.260
So regardless of whether or not
you're using the Google

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.240
Affiliate Networks API, or just
another API, you should

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.640
definitely check it out and play
around with it, because

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.230
personally, I found
it pretty sweet.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.350
ALI PASHA: Yeah that's how
I debug all the time.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.290
Sorry, so first question.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.440
AUDIENCE: Are affiliate networks
for me, if I'm on an

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.210
international website with
visitors from all over the

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:07.070
world, how do I select the
affiliates' network, the

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.300
merchants, or how do
I deal with it?

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.060
ALI PASHA: So the way this
works is if you're an

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.790
affiliate, the state of the
market is such that you're

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:17.830
going to have to be in almost
all the affiliate networks.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.590
And this is really driven by the
merchants that you want to

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.150
do business with.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:25.760
So some merchants will do
business on one network.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.610
Others will do business on
a different network.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.670
And some won't even be on a
network, they'll just have

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.650
their entire program.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.090
Amazon's a good example.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.790
Now if you want to have certain
merchants, you're

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.620
going to have to do business
with all of them.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.280
And then there are networks
which are international, and

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.290
which are more dominant in
one area than another.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.449
So you're going to have to pick
and choose which networks

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.330
you want to do business with.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:49.920
The good news is almost all of
them offer almost the exact

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.330
same tools.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.760
The challenge is that they're
slightly different, so you're

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.530
going to have to work around
each one of those tools and

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.870
learn them, and that is a
barrier to entry for an

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:01.900
international expansion.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.530
AUDIENCE: But in your
tool, can I--

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.570
I know my users come from, I
don't know, Europe or so, then

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:13.860
can I say, just send a query
that only gives me links to

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.100
European sites?

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.430
ALI PASHA: So in our tool,
we do it by advertisers.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.110
So basically what you can do
is you can go in there and

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:26.290
say, just give me all be
all the merchants who

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.900
run programs in Europe.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.100
And you can join
those programs.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.750
And then when you get the links,
there are fields which

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:38.480
tell you which geographic region
they're eligible in,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.650
and then even time zones
are given very clearly.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.880
So you know when a link ends and
when a link starts based

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.710
on your time zone.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.810
And then you can do the
appropriate thing, take them

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:47.932
down, put them up.

00:35:47.932 --> 00:35:48.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.240
SHAUN COX: And we also support
all the currencies and do the

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.310
currency transaction just
automatically for you, which

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.730
is kind of nice.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.220
My previous company, we
didn't always do that.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.480
So having that taken care of
for you really lowers the

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.310
barrier for entry
internationally.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.580
ALI PASHA: And as far as our
network goes, one of things

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:11.450
that we do piggyback on is the
payments infrastructure that

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.500
Google has.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.670
So internationally, we will pay
in whatever currency you

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:20.780
want, and it'll be the same
check that's written out for

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.910
your AdSense account.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.260
SHAUN COX: Thank you.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.070
AUDIENCE: Have you done any
studies as a publisher, the

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:34.630
typical earnings
versus AdSense?

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:38.450
Is it X% better than a typical
publisher would get just by

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:39.660
getting simple AdSense?

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.270
ALI PASHA: They are completely
different scenarios.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:42.820
They're completely different
use cases.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.900
And in fact, what typically
happens is even on the larger

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.410
affiliate sites, they'll do
direct placement, they'll do

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.670
display ads alongside
affiliate ads.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.530
Affiliate ads are--

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.990
I mean, the way to think about
them is when your ad is really

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.780
part of the content of your
website, then that's where

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.660
affiliate ads are.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.560
Whereas typical display
ads pretty much go

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.160
alongside other content.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.790
So you can use both, but they
don't really compete against

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:12.180
each other.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.420
And the biggest differentiator
here is if you have a site

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.320
like the New York Times, unless
you're doing product

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.110
reviews, if it's just a general
article, then display

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.700
is going to almost always
work better for you.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.670
If you're doing something that's
commercial in nature,

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:32.040
recommending a product, then
that's where affiliate plays a

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.200
bigger role, and that's where
affiliate conversions may be

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.420
better than display.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.580
AUDIENCE: Well that brings
me to my second question.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.230
If you reserved a space for
banners, let's say it has

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.630
certain dimensions.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:47.040
I didn't see any parameters in
the API there to call back for

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.700
a height and width.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.450
SHAUN COX: So there actually
is currently--

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:55.020
I forget which banner sizes
we support offhand.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.590
It will be in the documentation

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.550
once we launch that.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:02.040
You can actually go through,
most publisher websites will

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.210
have fixed banner sizes, like
a lot of the AdSense Sites.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:11.520
And our tool will actually go
ahead and query those things.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.380
It's just one field,
I believe.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.420
I have to go and look for it.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.370
ALI PASHA: So the merchants do
provide banner sizes, and they

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.590
are typically the same banner
sizes that you will see for

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.910
display as well, too.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:25.930
And the API will allow you to
query them, and that data's

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.340
provided through the
link subscription.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.230
And you can even filter
on it through the UI.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.990
So there's a variety
of ways to get it.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.760
AUDIENCE: That was my next
question, but when will that

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.010
be available?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.420
ALI PASHA: All of that
is already available.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.960
The documentation for the API
just needs to go live.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.760
And that will be live
either the next

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.930
week or the week after.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.830
AUDIENCE: So we could
go query today.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.380
ALI PASHA: You could query today
using the playground,

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.530
but the documentation
just isn't there.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:49.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.814
SHAUN COX: You're welcome.

00:38:51.814 --> 00:38:53.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.520
How does the Google Affiliate
Network work with respect to

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.560
mobile apps?

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.400
So if I wanted to cross-promote
mobile apps and

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.060
move to the Google Play store,
as iOS does it with link

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.030
shares, and Amazon does it.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.490
Does it work, or is the
affiliate network exclusively

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:11.170
on website?

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.600
And with mobile apps, where
we see a lot of consumers

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.220
spending times with an app, I
want to put a banner, promote

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.900
it to other paid apps of mine,
and basically get a revenue

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.200
share from the purchase.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.000
Is that likely to occur?

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.260
ALI PASHA: I mean, that's
something that we're still

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:26.770
considering.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.640
But our focus really has been
so far on driving merchant

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.760
sales outside Google Play.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.160
But that is something that
we're talking about.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.420
We're talking about a lot of
integrations within Google as

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.310
well, too, and we're just trying
to figure which ones we

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.920
want to tackle first.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.091
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:49.460
AUDIENCE: Did I understand you
right, that the comparison

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.480
shopping is based on Google
Shopping data?

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:53.810
ALI PASHA: Yeah.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.630
So almost--

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.210
I mean.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.820
I want to keep this a little
general, just because I know

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.250
that most of you, for sites,
you're going to have to use a

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.850
variety of networks.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:06.015
And almost all of them will
provide some sort of product

00:40:06.015 --> 00:40:08.900
feed, and some of them will
provide an API to get it.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.170
The one that we use is we just
piggyback on the Search for

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:15.860
Shopping API, so there's just
a parameter that you need to

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.990
provide there, and once you
provide that parameter, yes,

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.050
you get the data.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.160
AUDIENCE: So follow-up, if the
best priced item is with an

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.210
advertiser or a merchant I
don't have a relationship

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.885
with, would I be able
to show that price?

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:37.630
ALI PASHA: So to make money off
of that, you will need a

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:38.400
relationship.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:38.800
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.740
ALI PASHA: And I think you will
still be able to grab the

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.950
products for that particular
merchant, but

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.980
I'm not 100% sure.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:46.418
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:46.418 --> 00:40:46.856
Thank you.

00:40:46.856 --> 00:40:48.170
ALI PASHA: Sure.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.130
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.580
I was wondering, is there a way
to tell which links are

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.800
performing the best, or which
offers are performing the

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.820
best, kind of overall?

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.010
I know I could track that within
my own app, but just in

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.960
the system.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.680
ALI PASHA: Yeah.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.500
Absolutely.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.340
One of the things we haven't
shown is the actual UI, but

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.350
there's a comprehensive
reporting.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:09.070
And reporting you can do
on various dimensions.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.770
You can do it on advertiser,
you could do it on banner

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.360
size, you can do it on specific
links that are

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.320
performing best for you.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.050
All of that's there, that's
pretty standard.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.907
AUDIENCE: Is that available
through an API as well, or is

00:41:22.907 --> 00:41:26.050
that just the visual interface
on the website?

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.510
ALI PASHA: So that information
is not

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.960
available through the API.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.870
So you'll have to go--

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:33.320
and that's kind of what
Shaun's point was with

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.280
aggregation.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.130
So through the API, we will
provide you the raw data, and

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.500
the aggregation, which is what
reports does-- which is why it

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.070
takes more time-- is every
night we go in and we

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:47.950
calculate based on various
pivots and

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.390
then generate reports.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.620
So if you wanted that scenario,
what we could do is

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.167
we could FTP that data to you
daily in a CSV format.

00:41:56.167 --> 00:41:56.614
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.864
ALI PASHA: Sure.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.200
AUDIENCE: Any best practices
for placing affiliate links

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.560
for publishers in terms
of web search?

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.690
How many links per page, what do
you guys recommend in terms

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.640
of best practices?

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.570
ALI PASHA: I'm not the
expert on this.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.660
I don't really know.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.970
If you email me, I know there
are people on our team who may

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:17.950
have more information
than I do on this.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.090
Because we don't actually
spend as much

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.100
time running the programs.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.680
I only get product requests.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.920
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.160
SHAUN COX: Just a little brief
thing is most the time, the

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.710
advertisers who are in the
Affiliate Channel, it doesn't

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.750
mean you're not in other
advertising channels, it just

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.340
means you're part of the
Affiliate Channel as well.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.150
So oftentimes our publishers
will be part of the AdWords as

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:44.030
well as just general AdSense
to help monetize

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.380
their website as well.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.880
And if your content tends to be
mainly commerce in nature,

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.360
the Affiliate Channel is a great
way just to get more

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.590
effective monetization
for your website.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:00.240
AUDIENCE: So I'm interested
in helping ads become more

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.260
authentic by those
deeper links.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.970
In other words, there could be
an item in a shopping basket

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.820
or that somebody's looking at,
but they really want to review

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:11.920
some information which is really
far down, quite deep,

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.080
and perhaps has not been
associated with the shopping

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.380
basket by the advertiser
or by anybody.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.620
It's just that you're smart
enough to know that this is

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.500
really-- you have an intuition
that this is what people are

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.190
looking for.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:26.820
And you showed us the tool,
the deep linking tool.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:32.740
So I'm just trying to get a
handle on, is there some data

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.320
we can get back in order to
share with the advertiser that

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.340
perhaps they should share more
deep data on product?

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:43.560
Or is that something that we
just have to find links and

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:49.100
add the links in order to
associate with an ad?

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.750
In other words, I'm kind
of just interested

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.380
in this deep linking.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:55.400
ALI PASHA: That's interesting.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:02.160
A lot of affiliates think they
offer value by helping the

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.670
advertiser do that.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.510
And the value they offer,
they actually get

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.380
compensated that way.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.420
So say you find a page that
really converts well on the

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:15.490
advertiser's site that the
advertiser hasn't done a

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.760
really good job of surfacing it,
making it easy to navigate

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.010
to, and you've done that
through your website.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.300
There's little incentive for
most affiliates to want to

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.830
share that information because
they're actually converting on

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.800
those sales.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.550
But some do, and advertisers can
aggregate all that data up

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.860
themselves on their end because
they get the same kind

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.610
of data that you're getting, and
they get information about

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.450
what links are converting
for them.

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.880
They can go and take a look
and make those changes

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.750
accordingly.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.460
But there is this incentive.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.980
It's also the value that most
affiliates offer merchants is

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.410
when they make a mistake like
that, they know that they can

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:54.140
still get conversions through
the Affiliate Channel even

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.400
despite that mistake.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.860
And in terms of the deep linking
tool, we need to

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.420
release that, too.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.270
That's already built.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.080
It uses the existing
APIs, which are

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.300
actually public already.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.880
And we just need
to launch that.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.820
And then once you launch that,
it's just a Chrome extension.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.490
You just go to the specific
page you want, click the

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.050
Chrome extension, it'll
give you a link.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.400
It'll just create it for
you right there.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.300
You can copy it and paste
it on your website.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.300
AUDIENCE: My question was

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.390
concerning the Chrome extension.

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:21.160
What if you don't have a

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.600
relationship with that merchant?

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.480
What feedback do you get?

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.490
ALI PASHA: There are two types
of merchants, the ones who are

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.800
public and the ones who run
their private programs.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.150
Private programs, you're not
going to get any feedback.

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:38.520
For ones that run a public
program, they'll just ask you

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.460
to join their program.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.080
So you'll have to go through two
steps instead of one, the

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.490
first one being join a program,
the second one being

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.880
get the link.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.560
SHAUN COX: The actual tool
itself will actually more or

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.640
less check the domain that
you're currently on, figure

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.180
out whether or not Google
Affiliate Network has that

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.540
advertiser in there.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.610
If you're not in a relationship
with that

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.170
advertiser, I think currently,
the display message is like

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.120
"Sorry, you're not in a
relationship." And it may

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.310
actually even have a button
that's like, Request Joining

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:09.920
That Relationship.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.780
AUDIENCE: That would
be nice, yeah.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.190
SHAUN COX: Like we said, this
is actually, one of our tech

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:17.340
leads, Ben Sussman, just
came up with this and

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.510
wanted to try it out.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:22.060
And he wanted to play with
JavaScript actually.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.150
So he did it up.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.950
And this is a v1 iteration.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.460
And most of our API are
currently in v1 beta.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.060
So we're really iterating on
it and trying to get a very

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.650
solid base to truly give you
guys a platform in which you

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.970
can interact and do all the
things you want to do.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.090
Because our goal is to help
you best monetize your

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.930
website, because the more money
you're making, it turns

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:46.945
out the more money we
tend to also make.

00:46:46.945 --> 00:46:49.520
ALI PASHA: And the more money
merchants make as well too.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.650
AUDIENCE: I like
that extension.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:51.880
I could give it a +1.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.905
I would like to see you guys
release as soon as you can.

00:46:55.905 --> 00:46:56.310
ALI PASHA: Absolutely.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.488
We'll get that out there soon.

00:46:58.488 --> 00:47:00.680
SHAUN COX: Thank you.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.780
Are there are any
more questions?

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.940
Thanks again for coming
to our talk.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.715
It's been great

00:47:06.715 --> 00:47:08.190
ALI PASHA: Appreciate it.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.097
