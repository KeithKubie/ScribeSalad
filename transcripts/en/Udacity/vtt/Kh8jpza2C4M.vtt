00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.800
Hi.

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.750
I'm with Jen who's a lead designer
with Google Apps Accessibility.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.780
And Jen has over 15 years
of design experience.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.480
And today, Jen,
I'm really curious to get your insight.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.570
Our students have learned about user
interaction and information design.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.130
What else is important when it
comes to designing a good product?

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.190
I think one of the key things that
a lot of people overlook initially, but

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.245
is extremely important is accessibility.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:26.020
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.610
And what's accessibility?

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.560
&gt;&gt; Accessibility is about trying to
make products that are accessible and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.530
usable by all people regardless
if they have a disability or

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.450
not It's closely related to universal
design, which is all about the process

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.320
of making products usable by people
with all ranges of abilities,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.650
as well as they can use them
in all ranges of situations.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.490
So just thinking about if you
can envision a user using

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.690
your product with one hand, maybe it
wasn't designed intentionally for

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.370
that, but can they use it with one hand?

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.280
And this would benefit users that might
have certain motor impairments, but

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.480
it would also benefit users that maybe
have a hand busy holding a baby or

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.860
a large bag of groceries.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.116
That's kind of the idea
behind accessibility design.

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:17.690
&gt;&gt; Okay, and you mention some of
the impairments that someone might have.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.840
What other sorts of impairments
might people bring to a product that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.824
might prevent them from successfully
using a product in the first place?

00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:28.490
&gt;&gt; There's a number of common
impairments that we consider, and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.270
they range from having visual
impairments, being color blind,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.720
having hearing impairments, cognitive
impairments, and motor impairments.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.860
And the thing to note
with all of these is that

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.360
there's a wide range of severity
within each of these impairments, so

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.180
you could have just slight vision
loss to being totally blind.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.130
And the other thing is
that a lot of people

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.320
tend to have multiple
impairments at one time.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.522
It definitely makes things
interesting to design for, but

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:03.890
it's certainly a reality
that we need to consider.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.162
And one of the things that I always love
to talk to people about and remind them,

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:12.308
when you start to think about designing
for people with disabilities a lot of

00:02:12.308 --> 00:02:16.950
people tend to kind of treat them as
like they're in a separate group.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.665
And it's a group of people that you
could consider or could not consider.

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.490
&gt;&gt; Mm.
&gt;&gt; But in reality, we're all going to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.220
have some sort of impairment most
likely and within our lifetime.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.790
One of the important things that I feel
that people need to keep in mind is that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.910
when you're thinking about people with
disabilities a lot of designers and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.100
different people tend to think of them
as a totally separate group that may or

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.870
may not, or can or
can not be considered in the process.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.170
But in actuality,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.060
all of us are going to have a disability
at some point in our lives.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.920
And these things can be temporary,
like a broken arm.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.160
They can be situational,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.930
like if you're riding a bike and
maybe can't see your small phone screen.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.670
And they can be just natural
progression of aging.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.420
So it's really important
to consider these things.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.260
because if you're not,
in a sense you're not considering

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.560
how to design these products for
yourself at some point.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.330
So, what other considerations, I guess,
or why would it be important for

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.520
entrepreneurs to think
about accessibility first?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.150
&gt;&gt; Well, one huge thing is that there
is a large population of people

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.310
with disabilities.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.210
There's a lot of great research out
there about the demographics of people

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.090
and we compiled some research and
noted that there are more people with

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.950
color blindness than there are native
English speakers in the world.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.670
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.
&gt;&gt; So this is a huge population.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.290
And just thinking as an entrepreneur,
that's a huge pool of people, and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.610
an audience that you can tap into
from a financial profit standpoint.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.920
Obviously, another motivator if
you're looking to get involved

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.225
in education or government.

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:54.230
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; There's some legal considerations

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.620
there and some legal standards
that you need to meet.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.090
But I think most importantly, what we
have found is that, when you consider

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.750
accessibility up front, it often leads
to a much better product for everybody.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.750
And what's one example of a product
like that that you've seen?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.760
&gt;&gt; Well,
one really simple simple example and

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.670
a straightforward thing that everyone
can start doing if you're designing

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.820
a digital product,
is think about can a user

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.950
complete all the necessary tasks on
your product using just a keyboard.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.480
So, not only is this beneficial to
somebody that uses a screen reader or

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.300
doesn't have the dexterity to use
a mouse, but it's also really powerful,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.690
or useful, for
the power users that you might have.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That like to use keyboards,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.770
because they feel it's more efficient.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.300
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.800
Cool.
