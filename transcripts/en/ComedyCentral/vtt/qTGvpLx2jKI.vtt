00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:06.773
- [exhales]

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:09.142
So...
[clears throat]

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.311
Welcome back
to another installment

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:15.115
of "Van and Mike:
The Ascension."

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.216
Um...

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.051
You know.
[chuckles]

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.553
We're doing our best

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.555
to bring you
all the behind-the-scenes

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.490
situations that a person
would experience

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.894
when they're at the top level
of Hollywood stardoms.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.730
And there are--
I mean, am I wrong, Mike?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.732
There's some roadblocks
in the way.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:32.833
- Well, it's like,

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.668
when you start
throwing out gold,

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.270
people get jealous.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.846
I know we only been working
at "Key &amp; Peele"

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.848
on set
for a couple weeks now.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.416
I don't think
we need them anymore.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.684
- Oh, you know what?

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:51.985
I'm glad you voiced it,

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.454
'cause that thought has occurred
to me many a time.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.490
At any rate,
watch this clip.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.458
Oh, look at
this dude's makeup.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.459
- Oh, hey,
what's up, Vandaveon.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.061
- What's going on, dude?

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.564
We've been driving this van
all over the place today, dawg.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.299
I've been running a gypsy cab
up out this motherfucker.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.900
[laughs]

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.235
Titty club, here we come.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.703
No, I'm kidding,
I'm gonna take you to the set.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:10.771
- What are you shooting, man?

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:11.872
- Oh, this is
for prosperity, dude.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:12.940
This is for prosperity.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.341
- Keep your eyes
on the road, man.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.342
- Oh, sorry about that, dawg.

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:16.543
Hold up, man.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.111
Look to the left for me,
see if that car coming.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.279
Look to the left for me,
see if that car.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.714
- Are you kidding me?

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:22.216
- There we go, there we go.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.317
- Are we almost there?

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:25.953
- I just been driving
in circles.

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:28.555
- Zach, tell base camp
we're coming back.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.756
- Yeah, I'll call them
right now.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.593
- Tell them, no, he can't
drive the van anymore.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.428
- Zach, tell base camp
I don't know

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.429
where the location is.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.897
- Don't fucking listen to him.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:38.398
- You don't know--okay.
- No, I don't know.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.833
I thought you had the Waze,
Google Maps or something.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.602
- This is so fucking ridiculous.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.004
- Okay, let me just pitch
one thing.

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.405
I got the best scene
you ain't never heard of.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:46.807
- Ah, a fucking pitch.

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:49.443
- There's a dude who's trying
to hold his breath

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:50.978
and not sneeze,

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:53.313
but then what happen by accident
when he's trying to not sneeze,

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.883
he's also holding
his butt cheeks together,

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:58.151
and then like "hub-uh-uh"
sound go through his body,

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.254
and this nigga fart
out his dick.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:01.455
- That--

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.789
- But I ain't even got
to the good part.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.057
There's a girl in there,

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.059
and she's coming at him
on her knees,

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.861
like, about to suck his dick.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:11.565
And the fart come out his dick
into her mouth.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:12.900
And then she's like,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.702
"I've never experienced
a dick fart before.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.404
You a unique man."

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:21.775
In and out, that's the scene.

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:22.776
What do you think?

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.711
- It's not that bad, actually.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.513
- All right, so,
as you can see in that clip,

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:29.650
I was spending a good deal
of time in that vehicle,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.285
and Peele just talking
the whole time

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:32.553
about how we need to get to set,

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:34.655
we need to get to set,
we need to get to set.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.757
I'm up here trying
to share ideas with him

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:38.358
and bounce new ideas
off of him.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.160
- You broke his mind.
- Do you think so?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.361
You like that idea,
right?

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.964
- He was like,
blip, "Oh, snap.

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.899
These kids is genius."

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.701
And he probably thought
I was a genius too,

00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.102
to be associated with you.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.104
- So, he's like double--
he double intimidated.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.239
- You good.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.807
You got your little
cute shit that you do.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:54.842
We trying to come up here.

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:55.876
- Talking about pigtails.

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:57.177
- Pee-pee Longstocking.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.178
- What? Who?

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.279
- Pee-pee Longstocking.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.714
- Pee-pee Longstocking.

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:02.149
Pee-pee Longstockings.

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.650
- Go tit-for-tat
with me any day.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.751
- Oh, my God.

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.753
He said tit-for-tat
and Pee-pee Longstocking.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.922
Oh, this is me just
riding the wave now.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.858
So here we gonna show you
another sketch,

00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:12.059
a little inside stuff

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.594
back behind the scenes
and whatnot.

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:14.728
Take a look.

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:15.963
- Action.

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:20.701
- Introducing...
Dr. Balance.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:21.835
He's an aging robotic scientist.

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:22.936
- Sir, we're trying
to shoot here.

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:23.937
Can you please move?

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.172
John, can you please move?

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:26.440
We're trying to shoot here.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.575
- It's the Gray Chaser.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:29.576
- John, that's your name?

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:30.878
He's not--

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:31.979
- Doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.215
Excuse me, sir, sir, sir, sir.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.283
There you go.

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:37.484
- Totally dickless.

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:38.719
- No dicks.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:39.820
They got as close
as they could

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.255
when they got
to that Gray Chaser thing,

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:43.290
and then Stan Lee kind of
pointing to her leg

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.591
by her vagina.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.293
- Right.
- But other than that...

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:47.794
Pshh.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.429
It's a barren wasteland.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:50.731
- The vibe on the set
has got weird.

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.366
- The vibe on the set
has got a real tension feel.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:53.600
That's real weird.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.836
I'm not sure how much longer
we can stand for this.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.639
So we will see you next time

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.641
on "Van and Mike:
The Ascension."

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.575
- Peace.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:06.847
- Well, once you hear my idea,

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.549
there's gonna be fanfare,

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.351
and you're gonna make me
executive producer.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:12.753
Everything's gonna
fall into place.

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:16.557
I just want you to think back
to when you were young

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:18.892
and you were just--
you were just

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:20.494
a kid on the streets
with a dream...

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:21.495
- We got to go.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.096
- And a joke about a dick.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.865
- What are you supposed to be
doing right now, Mike?

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.134
What are you supposed to be
doing right now?

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.635
Yeah, exactly.
Okay, so I'm just saying...

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:29.570
- That's a good question,
though, that's a good question.
