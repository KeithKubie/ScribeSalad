00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 align:start position:0%
there for very long uh but I think
 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.459 align:start position:0%
there for very long uh but I think
that's<00:01:53.240><c> replaces</c><00:01:53.719><c> a</c><00:01:53.750><c> strength</c><00:01:54.020><c> because</c><00:01:54.290><c> then</c>

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 align:start position:0%
that's replaces a strength because then
 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.109 align:start position:0%
that's replaces a strength because then
you<00:01:54.590><c> just</c><00:01:54.619><c> have</c><00:01:54.950><c> to</c><00:01:55.070><c> rely</c><00:01:55.340><c> on</c><00:01:55.369><c> the</c><00:01:55.640><c> individual</c>

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
