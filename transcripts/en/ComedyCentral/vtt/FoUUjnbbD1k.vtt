00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.748
- Hey, come on in.

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:18.084
(bouncy keyboard music)

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yes, push and
believe, you got it.

Jonah Ray.

- Brody Stevens.

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You got it,
Steven Brody Stevens

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.162
if you so choose to go that
way, but you don't have to.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.363
- I don't want to.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.599 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So you've, ow, I
hit my elbow, darn it.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.002
I hit my elbow, and where
is the nearest hospital?

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.370
Let me check the call sheet.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.605
- I think you should
just wait a little bit,

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:39.806
I think the pain might go away.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.074 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You gotta be
feeling good, Jonah.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.609
- I feel okay, I'm
getting married.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.310
- Yeah, you're getting married.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.545
- Yeah.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.815
- Where is that gonna
happen, Comic-Con?

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.318
We had a Twitter tiff
regarding the tsunami,

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.587
the great tsunami of Japan,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.791 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I went on Twitter
and I made a joke about,

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.359
can somebody check my mail

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.862
before the tsunami
hits my condominium.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.966
It got 17 retweets, and
then you went on Twitter,

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.104 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you said, 'Brody,'
'cause you're from Hawaii,

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.372
like that was a real,

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:16.276
the tsunami could've
impacted Honolulu.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.244 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yes it was headed
for Honolulu.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.679
- No joke.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.548 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Parents are there,
they live near the water.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:25.251
- And you said, at
Brodyismefriend,

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.387
'Brody, shut the fuck up.'

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.288
- Is that all I said?

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:29.122
- Yes.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.123
- Really?

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.591
- Maybe you had,
do you remember?

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.093 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm out of my mind, I can't
get a hold of my parents,

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.328 align:start size:97% position:3%
when I finally do, my dad
says they're just gonna stay

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.363
and wait it out,
I'm going crazy.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.299
And then I saw your tweet,

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.835
I could've easily just
emailed or texted you,

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.570 align:start size:94% position:6%
but for some reason I
did it in a public forum,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.971
and it was not cool of me.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.272
- Really?

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.241
- Yeah, I think that's a
silly thing that I did,

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.509
I regretted doing it.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.910
- I'm not gonna say
I held a grudge,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.679 align:start size:84% position:16%
but it was something
I thought about,

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.183
now I feel so much better,
I got it off of my chest,

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.651
you got it off your chest.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.120
- Well, it wasn't on my chest.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.654
- It wasn't?

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:02.856
- No I hadn't really thought
about either of those tweets

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.157
since the moment they happened.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.493 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I let it go now
once I heard you say

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.696
it was wrong and you
felt bad about it.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.998
- You let it go when I
put the blame on myself.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.233
- Yes.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.434
- Yeah so when I was
like it was my fault,

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.336 align:start size:84% position:16%
you were like oh this
is such a relief.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.737
- Right.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.372 align:start size:97% position:3%
Thank you very much,
Jonah, you're a good sport,

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.941 align:start size:94% position:6%
Johan Ray, he's got an
album, he's got a podcast,

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.777
and he's got a pilot, and
it's gonna get picked up.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:25.712
- Ooh, is it?

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.614
This is great news!

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.115
I'm gonna call everyone
I know and tell them

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:32.385
that Brody said my
pilot got picked up.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:35.121 line:0%
Mom, I can get us
out of trouble.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.925 line:0%
- Get to high ground.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start size:97% position:3%
Yes, what a great video,
it's inspired me to exercise,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.371 align:start size:97% position:3%
it should inspire you to
click and subscribe and like

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:55.642
and even tweet at me,
whoo, feeling good.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.712
Laughter makes me exercise,

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.482
yes, you got it,
push and believe.
