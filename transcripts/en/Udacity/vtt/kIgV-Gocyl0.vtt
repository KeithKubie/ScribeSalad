00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And the answer is relatively straightforward a 10% boost in performance goes from 30 to 33 m

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and a subsequent 2 m gives us 35 m as our new mean.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Our Ïƒ increases in proportion to the first term to 5.5.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The fixed offset of 2 m doesn't affect the spread so this all just stays the same.
