“These are the deus ex panels which you
can see look really nice.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.460
With this arm, I'm able to open and close
as you can see, tense my muscles, there you

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.370
go, I can change the thumb, and then if I
press the middle button it flashes.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.150
I love it because everyone's so distracted
by the arm, opening and closing it that AHHHH

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.930
that's mad and I love the reactions.”

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.820
“Open Bionics is a Bristol based startup
and our mission is to create and democratize

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.960
technology that enhances the human body, so
in other words, we turn disabilities into

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.899
super powers.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.359
The Hero Arm is our first bionic product,
it's the first medically certified, 3D printed

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.199
bionic hand and it's also the most affordable
bionic hand available.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.440
We've got a multi grip hand with four motors
inside controlling individual fingers and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.280
moving the thumb.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.969
The Hero Arm works by picking up signals from
a user's muscles, it has sensors on the inside

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.500
of the socket and they sit on top of the muscles
and detect a small voltage when the muscles

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.869
are flexed and the hand will move in response.”

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.049
“I didn't think this kind of technology
could be possible, especially low-cost.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.141
it's just crazy, especially what I can do
with the arm compared to what I could do with

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.141
it three years ago.

00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:20.409
But even back then, that was still mad.”

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.090
“The first thing that happens is a prosthetist
will get a model of their arm, which could

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.900
be physical or digital from a 3D scan.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.429
We feed that into our software algorithms
to create the bespoke Hero Arm for that individual

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.549
person and we then export the files for the
3D printers, 3D print them and then we assemble

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.469
everything together into that person's Hero
Arm.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.189
We've been continually testing with people
from the very beginning, and getting feedback

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.950
on things like how long can they wear it...do
they experience any discomfort at any time

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.210
or um how can we design the the socket and
the liner to fit to feel really comfortable

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.210
on their skin.”

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.240
“Essentially it's just gotten better because
first it was like oh yeah it just needs to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.930
open and close, but actually, being able to
pick up more extra items, or even picking

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.930
up something heavy.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.790
Holding a tray, opening a door, opening a
bottle of water is a major thing.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.720
“One of the really cool things about the
design of the Hero Arm is that it has adjustability

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.980
built into the socket, so it can cope with
maybe a little bit more growth than usual.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.150
And that means that as a child grows, their
prosthesis can grow with them.”

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.570
“I used to have quite a couple of prosthesis
that didn't really do much they just sort

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.320
of stale really in a sense.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.660
It didn't do anything for me, it made me stick
out and I did not like them.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.380
I think I just got them because I thought
that was the normal thing to do.”

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.830
“That's one of the things that we're most
proud of is the the fact that you can change

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.980
the look and style of it, we've got a customizer
so you can design them yourself, change the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.810
colors, it's an expression of individuality
and it means that you have choice over the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.830
way that your prosthesis looks.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.010
We much prefer the kind of prostheses that
we're making which don't pretend to look like

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.830
a human limb, and they're saying you're unique,
you're different and that's brilliant, you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.830
should celebrate that.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.340
Same way like the glasses I'm wearing today,
I wouldn't wear skin colored glasses frames

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.050
that try and look like eyes, it's totally
ridiculous to even consider that.”

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.340
“People's eyes light up and it's just nice
to have questions like how does this arm work

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.590
as opposed to what happened to you kind of
thing.”

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.060
“We've done lots of open source work.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.860
By releasing those design files, giving people
those tools, we'll be able to ultimately integrate

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.540
some of those really cool new technologies
back into our products in the future.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.240
We've seen some incredible projects from researchers
at different universities.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.310
There was a researcher that worked with a
upper limb different musician, he was able

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.610
to independently control each finger to play
the piano and that was using one of our hands.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.590
It shows that these technologies that get
talked about a lot in the media and get hyped

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.050
up, they can actually be translated into something
that people can genuinely get and use.”

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.900
“Seeing these kids Tilly and Cameron wearing
these arms really warms my heart because as

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:07.650
a kid, I dreamt of something like that and
now it's reality, it's just overwhelming in

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:22.570
a way because I just can't believe I'm part
of it.”
