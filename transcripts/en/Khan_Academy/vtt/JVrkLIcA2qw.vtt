00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.410
The main mast of a fishing boat
is supported by a sturdy

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.720
rope that extends from the top
of the mast to the deck.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.990
If the mast is 20 feet tall and
the rope attaches to the

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.390
deck 15 feet away from
the base of the mast,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.110
how long is the rope?

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.260
So let's draw ourselves a boat
and make sure we understand

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.150
what the deck and the mast
and all of that is.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.620
So let me draw a boat.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.200
I'll start with yellow.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.270
So let's say that
this is my boat.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.740
That is the deck of the boat.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.100
And the boat might look
something like this.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.480
It's a sailing boat.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.210
This is the water down here.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.875
And then the mast is the thing
that holds up the sail.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:56.630
So let me draw ourselves
a mast.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.550
And they say the mast
is 20 feet tall.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.769
So this distance right
here is 20 feet.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.100
That is what is holding
up the sail.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.230
I can draw it as a pole so it's
a little bit clearer.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.960
Even shade it in if we like.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.200
And then they say a rope
attaches to the deck 15 feet

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.670
away from the base of the mast.
So this is the base of

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.960
the mast. This is the
deck right here.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.190
The rope attaches 15 feet away
from the base of the mast.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.590
So if this is the base of the
mast, we go 15 feet, might be

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.255
about that distance
right there.

00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:32.505
Let me mark that.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.620
And the rope attaches
right here.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.340
From the top of the mast
all the way that base.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.290
So the rope goes like that.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.330
And then they ask us, how
long is the rope?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.470
So there's a few things
you might realize.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.550
We're dealing with
a triangle here.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.750
And it's not any triangle.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.680
We're assuming that the mast
goes straight up and that the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.370
deck is straight
left and right.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.970
So this is a right triangle.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.090
This is a 90 degree
angle right here.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.660
And we know that, if we know two
sides of a right triangle,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.600
we can always figure out the
third side of a right triangle

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.850
using the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.220
And all that tells us is it the
sum of the squares of the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.610
shorter sides of the triangle
are going to be equal to the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.280
square of the longer side.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.540
And that longer side is
call the hypotenuse.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.010
And in all cases, the hypotenuse
is the side

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.360
opposite the 90 degree angle.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.720
It is always going to
be the longest side

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.760
of our right triangle.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.580
So we need to figure out
the hypotenuse here.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.920
We know the lengths of the
two shorter sides.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.210
So we can see that if we take 15
squared, that's one of the

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.280
short sides, I'm squaring it.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.050
And then add that to the square
of the other shorter

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.125
side, to 20 feet squared.

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.620
And when I say the shorter side,
I mean relative to the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.260
hypotenuse.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.700
The hypotenuse will always
be the longest side.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.670
Let's say the hypotenuse is in
green just so we get our color

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.940
coding nice.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.260
That is going to be equal
to the rope squared.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.520
Or the length of the rope.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.070
Let's call this distance
right here r.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.320
r for rope.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.440
So 15 squared plus 20
squared is going to

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.080
be equal to r squared.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.510
And what's 15 squared?

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.260
It's 225.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.840
20 squared is 400.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.460
And that's going to be
equal to r squared.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.260
Now 225 plus 400 is 625.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.430
625 is equal to r squared.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.443
And then we can take the
principal root of both sides

00:03:57.443 --> 00:03:58.430
of this equation.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.370
Because we're talking about
distances, we want the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.800
positive square root.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.460
So you take the positive square
root, or the principal

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.140
root, of both sides
of this equation.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.050
And you are left with
r is equal to the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.540
square root of 625.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.960
You can play with it a little
bit if you like.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.500
But if you've ever played with
numbers around 25, you'll see

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.740
that this is 25 squared.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.520
So r is equal to the square
root of 625, which is 25.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.160
So this distance right here,
the length of the rope, is

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.700
equal to 25 feet.
