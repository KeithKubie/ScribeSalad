(mouse clicking)
(electronic jingle)

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.460
- Program Director the UCSF Family

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.166
and Community Medicine Residency.

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:17.405
She is also faculty in UCSF's
Addiction Medicine Fellowship

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:19.737
and helped to write
the national guidelines

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:22.170
in the management of opioid use disorder

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.630
in pregnant and parenting
women and their children.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.440
And Diana is gonna talk to us today

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.600
about the pediatric effects
of parental substance use.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.650
We're gonna take a couple
minutes for questions

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.780
after her talk because she's gotta go

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.040
pick up a child after that.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.353
So Diane, thank you for being here.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.598
- Thank you.

00:00:45.598 --> 00:00:47.690
And thank you to the conference schedulers

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.123
for being so accommodating.

00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:51.410
So yeah, this is, I think,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.003
gonna be a little bit of a different talk.

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.326
I spend most of my time
thinking about addiction

00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:01.010
and how we address it both as clinicians

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.336
and as a society.

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:04.880
So you're gonna see a lot of that come out

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.229
in what I'm talking about.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.447
I'm gonna be focusing on the impact

00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:11.776
of parental substance use
on pediatric development,

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:16.191
but I can't help but
include some commentary

00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:20.720
on our society and the way we
treat people with addictions.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.230
So that's gonna be all mixed in.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.220
In fact, okay, I've got
nothing to disclose.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.943
Nobody's paying me
anything besides my salary.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.830
So today, we're going to explore the fetal

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.024
and pediatric impact of
intrauterine drug exposure.

00:01:38.024 --> 00:01:41.800
We're also gonna explore
the pediatric impact

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.660
of parental substance use.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.020
And I'm finding more and
more as I think about this,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.689
I'm finding it really
useful to separate those

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.790
as two related but separate issues

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.822
that actually require different
kinds of interventions.

00:01:54.822 --> 00:01:57.080
And then we're gonna talk about strategies

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.860
for mitigating the impact
of parental substance use

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.483
including intrauterine exposure.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.053
I want to start.

00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:06.660
Here's my commentary to begin with.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.050
So people with substance use disorder

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.940
have a disease that responds to treatment.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.731
This is a graph of relapse rates

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.147
for other chronic diseases.

00:02:15.147 --> 00:02:16.560
This is from an old study

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.597
where they looked at people
who had a chronic disease

00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.682
that was well controlled,

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.690
and they watched them for a year

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.880
and watched what percent of them

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.360
lose control at some point in that year.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.000
And it's not that different
for substance use disorder

00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:35.520
as it is for some of these
other chronic diseases.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.353
The real difference

00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:38.810
is that when your hypertension
goes out of control,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.547
it's like you have a troubling
visit with your doctor

00:02:42.547 --> 00:02:46.654
and they increase your meds,
and you're back to okay.

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:50.050
Whereas with substance use
disorder when you relapse,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.900
it can be that your whole
life falls apart, right?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050
So it's much more of a dramatic relapse,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.320
but the nature of the
disease is not that different

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.500
from other chronic diseases.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.790
I could talk with you
about that for an hour,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.594
but that's all I'm gonna say about that.

00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:07.577
What's been nice as the
opioid crisis has unfolded

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:10.070
is that the public health conversation

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.733
really has acknowledged
that with the opioid crisis.

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:15.262
There's been a relatively sympathetic

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:17.168
response to the opioid crisis

00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:20.650
that is in part because of the groundwork

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.210
that's been laid by addiction medicine

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.789
where we have a lot better understanding

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:27.946
of the neurologic antecedents to addiction

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:31.887
and the neurologic and kind of
organic nature of addiction.

00:03:31.887 --> 00:03:35.236
And it's partly because of racism, right?

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:38.802
The opioid epidemic is primarily

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:41.490
throughout the country a white epidemic,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.307
and so the public health response

00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:44.728
and the public response in general

00:03:44.728 --> 00:03:47.159
has been a more sympathetic response

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.910
than our response to other
drug crises in the past.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.340
And I think it's very important for us

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.207
to be aware of that so
what we can do better

00:03:57.207 --> 00:04:00.072
the next time there's a drug crisis

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:02.233
that may not be predominantly white.

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:05.160
I will say in California actually,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.583
the opioid crisis is
much more multiracial.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.340
So it's a little bit
different here in California,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.700
but that is an important part

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.323
of what's happening nationwide.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.550
Now, if you look,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.624
these are some typical
images from public health

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:24.813
and sort of laypress
about the opioid crisis

00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:27.050
and you can see how sympathetic they are.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.060
Like there's somebody
who's trapped by the pills

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.525
and the opioid epidemic hits home.

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.860
These are the images you see

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.258
if you Google addicted mother.

00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:43.258
So the images suddenly become
totally unsympathetic, right?

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:45.842
The image over on your left,

00:04:45.842 --> 00:04:47.880
the main character is the fetus.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.520
The second character is the needle

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.360
and the mother is like some
kind of drug delivery mechanism.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.737
And we see that,

00:04:54.737 --> 00:04:58.456
I see it so intensely in the
conversations we're having

00:04:58.456 --> 00:05:00.985
around pregnant people using drugs.

00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:04.440
In this one up here, the baby's
being born out of a syringe

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.800
as if there's like no
parent at all involved

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.010
and all that this baby is made out of

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.000
is its exposure to heroin.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.040
And so I want to just highlight that

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.460
because this is a really emotional issue.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.670
And it's an issue where we get

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.770
extremely protective of the fetus,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.716
which is, you know, a reasonable thing.

00:05:23.716 --> 00:05:27.030
And also, I find it increasingly important

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.538
to just recall that there's a mother too.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:34.730
There's a mother who has
problems and needs help too.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.333
And when we fall into kind
of demonizing the mother

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:41.173
and sort of reifying the fetus

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:43.490
when we talk about this issue,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.368
we forget the reality that
they're actually connected

00:05:47.368 --> 00:05:50.540
and they kind of need each
other and care about each other.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.630
And when I work with pregnant women

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.900
who have substance use disorder,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.256
the question they ask me always

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:58.140
when we're discussing treatment options

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.890
is well, what's best for the baby?

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.490
What can I do to make sure my
baby doesn't have withdrawal?

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.396
Like they want healthy babies

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:08.530
and babies want moms, right?

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.190
Who are present, and
are healthy, and around.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.421
And so this tendency we have

00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:16.370
to separate the needs of these two beings

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.272
as though they're not intimately
reliant on each other,

00:06:21.272 --> 00:06:25.950
I think it's an inaccurate understanding

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.950
of what's happening.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.080
In these states in the country,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.753
pregnancy is considered child abuse

00:06:32.753 --> 00:06:36.200
which you can imagine
impacts people's desire

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.280
to show up for prenatal care
or tell us they need help.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.680
You can also imagine that
it impacts the conversation

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.147
about abortion access

00:06:43.147 --> 00:06:46.343
when you start labeling
fetuses as children.

00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:50.530
And so I've already said this,

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.258
but the thing that I want us
to remember over and over again

00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:57.960
is that if we want to help these children,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.469
and these fetuses, and these babies,

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:03.417
we really need to help the whole family

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:05.990
because what's good for the baby

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.913
is usually the same thing as
what's good for the family.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.070
Okay.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.190
So I mentioned earlier

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.180
that I'm interested in separating out

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.410
the impact of intrauterine exposure

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.890
and the impact of parental
use during childhood.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.650
And so I've put up just
kind of some theoretical,

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.500
theoretically we might imagine that

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.111
parental use could lead to
behavioral issues in the child

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:36.620
to an increased risk of substance
use later for the child,

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.070
to cognitive issues, ADHD.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.470
And then intrauterine exposure

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.570
might also lead to all of those things,

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.630
and also we'd be looking specifically for

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.908
congenital anomalies,
intrauterine fetal demise,

00:07:48.908 --> 00:07:51.402
growth restriction, preterm birth.

00:07:51.402 --> 00:07:53.043
So we're gonna look at

00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:55.810
some of the literature on specific drugs

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.040
and see what we actually
know about the impact

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.770
of intrauterine exposure and parental use.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.530
So anyone know which
of the following drugs

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.690
is the most likely to cause fetal harm.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.253
Raise your hand if it's heroin.

00:08:10.102 --> 00:08:12.640
(laughing) Okay, people wanted to.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.990
If it's methamphetamine?

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.823
Okay.

00:08:15.823 --> 00:08:17.000
If it's alcohol?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.580
I mean, yeah, right?

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.920
Right, right, right.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.023
And second is probably tobacco actually.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.251
So you know this 'cause
you know about FASD

00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:29.513
better than most audiences,

00:08:29.513 --> 00:08:33.520
but we spend so much time
getting really worked up here,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.283
and like this has been going on forever

00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:38.940
and we've not gotten a handle on it.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.383
So good job knowing that.

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:45.472
So we're gonna go through
the different drugs

00:08:45.472 --> 00:08:49.549
and drug classes that we
know enough to talk about.

00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:51.490
And I'm gonna start with opioids

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.890
'cause that's where all the press is.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.960
So I'm gonna talk just really
quickly about maternal risks

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.720
and then fetal, pediatric,
and neonatal risks.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.096
So maternal risk.

00:09:01.096 --> 00:09:02.260
If you're injecting,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.060
you have a whole bunch
of infectious risks.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.360
Without injection, you still actually

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.850
have higher rates of STI,
higher rates of violence,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.960
withdrawal, and for some reason,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.150
this slide doesn't have overdose and death

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.060
which should be on here.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.360
And really, it's the withdrawal,
and the overdose, and death

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.040
that are attributable to the opioids.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.530
The rest are attributable to things

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.333
that come with opioid use disorder.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.990
Now, for the fetus, the newborn,

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.122
and the child as the child grows,

00:09:31.122 --> 00:09:33.870
there is increased risk of preterm birth

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.320
among children born to women
with opioid use disorder.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.430
There's increased risk
of growth restriction

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.173
and low birth weight.

00:09:42.173 --> 00:09:45.460
There's increased risk of
exposure to infections,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.570
exposure to other drugs.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.783
Now, all of these are not
actually caused by the opioid

00:09:50.783 --> 00:09:52.668
and the reason I can say that

00:09:52.668 --> 00:09:56.142
is that when you treat opioid use disorder

00:09:56.142 --> 00:09:59.490
with buprenorphine, which is an opioid

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.460
that we give for the treatment
of opioid use disorder.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.058
When a pregnant person takes
that throughout pregnancy,

00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:09.169
their risk of preterm birth

00:10:09.169 --> 00:10:14.169
and of growth restriction
normalizes, right?

00:10:14.286 --> 00:10:16.440
So we don't think it's the opioid itself

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.360
that's causing the problem.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.470
We think it's a bunch of other things

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.837
that are associated with opioid use,

00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:23.137
and I've got a slide on
that in just a minute.

00:10:24.634 --> 00:10:26.463
There's a little.

00:10:26.463 --> 00:10:29.210
This should be like half an asterisk here

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.127
'cause maybe it's caused by the opioid.

00:10:31.127 --> 00:10:34.110
Some mixed evidence about
cognitive and behavioral issues,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.710
and I'll show you some studies.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.010
Maybe caused by the opioid.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.740
More likely, in my opinion,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.893
caused by the environment after birth.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.730
And then of course,

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.295
neonatal opioid withdrawal
syndrome or NOWS

00:10:47.295 --> 00:10:51.121
occurs in 50 to 80% of exposed infants.

00:10:51.121 --> 00:10:54.220
Has not been associated,
and we have looked,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.860
it has not been associated
with developmental issues

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.510
further down the line,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.299
but is a difficult phase

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:02.250
for the neonate to have to go through

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.633
and for the family actually
to have to go through.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.175
So here's that image I was promising you.

00:11:08.175 --> 00:11:11.199
This was a paper that
was published last year

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:14.732
where they explored, and I
know this print is small,

00:11:14.732 --> 00:11:18.501
the many factors other
than opioid exposure

00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:20.974
that are impacting a fetus

00:11:20.974 --> 00:11:23.680
of a mom with opioid use disorder.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.077
So maybe poorer prenatal care,

00:11:27.077 --> 00:11:30.322
maybe decreased access to healthcare,

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:34.943
maybe neighborhood
violence, maybe maternal.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.070
The mothers have higher rates
of adverse childhood events.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.750
They have trauma histories.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.530
They may have emotional dysregulation.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.640
They may have nutrition access issues.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.990
So there's all these things

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.620
that I'm not gonna read
through all of them

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.810
that are impacting the fetus
during birth, during pregnancy.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.772
And one of the things we want to target

00:11:53.772 --> 00:11:55.944
when we're treating these parents

00:11:55.944 --> 00:11:59.030
is all of this stuff, right?

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.630
So it may be okay,

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.520
and this is what we've seen
specifically with buprenorphine.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.650
We can replace the opioid
with another opioid.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.023
If that stabilizes all of this,
the fetus seems to do okay.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.660
Alright.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.170
Here's a painful, painful slide.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.740
So an example.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.990
I'm gonna show you two studies

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.298
looking at the impact of
opioids on development.

00:12:24.298 --> 00:12:28.345
So this is a study where
they looked at 72 children

00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:30.820
and they tested them at one, two, three,

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.105
four and a half, and
eight and a half years.

00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:35.810
These were children of
mothers who used opioids

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.920
and other substances.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.900
It is very difficult to find
people who only use opioids

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.530
and don't smoke, or drink,

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.010
or occasionally use other substances,

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.310
so these are poorly controlled studies.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.138
This study actually only,
in terms of the environment,

00:12:49.138 --> 00:12:52.490
controlled for foster
placement and heroin use

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.900
as opposed to prescription use.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.900
And what they found was
that in the female children,

00:12:58.902 --> 00:13:02.100
they found a statistically
significant difference

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.450
in cognitive scores at
eight and a half years

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.279
but not prior to that,
which I think suggests

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:10.062
that it was more of an environmental issue

00:13:10.062 --> 00:13:12.793
than an intrauterine exposure issue.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.269
In the boys, interestingly,
they found p values

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:20.310
of statistical significance throughout

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.250
which, it's really hard to
interpret what that means.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.100
Does that mean that boys

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.450
are more vulnerable to opioid exposure?

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.910
Is it that they're more
vulnerable to the stressors

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.542
like elevated cortisol
levels intrauterine?

00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:34.660
Are they more vulnerable to withdrawal?

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.823
We don't know, but that is one finding.

00:13:39.722 --> 00:13:42.822
More recently, there was this study

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:46.930
where they followed a group of women

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.830
who had been treated with buprenorphine

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.150
and methadone during their pregnancy

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.150
meaning there was
continued opioid exposure,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.960
but a resolution of those other stressors.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.710
And they measured a whole bunch
of things in these children

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.780
including going into their homes

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.930
and looking for acceptance in parenting,

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.350
organization in the home,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.180
learning materials that were available,

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.549
and then all of these indicators

00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:17.581
of various aspects of development.

00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:22.581
And what they found was
that up to 36 months,

00:14:23.047 --> 00:14:26.014
children follow a path
of normal development.

00:14:26.014 --> 00:14:29.960
Growth parameters suggest
that prenatal opioid exposure

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.200
does not affect normal
physical development

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.760
and conclusions are similar

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.003
in terms of cognitive, language,
sensory, and temperament.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.840
So again, we think

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.280
that if we can normalize
those social exposures,

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.770
we can actually resolve

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.223
most of what we see in
some of the studies.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.100
Cocaine and methamphetamine use.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.550
So maternal risks are many.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:58.323
So in addition to the sort of
infective risks of injection,

00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:02.312
there are all kinds of
cardiovascular risks

00:15:02.312 --> 00:15:05.770
and psychosis and formication.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.740
Do people know what formication is?

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.573
It's where you feel like

00:15:08.573 --> 00:15:09.950
there are bugs crawling in your skin

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.320
and so there's that
picking that goes with it.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.774
The psychosis associated
with methamphetamine use

00:15:14.774 --> 00:15:18.640
specifically can last up to
a year after stopping use.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.913
It's really profound.

00:15:22.201 --> 00:15:27.201
For a fetus, a neonate, and a child,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.416
we see explicit impact on the placenta

00:15:31.416 --> 00:15:33.894
from the repeated hypertension

00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:37.550
that comes with exposure to
cocaine and methamphetamine.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.380
So we see placental insufficiency

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.180
which means less blood flow to the fetus

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.920
which means growth restriction,
reduced birth weight.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.990
We have higher risk of those.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.961
We have higher risk of
placental abruption.

00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:50.933
Higher risk of intrauterine fetal demise.

00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:54.730
And maybe in terms of development,

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.030
maybe some attentional issues.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.897
I'll show you a little bit
about what we know there.

00:15:58.897 --> 00:16:00.370
But I want to remind us,

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.320
and I alluded to this at the beginning,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.150
that back when, what was
it, the '80s and '90s

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.429
when we were seeing increasing
rates of crack cocaine use,

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:16.429
the media went wild on
this notion of crack babies

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.410
and absolutely demonized
mothers about their use.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.940
And I use this, again, to
highlight the racial differences

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.020
between what we're doing
now and what we did then,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.853
but also to remind us

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:31.240
like we're leaning in that
direction a little bit right now

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.440
when we talk about pregnant women

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.230
using opioids in the press.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.330
I think it's really important for us

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
to learn from our history

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:43.330
because here's a systematic
review that came out in 2010,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.864
so after all of that had died down.

00:16:45.864 --> 00:16:47.950
The potentially stigmatizing label

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.640
of the so-called crack baby

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.860
preceded the evidence now accumulating

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.850
from well-designed
prospective investigations

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.696
that have revealed less severe sequelae

00:16:57.696 --> 00:17:00.350
than originally anticipated.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.530
Prenatal cocaine exposure

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.620
appears to be associated with
statistically significant

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.320
but subtle decrements in neurobehavioural,

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.410
cognitive, and language functions,

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.340
especially when viewed in the
contexts of other exposures

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.300
and the caregiving environment.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.133
Okay.

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:17.650
So basically the same thing
I've been saying about opioids.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.490
There may be some subtle decrements,

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.097
but they may be either moderated by

00:17:24.097 --> 00:17:26.083
or caused by the environment.

00:17:27.142 --> 00:17:30.520
Here's a study where they took adolescents

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.120
who had had over 99 days of
in utero cocaine exposure

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.180
and they measured all these tests.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.593
And you can see that
they're pretty similar.

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.330
There may be a few places

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.236
where there's some subtly lower scores

00:17:46.236 --> 00:17:50.590
among the adolescents who were
exposed to cocaine in utero,

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.250
but it's quite subtle actually.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.387
And the kind of thing that
could probably be mediated

00:17:55.387 --> 00:17:59.043
by support in the home.

00:18:02.585 --> 00:18:04.336
So tobacco.

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:08.283
So we know the maternal risks
for tobacco use are many.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.500
For the newborn and the fetus,

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.140
what we see is again
placental insufficiency

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.830
from the vasoconstriction
caused by nicotine,

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.060
intrauterine growth restriction
for the same reason,

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.470
again, an increased risk
of placental abruption,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.330
again, an increased risk of preterm birth.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.632
For newborns, there's an increased risk

00:18:27.632 --> 00:18:29.244
of sudden infant death syndrome

00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:31.740
if parents are smoking
cigarettes in the home.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.080
We don't know the mechanism
of that, but it's real.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.283
We also see facial clefts,

00:18:39.014 --> 00:18:42.862
and we see some evidence
of maybe some ADHD,

00:18:42.862 --> 00:18:46.570
and increased rates of
substance use in adolescence.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.300
Again, are these two from
the home environment?

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.133
We don't know.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.720
Cannabis.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.120
This is an area of great
interest and debate right now

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.603
and there's very little evidence
to work with as we argue.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.307
So parental risks.

00:19:08.307 --> 00:19:12.230
In adolescence, there does
appear to be an increased risk

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.865
of developing psychosis and depression

00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:18.530
among people who use
cannabis in adolescence.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.730
That's a strong correlation.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.680
We also know that there's an association

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.240
with decreased school performance,

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.742
reduced cognitive performance.

00:19:26.742 --> 00:19:30.149
So in general, those of us in
the addiction medicine world

00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:34.275
who tend to be like legalize everything

00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:36.711
or at least decriminalize everything,

00:19:36.711 --> 00:19:39.990
we still get nervous about
cannabis use in adolescence.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.300
That's something we try to prevent.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.430
In adulthood, there do
seem to be minimal risks.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.803
There is a risk of developing
cannabis use disorder.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.030
The research suggests that the rate

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.021
of developing cannabis
use disorder is about 10%

00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:59.359
which is higher than
probably most people think.

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:03.743
So that's the main risk of
cannabis use for the mother.

00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:09.280
For the fetus, really as I said,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.780
scant literature, lots of debate,

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.310
maybe increased risk of memory
issues, attentional issues.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.450
Quality of data is very poor.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.493
And that's all I have to say
about that unfortunately.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.690
We talk more in the questions

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.890
if people have specific questions.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.433
Alcohol, again, you
probably have a good sense

00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:32.023
of maternal risk of alcohol use.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.670
Pediatric risks, you
also have a good sense of

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.503
in this audience.

00:20:37.503 --> 00:20:38.336
That's clear, right?

00:20:38.336 --> 00:20:41.300
So really, FASD is the thing
we're most worried about

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.193
with intrauterine exposure to alcohol.

00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:50.520
And you probably know the
literature on FASD as well as I do

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.670
but you know that we haven't
identified a safe level of use.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:55.670
And what we do know

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.940
is that there seems to be a dose response

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.490
so the more somebody drinks,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.430
the more likely they are to develop FASD,

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.590
but we have not been able to say

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.017
that below a certain threshold,

00:21:05.017 --> 00:21:06.840
you don't have an elevated risk.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.330
And that's why the current recommendation

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.980
is not to drink during pregnancy.

00:21:13.753 --> 00:21:16.240
So this is a table that
basically summarizes

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.963
most of what I just said.

00:21:19.648 --> 00:21:21.348
The things, yeah.

00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:22.970
This is most of what I just said.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.390
And what you'll notice
is that not surprisingly,

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.998
it's really nicotine and alcohol

00:21:26.998 --> 00:21:30.969
that seem to have the
greatest known impact anyway.

00:21:30.969 --> 00:21:34.150
And that we have a lot of questions about

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.630
whether the impacts on development

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.853
are environmental or organic.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.090
Okay.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.985
So how do we support children
whose parents use substances?

00:21:50.985 --> 00:21:54.815
And there are three things
that I would recommend.

00:21:54.815 --> 00:21:57.600
One is that we treat
parental substance use

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.750
and that we think of it not
just as maternal substance use

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.030
but parental substance use

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.801
'cause it's really whoever is in the house

00:22:03.801 --> 00:22:05.727
with childcare responsibilities

00:22:05.727 --> 00:22:08.343
that is impacting that
child's development.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.230
We enhance parenting and attachment.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.140
I'm gonna talk with you a
little bit in a few minutes

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.670
about what we know about parenting

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.780
among people who use substances

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.090
and how that impacts attachment.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.447
And then that we work societally

00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:26.370
and also individually to
enhance the home school

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.003
and after school
environment for these kids.

00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:31.883
There's something else I was gonna say.

00:22:35.256 --> 00:22:36.320
I know.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.243
So I will tell you one
of the recommendations

00:22:38.243 --> 00:22:39.981
of the Substance Abuse

00:22:39.981 --> 00:22:42.604
and Mental Health Services
Administration around this

00:22:42.604 --> 00:22:44.046
is specifically,

00:22:44.046 --> 00:22:46.630
the place they've looked at
the data the most closely

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.670
and made recommendations

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.420
is around children who are
exposed to opioids in utero.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.520
Their recommendation is that we screen

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.360
according to the regular well child

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.010
screening recommendations for development.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.030
So they're not recommending

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.899
additional developmental screening

00:23:03.899 --> 00:23:06.247
and that we respond as we would

00:23:06.247 --> 00:23:10.763
with any other developmental
issue on our screening.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.030
Okay, so treating parental substance use.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.820
There are many, many, many options

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.811
for treating parental substance use.

00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:20.802
There are lots of places you can go.

00:23:20.802 --> 00:23:23.810
You can go to residential
treatment, outpatient treatment.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.300
You can come to a clinic

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.510
and get medication
straight just from a clinic

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.950
which can be quite effective,

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.260
particularly for opioid use disorder.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.474
You can go to things
like 12 Steps programs,

00:23:34.474 --> 00:23:36.020
peer support programs.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.030
Smart Recovery is like a version of AA

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:43.401
that doesn't require you to
submit to a higher power.

00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:46.820
So there are a lot of options
for peer support actually.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.280
You can hospitalize people.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.510
You can put people in
dual diagnosis programs

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.330
that are specific to managing
both psychiatric conditions

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.400
and substance use.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.990
And in any of these settings,

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.980
you can provide people with evidence based

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.350
and effective medications.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.070
And we have medications
for all of the drugs

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.470
that I have put up here.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.160
We have good meds for alcohol.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.360
We have good meds for tobacco.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.650
We have great meds for opioids.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.499
And we have like emerging meds

00:24:10.499 --> 00:24:14.003
for methamphetamine use disorder
that we can use these days.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.511
So we can help parents

00:24:16.511 --> 00:24:18.723
and we don't need to just write them off.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.770
Parenting and attachment
is more complicated,

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.330
but just as critical.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.020
So there are a bunch of studies

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.210
looking at parenting and attachment style

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.931
among parents who use substances.

00:24:31.931 --> 00:24:33.558
We have found that

00:24:33.558 --> 00:24:37.236
there's an increased level
of disorganized attachment

00:24:37.236 --> 00:24:41.360
among children who have
parents who use substances.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.710
Disorganized attachment

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.920
is caused by parental
inconsistency, right?

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.965
Parents inconsistently being available

00:24:47.965 --> 00:24:50.622
to help you with your
emotionally stressful situations

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:53.641
leads to this disorganized
attachment style.

00:24:53.641 --> 00:24:56.144
The kids are less likely to see contact

00:24:56.144 --> 00:24:58.077
with their parents when they're stressed.

00:24:58.077 --> 00:25:00.140
They're more avoidant
when they're stressed

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.850
so they'll like withdraw into themselves

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.907
instead of comforting with the parent

00:25:03.907 --> 00:25:07.666
which is considered kind of a
healthy attachment approach.

00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:11.622
And that those differences
are to some degree

00:25:11.622 --> 00:25:16.180
mediated or predicted
by how much the mother

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.870
before having the baby

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.708
thought she was gonna have a
hard time caring for the baby.

00:25:20.708 --> 00:25:24.435
So that maternal anxiety or instinct

00:25:24.435 --> 00:25:28.450
does predict how it's gonna
go after the baby's born.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.540
So this is one of the places
we can start to intervene

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.740
and work with people
while they're pregnant.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.810
Other studies looking
at the parenting style

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.929
have shown that parents who use substances

00:25:38.929 --> 00:25:41.380
don't have a different
philosophy of parenting.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.610
Their beliefs about parenting

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.119
are actually similar to people
who don't use substances,

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:50.154
but their behaviors are
substantially different, okay?

00:25:50.154 --> 00:25:54.160
So they tend to have a less
quote adaptive parenting style.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.729
They tend to be more critical,

00:25:56.729 --> 00:25:58.660
less kind of patient

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.900
with the errors that their children make.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.440
There tends to be more negativity,

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.640
more threatening

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.883
and negative reinforcement
in the parenting style.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.956
The quality of the relationship

00:26:09.956 --> 00:26:11.430
between the parent and the child

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:16.340
is strongly mediated by
maternal depression and stress.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.960
And so again, this is a clear place

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.263
for us to intervene in these families.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.570
We see less maternal structuring.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.710
So maternal structuring is when the mom

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:27.770
sort of sets the rules

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.088
and says here's what time we go to bed,

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:31.700
here's when we brush our teeth,

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.960
here's what we're gonna do today.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.230
Instead, there's a little bit more

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.400
of like the day is flowing

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.520
and I'm just trying to get through it.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.520
As a mother, I know both
states well. (laughing)

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.123
Alright, we all struggle.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.363
Some have more to struggle with.

00:26:50.647 --> 00:26:53.147
There's a higher probability

00:26:53.147 --> 00:26:56.010
that they will have multiple other people

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.050
caring for their children periodically.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.440
And again, just to what I just said,

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.490
some of us have more to struggle with.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:06.473
This is not because they don't want

00:27:06.473 --> 00:27:11.407
to parent in the same way that
many of us want to parent.

00:27:11.407 --> 00:27:14.360
There are just so many other stressors,

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.510
and needs, and things
they have to take care of

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.370
that make it quite difficult.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.080
So this isn't about demonizing
people for doing it wrong.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.792
This is really about just characterizing

00:27:22.792 --> 00:27:24.530
how these things get in the way

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.380
of the kind of parenting that
really supports these kids.

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:31.570
This is another really intervenable one.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.450
So mothers with substance use disorder

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.490
tend to be less clear

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.000
about what cues their
kids are giving them.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.880
So knowing oh, this
means my baby's hungry.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.250
This means my baby's tired.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.550
Now, I'm gonna respond to
that cue appropriately.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.264
That doesn't come as naturally.

00:27:45.264 --> 00:27:47.780
Often, I think, because they didn't get

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.740
that modeling necessarily
themselves, right?

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.730
So specifically teaching
people about cues,

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.259
how to notice them, how to address them,

00:27:55.259 --> 00:27:57.680
it's a useful intervention that we can do

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.763
in the first few days of life actually.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.409
So interventions.

00:28:04.409 --> 00:28:08.210
So integrating parenting
classes during pregnancy,

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.975
integrating it into substance
use treatment, very helpful.

00:28:11.975 --> 00:28:16.200
Breastfeeding is a really
helpful intervention actually.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.160
So for babies who've been
exposed to opioids in utero,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.490
we strongly recommend
breastfeeding actually.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.166
It reduces the risk of neonatal
opioid withdrawal syndrome

00:28:27.166 --> 00:28:30.600
not because of the opioids
going into the breast milk

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.500
to the baby.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.720
There are very minimal
opioids that make it through.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.480
But we think it's actually the holding,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.300
and the skin to skin, and the suckling,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.330
and the eye contact,

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.588
and all the things that go with nursing.

00:28:40.588 --> 00:28:44.983
So we really want to
support that kind of bonding

00:28:44.983 --> 00:28:47.150
and that opportunity to bond

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.713
when it's possible to do so.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.550
Teaching infant cues, as I mentioned.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.870
And then parenting class is the focus on

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.560
specifically attachment,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.780
and how to build healthy
attachment and consistency,

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.850
which is part of building
healthy attachment.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.570
Support groups with a parenting focus.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.480
And there are a lot of evidence
based curricula available

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.960
for helping parents
really support children

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.560
after drug exposure in utero.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.060
So I listed some of them here.

00:29:14.661 --> 00:29:17.930
And then the last thing
of the three that I said.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.169
So treating parental substance use,

00:29:20.169 --> 00:29:23.220
assisting with parenting and attachment,

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.090
and providing an enriched
environment, right?

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:30.035
So universal pre-school,
Head Start programs.

00:29:30.035 --> 00:29:32.680
Filling the home with books.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.163
These kinds of interventions.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.750
And supporting the parents

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.670
so that they can really create

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.900
a nourishing environment in the home,

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.803
I think is one of the most
powerful interventions we can do.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.860
So in summary, parental substance use

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.938
is harmful to the whole
family including the child.

00:29:51.938 --> 00:29:54.290
Intrauterine exposure can be harmful

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:58.373
and post-partum exposure,
the home environment

00:29:58.373 --> 00:30:02.385
can either mitigate or
amplify whatever happened

00:30:02.385 --> 00:30:05.520
in the intrauterine environment.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.827
And by treating substance
use disorder in pregnancy,

00:30:07.827 --> 00:30:09.690
providing parenting support,

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.050
and enriching the home
and school environment,

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.820
we can help children and
their families thrive.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.697
Thank you.

00:30:16.697 --> 00:30:19.864
