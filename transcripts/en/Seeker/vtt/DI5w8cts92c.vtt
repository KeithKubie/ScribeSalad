00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.060
We usually think of Astronauts in only the
most heroic terms.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.660
Brave women and men in peak physical and mental
shape who will risk it all to further humanity’s

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.690
reach into the great beyond.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.749
But as the Japanese author Taro Gomi so eloquently
put it, everyone poops.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:21.150
And NASA is still looking for the number one
way to dispose of number two.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.699
When we first started taking baby steps into
space, NASA tried to get around the problem

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.859
by keeping astronauts from having to go entirely.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.730
Weightlessness actually makes poop travel
through the body faster, so to counteract

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.320
this for short missions astronauts ate a low
fiber diet for three days before launch.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.329
The early days of longer crewed missions had
the most crude solutions.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.260
Apollo astronauts used what was essentially
a plastic bag taped to their butts.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.940
And yes, the bags were clear,
I guess so the astronauts could see if they

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.190
had the right stuff.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.579
It may shock you but dropping space trou and
pinching off a brown asteroid into a bag didn’t

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.100
always go smoothly.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.589
Famously the Apollo 10 mission, the dress
rehearsal for the moon landing and the step

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.390
before the giant leap for mankind, had an
unexpected passenger along for the ride.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600
It happened six days into the mission.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.800
Commander Tom Stafford was the first to notice
it: a turd floating around inside the capsule [laughs].

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.640
It happened 6 days into the mission.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.680
Commander Tom Stafford was the first to notice
it: a turd floating around inside the capsule.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.780
Between fits of laughter the three astronauts
on board all denied ownership of said turd

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.610
claiming they would have known if they had
pooped on the floor, or that their poop was

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.700
more sticky.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.680
Regardless Stafford stepped up and grabbed
the space waste with a napkin, and that’s

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.750
why he was the commander.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.350
To this day no one has owned up to it, but
the transcripts of the exchange are public

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.350
record.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.840
My favorite part is they were at one time
marked “Confidential,” presumably to keep

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.350
the Russians from learning about our state
of the art butt bag technology.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.300
The space shuttle had a more conventional
toilet, though it required training with an

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.330
underseat video camera to master.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.660
Yes shuttle astronauts were toilet trained
twice in their lives.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.070
Today astronauts on the International Space
Station have a vacuum powered toilet to catch

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.450
any floaters.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.040
It even has a seatbelt, probably to keep them
in place in a microgravity environment, but

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.610
maybe in case they have a really intense session,
I don’t know.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.580
But we haven’t stopped developing space
toilets, we’ve got our eyes and tushies

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580
on the prize.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.800
Yes, there is a prize for a better space loo.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.670
Dr. Thatcher Cardon is a family doctor, a
flight surgeon, and a colonel in the US Air

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.670
Force.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.560
In 2017 he added “Winner of the Space Poop
Challenge” to his many prestigious titles.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.030
Dr. Thatcher developed a system that allowed
astronauts to go to the bathroom while still

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.800
in their suit, eliminating the need for diapers.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
The system relies on an air lock at the astronauts
crotch.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.300
When the astronaut takes off the cap, a self-closing
valve keeps air from escaping.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.170
The astronaut can then insert a tube through
the valve that can be used to slide a number

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.470
of things inside the suit, like an inflatable
bedpan, a bidet, wet wipes, even fresh underwear.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.069
This technology might not just help astronauts
avoid diaper rash, it could be essential if

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.950
their spacecraft is pierced by debris and
they have to spend days inside their suits.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.490
For his sanitation innovation Dr. Cardon was
awarded $15,000, which is nothing to sniff

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.490
at.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.490
As glamorous as space exploration is, it has
a funny way of reminding us that we are still

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.270
human, and still have to solve some very basic
human problems.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.830
Rockets that get us to Mars are important,
but making sure the first person to set foot

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.080
on it doesn’t track poop on their boot is
important too.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.210
If this video made you laugh, then I’m sorry
but you have to subscribe.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.210
Those are the rules.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.650
Poop’s not the only problematic waste.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.240
In 1963 A Mercury capsule had several systems
go dark thanks to a leaky pee bag.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.099
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker.
