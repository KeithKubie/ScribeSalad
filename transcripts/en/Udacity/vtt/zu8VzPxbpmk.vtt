00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, it seemed that this condition can only hold when c was in double quote.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So first c was in double quote and then c was in less than sign.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
&gt;From all of this information, we can reconstruct the input

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that was passed over to remove HTML markup.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It must have been something along the lines of first a double quote and then an opening tag.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Between these two events, c being a double quote and c being an opening tag,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
there could also have been other characters before.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But in our deduction, none of these matter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
For us, it is sufficient to know that indeed there is an input,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which can cause this assertion to fail.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And second, while we are doing the reasoning, we actually also stumbled

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
across the condition that was wrong here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
&gt;From the line of our reasoning, we can now deduce that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
if this condition had not been true, then for this input the assertion would not have failed.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
By adding appropriate parenthesis here, we can make sure that this input will not cause

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the assertion to fail and thereby through deduction we have found a fix

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
without executing the program even once.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And now for a really tough quiz in which you can show how good your deduction skills are.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If I have applied this fix with this parenthesis, can this assertion ever fail? If yes, provide an example.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If no, write down the individual steps of your deduction

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and let's see whether this is elementary, my dear Watson.
