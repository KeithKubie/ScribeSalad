00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.880
just put it into a clone or inside a
computer or something like that that's

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890
computer or something like that that's
 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.580
computer or something like that that's
the idea and I think the the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
the idea and I think the the
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.510
the idea and I think the the
underestimation of the complexity of the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520
underestimation of the complexity of the
 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.880
underestimation of the complexity of the
problem is is orders of magnitude off

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890
problem is is orders of magnitude off
 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.560
problem is is orders of magnitude off
and we are not even close to doing

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570
and we are not even close to doing
 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.550
and we are not even close to doing
anything like this

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560
anything like this
 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.750
anything like this
I mean Ray Kurzweil projects 2040 is the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760
I mean Ray Kurzweil projects 2040 is the
 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.860
I mean Ray Kurzweil projects 2040 is the
singularity and after that you know we

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
singularity and after that you know we
 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.900
singularity and after that you know we
might be able to live forever how is

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910
might be able to live forever how is
 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.390
might be able to live forever how is
that gonna happen and who's the we okay

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400
that gonna happen and who's the we okay
 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.460
that gonna happen and who's the we okay
so then I have a chapter on who are we

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
so then I have a chapter on who are we
 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.210
so then I have a chapter on who are we
who are you

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220
who are you
 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.510
who are you
what what does it mean to be you and and

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520
what what does it mean to be you and and
 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.250
what what does it mean to be you and and
so their idea is that if we just copied

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260
so their idea is that if we just copied
 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.900
so their idea is that if we just copied
your memories it would be you stop right

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910
your memories it would be you stop right
 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.140
your memories it would be you stop right
there

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150
there
 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.950
there
which memories at what age 20 30 50 60

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960
which memories at what age 20 30 50 60
 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.080
which memories at what age 20 30 50 60
the memories are not stored in there

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090
the memories are not stored in there
 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.849
the memories are not stored in there
like video tape like you just play it

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859
like video tape like you just play it
 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.560
like video tape like you just play it
back on the theater your mind and there

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570
back on the theater your mind and there
 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.030
back on the theater your mind and there
it is what really happened when you were

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040
it is what really happened when you were
 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.190
it is what really happened when you were
15 or whatever no they're they're

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200
15 or whatever no they're they're
 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.780
15 or whatever no they're they're
constantly edited and changed that those

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790
constantly edited and changed that those
 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.960
constantly edited and changed that those
neural networks are reworked

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970
neural networks are reworked
 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.420
neural networks are reworked
constantly so there is no real you in

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430
constantly so there is no real you in
 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.580
constantly so there is no real you in
any snapshot sense of that moment right

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590
any snapshot sense of that moment right
 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.230
any snapshot sense of that moment right
there is the time when you're you know

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240
there is the time when you're you know
 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.110
there is the time when you're you know
such thing and then finally there's the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
such thing and then finally there's the
 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.090
such thing and then finally there's the
through your eyes perspective what's

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100
through your eyes perspective what's
 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.770
through your eyes perspective what's
called a point of view self so the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780
called a point of view self so the
 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.780
called a point of view self so the
memory self mem self is what I just

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790
memory self mem self is what I just
 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.250
memory self mem self is what I just
described it is the point of view self

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260
described it is the point of view self
 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.290
described it is the point of view self
which is you know me looking out of my

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300
which is you know me looking out of my
 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.700
which is you know me looking out of my
eyes at you right now and you you

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710
eyes at you right now and you you
 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.320
eyes at you right now and you you
looking out at me and now when I go to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330
looking out at me and now when I go to
 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.480
looking out at me and now when I go to
sleep tonight there's a disruption in my

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490
sleep tonight there's a disruption in my
 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.220
sleep tonight there's a disruption in my
conscious point of view but it comes

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230
conscious point of view but it comes
 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.990
conscious point of view but it comes
back in the morning and if I go under

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000
back in the morning and if I go under
 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.610
back in the morning and if I go under
general anesthesia it's gone for a

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620
general anesthesia it's gone for a
 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.590
general anesthesia it's gone for a
couple hours comes back a little groggy

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600
couple hours comes back a little groggy
 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.130
couple hours comes back a little groggy
at first but it comes clear if I died

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140
at first but it comes clear if I died
 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.890
at first but it comes clear if I died
and then copied my brain and put it in a

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900
and then copied my brain and put it in a
 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.600
and then copied my brain and put it in a
computer turn the computer on am I

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
computer turn the computer on am I
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.340
computer turn the computer on am I
suddenly inside the computer looking at

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350
suddenly inside the computer looking at
 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.350
suddenly inside the computer looking at
the little you know camera hole I don't

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360
the little you know camera hole I don't
 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.070
the little you know camera hole I don't
think so

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080
think so
 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.800
think so
and here's why because if we did this

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810
and here's why because if we did this
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.890
and here's why because if we did this
while you were alive let's say the

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900
while you were alive let's say the
 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.570
while you were alive let's say the
current technology would be that after

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580
current technology would be that after
 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.220
current technology would be that after
you die we take your brain out and slice

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230
you die we take your brain out and slice
 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.110
you die we take your brain out and slice
it and scan every single synaptic

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120
it and scan every single synaptic
 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.060
it and scan every single synaptic
connection and then take that big data

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070
connection and then take that big data
 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.400
connection and then take that big data
mass and put it into a computer now in

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410
mass and put it into a computer now in
 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.960
mass and put it into a computer now in
the future we may be maybe in five

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970
the future we may be maybe in five
 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.400
the future we may be maybe in five
hundred years or something we could scan

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410
hundred years or something we could scan
 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.500
hundred years or something we could scan
your brain while you're living and and

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510
your brain while you're living and and
 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.260
your brain while you're living and and
scan through sophisticated MRI type

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270
scan through sophisticated MRI type
 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.670
scan through sophisticated MRI type
technology every single neural

now and get your connectome and put it

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610
now and get your connectome and put it
 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.920
now and get your connectome and put it
into computer while you're standing

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930
into computer while you're standing
 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.290
into computer while you're standing
right there a lot so we turn it on who's

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300
right there a lot so we turn it on who's
 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.210
right there a lot so we turn it on who's
that in there in the computer when

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220
that in there in the computer when
 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.940
that in there in the computer when
you're standing right there okay you see

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950
you're standing right there okay you see
 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.260
you're standing right there okay you see
the problem because you're not gonna be

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270
the problem because you're not gonna be
 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.550
the problem because you're not gonna be
standing there going yeah there I am in

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560
standing there going yeah there I am in
 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.290
standing there going yeah there I am in
the computer no you're gonna be standing

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300
the computer no you're gonna be standing
 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.990
the computer no you're gonna be standing
there going nah me no more than a twin

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000
there going nah me no more than a twin
 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.580
there going nah me no more than a twin
we look at their other twin and go yeah

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590
we look at their other twin and go yeah
 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.580
we look at their other twin and go yeah
they're right there I go no so I don't

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590
they're right there I go no so I don't
 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.710
they're right there I go no so I don't
think even that even if they could

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720
think even that even if they could
 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.020
think even that even if they could
accomplish the technology of it it's

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030
accomplish the technology of it it's
 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.409
accomplish the technology of it it's
still not you being put into the future

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419
still not you being put into the future
 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.920
still not you being put into the future
in terms of an afterlife and by the way

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
in terms of an afterlife and by the way
 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.480
in terms of an afterlife and by the way
I think religions have the same problem

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490
I think religions have the same problem
 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.860
I think religions have the same problem
you know when Christians talk about

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870
you know when Christians talk about
 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.510
you know when Christians talk about
you're gonna wake up with Jesus up in

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520
you're gonna wake up with Jesus up in
 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.180
you're gonna wake up with Jesus up in
heaven okay but but I'm actually still

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190
heaven okay but but I'm actually still
 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.280
heaven okay but but I'm actually still
down on the ground there no no no that's

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290
down on the ground there no no no that's
 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.320
down on the ground there no no no that's
your body your soul wait what is the

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330
your body your soul wait what is the
 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.060
your body your soul wait what is the
soul what it's all your memories and

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070
soul what it's all your memories and
 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.550
soul what it's all your memories and
your you know it's you uh which part of

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560
your you know it's you uh which part of
 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.860
your you know it's you uh which part of
me is is going to heaven what age and so

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870
me is is going to heaven what age and so
 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.860
me is is going to heaven what age and so
on same problem it's just a copy going

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870
on same problem it's just a copy going
 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.170
on same problem it's just a copy going
to heaven I'm still in the ground I'm

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180
to heaven I'm still in the ground I'm
 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.969
to heaven I'm still in the ground I'm
still dead it's just some copy of me I'm

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979
still dead it's just some copy of me I'm
 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.400
still dead it's just some copy of me I'm
not waking up in heaven through my point

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410
not waking up in heaven through my point
 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.650
not waking up in heaven through my point
of view okay so that's the core of the

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660
of view okay so that's the core of the
 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.450
of view okay so that's the core of the
book

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460
book
 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.560
