00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.030
Let's put this distributed object model of Java

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.850
to work. And, the example that I'm going to

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.490
construct is ,a bank account server. And, the server

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.880
has obvious API's for accessing your bank account, you

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.250
can deposit, you can withdraw, and you can ask

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.420
for a balance. So, those are the API's that

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.390
the server is going to provide as a service.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.490
Now, the question is. How best to implement it

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.820
using Java. In particular, given that ,there is the remote object and the remote

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.750
interface available as mechanisms in the distributed object model, what

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.340
would be the best way to construct this service as a distributional

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.860
object, accessible from clients anywhere in

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.400
the network? Let's consider two possibilities.
