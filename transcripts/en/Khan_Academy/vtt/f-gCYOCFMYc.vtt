00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.650
Cole is an urban planner.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.590
He wants to create a small
scale drawing of a city block.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.510
The block is a square with an
area of 8,100 square meters.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.860
Create a scale
drawing of the block

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.034
using a scale factor of 0.1.

00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:21.700
So the first thing
we could think about,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.340
they give us the
area of the block.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.800
And it's a square block.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.940
So it has the same
length and width.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.400
So we could use that
information to figure out

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.650
the length and
width of that block.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.770
So if it's a square, so let's
imagine a square block right

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.090
over here.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.605
And that this is, I guess we
could call that the length.

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:42.480
And then this is also
going to be the length.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.080
It's going to be
the same dimensions.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.538
We know that the
area is just going

00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:49.200
to be the length
times the length is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.450
going to be equal to 8,100.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.920
Or we could say that
our length squared

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.000
is going to be equal to 8,100.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.590
So what times itself
is equal to 8,100?

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.400
Well, the 81 might
jump out at you.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.150
We know that 9 times
9 is equal to 81.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.280
But then we have these two
zeroes right over here.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.010
But if we give each
of these nines a zero,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.410
then we'll end up with
two zeros in the product.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.520
So 90 times 90 is
equal to 8,100.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.610
So now we know the dimensions
of this square block.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.445
It's a 90 meter by 90
meter square block.

00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:41.440
It's my best attempt
to draw a square block.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.200
Now that's the
actual square block.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.670
Here let me draw it a little
bit more like a square.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.620
My first drawing looked a little
bit too much like a rhombus.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.490
So here you go.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.010
A little bit better
attempt at a square.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.940
Now we want to create at a
scale drawing of the block using

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.540
a scale factor of 0.1.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.350
So the actual block, once again,
is 90 meters by 90 meters.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.130
But in our scale
drawing, and I'll

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.150
do this in this purple
color, we essentially

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.919
want each of the
dimensions to be

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:15.020
1/10 of their
original dimensions.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.560
So we could take
the scale factor

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.690
and multiply it by each of these
dimensions right over here.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.599
So 90 times 0.1, well
that's just going to be 9.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.890
This right over here is a 1/10.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.750
A 1/10 of 90 meters is
going to be 9 meters.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.130
And so this, when we draw the
scale drawing at the scale

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.740
that Cole intends
to draw it at, we

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.460
would draw 9 meters by 9 meters.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.060
And so let's go
to the actual tool

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.680
and draw a 9 meter by 9 meter
square, or a 9 by 9 square.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.380
We can assume that the units
here are in terms of meters.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.810
So let's see.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.360
I could draw in that dimension.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.810
OK, a 9 there.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.010
Let me use my mouse
instead of my pen tool.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.500
It'll be easier.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.650
And then let me make
this 9, this side 9,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.970
and then I could
make this side 9.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.050
And then we are all set.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.680
It's a square.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.360
We see we have
four right angles.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.120
And now we can check our answer.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.330
And we got it right.
