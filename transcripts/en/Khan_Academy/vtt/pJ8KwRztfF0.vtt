00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.524
- Let's get some practice counting money!

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:07.378
So I have six coins right over here,

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:10.304
and these are all United States coins,

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:11.711
we're counting money in the United States

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:16.285
for these examples, and
what is this first coin?

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:18.862
Well, this is called a
quarter, or a quarter-dollar,

00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:22.577
so it represents 25 cents,
and we could write it out

00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:27.314
as 25 cents, but I'll just
keep that one like that.

00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:28.498
Now this one's another quarter,

00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:33.211
so it is also going to be 25 cents.

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:34.581
Now this one looks different, but

00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:37.043
it's just the other side of these coins.

00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:38.923
This is what the other side looks like.

00:00:38.923 --> 00:00:43.010
So this is also going to be 25 cents.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.309
These are three quarters right over here.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.675
So how much money do these
three quarters represent?

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:52.112
Well, it's going to be
25 plus 25, which is 50,

00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:54.852
plus 25, which is going to be 75,

00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:59.852
so these three quarters
are going to be 75 cents.

00:01:00.447 --> 00:01:02.955
And remember, 100 cents make a dollar,

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:05.602
so this is still less than one dollar.

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:07.576
But we're not done yet.

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:11.012
We have this nickel, this
is a nickel right over here,

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:13.427
that represents five
cents, and then we have

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.331
another nickel here, it looks
different, but it's just

00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:18.790
the other side, this is the head
side, this is the tail side.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.066
So this is also another five cents,

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.154
and so these two nickels,
if you add them together,

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:28.496
they are going to represent 10 cents,

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:30.864
and then finally, you
have a penny, and a penny,

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:33.140
and it even says it right over
here, is one cent, in fact,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.226
they all say it here, this is
five cents, this is one cent.

00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:39.432
So this right over
here's gonna be one cent.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.822
So what is 75 plus 10 plus 1?

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:47.822
Well 75 plus 10 is 85, plus 1 is 86,

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:51.947
so this is equal to 86 cents.

00:01:51.947 --> 00:01:56.947
And if it felt a little bit
too fast to count up 25, 50, 75

00:01:57.195 --> 00:02:00.054
in your head, you could also add them up.

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:05.054
25, 25, 25, plus 5, another 5, plus 1.

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.655
You could add them up this way,

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:15.619
and then what would you get?

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:20.619
5 plus 5 is 10, plus 5 is 15,
plus 5 is 20, plus 5 is 25,

00:02:23.118 --> 00:02:26.926
plus 1 is 26, so that's
two tens and one six,

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.668
put the two tens up here.

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:33.668
2 plus 2 is 4, 4 plus
2 is 6, 6 plus 2 is 8.

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:36.980
So you could get 86 cents, either way.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.859
Let's do one that has
even more coins in it.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.859
So here we go, we have, so what
is it, what's going on here?

00:02:45.107 --> 00:02:49.333
This right over here is a quarter,
that's going to be 25 cents.

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.512
25 cents, and then, we
have one that we didn't see

00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:57.668
in the previous example,
we have two dimes.

00:02:57.668 --> 00:03:02.033
A dime represents 10 cents,
so we have two dimes,

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:05.122
where we can have those
each represent 10 cents,

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:07.792
then we have two nickels,
we've already seen

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:12.792
those each represent
five cents, so 5 and 5,

00:03:13.132 --> 00:03:18.132
and then we have four pennies,
one, two, three, four.

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:21.839
Now we could put each penny
separately, like that,

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.231
or we could say, look, four
pennies, each of them represent

00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:27.110
one cent, so that's
going to be four cents.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.782
So let me do it that way.

00:03:28.782 --> 00:03:33.782
So, this one, two, three, four,

00:03:34.354 --> 00:03:36.305
that's going to be four cents.

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:38.812
And then we could just add everything up,

00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:43.812
so 5 plus 0 plus 0 plus 5 is
10, plus 5 is 15, plus 4 is 19.

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:49.334
19 is one ten and nine ones, so I could

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:51.401
put the one ten in the tens place,

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:56.401
1 plus 2 is 3, plus 1 is 4, plus 1 is 5.

00:03:56.857 --> 00:04:01.857
So it's five tens, five tens
and nine ones, so 59 cents.

00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:05.555
This right over here is 59 cents.

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:07.784
And notice, we have more coins,

00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:11.058
but it represents less value
than the previous example.

00:04:11.058 --> 00:04:12.567
That's because we had a lot of coins

00:04:12.567 --> 00:04:13.960
that didn't represent a lot of values,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.096
like, we had these four pennies here,

00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:20.498
while the previous example,
we had three quarters!

00:04:20.498 --> 00:04:24.236
Each of these quarters is
equivalent to 25 pennies,

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:26.071
so we're able to represent more money

00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:28.925
with fewer coins in the first example.
