00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.340
(woosh, mouse clicking,
and electronic beeps)

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.173
(gentle piano)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.360
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical eight.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.820
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.693
of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.210
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.737
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.161
(synth tones)

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.723
(melodic electronic music)

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.920
- Among the oldest questions
of humans as you know,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.453
we always ask, is, who are we?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.793
What are we doing here?

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.500
Where did we come from?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.790
How did we get here?

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.323
And, where are we going?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.500
Some of these questions are
not completely accessible

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.400
to a scientific approach,
but two of them are.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.010
And these comprise anthropogeny,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.920
explaining the origin of humans.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.030
Where did we come from,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.253
and how did we get here?

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.920
And to pursue the anthropogeny involves

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.740
most academic disciplines,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.860
so the symposium is presented by

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.520
the Center for Academic Research

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.193
and Training in Anthropogeny.

00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:26.050
Which is run together
with the Salk Institute

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.563
and UC San Diego.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.540
And this collaboration along
with interested scientists

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.760
at other institutions

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.840
has a mission to explore
and explain the origins

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.143
of the human phenomenon.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.943
So, besides myself, Fred
H. Gage and Margaret,

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.490
our co-directors and Pascal
Gagneux is associate director.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.200
We have special thanks
to our major sponsors,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.110
the Mathers Foundation in New York,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.560
and this time for the first time,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.733
the Paul Allen Frontiers Group.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.980
And a special thank you
to Annette Merle-Smith

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.470
for her support of the
graduate specialization

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.593
in anthropogeny.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.810
And of course, we thank all the supporters

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.460
for the James Handelman Endowment

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.343
for the Exploration of Anthropogeny.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.700
And all of the individual
supporters of CARTA,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.283
whose names you see
circulating on the slides.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.850
And finally, special
thanks to the CARTA staff,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.680
Ingrid, Rachel, Kate, Linda, and Jesse.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.590
And of course the USCD-TV
group, Rich Wargo,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.520
Matt, Marci, and Domenick.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.360
And the Salk Media Services
here with Kent and Mike.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.043
And of course, our wonderful guitarist.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.730
So with that I'll hand over
the show to the chairs.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.990
- Thank you everyone for coming,

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.510
and I'll just take a moment to tell you

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.450
a little bit about how we decided to make

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.250
like a CARTA meeting entirely
on human imagination.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.700
And this is one of those things that,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.870
it seems to happen only in San Diego,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.050
where two people, and
I'm talking about myself,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.220
who I'm a professor in pediatrics

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.080
and cellular molecular medicine,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.030
turns out to be in a
meeting sitting together

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.600
with Sheldon Brown, whose
gonna hear as first speaker.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.200
And Sheldon Brown comes from visual arts.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.980
So, a scientist and
artist, we start talking,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.280
and we realize that we
have something in common.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.372
We are both fascinated
by human imagination.

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:31.770
So I make a challenge to
Sheldon and say, well,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.280
can we put this in a scientific contest?

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.180
And we start planning
about a meeting like that,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.010
and we realized that most of the time,

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.891
when we try to understand something,

00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:46.950
if it's unique or enhanced in humans,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.750
or we turn on to compare
to our closest relative,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.340
leading relative, such as the chimpanzee,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.300
in comparing to other animals,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.560
it's difficult, especially
if you're talking about

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.868
cognition, imagination.

00:04:59.868 --> 00:05:02.460
So this time, I mean I
think you're gonna hear

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.446
lots of speakers talking about imagination

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:08.710
in modern humans, in
also extinct in humans,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.320
such as the Neanderthals.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.540
And we hope that the combination
of all those speakers,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.550
all this knowledge will help
us to understand a little bit

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.298
about ourselves and answer
those questions that

00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:21.563
Ajit posed to us.

00:05:24.538 --> 00:05:28.121
