00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:24.730
Flimsy white sheets shaped

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.080
like the seat, paper toilet liners can be
found in many public bathrooms.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.901
Notably, however, while they may provide reassurance
to the germaphobic and finicky, toilet seat

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.150
covers have little else to offer in terms
of decreasing your odds of being infected

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.280
with some pathogen when sitting on the toilet
seat.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.559
Once thought to be capable of conducting sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs), contrary to popular

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.199
belief, today scientists know that toilet
seats are very poor vehicles for spreading

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.059
such maladies (like herpes and HIV).

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.710
This is due to the relative fragility of these
viruses outside of a human host, as well as

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.909
the very effective protective barrier offered
by the skin of your backside.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.590
(Note, however, that if you have an open cut
or other wound on your derriere, it is possible

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.409
one of these viruses could get through in
that scenario.)

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.740
Of course, this doesn’t mean that viruses
and bacteria aren’t sometimes present on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.950
toilet seats, and, in fact, an eight-year
old girl once caught gonorrhea (Neisseria

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.640
gonorrhoeae) from one; however, she didn’t
get it by sitting on the seat, she picked

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.819
it up when she tried to use toilet paper to
clean the soiled seat off and got the microbes

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:34.869
on her hand.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.470
In addition to a few, short-lived STDs, toilet
seats may have germs like E. coli and streptococcus;

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.110
however, neither of these can typically invade
a body through the skin, so the only way they

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.920
will make you sick is if they get on your
hands and you don’t then wash your hands

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.299
before eating or the like.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.380
Nonetheless, some people have very sensitive
skin and seats covered with certain allergy

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.530
triggers like chemical cleaners, paints, or
varnishes may cause contact dermatitis, a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.249
condition seat covers would help prevent.

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:07.929
In addition, the truly fastidious would find
themselves in a difficult position if toilet

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:08.930
seat liners weren’t available.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.170
For the biggest germaphobes, toilet paper
strategically placed on top of the toilet

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.850
seat liner may also ease your mind, albeit
not actually accomplishing much in terms of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.610
disease prevention over what your skin already
offers.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.070
Of course, when a toilet containing fecal
matter is flushed, it tends to result in microbes

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.860
and bits of said matter being sprayed about,
including landing on that latch handle you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.489
touched, exposed bits of toilet paper and,
yes, the exposed part of the disposable toilet

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:46.840
seat liners…

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.989
It could be worse, though.

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.890
In Ancient Rome, a wet sponge on a stick was
often used for wiping.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.659
That may sound very comfortable and appealing
until you learn that, after being used, the

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.470
sponge was placed back in a tub of salt water
to await the next person to come along and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.740
wipe with it.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:19.560
Even if the salt content was sufficiently
strong to kill off any microbes.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:32.230
