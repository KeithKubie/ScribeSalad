00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:05.550
Lamport's clock serves as the theoretical underpinning,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.120
for achieving deterministic execution in distributed systems,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.005
despite the fact that that there are

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:15.460
nondeterminism that are existing due to vagaries of

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.610
the network and due to drifts in the clocks, and so on. It's a

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.370
nice feeling that we can come up with. Conditions that need to be satisfied in

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.500
order to make sure that we can have deterministic executions and avoid anomalous

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.440
behaviors using Lamport's clock, both logical clocks.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.610
Where it is sufficient, as well as

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.730
the physical clock conditions. In the next part of this lesson module. We

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.230
will discuss techniques for making the operating

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.690
system, communication software stack efficient for dealing

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.150
with network communication.
