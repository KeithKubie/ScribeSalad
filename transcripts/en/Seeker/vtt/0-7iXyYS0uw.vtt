00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.220
Remember Jurassic Park?

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.540
Those guys were so silly.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.230
if they wanted to see dinosaurs, just go outside.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.389
They're BIRDS NOW!

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:15.539
Hey raptors, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.620
Dinosaurs are of constant fascination to humans
all over the planet.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.981
150 million years ago, birds were giant animals
roaming free across the planet, until 65 million

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.350
years ago, when that big asteroid hit causing
a massive extinction across the entirety of

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.350
our planet.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.620
Obviously, our ancient mammalian ancestors
were able to survive, as were many other animals

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.680
-- mostly by burrowing into the ground or
hiding in the water to escape the initial

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.910
heat, and then surviving on smaller prey during
the ensuing years of cold.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.360
The big fellas like diplodocus would never
have survived -- they couldn't seek shelter

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.980
and needed far too much food.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.399
But, according to new research published in
the journal Science, some dinosaurs DID survive,

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.890
the smaller ones.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.950
Scientists at the University of Adelaide analyzed
the skeletal characteristics of 1,500 dinosaurs

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.719
over 50-million years and found theropods
-- a carnivorous dinosaur family which included

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.939
tyrannosaurus -- got smaller, and smaller
over that time.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.499
In fact, they got smaller in 12 separate mutations,
going from 163 kilos on average to the 0.8

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:22.030
kilo Archaeopteryx, the first bird.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.439
Because they kept getting smaller, and because
they ate meat rather than plant life, they

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.159
were able to survive the asteroid strike and
ensuing extinction.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.429
The reason meat eaters survived was because
they didn't require as large a body as plant

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.359
eaters -- less body means less to take care
of which means survival!

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.469
Yay!

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.999
Separate research, also published in Science
last month, theorizes that ALL dinosaurs had

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:49.469
feathers, some were more primitive, more like
hairs or bristles, while others were soft

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.299
and downy like modern birds.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.789
They discovered this when they found a new
dinosaur called Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.999
which had feathers, but couldn't fly.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.549
This, combined with other evidence is enough
to make a theory, but not a final determination.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.959
Though, taken together, it's pretty easy to
see that modern birds are probably tiny dinosaurs,

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.129
and the scientists were quoted in the Washington
Post saying, "Without a doubt," that is the

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.129
case.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.260
But why would these dinosaurs get smaller?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.019
What would be the purpose?

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.519
Scientists say there would be a distinct advantage.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.879
Smaller carnivorous dinosaurs with feathers
would be able to climb trees, glide, and MAYBE

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.450
fly -- allowing them to hunt prey that differed
from their larger carnivorous brethren, also

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.750
helping them survive extinction.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.319
"They just knew how to innovate, evolutionarily
speaking," Discovery News writer Richard Farrell

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.319
said.

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.180
If you take this to be true, as many paleontologists
today do, then instead of being extinct, there

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.770
are 10,000 species of dinosaur living and
breathing on our planet still today, even

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.930
more than there are mammals or reptiles!

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.799
Maybe had some fried dinosaur for dinner last
night, or went out to fill the dinosaur-feeder

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.310
in your yard or perhaps you have a pet dinosaur
in a cage in your house…

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.420
All of those sound pretty frickin' cool to
me.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.420
What do you think?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.209
Are you on board with the dinosaur-bird changeover?

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.560
Are you going to start calling it KFD or eat
dinosaur noodle soup when you’re sick?
