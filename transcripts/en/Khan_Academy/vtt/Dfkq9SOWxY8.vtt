00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.630
In order to maintain
a trade imbalance

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.430
we know that the Chinese
central government

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.730
needs to keep its currency
artificially weak.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.180
And to do that they essentially
can print their currency

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.130
and use that to buy US dollars.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.350
So what they do is they
increase the supply of yuan

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.850
and they increase the
demand for dollars,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.110
keeping their currency weak.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.800
Now, the next
question you might ask

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.990
is what do they do
with the actual dollars

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.720
that they bought with the
yuan that they printed.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.080
Well, they don't want to
just sit on those dollars.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.870
They'd prefer to be collecting
some type of interest

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.930
on that money.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690
So instead of just
keeping it all in

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.400
some warehouse
someplace they actually

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.700
just lend that money
to the US government.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.060
And they lend that money by
buying US Treasury bonds,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.490
by buying T-bills and T-notes.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.340
So that money that they use that
they bought with their printed

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.250
yuan, that goes to
the US Treasury.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.090
And the US Treasury gives the
Chinese Central Bank treasury

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.590
bonds.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.040
So these are treasury bonds.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.500
Now, what's the effect of this?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.290
Clearly, the Bank of China is
getting interest on its money

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.810
now.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.360
It's helping to finance
the US government's debt.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.860
But maybe even
more interestingly,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:43.040
it is creating incremental
demand for T-bonds,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.230
for treasury bonds.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.830
Now, what does that do?

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.410
Well, if you're increasing
the demand for anything

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.200
that's also going to
increase the price.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.790
So the price of treasury
bonds, of T-bills and T-notes,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.870
goes up.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.040
T-bills are durations
less than one year.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.140
Notes are durations
more than a year.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.320
So the price goes up.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.290
But what happens if
the price goes up?

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.900
That means that the interest
that the government has

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.360
to pay on this debt goes down.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.510
And I explained that in
more depth in other videos.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.860
Now, the interest goes down.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.560
That means that the cost of
borrowing for the US government

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.430
goes down.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.120
But that's also
the benchmark rate

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.590
for the cost of debt in general.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.120
So in general it finances US
debt, both of the government

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.920
and really just
credit more broadly.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.270
So debt becomes cheaper
inside of the United States.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.790
