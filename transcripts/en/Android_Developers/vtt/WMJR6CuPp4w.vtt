00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.600
I’m Neutron, Developer of Erudite

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.920
Erudite is a mobile language learning app integrated with all essential tools

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.600
including dictionaries, phrasebooks, flashcards

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.600
and supports Android Wear

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.400
so users can learn English anywhere anytime with their native tongue

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.620
Users who speaks English can also learn 24 foreign languages with Erudite

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.360
It’s our approach to break the language barrier

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.660
and bridge the gap between different cultures

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.320
We took Google's suggestion

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.020
and updated the app with Material Design

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.520
This made our user rating in Google Play increased from 4.1 to 4.3

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.760
Erudite now has over 1M downloads globally

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.940
with users from more than 200 countries

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.880
It has been selected as the Editor's Choice and App of Year 2015 on Google Play

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.180
All these acknowledgements also encouraged us a lot

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.380
My name is Benji, Product Manager of Erudite

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.080
Maintaining user retention is our key priority

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
We implemented Pre-Launch Report

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.260
to collect data from a variety of Android devices

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.520
so we can reduce as many bugs as possible before its official release

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.520
This helps us to improve user satisfaction

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.140
and our user retention rate has increased by over 60%

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.980
Firebase enables us to monitor analytics

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.640
crash reporting, and other app-specific data

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.100
including location, age, gender, device type, etc.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.020
Firebase enables us to know our users from different aspects

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.320
and hence make quicker decisions and better app

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520
Additionally, we use Review Analysis

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.240
to gather feedback from users on Google Play

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.680
and use them to polish Erudite's features

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.940
It also allows us to reply to users directly and individually

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.240
so we can improve the communication with our users

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.300
and know their true requirements

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.260
Google is the bridge connecting Erudite and its users from all around the world

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.440
I’m Winson, Erudite’s Technical Manager

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.120
Google’s great support all along the way makes us more confident about the future

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.900
We are trying to build a crowdsource platform

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.540
to enable users to contribute learning materials to each other

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.240
and providing our users with richer language learning experiences
