00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.399
Looks like Jupiter forgot to pack sunscreen…

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.700
Hey guys, Amy here with you on DNews.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.910
Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is arguably the
gas giant’s most notable feature.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.400
The spot is actually massive, swirling storm
twice as wide as the Earth that astronomers

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.630
have been tracking since the 1800s.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.010
And even though its shrinking to the tune
of 580 miles per year — astronomers suspect

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.830
eddies feeding into the storm are affecting
its internal dynamics, turning it from an

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.789
oval into a circle — it’s still going
strong.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.440
That giant storm, and the name Great Red Spot
suggests, is also, well, red.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.300
But not because Jupiter is blushing.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.730
It’s red because Jupiter has a bit of a
sun burn.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.320
Scientists used to think that the red in the
Great Red Spot was due to chemicals welling

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.060
up in the region from below the visible cloud
layers.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.340
If this were the case, the whole storm would
be red, not just the top.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.010
But new lab tests suggest something different
is going on.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.420
Jupiter’s atmosphere is composed almost
entirely of hydrogen and helium with a few

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.610
traces of other gases thrown in.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.630
Though these other gases only exist in a tiny
percentage, their effects can be significant.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.830
Two of the trace gases in Jupiter’s atmosphere
are ammonia and acetylene.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.810
In lab tests, scientists exposed these gases
to ultraviolet light to simulate sunlight

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.530
interacting with these gases in Jupiter’s
atmosphere.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.520
The experiment produced a reddish material
and when the team compared this material’s

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.210
spectroscopic signature to that of the Great
Red Spot as observed by Cassini's Visible

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.930
and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer, they found
it to be a pretty close match.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.720
The reddish material matched a model of the
Great Red Spot in which the red-colored material

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.080
is confined to the uppermost region of the
giant storm.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.760
Scientists think that below this sun-scorched
redness, the storm is actually pretty bland,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.300
colour-wise; lots of whites and grays.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.850
But it’s not just composition of the clouds
that accounts for the reddish hue in this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.049
big storm (and elsewhere around the planet).

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.150
It’s the altitude of those clouds.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.979
Jupiter’s uppermost cloud layer is largely
ammonia, and the storm that makes up the Great

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.900
Red Spot is incredibly tall meaning those
upper layers of clouds get hit with a lot

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.900
of sun light.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.420
An interesting question now is what combinations
of elements are responsible for the other

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.670
colours in Jupiter’s clouds; the planet
is generally a mixed palette of oranges, browns

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.670
and reds.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.549
But other trace gases in Jupiter’s atmosphere
like ammonium hydrosulfide turned green when

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.239
exposed to UV light in a lab.

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.560
Don’t you guys think the chemistry going
on in Jupiter’s clouds is just awesome?
