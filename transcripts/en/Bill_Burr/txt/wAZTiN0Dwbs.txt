Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 19th. No, January 9th, sorry, 2017. January 9th, 2017. You know, that's how bad I am at math. I can't even fucking say that date. Right. Um, how's it going? How are you? Oh, the summer wind. It came fucking blowing in because of global warming. It's fucking cold for about two weeks and then it's hot. My fucking house is gonna Melt and then it'll slip into the sea. I don't give a fuck that it's snowing and Massachusetts. [inaudible] Hey, what's going on? What's going on? It's already getting hot as fuck out here. Um, Joe, you should be a meteorologist. Yeah, it's going to be hardest fucking fucking Los Angeles. Um, how are you? How's it going? Are you out there? You're fighting the good fight. You're trying to be a better person. You're trying to turn around your fucking childhood.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       Well, join the club. Had a little setback yesterday, you know? Oh, all fucking knew. Billy was running around and old Williams showed up listed age, just I, you know, whatever. I just got to keep fucking, you know, moving forward, you know, moving forward like the Celtics and the Bruins. Okay, we're not winning championships this year, but you know, we're trying, all right, I'm not going to get rid of all of my anger in fucking two weeks, but you know, if you can just chop away even a half a percent, you'll be a half a percent better GTA than you were yesterday. Jesus Christ, you know, it's fucked up, is knowing that you fucked up and then actually really analyzing yourself and you're like, Whoa, I didn't know it was that deep. Um, anyways, so what do you do? What do you do when you know you're fucked up and you can't really fix it?

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       Then Day, what do you do? Well, you know, what you do is you fucking crack open a bear and you watch some goddamn sports. That's what you do to distract yourself from all this shit that's going on. I love this whole fucking story about the Russians hacking into the fucking democratic national fucking convention committee, fucking websites and all that. All these fucking Hillary supporters. Yay. It's why you fucking Trump was able to eke it out. It's just like, I can't even fucking, I can't listen to any. And then you look at the Trump supporters, they're like, what's the big deal? It's just the Russians.

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       The bottom line is you either give a fuck or don't give a fuck about what the Russians allegedly did or didn't fucking do, depending on whether you wear a blue or a fucking red tie. And I love how in the end of all this, like I was supposed to listen to the fucking CIA. Like they don't have an agenda. Everybody in this story has a fucking agenda. So it's like, all right, who the fuck do I listen to? You know, good fucking Lord. Do you think Obama would give a shit if the hacking led to Hillary winning? We'll, uh, we'll do something, uh, when the time is right and blah, blah, blah, blah. Why? Because the lady with the Blue Bra lost. What if she won Obama? When, then what the fuck would you do? You'd ride off into the sunset, getting ready to do your fucking speeches for fucking 300 grand to clip to the exact people that get you in the White House. It's all, I can't, that's why watch sports. That's why I watch sports because other than a couple of mobbed up refs here or there, you know, it's pretty fair. It's about as fair as it can get, which means it isn't fair.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       So anyways, um, I love that people don't like that Trump is friends with, uh, Vladimir Putin. [inaudible], Putnam, Putin, him, you know, that, that not being friends with the Russians the first time didn't work out too well with the whole thing almost blew up in our face. So, uh, you know, why don't we try to hold hands this time? I don't know. I, this is, I don't get into politics. I think war should be illegal. I think war is literally, it's the temper tantrum of the fucking Illuminati and then everybody else has to pay the fucking price. You know, and those rich loafer wearing cuts will never step one foot into a battlefield. Uh, you know, the I, they all make the fucking money off. It's just a bunch of fucking bullshit. And when are they going to grow up? I love how I can't go over my fence and just take a bat out in, beat the fuck out of my neighbor because of, I dunno, whatever the fuck they did.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       You know, the apple trees on their property and I want the apples on my fucking property and I can't just fucking try to force them to fucking give me their apples and when they don't, I can then just fucking come up with an idea. I don't know, some sort of angle of bullshit that I tell the rest of my neighbors and I go over there and I fucking smash up his house and kill a few people in it. I don't, why can't, I can't do that on a fucking local level. But as a country, countries can do that to one another. It's just fucking beyond me. They can't sit down at a fucking table and hash it out.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       Give us the oils. No, sit there at the table for fucking years. Just doing different reeds. Give us the oil. No, I'm all right. There's my fucking wingnut fucking conspiracy theory horseshit full. You're right out of the gate. So let's go right back to bread and circus. Okay. Bread and fucking circus. You guys watch a the play off play off fucking football games. Um, I'll tell you right now, the two luckiest teams in the NFL right now are the Seattle Seahawks and the New England patriots. Why you say, because the other two best remaining teams in both conferences are going to play each other next weekend. You know, while the Patriots play the, the a Houston Texans and the Seattle Seahawks play the Atlanta Falcons. Now I'm not trying to disrespect the Texans or the falcons, but who's kidding who, if you see Atul and you got the cowboys, the packers and the Falcons left, which is the best game for you, which gives you the best chance of moving onto the next round. Why those fucking dirty burns down there in Atlanta with the real housewives and the down low brothers. Um, and if in the AFC I would much rather as a Patriot fan, watch us play the Texas without JJ. What? Right.

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       Playing a home game while the Kansas City chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the shit out of each other. You know, cowboys and Greenbay are going to eliminate one of them, right? You know the deal. So rather than Seattle having to go through fucking Green Bay and Dallas, the only got to go through one of them and the Patriots, rather than having to play the Steelers and the fucking chiefs, we only got to play one of them thank Christ the way that worked out. So both of us, if we play the game that we should be, fuck that we know how to play should easily, not easily, but we should make it to the, uh, to the fucking NFC AFC championship game and the fucking patriots at a buy. So we're fucking, we're wearing flip flops to the AFC championship game. Having said that, I have no idea who's going to win the Superbowl. Um, I like many people I think were amazed at how easily the packers handled the, uh, the New York football giants. And as a patriots fan, I did not enjoy that outcome because I wanted the rematch. You know, I, I sat dead fucking for the last five weeks. I want to see, I want to fight, I wanted the patriots play the giants again. I wanted to see if definitively if the giants just fucking own us,

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       You know, for the trilogy or could we get some revenge? You know what I mean? That, that's what I was looking forward to. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       so, you know, and I also love Eli and I actually love the giants, believe it or not, as a patriots team, I don't understand like as much as those two losses were painful, what is there to hate? They were a great fucking franchise. They always have a great fucking defense and a couple of tough years. But, um, I wanted the rematch. Oh my God, that would have been huge fucking ratings. Although rematch patriots, Seattle could also be a good thing. However, how many times have we beaten the Steelers in the playoffs? Playoffs. We've beaten them up. I don't every fucking significant. Goddamn, I don't even know. I lost count this. Would this be number four?

Speaker 3:          00:09:17       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:18       so you can't tell me the Steelers aren't due and I don't know shit about Kansas City other than people telling me that they're really good. So it's not going to be an easy AFC championship game. And if you're asking me if I'm looking past the Dallas Texans, uh, I kind of am, but only as a fan. I don't play for the New England patriots. So I think the Patriots will be fine that I'm kind of looking past that. The Houston Texans going into New England without JJ Hawaii. Um, how about that fucking catch by Richardson? You probably should say which one, but that one in the fucking end zone. That was like one of the best catches I've seen since Odell Beckhams. You know, it wasn't anywhere near as good as that, but Jesus Christ, fucking lily reaching around below the guy, you know, around his junk past his taint, they throw a flag for an interception.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       You still fucking catch it. How many fucking times is there a flag in the end zone? And the offensive team gets to deny it because the fucking wide receiver reached around, you know, that sounds fucking perverted. But yeah, around the defender, you know why? Cause I stopped at reach around, reach around Jack, reach around, fucking reached around the defender. They probably teach you that in broadcasting school. You know, and one of the main things you have to look out for other than staying away from advocacy of domestic violence against women is when you're going to use the expression that the, the, the wide receiver have reached around the defender. You gotta get, you can't pause after a rant. You gotta go right to defendant reached around the defender and then continue with your idea. Um, anyways, sorry. So, um,

Speaker 3:          00:11:06       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       I don't know. A lot of people thought some of those playoff games are boring. I know I did. The Steelers dolphins won it and that was a fucking snooze fest. But it's the early rounds, the early rounds, everybody's evenly matched. I think next week's will be a, we've agreed it will be great. We'll see what the fuck happens. Who Do you like? Who Do you like? I think a lot of people are on Seattle's fucking beak as they say, right? Everybody's fucking looking at them like, oh well, you know, they were just there and our, they played pretty good against the fucking lights, you know, and then Green Bay, green bay been there and everybody's like, Oh, you know, fucking all of a sudden here we go. Aaron fucking Rogers looking like a beast in the second half. Right. And then there's other people go, oh, what about those fucking cowboys?

Speaker 3:          00:11:53       That's

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       why I don't fucking watch pre or post game analysis and probably why you guys, well actually maybe you shouldn't fast forward through this because I'll honestly tell you, I don't know what the fuck is going to happen. I have no idea. I don't know what happens. I haven't watched Kansas City all year. I just know that, uh, the, what the Fox is, Andy Reed is their coach. And the last time I watched them was the first time I saw him in a red jacket and he looked like a big fucking tomato. And I said, you know what, I'm done with this franchise. And the only other time I paid attention to was when Paul Versey kept telling me that US trading Matt Castle or letting them go to the chiefs was a huge fucking mistake. And do you think he ever apologized for me to me for making that sort of a comment? I don't think he did. Ah, I don't think he did. Um, anyways, so I'm just continuing to try and do the impossible, uh, which is watch every home game of the Boston Celtics and the Boston Bruins while sustaining a healthy marriage.

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       It's not easy. You know what makes it really fucking hard is the spoons and Celtics a lot of times play on the same day. And I, for some reason, never think, well, why don't you just watch one of them and then watch the other one on the off day? That's what I have to do. But I watched 'em, you know, I watched the, uh, the selto against, I taped the Pelican game, so I watched the Celtics beat the Pelicans, and then I watched the Bruins fucking play the Goddamn Hartford whalers via North Carolina. And, uh, every time we play the fucking hurricanes, it always goes into the light. We played them three times in the last month. It always goes into overtime and we usually, we usually lose to those cuts. I don't know what it was. We used to own the Hartford whalers, but every, once they become the fucking Carolina hurricanes, we always lose to them.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       They reminded me of what used to happen when the Patriots would go into Denver. We always lost, you know, granted they had Craig Morton and then into John Elway. What do we have? We had Tony [inaudible], we had Steve Grogan, we could match up, Eh, the, the orange crush defense. And then John Elway was better than, I'm sorry we gave you is better than Tony Asen and uh, but it wasn't still on the draft board. And I know you think we should've picked Dan Marino. Well, you know, we didn't like everybody else. We fucking didn't. And you know who paid the price more than anybody else. Dan Marino. Cause he went to fucking Miami and they never got him a running game or a defense. And to this day people fucking trash them say, and he couldn't win the fucking big one. And meanwhile they had to change every possible fucking rule in passing and tip it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       So totally forward to the fucking, the scales to the orphans for Dan Marino's records to finally start falling. Yeah. I'm a big Damn Marino fan. Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, and I've been watching the, uh, the Celtics just having a great fucking time watching both in the broad, you know, they hang in there, we were out of the playoffs for a game playoffs and then we won. I don't even know who the fuck we beat. They watched it so many fucking gays. We'd be buffalo twice and then we fucking lost to Edmonton and then we'd beat somebody and then we fucking lost in overtime toe a.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       So the fucking hurricanes I believe. I Dunno, it gets crazy to try to watch 162 fucking games.

Speaker 3:          00:15:17       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       but anyways, they're both fucking, we play the blues and then the fucking Celtics got a huge game against the Toronto Raptors. Now if you're not watching the Celtics of Boston, this is all you need to know. I'm going to read you their wins and losses and you tell me if you can fucking pick up what's going on. We'll go back to them beating. They beat the, uh, all right, here we go. December 16th, we beat the sh we beat the fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:15:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       Does that say the Hornets? One of the Hornets. Stop being the bobcat's. The Horn is moved to New Orleans. Then they became the Pelicans and then that name freed up and then the bobcat's like alright, there's really, you know, not enough bobcat's out here in North Carolina. Can we go back to horn? It's cause there mother fuckers are everywhere. Overalls and shoofly. North Carolina. All right, that we beat the Miami Heat. Then we'd beat the Memphis Grizzlies, then we beat the fucking Indiana Pacers. Then we played the Oklahoma City thunder and we lost that. We played the next, we beat him.

Speaker 3:          00:16:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       Then we played the grizzlies. We beat them. Then we played the Cavaliers and we lost, you see in a pattern here that we beat the heat. Then we beat the jazz, then we beat the sixers, then we beat the fucking Pelicans. And then Tuesday we're playing the Toronto Raptors. So if you look, we fucking, we beat all the fucking regular Joe teams lunch pail Larry's, but we can't beat the cavs. We're not beating fucking OKC. And now we got fucking, uh, we got Toronto. So I don't know, I'll be very excited if we fucking, um, I'd be very excited if we fucking win that game cause we haven't really beat a contender yet since I've started to f watching them. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:17:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       But anyways, they're saying the Celtics are like one fucking player away then not one player way. If you really watched the Cavaliers and you watch the Golden State Warriors were at least two fucking players away, the fact that they want to move like fucking Marcus smart and fucking Jae Crowder for that white kid who used to play at Butler for Brad Stevens. You know, I'll tell you right now I'm reverse racist when it comes to fucking basketball too. We're going to trade a black guy and draft picks for a light guy who plays in Utah. I don't know. Versus he's telling me the guys of beast, whatever the Hawthorn is, some shit like that. I don't, I don't know about hoop. I just started watching. I'm like a fucking housewife that finally got her Celtic Apron in is stop making. Hamhocks is peaking into the living room. So I don't have no idea what I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       All I can tell you is that a, I'm loving watching the uh, the games during the Pelicans got a great fucking announced it too. I was so pissed. Cause I love lists at the Tommy Heinsohn. And the other fucking guy who, I don't know his Goddamn name, I should, he's been doing the southwest games forever, but a, the pelting the that, we'll see that that was the, the Pelicans and the Celtics. The pelicans are the Celtics. Um, they actually combined during World War II, they played the steals. Um, they got a great announcer, old school fucking uh, I don't know, had a lot of elements of a Vin Scully. I thought it was a class act. He could tell he was rooting for the Pelicans, but he gave you, you know, when his team committed files, he said, all right, that's a foul. You know, he wasn't a total homer.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       I like guys like that. And I also like total homers, like Tommy Heinsohn. Um, alright, I'm going to tell him, stop talking about fucking basketball cause that's about as deep as I go. Uh, let me read a couple of, a couple of advertisements here. All set there. Billy, you know, thought I came out of the fucking clouds, right? Okay. Dollar Shave Club. Everybody. Oh Jesus. Here we go. Dollar Shave Club gives you a clothes, smooth shave and you can't beat the convenience or the price. What is, can VR convenient cause they bring it to you. There's nothing convenient about shaving and fucking sucks. And when you were a kid, all you want to do, you be get old and fucking shave. It's the fucking worst. It's so ridiculous man that you didn't, you didn't have to shave for like the first fucking, I dunno, 1314 or 10 if you're one of those fucking hairy people years of your life, you want at least a God damn decade, 12 years without having the fucking shave.

Before Dollar Shave Club, there was no middle ground.

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       It was either save money and get a painful shape from a disposables. Uh, like the ones that give away for free at the gym, which felt like shaving with the piece of glass. I will tell you going from one blade to two blade was great. Everything else, three, four, five is all been fucking complete bullshit. Um, two blades is the perfect one. That's the one you want. The third blade one became too thick and you can't get under your cute little button nose to shave there. So you've got to start fucking grabbing and pushing it up. Giving yourself a pug nose like that completes fucking Psycho Orange County wife. When are they going to retire? Those fucking broads every day there's like, they're like on season 98.

It wasn't the Hawthorne, the Holland. Brooke. What's the one down there by a fucking Deniros restaurant to the Holland tunnel. Jesus.

All the other shit for instance. So I look up this whole pit bull thing is once people just go like these pitbulls man to crazy, they're licking your face and, and they love their owner.

Speaker 1:          00:27:47       And then one day they just kill them in their sleep. All this bullshit. I looked it up. Okay. Two things. One, the dog's name was Scarface. Repeat the dog's name was Scarface. Number two, they lived in Florida. Okay, can we quit blaming the fucking breed here? Jesus fucking Christ. That poor fucking dog. I can't imagine the abuse that that dog went through. The dogs named Scarface. What kind of dog do you think they wanted it to be? What do you think they trained it to be? That's what the fuck they did. Do you know when I was a kid, we had a west Highland white terrier. Okay. And me and my brothers teased the fucking shit out of that dog. And it bit as routinely bit me in the face one time. And I almost lost my eye. You know why? Because we were horrible to the dog.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       That's why. Okay. If you get a pit bull and you name it fucking Scarface and you start feeding it fucking raw meat and making it attack shit, eventually, you know when you, I guarantee you they abused the fucking shit out of that thing. And what happened is when you put a sweater on a dog, at some point its head is underneath the fucking material and it probably flipped out. And then what happens is you've abused the dog. And rather than it being a little west Highland terrier that you can push off of your fucking face. You've done it to a dog that is in a way class that you cannot fucking handle. But then what happens is, is they blame the dog because human beings are so fucking precious and fucking make no goddamn mistakes. It's, it's fucking ridiculous that they keep blaming those fucking dogs.

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       And I know what you guys are, think of what bill, didn't you just give away your pitbull? Yes, I did because I understood that I didn't have the capabilities as a fucking owner because of the abuse that happened to my dog. You know, my dog, when I first got it, I picked up a hockey stick to fucking stick handle in my living room and it ran to the other side of the room and started shaking uncontrollably. Okay? I don't know what the other people did that, but you know, when you do that to a fucking dog, you know, I dunno, I still love pitbulls and I hate that people come up to me with those fucking stories. I don't give a fuck. You know, dogs bite people all the fucking time, all these different breeds bite people all the fucking time. Every day a dog bites somebody.

Speaker 1:          00:30:10       You bringing a fucking animal into the fucking house. Okay? And if you're not a good owner and you don't know what the fuck you're doing, you could get bit, you get a hamster, you're going to get bit, you get a pet snake, you're going to get bit, you bringing a fucking animal into the house. My whole fucking life pitbulls were biting people, but it didn't get brought up until somewhere in the nineties when I was growing up. It was one German shepherd, one Doberman Pinscher after talking to other, you know, meanwhile, Dalmatians are out of their fucking mind because they're pure bred yet I, you know, I dunno. All right, let's, let's get back to the fucking podcast. I just, I don't, I don't buy into it the same way. I don't buy into the fact that these people in other countries, you know, just sitting there more evil than what the fuck is down the street from me.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       We're all fucking human beings. Some of us are good. Most of us are cunts. You know, I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about at this point. All right, let's continue on. Let's continue on with the podcast here. Um, as you might've guessed at this point, still no baby. So we're still fucking waiting. We are still waiting on pins and needles and um, I am getting to the fucking point where it's just like, it's, it's like enough already. It's just like, it's like waiting to go on stage in front of a rowdy crowd. You just want to be like, can you just bring me up already so I can fucking get this over with? Um, oh my God. And I become, I become an expert at talking people out of the vortex of, um, them give me, giving me advice about what to do on the day.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       Um, cause they just start telling me their stories and then I'll just be like, hey, did you see that fucking nor'easter they just had Becky, I've got family back east and I just, I waltzed them out of the conversation. Um, because I've tried being blunt with people being like, listen, listen, listen. Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't care. I don't want to hear your fucking story. Your fucking story is not going to help me. Your story is all about you and you just talking about yourself in everything that you learned. I don't give a shit. I've talked to a thousand fucking people. It seems like in every one of you tells me a different story and a different thing for me to expect, which makes me feel like every fucking things a little bit different. So for the love of God, can you please shut the fuck up? Can you please stop with the verbal home videos? Ugh. I can't wait to be a dad and, and not tell other people how to be a dad. That is my goal as a parent. I probably won't do it. I'll probably fucking follow the herd right over the cliff. It'd be like, you know what? You got it though. Tell you right now. Look out for this. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:33:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       Do you know this person told me the other day that fucking, I would never play drums again. The second my kids sport. Can you fucking believe how ridiculous that is? Yeah. You won't be playing drums anymore. I'll really, well, you know, fucking, uh, Dave Grohl plays drums. He Plays Guitar Too, and he sinks in a band while touring the world. As far as what I've read, he's got a couple of kids. I think he's doing fine. John Bonam had a kid when he was fucking 19. His band didn't even make it yet. He had a fucking kid before his band made it. He was a teen dad before MTV and he went on to become arguably the greatest rock and roll drummer of all fucking time. You know what? I think all freckles could sneak in a couple of paradiddles. What do you think? You don't even really think about parents.

Speaker 1:          00:33:52       I think that there's certain people that know how to be a parent and s and not lose themselves in it and actually still have a balance in their life where they, they have a card game every once in a while. Obviously your life is has to adjust. But these fucking people that just like, they just, they have no life and they just sit there staring at their children. You know honey honey, how you don't take no, no, no, no, no, no. They never let their kids fall down. They don't let them fucking do everything. They just sit there like a fucking penguin with that goddamn egg underneath them except the kids already bored. I don't think, I don't know. I don't want to do that. I don't want that to be my life. You know what I mean? I think if a kid is inside, considering that we were cavemen and we used to have babies and they were in caves and at any point a saber tooth tiger can come in and fucking just take the kid from you and then that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:55       The fact that your fucking inside with with fucking central air heating and food, you don't have to hunt. He can go right down the street and go to the grocery store. I know I'm oversimplifying this, but I have, I have to be honest with you. When I talked to other parents, all they do is just give me anxiety. I'm so excited for this thing to happen. And then I talked to people that have kids and they, they, they just dump all this anxiety on you. And I swear to God, I might be reading into this, but there's like a certain, like 30% of them that take like a certain perverted joy and making you feel not feel well about this experience that's allegedly the greatest experience you're ever going to have. Like they actually take this perverse joy. Um, and I think that those people are actually bad parents because I think, uh, I'm, I'm totally guessing here.

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       I think that they resent their children in what they took from them and they still wanted to do blow and go around and fucking have random sex with people and they're there. They never quite got past, they didn't quite fuck enough broads or jump on enough Dick's, I don't know what it is, but I found it equally with men and women. Like 30% of them will take a perverse joy in trying to infuse some sort of like preemptive misery into your fucking life. Cause I can tell you this right now. I'm still going to play fucking drums. I have to, because if I don't, I will go out of my fucking mind. Um, I'm not saying I'm going to play as much as I play, but to sit there and if you fucking think that I'm going to sit here with the 71 green sparkle fucking Ludwig drunk pit and I'm not going to keep fucking play in this thing. You know those people out there who play an instrument. Okay, but you don't make a living off of it and you stopped playing it because you have a kid. Did you ever think about maybe, you know, just playing the instrument in front of your kid and maybe that they'll take to it or maybe they'll play an instrument that they could play in the Ted together. You could have your own little fucking, you know, good time together, bonding through.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:03       The, I dunno, the wonder of having music as a fucking hobby. Who you are hurting. They right now, you better play that Ukulele. Cause once that kid comes, you're never gonna play to me. What is this kid like? Some little Donald Trump and he's going to fire me as a dad if I continue to do my little rudimentary on my practice pad. Um, how about I watch less TV and the amount of time I spent watching all the Bruins and Celtics, why don't I take that out of my life and then put that towards watching the kid and then continue to play drums? I mean there's the adjustments you can make, right? Um, oh fuck. I gotta tell you this story. I um, I always look at houses and you know, I'm not gonna sell my house. I love this fucking place as much as I pitch your best white bitch about it. Cause I love this fucking house and I'm

Speaker 3:          00:37:53       okay

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       and I'm going to continue to fucking repair it and I'm going to do the fucking homeowner three 60. And when I have the whole thing fixed, I'm going to start over again on the first job. Cause now it's going to be fucked up whenever I repaired at that point will then be fucked up. So anyways, I um, there was this house for sale and uh, I went to go, I went to go see it and it basically had everything that you could ever want. Right. It was a beautiful house, you know, from the outside. It was a beautiful house. It had a fucking pool, had garage detached from the house with a room above it, which to me is like, oh there you go. I got the kid, I got the house with the F, I got the garage with fucking room above it. I put my drums up, they're turning into a drum room slash podcast room.

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       There you go. That is my fucking dream. So I go over to go look at this fucking place, right. Knowing full well I'm not going to fucking buy it cause I can tell at this point having bought a fucking house that needed all the work it does. But as, as I'm driving up to it, I can already see the fucking windows need to be replaced and it needs a new roof. Even though they told me, we don't know. We checked out the roof there. We had some inspectors. They said it's fine. Oh yeah. Is that what they said?

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       Why are all these water stains all over the side of the fucking house? What's that about? I like how the windows don't fucking quite, they're not flush. Look at that. Look at the rot around all of those fucking windows. This House I can tell you right now is already a borderline tear down and I haven't even gotten into it yet. So I walk into this fucking house and Holy Shit. Holy fucking Shit, dude. I took a tour of this house. There was three separate times that I thought I was going to get murdered. All right. First of all, we go to look at the room above the garage first and there's just this, this moss growing on the side of the house, which I don't know if it was mold or if it was moss. It was fucking green. And I'm the guy trying to sell it, as, you know, he's doing his best going, you know, it's a mother-in-law's sweet.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       He can fucking do this, you can do that. There's room to add a little more under the garage. And I just point to the, I'm like, what is that? And he goes, yeah, well you know, you need need. That definitely needs a little bit of work. And uh, so I go into the house and there's this random guy living there who isn't the owner, Reza punk ponytail. It's sparsely furnished, was made the 1920. So it's already like creepy. You can already feel how many people have lived there and are now dead. And uh, we just walk around the house. It got remodeled sometime in the 90s. He had it still had the fucking, uh, you know, Long Chaney Jr vibe of it from the 20s. And uh, I go down stairs, it was like a basement, which they just don't have out here. And, uh, the guy's like, he can make this into a TV room.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       And there was all like these fucking files and film and all this shit down there. And like, you know, that was the first time I was thinking about like a saw or the Blair witch. And I'm like, alright, uh, can we go back upstairs? So we go back upstairs, we go all the way upstairs and there was this random like teenage girl living there that was the daughter of the dude downstairs who wasn't fucking, who lives there, but I don't know, it's not as house. And we look up there and this is stuffy, fucking smell. And then as we go down to go to the master bedroom, they said, oh, the owner is, uh, the owners, just to let you know, the owner is there. He's in the house, which usually they fucking leave. There's all these people just there. And this fucking cat just sitting there looking at me and I do the after you to go to the master bedroom and he does the after you to me. And then I didn't want to be rude. So now I'm walking towards the master bedroom down this creepy fucking Transylvania Hall with the, with the fucking, the guy, Smiley real estate agent behind me who, you know, he's still, I'm sitting there going like, he's regular looking good looking guy. That was to make me feel safe and now I'm fucked and I'm walking towards this fucking door and I opened the fucking door and I look in there and I swear to God, this is guy with like gray skin.

Speaker 4:          00:42:16       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       totally fucking bald. Like the landing strip. And then like, you know, like the little fucking Mr whipple fucking hair around the side that he sorta died at some point, but now it was like this gray. He was totally gray. You could see the veins on the side of his head, like Clint Eastwood, but not like, I wouldn't want to fight Clint Eastwood more like, did this guy die? And then come back. And he was sitting down, hunched down. I think he was typing on the side of his bed. The place was a mess. He just sort of looked over me and as I say, he looked like the fucking dad and uh, the Texas chainsaw massacre and I was just like, what the fuck? So I went like, hey man, how are ya? I sorta stepped around him and then when I went to look into the bathroom, which I did for fucking two seconds, you know, trying to feel the backside pressure by the way, you know, like when a quarterback doesn't feel the Russian of trying to feel that fucking ax, it was about ready to go into my back.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       I look into the bathroom and all along the bathtub, this guy had knee high dress socks drying on and I was just like, no. I was just like, aw man, I'll fuck it's sealed later. And I did, I like give a see that walk racing that they, that was a big fad in the seventies I did that right out of that fucking house. And I tell, I said, the real estate guy, I go, Jesus Christ, I can see why this has been on the market for so fucking long. How the fuck he supposed to sell it when the Goddamn creek kipper keepers is creek keeper, the crypt keeper. I'm like verbally dyslexic. Forget about trying to read. Um, is sitting up there. I didn't dare of looking, you know, I was standing there and I said all this shit. I know those old houses, you can hear everything when you're outside.

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       I'm standing right underneath the fucking bedroom window and I didn't dare look up there cause I had a feeling he was going to be standing in the window staring at me and I was gonna have fucking nightmares and a, and I just, I just five fucking left. I left and I had this creepy fucking feeling that because I went into that house, I got exposed to something and at some point today, my home phone, which I never used, so it never fucking rings is going to ring and I'm going to pick it up and it's going to be that guy's voice going daish and then I gotta somehow expose somebody I know to it so I don't fucking die. Having said that, it was a great house that had a lot of potential. Oh my God,

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       Jesus Christ, that that house needed a giant fucking hug needed to get that guy out of it and just the, you needed to buy all the sage in the state of California and fucking set it on fire. And if in one thing he either happens, either burns out all the spirits or it burns down the house and you start over again. Um, having said that though, despite how fucking creepy it was, uh, the fact that it had a room over a garage, that's, that's the only way I would ever leave this house is if I could find a fucking house. You know, I dunno. I got to get out of this fucking state. I got to get out of this fucking city. It's so fucking stupid. Every fucking house. I don't care how nice it is. You can literally stick your head out the window and before your hand completely extends, you can touch your neighbor's house. It's unbelievable. It's like, where the fuck do you have to go? There's just too many fucking people. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:45       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:46       Should I do some breeds for this week? Let's do some rates. What are we got here? I got a little more advertising to go. A who? Who the fuck wants to listen to me read out loud anymore? Let's Ah, let's read some of the, uh, some of the questions for the week. I'll read two of these and then the last two. Advertisings how about that? All right. And then I'll read the rest of the questions. All right. Polish invention. Hey Bill, I saw this on reddit. Kind of fucked. Do people go to Reddit, by the way? How do you even figure out what's going on? It looks like computer code. People always tell me you got to go on and read it. It's like, I, I, I looks like the fucking declaration of independence. I'm not reading all that shit. I saw this on reddit. It was a machine made by some Polish guy to cut wood. Does knowing it's Polish make you double guests yourself? Double guessed yourself as to whether or not it's good invention because of Polish jokes. Double guests yourself for this guys making fun of Polish people. I definitely did. I'm at the point where I have no idea your thoughts. Um, well, I don't know how to click. I've got to go back here to click the link. I can tell you this. We don't, I don't think we need any better way to cut down fucking trees. Did you ever see that fucking invention?

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:00       It looks like a fucking bulldozer without, without the bulldoze of front end. And the thing just reaches out, grabs the tree, rips it out of the ground, turns it fucking horizontal and it goes up one side where down the other end completely strips it down. And it does this within like fucking

Speaker 2:          00:47:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       I Dunno it within 10 seconds. And literally one man in that machine can do the work of like an army of lumberjacks for a year. It's a, it's terrifying when I sought to be honest with you. You know, as I talk about looking at a house that I don't need and then redoing it, what are you gonna Redo at bill? What are you gonna Redo it with the fucking wood that that machine cut down. Um, all right. Let me see if I can find the, uh, all right, here's the link. Let me look at this thing. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       oh God.

Speaker 2:          00:47:57       Oh

Speaker 1:          00:48:00       well, you know what? I know you're making fun of Polish people. This is just some guy in his backyard came up with this. I bet you couldn't come up with this fucking thing. And to be honest with you, I just had to cut up my Christmas tree for this year. Sorry. I'm sure that was really annoying to listen to. Uh, that's great. Let's see what people say underneath. This is way better than the a thousand degree knife videos. I am irrationally angry at the completely different sizes of cuts of the second log short on fire load. We specialize in short firewood. I don't even know what this guy put on there, but he basically, he hooked it up to his a, once that thing between the transmission and the district differential, uh, passed the universal joint, I'm going fucking blank here. He basically just hooked it up to that. And he's using the engine turning of the engine. Um, why, why, why do people just hate on everybody out there? Good for him. I don't fucking, what was I supposed to trash Polish people. I like Polish people. I like their food and uh, I dunno, I mean I'm, I'm sure they've made movies about it, but not here in the United States because we're so focused on our own fucking point of view, like most countries. But Poland I'm fascinated with because during World War II they were sandwiched between two of the biggest mad men of all time, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. They was stuck in between the two of them,

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       the most precarious fucking position of any country that I can ever fucking think of. And they somehow fucking survived. So I don't think they're dumped. Um, and I look forward someday to going there and seeing that beautiful country eating their food and doing a fucking show. Woo. Having a couple of fucking beers. All right. From Turkey, I'm sick of being called a delusional conspiracy theorist by my family and my legs.

Speaker 5:          00:50:07       E

Speaker 1:          00:50:09       he said, I live in the Republic of Turkey. Maybe you've heard that there was a coup here last year. Yes, I did a, I put it in quotation because it was the most pathetic attempt in Turkish history. Uh, so it didn't go down like the Ukraine. Um, long conspiracy short your guys, we're losing control of our guys who may installed here to have a nice little proxy to the loves the, to the lovely oil desert downtown deserts downtown. I already love how this person is thinking. Ah, so they try to pull the carpet from under our guys cause God knows they can't pass aggression wars in your congress anymore. Since you American citizens are woke as fuck now, thankfully I guess we're not cause I don't know what any of this means. By the way. You don't, right? Like you're from Turkey. Like this is your second language.

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       You're using like really high level slang for someone who lives on the other side of the world. Um, anyways, this pathetic coup attempt created a lot of turmoil here. I mean, it would be less destructive if it succeeded because now through their paranoia, they are going full apeshit, which turns Turkey to a bittersweet heaven for conspiracy theorists like myself with all this stuff going on. Um, all right, well there's no fucking way I'm reading your name so you don't end up in a jail if you actually are from Turkey. Um, I can deal with my family's indifference to all this and my friends are most likely are most like me regarding these subjects, but the fact that my girls stonewall's being goes, um, yeah, DOL. Okay. Really annoys Pete down deep. Of course it does. Anytime you're passionate about an opinion and somebody just goes, oh, really?

Speaker 1:          00:51:54       Okay sweetheart, forget about us. If it's a woman that you have feelings for, um, she is a totally dope chicken. Every other aspect, dude, you not from Turkey, you're not from Turkey, but I'll, I'll continue with this. Fun to hang out, hates the movies and music I hate has c cup fun pillows that were sculpted by God himself from my palms. But I can't help lose respect for her when it comes to her. Not giving a single shit about politics and stuff. She's convinced she doesn't get effected by them for some reason and it doesn't matter. I'm curious how you dealt with this feeling. Also, I'm very interested in how you reach information about the world and what news outlets you trust a from Turkey with love to you and Nia. Uh, all right, well let's say you're from Turkey. Very impressive. Your English and your slang.

Speaker 1:          00:52:44       You're actually better at my language than I am. Um, all right. Here's what you have to understand as a conspiracy theorist is that you're, you're really, uh, you're a lot to deal with and you really wear people out. This is what I learned when I went down the rabbit hole, which I got out of a good two, three years ago, is that as much as you don't trust what the fuck people are telling you, which is really common sense. And I'm not saying there's a bunch of fucking crazy people live in under a mountain pulling the strengths. But what I'm saying is that everybody is spinning this shit because everybody has their own agenda. So you can't, you don't, like if you just, if you fucking showed up to a two car accident, okay, both people are going to spin it in a way, even if one person was 100% right, they're still going to spin it. So there's no fucking way that, you know, they can be perceived, they gonna spin it just cause the other person has spinning just to offset this spinning of it. It's like, listen to that whole fucking Russia tapped into a, you know, hacked into our shit. You're gonna listen to the Democrats spinning it. The Republicans spinning it, the CIA spinning it and then fucking Russia their spin on it. So at the end of it, who the fuck knows what happened?

Speaker 3:          00:54:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:04       I just love how our country is acting. Like we don't spy on Russia and we don't try to influence elections around the fucking world and we haven't placed people in power taken people out and all of that. It's fucking hilarious. All of a sudden it happens to us and it's a big goddamn tragedy. So, um, I would say, uh, respect the fact that she's not into politics. I'm envious of people that can then, you know, I kind of did that after a while, like after a while it's just like you screaming into a tornado.

Speaker 3:          00:54:37       Alright,

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       it's way bigger than you are.

Speaker 3:          00:54:41       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       there are people out there that have the ability and the influence to fucking, I guess turn shit around. But I'm not that guy. I'm just some fucking guy ruining your beer at a bar by bringing all my delusional paranoid fucking thoughts, whether I'm right or not, which I was probably right on a few things like Mel Gibson in that movie where he drove the taxi cab. I was probably right about a few fucker. Thanks. But I don't know what they are. So all you're doing is just annoying the shit out of people. And I have to be honest with you. If your girl actually loves you and she's to the point of responding of, hm, yeah, doll. Okay. I think you've probably worn her down. I bet she didn't say that in the beginning. She probably listened to it and you probably freaked her out and you don't have a solution.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       You're just saying all this fucking shit that's just gonna ruin her day. So maybe that's her defense mechanism. And I'm, what I'm doing is I'm not being a, I'm not going Dr Phil here and just siding with the woman because I don't have a female audience, unlike that fucking dishonest con, right? You need to do what she says. Well, when you look at ladies, when you look at Dr Phil, when you honestly look at that man, do you see somebody? Do you honest? Do you not see how volatile a human being that guy is? Can you just imagine living with that man when he loses his, his shit? Just imagine that semi bald head and face just beat red screaming at you. His spittle getting caught in his mustache. Just imagine that. And he's a big man too. Okay? I'm telling you, I know he's got that southern drawl and you just think everybody's a fucking gentleman. You know the way women love of foreign fucking acts. I guess guys like it too. I Dunno. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Anyways, let's get back to this guy. Um, to lose respect for the fact that somebody's not into what the fuck you're into is, uh, at, that's a sign. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       it'd be one thing if she just didn't give a fuck about a mate, I don't know. I, I'd have to know who the fuck she was. That could just be a defense mechanism where it's just like, whatever doesn't affect my life. You know, I've done that with global warming and all of that type of shit. I've just started to block it out because there's nothing I can do to get people to, I don't, and I don't even know what the s I don't even what the fucking solution is. The only solution I have is to fucking exterminate most of us, 90% of us. And then just fucking everybody sits in a ball and hopes that, uh, everything that we've put into the earth and into the air kind of goes away after a while that that's the only solution I have, which I don't think that that's gonna work.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       So, um, I don't know. I just, you know, I, I, I try to fucking do whatever the fuck I can do, which is, you know, I dunno. See Dude, this is why people don't like could see you lea. You literally bringing this up is Brent brought me to a dark fucking place and your email alone just told me that just got me to say that we need to exterminate 90% of the people on the fucking planet. How insane is that? How are you going to do that, bill? You're going to do that to babies too, or you're not going to do babies, but you're going to kill all those fucking parents and then what you're gonna have the most giant fucking nursery like it all. It all unravels the whole fucking thing. That's why I kinda stopped doing the conspiracy theory thing even though I still throw it out there because it's fun. And I, and I also don't believe a fucking word anybody's telling me. Um, when it comes to that shit, you know, one-on-one, you know, if I sat down with somebody and there's not cameras around then I could feel like they can really be honest with me. But the second year on TV, you know, there's only so honest you could be. Um, so

Speaker 6:          00:58:36       wow.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       I Dunno. I, I would probably guess that on some level your a lot to be around during certain new stories and uh, I think you should lighten up a little bit. Take your girlfriend out, go get a fucking ice cream and enjoy the fact that someone is beautiful as you're saying is she is actually can tolerate you and your, your fucking theories. All right. Having said that, if I ever go to Turkey, I'll definitely have a beer with you and I'll fucking, I'll, I'll go fucking Tofa toe with you that with conspiracy theories. Um, all right. And thank you for listening to the podcast. Okay. Girlfriend was unwillingly married. What? All right, dear Billy psycho tits. I don't know what means, but I like that one. I'm 25 years old and finally found out the girl of my dreams and finally found the girl on my dreams.

Speaker 1:          00:59:27       Well, good for you dude. You found a pretty young a, she's 23 years old, smash, super attractive, and we have been in a relationship for the last nine months. I don't even have the urge to go to bars and sleep with women anymore. She has me all types of screwed up. It's amazing. My family loves her, especially my father who never gives a shit about my relationships. Um, she's from Yemen and is Muslim and although she hit, she doesn't really follow the religion. She is forced. She's forced to by her parents. That being said, one weekend last month, she told me her sister was having an arranged marriage and she was headed to the wedding. I did not hear from her for three days. She finally contacted. Oh No. She finally contacted me back after I constantly reached out to her and she told me we had to talk. Oh No. Once we met up, she told me she was unwillingly married off to a man from Yemen and that she had no idea this was going to happen. Oh my God. Is this real? Is this a lifetime script? She told me that since her parents sign the marriage documents, she really had no choice in her religion, in God's eye. She was, she's married. She made it clear that she was in love with me and that she wanted to be with me. Is is dead fucking chick who punches herself in the chest going to start singing at this point. What's her name? She does the casino gigs. She's from Canada. She sang the titanic song. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:01:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:11       Leonardo DiCaprio on the the ship. Whatever the fucking song, you know that's, that's in the arms of the angel. That's about rescue dogs. What fucking song? Oh yeah. Nia Fall. Whoa,

Speaker 7:          01:01:32       Woo.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       Ugh. How much does she fucking hate that song? Having to sing that to a bunch of casino dope. Sit there and flip flops getting teared up, you know? Anyways, she made it clear with me. She made it clear that she was in love with me and that she wanted me to be with me only she told me she pleaded with their parents, but they wouldn't budge. We then came up with the date that if her parents still wouldn't budge, she would just move in with me out of her parents' home and we would figure it out together during the, during the week after text messages turn to about three messages a day and I did not get to see her at all.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:14       All right. Then this, you know, even if you made this up, this is an incredible story. I then got a message from her best friend and she told me that our debt, my girlfriend was lying to me. Oh, now, now who do you believe? She told me that my girl had been engaged since she was 16 years old. Her new husband is forcing himself to try to fuck her and she is threatening her and is threatening her with violence. All right, dude, this is going outside the realm of, of my silly little podcast here, as well as taking her, taking her f uh, away or phone. Um, she does make it clear that my girl does love me with all her heart, but will never leave due to her parents disowning her if she decides to leave this marriage, what the fuck? Oh, what period?

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       The period fuck period. I immediately contact my girl and she admits to everything she told me. She knew about the wedding beforehand and doesn't think she could do that to her family. He's trying to have sex with her, but she cries and then he just stops. Oh boy. Well, you know what? I commend that other guy. You know what I mean? Any guy who can plow through a woman crying, that's, she's just a fucking animal that needs to be shot in the back of the fucking head. So this guy is actually not a bad guy. I don't think he's just wrapped up in the fucking customer. Ah, Jesus Christ. Gotta love religion. Everybody, I have no idea what to do. She won't go against her parents, but she loves me and she just given up. Uh, she was such a strong and tough person. Now she just going with the unwilling.

Speaker 1:          01:03:46       Maybe she should just keep crying and that guy's decent enough to do due to just be like, all right, you know, fuck this over t or a friend told me she's depressed and doesn't have the fight in her. Currently she's blocked by friends. Our mutual friends and our family are from social media. My family and friends have been calming me down. This guy who thinks he owns my girl would get American history x Curbstop if I find out he lays a hand on her. All right. This stop being funny, like at least nine paragraphs ago. Like I usually have like lighthearted, funny shit here, but that might also complicate things for her. Yeah. If you murdered the guy. Absolutely. Anyways, I love your podcast. Don't stop what you're doing. Want to go fuck yourself. I don't believe that. I don't believe that story. I'm not saying Shit like that doesn't happen, but I don't believe that someone would write this level of serious shit into me. Um, yeah, I don't put that deck. That got a little too fucking sensational for me. Not saying that shit like that doesn't happen, but I know if that actually is true. I don't know why you're writing to this podcast. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:04:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       I think at that point you need to write to a, I'm going to say it's wrong, isn't it? Niamh Lisa Ma, Liam Neeson, that fucking guy. You need, you need to write to that guy and find out who wrote the scripts in the words that he said and then find out what they base that off of and gradually go back and find whoever the fuck Liam needs some Niamh. Lisa is pretending to fucking be. I should know who guy's fucking name is, right. Considering I act every once in awhile. I should know who one of the best guys out there at Liam.

Speaker 2:          01:05:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       Neeson. Oh, okay. Liam Neeson is born in 1952 Jesus Christ, decades like 60 63 fucking years old. And I still wouldn't fuck with them. Not even remotely. You know certain actors that play a character and you're like, yeah, he's just pretending to be a tough guy. Then there's other people where you're just like, you know, you know, I think that guy could really beat the shit out of me. You know? You just saw on the ground, where does this say? All right.

Uh, banged friends. Virgin X. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:46       All right. Let's start again. Deer, strawberry, Billy pubes forever. Star Billy pubes forever. There we go. A month back. A recent recently acquired friend was at my house and unbeknownst to me, his girlfriend at the time was my next door neighbor. A few weeks later, they had broken up because she wasn't putting out. Apparently they had dated for three months and he couldn't take it anymore. Here's the thing of Jesus. One thing led to another. Next thing you know, long story short, a week ago, I was drunk with a different buddy. One thing led to another, sorry. Uh, and we decided it would be funny to invite her and her roommates over to play board games. I was pretty buzzed and had all the confidence in the world. I walked over to her house and it just so happened she was the only one home though Jesus. She invited me in. It's just like some red shoe diaries. This really happened. She invited me in for some cookies. Her sorority made one thing led to another.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       Hey, we go and we ended up fucking, one thing led to another, a the classic phrase, she was obviously inexperienced, so it was nothing to write home about. This normally wouldn't be a problem except she's my next door neighbor. So naturally I have repeated the process about a dozen times. My question is, should I tell my friend normally I wouldn't say anything, but I think I'm falling for this girl. He's been kind of distanced lately so he might have some suspicions. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Please come to San Diego and cool. Congrats on the baby. Uh, Jesus. Is there anything funnier than a young man with a Dick? You know Jesus Christ, Dude. You think he's getting suspicious? She lives next door. You've been over there 12 times. Yeah, he's going to figure it out. Um, well look, you know, he broke up with her. He was only there with her for three months.

Speaker 1:          01:10:42       How well did you, how well, how, how much, how f are you great friends with this person? Yeah. It gets messy. It gets mad. I don't know what you're asking me here. You know it's a fucking great story. Other than it used to be your friend's girlfriend, but he fucking tapped out. Maybe that's what you should say to him when he calls you on it. You just spend, he should have tapped out, man. Should've kept mining for gold. Is Golden in there hills. Um, I don't, the fact that you've been with this girl for 12 times and you think you're falling for her, I don't think you're falling for her. I think you'd love the convenience of it. If I had to guess. You really didn't write too deeply about your fucking

Speaker 2:          01:11:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:27       Yeah. About your fucking feelings for this girl. I think you went further into the fact that how you fucking nailed this girl and your, your, your friend didn't. So, uh, I don't know if you're really not into this girl. I would just pull the fucking plug and I would never bring it up and I'd wait til that guy is a couple of Miller highlights into him. And at that point I would stay out of his wheelhouse cause he might fucking suck a puncher cause you know what happened. All right. What did he say? Bang friends. Ex girlfriend. So he didn't say he accidentally did it. So yeah. Well you know, you knew what you were doing and you did it and now that's the, that's that's the world you created and you're living in it. So I don't know what to tell you. Um, other than if you're not really falling for this girl, I would stop fucking her. There you go. I don't care how good the cookies are. All right. Calling girlfriend at cunt a belt. Hope Fatherhood is treating you well. If it finally happened has not happened yet. Recently my girlfriend was being very unreasonable and running her mouth about something and I said she was being a cunt. Didn't call her a [inaudible], rather acting like one. I, you know what? There is a loophole there.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       There is a loophole there, but when he dropped the seaward it's, it's very difficult. Like I've never called my wife a bitch ever. I've never done it the entire time at Bu. I never called it that once. One time I did say that she was acting like one and uh, she brought that up for like fucking three years because she knew how important it was to me to never call her that and she fucking, we got into a fight and then she pushed my buttons trying to get me fucking more and more mad cause that's what they do and they're not doing it maliciously. That's how they fight. Most of them were guys go, what'd you've talked, you'd say? And then you start fucking fist fighting. Women usually don't get to that level. So their fist fighting is a, they, they've already broken you down psych psychologically and they just try to make you as mad as they can.

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       And um, if you're with a cool woman, they'll, they'll take responsibility for that and they'll eventually forgive you. Um, so anyways. All right, so you said that she was acting like one. Okay. Since then, she's had her panties in a twist and thanks. I owe her an apology. I haven't given her one. My thoughts are that if anyone, male or female is acting like a con, I can call them a con. What she thought thoughts on women calling women account and have you gotten into trouble for calling a woman account? I've never done that. Uh, to a woman that I've dated, have I ever called a woman at account?

Speaker 1:          01:14:10       You know, it's funny. Much as I use that word, I don't think I've ever done that. Um, no, I don't do the name colon thing as angry as I am. If I ever done that, I'd definitely like, yeah, fuck you. You fucking psycho. I've done that. But I, I don't, I don't do the, uh, I don't do the, the, the fucking, the a, those classics. I don't, I don't, I don't break out the classics. I don't say bitch cunt. I don't say any of that. Um, yeah, I don't, I just don't. I saw, I saw that early on in my life that that doesn't work. And I saw what it does to a relationship. I just saw it. Um, you know, I had a paper route when I was a kid. So, you know, you get to step into a lot of people's homes and watch a little movie trailer and a lot of times you're walking up to the house and you can hear the, the, the director's cut of what's going on before you went in there, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       So I saw a lot of that, you know, being from Massachusetts, it was a lot of hotheads and, uh, I dunno as much as a, as a dick as I am, um, I've never done that and I can tell you that it gets you nowhere. So, um, and the thing, the stubborn thing that you're doing right now that you're not apologizing for it, is going to cause her to dig her heels in. And what you're doing is you're creating this toxic fucking cesspool in your relationship. Okay. You could have set a bunch of other words and you went to def con five or whatever the fuck is it one? Is One the worst or is five the worst, whatever the worst one you went? No, killer honor. I think you should apologize and just say, for the record, I didn't say you were a cunt. I respect you enough to not call you a cunt. I just said you were acting like what? Okay. I won't do that in the future. I was wrong. I don't even don't even defend you, but you say, I apologize for what I said. I shouldn't have said it. Just, just apologize. All right.

Speaker 8:          01:16:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       And there'll be some rigid residual shit, but I can tell you right this right now, if you're gonna make a real, uh, a relationship work, when you're in the wrong, you have to apologize. You have to do that. Because if you don't apologize, if you always get your fucking back up, if you fight him every fucking step of the way, then you stopped being a person to them. You just this thing, you just, this loud, annoying fucking thing. Okay? But if you say you, sorry. If he ever, if you say like, you know what, you're right, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The Times when you actually are defending your position, you have clout because you admitted that you were wrong when you were wrong. So there you go. Now I'm not saying she wasn't being a cunt, okay? Now that's the type of thing.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       If you want to say that, that's what you say when you got you one fucking buddy, who for the most part can keep his fucking mouth shut. But even then, you can't depend on that, okay? If you're ever going to call you a woman a can, you fucking do it. You go for a drive and you do it in your car by yourself and you yell everything that you want to yell because she's not listening to you. You make all your fucking points. You fucking crush it. You give your closing argument to the invisible jury inside your car. And then in the end, you know, and if you actually stop for a second and listen to me, you don't understand that, but you can't because you're such a fucking cop, right?

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       And then you'll look over, you know, at the other person's sitting there at the red light with you. And if it's another guy, if it's me, I'm going to laugh, you know, not at you, but I'm going to laugh. No one, what the fuck you doing? And if it's a woman, she's probably going to laugh. No one what the fuck you're doing. Or if she's a cunt, she's going to fucking squint, arise at her and be more of a cunt.

Speaker 3:          01:18:21       There you go. So, um,

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       yeah, I do not. Nor would I ever do that. I would to the, to the, to my wife, I would never fucking do that. Uh, I wouldn't do that to any woman that I was in business with. I would do that with any fucking PR. I would do that in general. Uh, but, uh, generally speaking, when I talk about people,

Speaker 3:          01:18:45       um,

Speaker 1:          01:18:46       I kind of just call men cuts.

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:51       I think it's funny to call a man a cunt, to call a woman. A conti is a [inaudible] system. Funny.

Speaker 3:          01:18:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:59       I would call it a guy who can't, is fucking hilarious. And I stand by that. All right? Not say that this, God knows that word exists for fucking reason, but, uh, it's just too fucking mean and I'm telling you, you lose, you lose in the end because, uh, you know, they could just make your life miserable in every court of law, generally speaking, out there is going to side with them. And next thing you know, you will never play drums again because she's going to take them from you, all right? Not The fucking baby. Okay? That's the podcast for this week.

Speaker 3:          01:19:34       Uh, God bless you. All right, you fucking cons. Uh, go fuck yourselves and I will check in on you on Thursday.
