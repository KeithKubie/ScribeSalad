In this lesson, we will discuss storage
systems such as hard drives and

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.450
how they're connected to
the rest of the computer.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.270
This will help us understand
why they are so much slower but

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.280
can store so
much more data than the main memory.
