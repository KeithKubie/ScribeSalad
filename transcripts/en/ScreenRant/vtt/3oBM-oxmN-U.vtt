00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.640
Make up is and always has been a big part
of the movies.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.960
These days, however, an awful lot of the special
effects that make up aesthetically complex

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.250
characters are non-practical - generated,
for example, using sophisticated CGI.But there's

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.660
something a bit more charming about old school
make up.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.830
If and when it's possible to make a character
look fantastic via the magic of make up artistry,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.340
that should always be the first choice for
any production.There have been some amazing

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.920
transformations throughout movie history using
practical make up effects and this video will

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920
look at some of the best.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.590
Here are ten of the craziest movie make up
transformations you won't actually believe.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.430
Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight
The late Heath Ledger gave an Oscar-winning

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.149
performance as Batman's arch-nemesis The Joker
in The Dark Knight - and his make up certainly

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.149
helped.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.909
The remarkable thing about Ledger's make up
in this movie is that there really wasn't

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.730
much of it - it wasn't very "heavy" - but
Ledger was still totally unrecognisable and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.620
mysterious under the face paint and scar prosthetics.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.120
Costume designer Lindy Hemming came up with
the anarchical design, which took inspiration

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.460
from pop artists like Pete Doherty, Iggy Pop,
and Johnny Rotten.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.380
It was made up of three pieces of stamped
silicone - a "new technology" at the time

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.940
- and took less than an hour for the movie's
make up artists to apply.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.561
Jeff Goldblum in The Fly
1986's The Fly was a remake of the 1958 movie

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.570
of the same name and, as you would expect,
the make up effects were vastly improved on

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.570
the original.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.100
Jeff Goldblum played the lead role of Seth
Brundle, who transformed into the hideous

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.290
"Brundlefly" when a common housefly joined
him in a teleportation pod of his own invention

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.950
and their bodies merged.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.920
Chris Walas both designed and executed the
Academy Award-winning make up that conveyed

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.950
the transformation over seven different stages,
culminating in a terrifying final form that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.840
was asymmetrical and deformed, looking almost
cancerous in nature.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.200
Michael Keaton in Beetlejuice
Beetlejuice won the Academy Award for best

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.310
make up, as the effects created by the make
up team were fantastic throughout the movie,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.320
but none were more iconic in appearance than
the titular character himself, who was played

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320
by Michael Keaton.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.700
Ve Neill, Steve LaPorte and Robert Short were
the make up geniuses behind the movie's fantastic

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.140
aesthetic, with Keaton's twisted and perverted
Beetlejuice made up to look like a disgusting

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.260
rotting corpse.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.050
And yet somehow the character was actually
quite likeable?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.060
Weird.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.510
Linda Blair in The Exorcist
Linda Blair's make up in the terrifying horror

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.790
classic The Exorcist turned her from an innocent
and pretty young girl into a horrifying-looking

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.660
victim of demonic possession.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.370
Blair's character, Regan MacNeil, was made
to look like the demon inside her was destroying

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.740
her body from within, as her face turned a
sickly shade of pale green and became covered

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.430
in painful-looking sores.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.730
Dick Smith was the man behind the make up
for the movie, which also involved making

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.270
Max von Sydow's character, Father Lankester
Merrin, look 74 when the actor was only 44

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.740
at the time of filming.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.840
Jim Carrey in How the Grinch Stole Christmas
How the Grinch Stole Christmas saw the wonderful

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.810
Jim Carrey transformed into Dr. Seuss' iconic
character, the grumpy titular Grinch.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.650
Transformation into the green, furry, pig-nosed
miser was a real chore for the actor.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.709
The prosthetic make-up took around eight hours
to apply by a team of make up artists - and

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.790
it also took around an hour to get out of.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.630
Carrey deserves a medal for spending 92 days
wearing it, as he felt so horribly confined

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.040
and uncomfortable in the latex skin that he
needed counseling from a CIA agent, who taught

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.770
him torture-resistance techniques to deal
with the discomfort.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.099
Ron Perlman in Hellboy/Hellboy II: The Golden
Army

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.540
Ron Perlman already has the gruff, square-jawed
look that made him perfect to play Hellboy,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.130
but the make up that finished the job was
pretty damn great.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.489
Matt Rose at Cinovation Studios was responsible
for the design and transformation, which gave

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.580
Perlman a red face, clipped horns, a big hammer-like
hand and left his eyelids as the only part

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.330
of his body that were visible.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.140
Incidentally, in 2012, Perlman visited a sick
young boy named Zachary in full Hellboy make

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.490
up - and he looked every bit as cool as he
did in the movie itself.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.739
In a way, he looked very similar to Tim Curry
as Darkness in Legend, who is also very worthy

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.400
of a mention on this list.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.620
Charlize Theron in Monster
The incredibly beautiful Charlize Theron underwent

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.599
an unbelievable transformation into serial
killer Aileen Wuornos for 2003's brilliant

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.599
crime drama Monster.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.510
Wuornos - a former prostitute - killed six
men, and Theron's resemblence to her was uncanny

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.730
by the time her make up was applied.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.669
Theron put on 30lbs of weight, shaved her
eyebrows and wore both contact lenses and

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.590
prosthetic dentures to portray her, but it
was the work of make up artist Toni G that

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.130
really made the transformation so spectacular.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.220
Theron's skin was aged and freckles were added.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.590
Combined with an Oscar-worthy acting performance
from the actress, the transformation was complete.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.030
Eric Stoltz in Mask
The make up Eric Stoltz wore in The Mask was

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.210
fantastic.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.490
Portraying Roy L. "Rocky" Dennis, Stoltz's
make up augmented a performance that was already

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.840
both extremely heartfelt and, frankly, emotionally
draining.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.520
The make up emphasised the devastating nature
of Dennis' condition - craniodiaphyseal dysplasia

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.840
- without exaggerating it in a crude or disrespectful
way.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.530
Michael Westmore and Zoltan Elek were the
creative masterminds behind a transformation

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.100
that rendered Stoltz completely unrecognisable.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.820
John Hurt in The Elephant Man
John Hurt portrayed Joseph Merrick AKA the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.400
Elephant Man in the brilliant and moving 1980
movie of the same name, and the make up involved

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.850
was incredible - so incredible, in fact, that
it holds up nearly forty years later, in an

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.560
age when unbelievably realistic CGI is commonplace.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.729
Make up artist Christopher Tucker designed
the look for Hurt's character - who suffered

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.550
from severe cranial deformities - from actual
casts of Merrick and it made such an impression

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.389
that the Academy decided to add a category
make up category to the Oscars, as protest

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.820
letters were sent to them for not giving The
Elephant Man an award for it.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.889
Rebecca Romijn &amp; Jennifer Lawrence in the
X-Men Movies

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.280
Both Rebecca Romijn and Jennifer Lawrence
have portrayed the shapeshifting mutant known

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.790
as Mystique AKA Raven Darkholme in the X-Men
franchise - and the transformation both actresses

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.080
underwent was pretty damn amazing.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.000
Mystique's natural form is a beautiful blue
scaly work of art, and Romijn and Lawrence

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.870
had to each undergo around seven hours' worth
of make up being applied by fairly large teams

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.800
of make up artists, whilst half naked, to
become the character - and we think you'll

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.009
agree that both of them looked absolutely
awesome.
