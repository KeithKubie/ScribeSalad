1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,400
Thank you for a second. Well, there was
the year before they launched cern, uh,

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,400
that little article and open up a,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,400
that black hole that it will create a
particle that would devour the fabric of

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,190
the universe. Yeah. It was a black hole.

5
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:18,150
It would expand and expand
and expand until what we did.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,230
God, man, maybe we restarted. Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe we were in a parallel universe.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,530
Maybe we were knocked off our timeline
into another place. It makes less sense.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,710
Yeah, it was, it was the
things going on in the unit,

9
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:34,440
a little radios that the evidence of
multiple universes that we pop in and out

10
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,730
of different realities. Right? Like
the fact that we, it's a multiverse,

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,480
the Ford logo,
let's say.

12
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,240
Do you remember you recognize this
part of the Ford logo and they see,

13
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:47,160
most people never noticed it. This weird
little squiggle in the AF. Really? Yeah.

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,150
And they said the Fedex thing blows
people's minds to what's that?

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,810
It's the Arrow. What Arrow? Exactly.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,680
Bring ups. Fedex. If you
never, if you, you'll never
not see the Arrow again. Yeah.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,970
Same thing with the Ford logo.
It's like there's perceptions.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,170
It's like hmm. And sit there the
whole time and I didn't. Yes,

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,960
I didn't know there was an arrow there.

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,720
There people will insist that
the Fedex Arrow is really, oh,

21
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:19,740
interesting. Okay. But that's an
accidental arrow. No, you'd think so.

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,080
They designed it in there.
Where's the air?

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,500
They definitely designed it right there.
Yeah, right there. The white part? Yeah.

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,480
Oh now. Oh yeah. Now I never see it
again or never not see it again. I know.

25
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,440
It's funny,
Huh?

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,150
But I mean that could be like four years
before it was the little squiggle in

27
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:39,930
the f Jews. Why is that a squiggle?
Why is it that that's ridiculous?

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,070
Cause it actually makes an effort like
that. Yeah. It actually spells fjord.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,990
Yeah. Or food. If your
[inaudible] is that an eye?

30
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:52,410
What is it? Why did they squeak a
lot? Did they do that? Oh, it's not.

31
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:56,510
That didn't use to do that in
Richmond to say it's time. It's time.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,120
It's right in front of you that you don't
think that's right. Yeah, that's right.

33
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:04,770
You the people who insist that
Miguel had died in jail, in jail.

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,010
So was there always a squiggle? When did,
what is that? Is that a real forward,

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,040
that little thing? When did
they make the squiggle? Okay.

36
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,960
That's normal because that's
what I thought. The fourth
thing look like someone,

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,740
until I saw this maybe in a village
that they stopped the squiggle.

38
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:23,250
At some point they must have, or the
opposite. Maybe they add the squiggle,

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,990
bring up the swiggle without some monitor.
Do the research. What's a modern Ford?

40
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,100
Go to a,
you put 2019 Ford Mustang.

41
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,180
Let's see that. Let's see if they'd
have the squiggles. A squiggle.

42
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,850
Now it does some,

43
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,470
the squiggle asshole wanted to justify
his existence by ruining their beautiful

44
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:47,210
logo. Yeah. Um, let's see. I mean,

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,050
logos do change that does the squiggle
squiggle? Yeah. That's a new Mustang.

46
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:55,980
So the squiggle was occurrent.
Yeah. Yup. The squiggles current.

47
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,500
It really doesn't fit.
No, it looks stupid.

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,680
It would look better without
that stupid score home.

49
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,670
The only thing that's saving
that squiggles that no one
noticed it up until now.

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,620
Oh Great. Now, I'm never going to notice
the Mandela effect. I Hate Mandela effect,

51
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,840
but that just seems like people fucking
with something that's not broken. Yeah.

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,550
Right. Yeah. Um, it's like,
let's just make it up. Right.

53
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:22,090
Remember when they came up with a
new coke? Fuck God was like a riot.

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,170
A riot on their heads of a parallel
universe. It's just a stupid idea.

55
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,030
Just ruined coke. Yep. Jeff, the cokes
made with real cocaine. The original coke.

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,940
Yeah. No, today. Today. Yes.
What that the at that they
replaced it with caffeine. No,

57
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,040
they use coca leaves. Smack in the
coca leaves for flavor. Yes. In fact,

58
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:43,970
the company, dude, it's crazy. The
company that makes the cocaine,

59
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,740
the um,

60
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,160
the company that uses the coca leaves
that brings in the coca leaves to make

61
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,630
Coca Cola is the number one.
You creator of medical grade cocaine,

62
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,160
they use that coca leaf to also
make medical grade cocaine.

63
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,470
There's no cocaine in,
in Coca Cola,

64
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:03,490
but there is a flavor that's a
bunch of different four logos. Yeah.

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,880
Over the years I drink diet
coke. Would you? Seven,

66
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,430
1927 to 2003. All of them. Huh. Huh?

67
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,140
I like the one in 1903, that's
actually a pretty dope. Um,

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,060
Google coke.

69
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,040
They use coca leaves to make Coca
Cola. They still do. They actually do.

70
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:28,330
And then the company does that
cause it makes cocaine because the,

71
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,890
yeah cause the recipe for its coats,
laser herbal.

72
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,020
There's like a lot of herbs that go
into coke. Yes. It's a flavor. Yeah.

73
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,410
But the Diet coke is just chemicals.
It's all artificial.

74
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,950
Remember I was in school in the new
coke thing happened and then Celia,

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,160
this advertising besides producing
the cocoa flavor agent for Coca Cola,

76
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,770
the Stephan company extracts
cocaine from the coca leaves,

77
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,100
which sells it to Mallon.

78
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,380
Crocked a Saint Louis Missouri
pharmaceutical manufacturer.

79
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:57,070
That is the only company the United
States licensed to purify cocaine from

80
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:01,270
medical use. But digital
use. Yeah, there you go.

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,740
So they actually using actual coca
leaves. So someone, I guarantee you,

82
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,300
if you follow the paperwork,

83
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:11,200
there's a bunch of cocaine hanging
around residual to those guys.

84
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:15,130
They get a little bit here and there at
work gives you a little pep me up. Right.

85
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,920
That's what's amazing is that you're
not allowed to chew the leaves.

86
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:21,670
Cause apparently chewing the leaves is
really healthy. Yeah. You get flavonoids.

87
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,720
It's actually good for you and it gives
you a pickup that's very similar to

88
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:26,290
caffeine.
