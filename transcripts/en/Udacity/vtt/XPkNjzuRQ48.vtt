00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now I want you to extend your routine to accommodate the landmark

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Specifically, I want you to use a function that I coded for you that is very useful

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that is called "expand."

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can run omega.expand, xi.expand to take a 3 x 3 matrix or vector

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and move it to a 4 x 4 vector that you actually need when you have to include

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the landmark itself.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Give that a try and see if you can modify the code

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to now have additional input parameters of measurement 0, 1, and 2.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In particular, here is our new doit routine.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It now has as input parameters my 2 motion commands

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and the 3 measurement commands for the 3 different poses.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Here is the code that you produced before.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's my version of it where we have the initial 3 x 3 matrix.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Then using the expansion command

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you can now increase those to a 4 x 4 matrix and a 4 x 1 vector.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
When you run it what comes out is this result over here-- -3, 2, 5, 7.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I want you to do this where -3 and 2 and 5 is the robot path,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and 7, as before, is the landmark location.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Please code this and realize that I can modify the input to doit just fine,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and your code should not just produce this one vector,

00:01:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but it should implement the right math.
