Every one of you here tonight, and watching at home,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.250
has a brain inside your head. 
Every brain is important.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.449
Every brain is unique. But all brains have
the same

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.250
basic machinery working. 
So how does the brain work?

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.300
Well, to help me answer these questions,
I've invited along another brain scientist

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:33.200
Professor Vince Walsh from University
College London so give a big round of applause to Vince.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.469
So Vince, you've brought along a special
machine that

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.309
influences the brain which we're gonna see
in action in a moment. But before we do so,

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.460
let's start with a very simple demonstration.
Do you know the nursery rhyme

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.010
Baa baa black sheep? 
I think so.
Could you give us maybe the first line?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.920
Baa baa black sheep have you any wool?
That's very good, it's reassuring to know

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.510
that professors still know their nursery rhymes.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.940
Okay, I'm gonna get you to repeat that 
but this time

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.990
I'm going to stimulate this part of your
brain with your machine

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.380
Start please 
Baa baa bla jaa beee yeea byee

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.930
[laughter]

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.830
Would you like me to do some more
disruption of Vince's brain?

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.880
Yes
Okay Vince I'm sorry but we're going to
put you through some more.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.000
Okay so what else should we try?
How about some some motor control?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.780
We could do that, we could try left and right-handed.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.690
Can we try just affecting your right
hand would that be okay?

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.060
I'm going to take a magnet now it's
fully charged up again

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.200
I'll touch my nose a few times

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.470
Okay, let's see how accurate you are
when I place it up here.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.700
Is that the correct area?
Yes umm

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.880
Now Vince, tell us what that feels like

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.400
It's actually quite painless but
I've lost control of my muscles

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.610
I've lost control of my
ability to

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.140
locate my a hand in space.
It's a very very weird sensation.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.490
Can we do one last example? 
Can you clap for us?

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.710
I'll stick the magnet here, are you ready?

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.700
Start clapping please.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.870
[Laughter]
I think we've put you through enough Vince.
