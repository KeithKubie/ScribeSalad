00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.220
One of the assays that
we do here in our lab

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.970
is called larval turning.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.040
And what we do is we take a
seven-day-old larva that you

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.530
see here on this screen.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.620
This is a larva with ALS.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.520
And we can flip it over
using a paintbrush,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.110
and time to see how long this
larva takes to flip over,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.120
belly-side down, and make its
first forward fluid motion.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.720
Flies are a great model system
that have been traditionally

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.340
used to study development,
and to identify

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.640
genes that are important
for human development,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.470
for human health.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.210
And in the past
several years, they

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.990
have been used to
study human diseases.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.400
We can test what happens
here at this protein level

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.690
with these small molecules.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.570
And I give it to her, she
can test a small molecule

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.690
on her fly, and she can
test it in this ALS model.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.020
And we sort of work on
developing in silico,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.780
on the computer, here is some
protein, do we put-- here

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.590
is where we want to target
the small molecule after we've

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.020
studied it in my lab of
what's wrong with it,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.580
and here's where we can fix it.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.890
And then once we fix it, we
take it to the next step.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.480
Daniela test it in the fly.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.190
She gives it back to
us, and we sort of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.700
go into this really
wonderful circle.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.180
We have the tools in the fly
model to tweak those changes

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.550
and see what would be
the most effective way

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.420
to restore neuronal function,
and figure out strategies that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.250
could help motor neuron
survival that can potentially

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.460
prolong a patient's life, and
improve the quality of life.
