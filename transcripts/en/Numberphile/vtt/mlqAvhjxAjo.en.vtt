00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.630
JAMES GRIME: Today, Brady,
we're going to

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.060
look at Smith numbers.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.690
And Smith numbers were born
in an unusual place.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.710
They were born in a telephone
directory when somebody was

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.820
looking up the phone number of
their brother-in-law and wrote

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.990
down the number, and then
realized it had some unusual

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.740
properties.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.790
493-7775--

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.140
BRADY HARAN: And that's
a Smith number?

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.520
JAMES GRIME: That's
a Smith number.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.902
BRADY HARAN: And whose
number was it?

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:31.120
JAMES GRIME: It was, in
fact, Harold Smith.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.010
And he was, I think, the
brother-in-law of Albert

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.400
Wilansky, who was trying to
contact him and found him in

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.400
the phone directory.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.230
So Wilansky made the
breakthrough in realizing that

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.980
there was some nice property
about this particular number.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.050
So this is, perhaps, a bit big
to start off with in defining

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.360
a Smith number.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.650
But a Smith number is
a special number.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.910
The sum of the integers that
make up the number is the same

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.760
as the sum of the prime
factors of the number.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.330
27 is a Smith number.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.099
Well, first of all, let me
just write out the prime

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.840
factors of 27.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.270
So 27 can be written in
the following way--

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.510
3 times 3 times 3.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.710
OK.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.830
Now, let me do the following.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.250
Add these two numbers together
that make 27--

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.630
2 plus 7.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.500
And you'll notice that that's
equal to the sum

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.230
of the prime factors--

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.970
3 plus 3 plus 3,
which equals 9.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.010
And that's what makes
up a Smith number.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.820
A famous one, the one that
you've already covered in

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.150
Numberphiles, which is
the beast number--

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.170
666.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.380
So that breaks into 2 times
3 times 3 times 37.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.010
OK?

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.580
If you multiply these together,
you'll get back 666.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.820
Now, let's add these
digits together.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.300
So 6 plus 6 plus 6--

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.520
and that is the same as
2 plus 3 plus 3--

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.120
and now comes the subtle bit.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.440
You don't add 37.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.040
You break 37 up into
its digits.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.930
So let me put 3 plus 7.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.870
And hopefully, this works.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.800
6 plus 6 plus 6 is 18.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.500
2 plus 3 is 5 plus 3 is 8 plus
3 is 11 plus 7 is 18.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.680
And so that's why 666 is
also a Smith number.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.125
Let's go to the original
Smith number.

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.660
And let's have a
go at that one.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.800
What gets me is how he
realized that this

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.680
was going to work.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.140
First of all, get the
prime factors.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:58.830
So it's 3 times 5 times
5 times 65,837.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.240
It's that bit that I really
think is really neat.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.310
What we can do is add
up the digits

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.480
that make up the number.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.640
4 plus 9 plus 3--

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.610
plus 5.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.710
And this should equal 3 plus 5
plus 5 plus-- and then we do

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.650
this trick, right?

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.370
We break this up into its
individual digits--

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.880
plus 3 plus 7.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.680
I hope this works, Brady,
otherwise I'm

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.300
looking a right idiot.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.390
4 plus 9 is 13 plus 3 is 16--

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.872
plus 5 is 42.

00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:34.200
BRADY HARAN: 42!

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.670
JAMES GRIME: Yay.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.030
OK.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.360
Let me confidently
write 42 there.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.120
And now, let's check
if it works here.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.430
5 plus 5 is 10 plus 3 is 13--

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.060
plus 10 is 42.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.166
It worked.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.000
BRADY HARAN: There we go.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.830
It's a Smith number.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.693
JAMES GRIME: And that's
a Smith number.

00:03:50.693 --> 00:03:51.400
BRADY HARAN: Do you
like those ones?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.510
JAMES GRIME: I like
that number.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.130
I think it's really nice.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.100
BRADY HARAN: What do
you like about it?

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.120
JAMES GRIME: I like the fact
that, first of all, it's a

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.860
number where you've broken
it down into its--

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.910
I'm a physicist, right?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.420
I believe in building
blocks, quarks, the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.000
building blocks of matter.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.720
These are the building blocks
of mathematics, right?

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.040
The prime numbers are
the building blocks.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.720
So you first of all,
can break it down

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.490
into those prime numbers.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.529
And then, somehow, by just
adding together these prime

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.740
numbers, you get a property of
the original number over and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.210
above the original property,
which was you multiply the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.920
primes together.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.270
It just has a nice additional
feature to it.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.510
4937775--

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.685
am I speaking to this person?

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:39.241
BRADY HARAN: Just to
see what happens.

00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:40.163
AUTOMATED VOICE: --recognized.

00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:41.546
Please check the number.

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:44.217
If you need help, call
the operator on

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:46.402
100 from your mobile.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:48.380
JAMES GRIME: Oh, well.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.190
He's probably had it
disconnected he's so cheesed

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.600
off with people ringing him.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.570
What really blew me away was
when I discovered what the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.650
biggest known Smith number is.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.520
And I thought I'd write that one
down for you, because I'm

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.210
not sure how they were
able to check it all.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.990
OK.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.380
It's a big one.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.860
So 10 to the power 1,031 minus
1-- that 1's very important.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.630
OK.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.970
That's all multiplying
the following--

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:28.670
10 to the power of 4,594
plus 3 times 10 to the

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.945
2,297 plus 1 again.

00:05:33.945 --> 00:05:41.770
And all of that bracket is
raised to the power 1,476.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.340
And that's not the end of it.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.830
That, then, all gets
multiplied by 10

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:53.390
to the power 3,913,210.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.195
And this is the largest
known Smith number.

00:05:59.195 --> 00:06:05.540
In fact, in terms of the little
mass, it's given as 16

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.010
times 100 to the power n, where
I'm going to let this

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.700
number n vary.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.950
So if n is 0--
