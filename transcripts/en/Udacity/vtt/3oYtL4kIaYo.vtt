00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.998
Charles Spearman developed one of the first theories of intelligence. He

00:00:03.998 --> 00:00:08.537
believed that intelligence is a single general capacity or ability. The reason

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:12.035
for his belief is that he found that although intelligence test assessed math,

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:17.006
language, and spatial ability. Children's scores on these domains, tend to be

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:21.670
positively correlated. Meaning, those who scored high on one dimension, for

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.330
example, math, tend to score high on others, such as language, or spatial

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.424
skills. Likewise, those who scored on low on one dimension, tended to score low

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:31.790
on others.
