NICK BUTCHER: Hello, and
welcome back to ADIA.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.875
It's been a little
while since we've

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.750
been giving you design
in action advice.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.350
But we're back today to talk to
you about the Google I/O 2014

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.150
conference app and
how we designed it.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.040
So as always, I'm your
host, Nick Butcher.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.860
ROMAN NURIK: Hey, guys.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.350
I'm Roman Nurik, dialing
in here from New York

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.020
in our fancy new space
on the 11th floor here.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.050
And also, in this weird
looking, weird evil doctor

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.970
laboratory type environment.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.416
So yeah, hi, guys.

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:45.080
MIKE DENNY: And hey, guys.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.640
I'm Mike Denny from Mountain
View in a phone room.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.837
People will be walking by.

00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:53.670
NICK BUTCHER: So as I
said, this week, we're

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.690
talking about the
Google I/O application.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.160
So for anyone who
doesn't know, Google I/O

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.439
is our annual
developer conference.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.480
But well, for more than
the developers this year.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.280
There was a huge focus on
design content as well.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.530
And each year, to
accompany the conference,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.090
we put out a companion
Android application,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.070
which helps you to
find the sessions,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.950
create a personalized
schedule, navigate around

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.080
the conference, and
lots, lots more.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.980
But that's almost secondary
to its almost main goal, which

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.220
is to be an open source
application, to share

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.460
the code and best practices
with a bunch of developers

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.590
out there.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.640
And we'd like to really
do the same kind of thing

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.440
and give a peek
behind the curtain

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.350
into the design process.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.210
So the I/O app is
built by our team,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.420
and Roman, Mike, and myself were
three of the designers working

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.040
on the application in
close collaboration

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.160
with the core material design
team right here at Google.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.524
So we want to take this
opportunity to give you,

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:54.690
like I say, a peek behind
the curtain of how we went

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.273
about designing the
app and giving you

00:01:56.273 --> 00:01:58.740
some advice of problems
we ran into and processes

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.040
we found to work really well.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.480
OK, so without further ado,
let's jump into the content.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.229
So when we came to wanting
to update the application,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.549
as always, the first place we
started was with sketching.

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.090
And there were a
few things we wanted

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.919
to do with the
application this year.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.960
First off, there was an
updated information model

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.744
we were trying to work
into the application.

00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:22.910
There were some big changes.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.840
We're going to be pushing
to get more imagery

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.470
into the application to
really bring it to life.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.260
And that was finally
arriving this year,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.340
so there was a lot we
wanted to do with imagery.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.590
And lastly, always
most exciting,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.560
we wanted to introduce some of
the elements of material design

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.200
into the application.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.160
So we have a challenge.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.600
And this application
was obviously

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.770
shipping to existing
versions of Android

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.630
out there without new
APIs and new support

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.610
for all this crazy stuff
like real time shadows.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.550
So we had to do a
conservative approach

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.400
of what we could use
on earlier devices

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.050
as well as on newer devices
which got the L preview.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.220
We wanted to really show off
some of the great new design

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.820
features.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.610
So like many of
you, we'd seen lots

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.130
of the exciting output of
the material design team.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.400
They'd shown lots of great
explorations and videos

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.070
showcasing their
new design system

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.300
and what it could produce.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.560
And we naturally wanted to dive
in and reproduce some of this.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.530
So our first instinct was to
rush straight to visual design

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.550
and put together
some mockups of how

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.290
we could apply the material
design principles to the I/O

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.510
application.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.220
But as you can see from these,
some early explorations we're

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.920
sharing with you here, these
weren't quite satisfying.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.800
It wasn't quite hitting
the right notes.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.940
And what's more, the work
that we were producing

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.670
felt somewhat disjointed.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.370
And this is a real
trap you can fall in,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.940
the temptation to rush
straight to pixels.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.990
So what we actually did was
to take a step back and really

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.600
work out our information
models and our flows

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.999
before going to do the
visual design stage.

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:07.790
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, so
what we ended up doing

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.720
is dropping down a step to what
we're calling white frames,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.300
if you look in the
Google design spec.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.750
You can download a lot of
Adobe Illustrator files

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.860
that give a bunch of blank
templatey feeling screens that

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.130
are not quite-- a little
bit more than wireframes,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.990
but a little bit less than
a visual design mock up.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.920
And so in that kind
of intermediary step,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.100
it allowed us to really
explore the challenges

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.200
that the update to
the app proposed.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.120
And the most difficult
thing, I think,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.360
for us was to figure out how
to most simply show and allow

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.140
for filtration and selection,
the collections of all

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.700
the different sessions
and sandbox events,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.270
and all the different things
you could do at the conference.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.000
We also had to think about
two different groups of users.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.580
About 5,000 people at Moscone
West in the conference hall

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.710
would be using the app.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.660
And they'll be making
use of the indoor map

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.150
to find which room they need to
go to watch a certain session.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.920
But the vast
majority of our users

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.670
are people at home or
at I/O Extended Events

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.770
who weren't able to attend
in person in San Francisco.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.660
So we wanted to really make a
great app experience for them,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.585
as well.

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:37.990
The interesting change in 2014
from previous years at Google

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.630
I/O was that each
session, instead

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.620
of being part of a track
around a specific product,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.740
like the Android
sessions, or the Glass

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.780
sessions, or the Chrome
sessions, this year

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.290
the conference was separated
around functional roles,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.150
or what we ended
up calling themes.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.920
And those were design,
develop, and distribute.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.840
So you had those three
broad categories,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.800
those themes that gave structure
to the sessions themselves.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.200
But we also, of course, had
product specific topic tags

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.330
and business vertical tags
like commerce, retail.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.560
We had music, media,
games, Android, of course,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.840
Chrome, Go, all these
different-- just tons of ways

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.915
to dissect and
create cross-sections

00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:36.970
of this huge jumble of
sessions and other content.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.020
And it really took a lot
of time and collaboration

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.920
and arguing back and forth,
should this be a list?

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.350
Should this be a grid?

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.290
Can it be a list on phones
and a grid on tablets?

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.740
How do we do the filtration?

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.110
Do you jump in and pick a track,
say show me only Android stuff?

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.810
Or can you be a little bit
more fine grained than that?

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.380
Where's the line
of filtering down

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.150
to really present the
amount of information

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.220
that the user is looking for?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.120
So it definitely helped
us to take a step back

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.490
into the wireframe,
the white frame stage,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.230
and look more structurally
at the interactions

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.255
of the different screens
and how the users were

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:21.296
going to be moving
throughout the app

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:22.680
and through the
different stages.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.660
NICK BUTCHER: Just one quick
note on the white frames,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.210
we've put a little
link in the corner

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.130
here to download these
Adobe Illustrator files.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.130
But there's also some
community members

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.470
that really already
stepped up and produced

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.511
Sketch versions of these.

00:07:33.511 --> 00:07:35.230
So if you're
getting into Sketch,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.070
which I have been
enjoying a lot lately,

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.130
I can add a link in the show
notes to find that, as well.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.220
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, so to
help facilitate the fact

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.570
that three designers
working across three time

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.810
zones on this
really complex app,

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.040
we ended up just
using Google Slides

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.420
and drawing out shapes
in really rough ways,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.650
because it allowed us to
make comments directly

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.420
on specific areas
and have a discussion

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.696
in an asynchronous way.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.570
ROMAN NURIK: I want to
add something on that.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.457
I think that's really,
really critical.

00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:15.290
Something I always talk
about in development

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:21.000
is your iteration loop,
how fast you can iterate.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.200
And I feel like
there are great tools

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.935
for iterating in development.

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:27.740
You make a change to
some code, you push it,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.382
and it shows up on your phone.

00:08:29.382 --> 00:08:30.590
On the web, it's even faster.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.330
You make a change, and
you refresh the page.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.159
Here, when you do
design work, design

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.219
is an inherently
collaborative thing.

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:40.260
Design is a conversation.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.929
It's a conversation between
various people working

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.687
on a product.

00:08:44.687 --> 00:08:46.520
And so I feel like the
integration loop here

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.530
was critical.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.460
To be able to build out these
new features pretty quickly,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.220
we really needed to be
able to have three people,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.370
again, across three
different time zones working

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.470
on one thing in a
single, shared space.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.230
Mike would put
together a screen.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.440
I would make a quick comment.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.500
I would select the item
in Google Slides, the box

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.250
or whatever it was,
make a comment on it.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.250
Mike would make some tweaks.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.200
Later on, I'd just push
something down a few pixels

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.980
so that there was some alignment
across different slides.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.650
But the overall environment
for Google Drive,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.061
basically using Google Slides
to collaborate on wireframes,

00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:28.310
worked out really well for us.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.680
Obviously, it's super,
super low fidelity.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.060
But just to get
the point across,

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.730
the information on the screen,
the general macro level layout

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:37.609
was super useful.

00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:39.150
NICK BUTCHER: And
I feel like forcing

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.310
us to work in low
fidelity really helped us

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.090
to focus the conversation
on the zoomed out,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.780
rather than getting bogged down
in the minutia of the pixels.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.837
It helped us to think
about the larger problems,

00:09:49.837 --> 00:09:51.420
like how are we going
to do filtering?

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.086
How are we going to
display collections?

00:09:53.086 --> 00:09:56.202
Rather than getting too
bogged down too early.

00:09:56.202 --> 00:09:57.410
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, definitely.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.160
It's super interesting
to go back and look

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.440
at that slides deck because
everything at the bottom

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.080
is like slide purgatory,
all of our rejected ideas.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.080
Old slides, we just dragged
them to the bottom of the stack

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.692
and forget about them forever.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.441
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, what
it could have been!

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.860
So after we really had worked
a lot on the wireframes,

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.540
we wanted to step
up and introduce

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.590
a lot of the material
design elements

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.580
that we were hugely
excited about working

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.650
into the application.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.410
So we're going to go through
now some of our interpretations

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.560
of what we felt
was most critical

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.540
and how we interpreted
them into the application.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.420
This isn't going to
be like a thou shalt,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.640
this is the only way you
can apply material design

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.240
to your application.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.470
In fact, we were actually
kind of working on this

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.710
while the material design
spec was somewhat in flux

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.030
and changing a little
bit, as these things

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.650
are wont to do before
they get launched.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.230
So if some things we did don't
quite work for your application

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.090
or have evolved since
then, that's fine.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.300
This is part of the
evolving design process.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.730
But some of the key things that
we definitely wanted to use

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.150
was the key lines
and layout metrics

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.490
which material
design introduced.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.155
The idea of using these
print style layouts-- Roman,

00:11:18.155 --> 00:11:20.030
do you want to talk
about the key lines some?

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.750
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.780
Well, the first thing
is that the key lines

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.420
are kind of like a
hallmark or a signature

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.740
characteristic of a
material design app.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.655
When you see some of that text,
some of the body copy aligned

00:11:32.655 --> 00:11:36.760
to that 72-bit key line,
that second key line,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.910
it is very much a signature
aspects of material design.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.961
It evokes material design, the
personality of the framework.

00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:47.710
And another thing I
just wanted to mention

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.620
is that when I first saw this,
I was like, this looks great.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.650
This makes a lot of sense,
too, gestalt principles.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.620
When things are aligned,
they kind of naturally group

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.200
together so you can
understand that these

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.650
are part of a
single, whole thing.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.210
It also makes it
much easier to scan.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.120
Your eyes don't have
to bounce around

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.654
between different starting
points [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:08.654 --> 00:12:10.320
But besides that, it
kind of reminds me,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.356
one of the things
that I allude to when

00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:15.270
I talk about this with
folks is this kind

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.580
of reminds me of textbooks.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.910
When you look at print
design, print and designing

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.240
for magazines or textbooks
and things like that,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.135
you kind of have your
primary columns--

00:12:24.135 --> 00:12:26.010
and I'm probably using
all the wrong language

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.090
here because I'm not
a print designer.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.054
You have your primary
body copy columns.

00:12:32.054 --> 00:12:33.720
And then, you have
stuff on the outside.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.050
Imagine a textbook, right?

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.410
You have your primary
prose in the middle.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.490
And then, you have little asides
or other accompanying items

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.340
along the sides in the
gutters in those margins.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.290
And so I look at this
as these key lines

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.870
help establish
that middle column.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.485
And then, you have things
on the outsides like the Add

00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:58.500
to Schedule floating
action button here.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.300
Or when you're looking
at speaker details,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.380
the speaker avatars, the
photos of the speakers,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.900
are in those margins.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.030
So I kind of look
at it that way.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.390
And it does, again,
help for scanning.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.990
It's very easy to, once you
lay that one piece of text

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.900
on the screen, just look all
the way down and very quickly

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.805
scan the rest of
the text related

00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:21.030
to that first piece of text.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.392
In this case, the title,
description, and so on,

00:13:24.392 --> 00:13:26.864
and the metadata as
well for the session.

00:13:26.864 --> 00:13:28.530
NICK BUTCHER: And
another thing I really

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.920
liked about using the key
lines in our design process,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.840
it was a very easy way to
bake in some responsive design

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.749
principles into layouts.

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:38.040
So in these screenshots here,
you can see, for example,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.789
we've called out what
the key lines should

00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:41.144
be on a smaller device.

00:13:41.144 --> 00:13:42.560
But then, you can
very easily just

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.830
increase these key
lines on larger devices

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.940
and build in this
kind of responsiveness

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.680
from upfront
thinking about where

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.200
the different
blocks of text are.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.120
You're designing
the use of content

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.581
and the use of white
space deliberately.

00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:57.330
And then, you can then
vary those amounts,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.630
the way they scale up as you
have more space on a device.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.880
ROMAN NURIK: The other thing
I wanted to mention here,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.296
and yeah, that
totally makes sense

00:14:04.296 --> 00:14:07.220
to me, the responsive nature,
we bump things up on tablets,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:07.720
right?

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:13.680
But if you look at the actual
numbers, 16 and 24, 72 and 80,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.260
one thing we haven't
really mentioned is grids.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.600
And this has been around
on Android for a while

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.040
using a 4 DIP or an 8 DIP grid.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.820
In this case, everything
in material design,

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.410
all the suggested values,
they fall on that grid.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.360
It makes it really
easy to I guess

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.970
diverge from the guidelines
when you feel it's necessary,

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.050
when you need to.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.330
So these 16 DIPs,
the 72 DIPs, these

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.840
are just suggested guidelines.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.560
But if you need a bit more
space in that left margin,

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.430
it's really easy to say,
let me try to add 8 DIPs.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.260
Let me try to add 16
DIPs to that key line

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.490
and see if that kind of
better communicates my content

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.650
or gives my content more space
to breathe or whatever it is.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.580
And so I kind of look
at material design

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.650
and these key lines specifically
as they're suggestions.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.370
But there's, at the lower
level parts of the framework,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.360
this grid system helps you
deviate from those suggestions

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.990
very easily and in
a very standard way.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.750
So that's one of the
things that I really

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.952
loved about this process.

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:20.660
We ended up choosing
the 80 DIP key line.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.529
But we could have done
96 or 104 on tablets

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:25.695
if we felt it was necessary.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.810
So let's talk about
surfaces for a bit.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.660
And this is actually one of
the biggest components actually

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.390
looking at material design as
composed of four basic things.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.520
Surfaces and shadows are one
of the biggest things to me.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.980
And actually, there's a
design byte either out now

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.090
or coming out from
Rich Fulcher where

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.370
he talks about specifically
surfaces and shadows

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.915
and how those effect the
universe, if you will,

00:15:53.915 --> 00:15:58.700
of apps following
this framework.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.470
And for surfaces,
he kind of alludes

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.680
to surfaces as pieces of paper.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.820
And when a surface is
floating over another surface

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.370
in the z space, it casts a
shadow on the surface below it

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.830
or the piece of paper below it.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.460
And so we thought
a lot about this

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.682
because this is one of the key
components of material design.

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:22.890
We thought a lot about this.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.181
And so that influenced
some of our decisions.

00:16:25.181 --> 00:16:27.555
NICK BUTCHER: So one technique
which we've not shown here

00:16:27.555 --> 00:16:32.660
in our mocks is ways to,
in your design stage,

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:40.640
show which level on the z access
a particular surface lives.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.150
So we didn't use it at the
time of designing the I/O app.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.300
I've been using it in
my design since then.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.435
It's actually a call out,
so when you're specing up

00:16:48.435 --> 00:16:53.060
a screen, as well as when you're
calling out the color or size

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.500
or shape, whatever,
it's to say that this

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.390
lives in a particular plane.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.020
So the way we've
been doing that is it

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.478
helps to think about it in--
if you might have, say, three,

00:17:02.478 --> 00:17:04.895
four, maybe five
different z levels,

00:17:04.895 --> 00:17:09.630
you can call it z0, z1,
z2, z3, and call those

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.839
out so that you can then use
those levels consistently

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.009
throughout your application.

00:17:15.009 --> 00:17:16.800
So you might say that,
in your application,

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.380
in the primary
content, there's a z0.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.912
Whereas in this example
here, the bottom bar,

00:17:22.912 --> 00:17:25.450
the bottom section
lives at z level one

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.890
and the floating
action button is

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.300
on top of that at z level two.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.800
And then, what
you can then do is

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.700
when you hand that
over to developers,

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.910
is decide what levels,
what dimensions and DIPs

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.540
those levels of z work at.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.030
And then, transfer those
into actual dimensions.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.260
It's kind of like thinking
about an air traffic

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.870
controller, where you're
thinking each of your UI

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.864
surfaces is actually a different
plane, a different level.

00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:55.530
So you're trying to work out how
they stack on top of each other

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.863
without colliding so they can
move underneath each other

00:17:57.863 --> 00:18:00.650
and give you that natural motion
you're trying to design for.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.899
ROMAN NURIK: So one of the
things that we came across,

00:18:02.899 --> 00:18:07.200
one of the decisions we had to
make was how we present tabs.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.420
And specifically, we have this
case in the schedule screen

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.980
where you have an
app bar at the top,

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.270
and you have tabs for
today or tomorrow,

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.224
or June 25 and June
26, and then you

00:18:18.224 --> 00:18:19.640
have content below
that, basically

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.910
the schedule for
each day below that.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.260
And there are obviously a number
of ways you can present that.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.790
And the final decision
that we made here

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.820
had a lot to do with how
surfaces are described

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.650
and presented in
material design.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.485
And so in our first
iteration, we kind of

00:18:37.485 --> 00:18:41.250
had these two surfaces,
one for the app bar

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.984
and a second just for the
tabs and the content below it.

00:18:44.984 --> 00:18:46.400
One of the interesting
things here

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.350
is that, well first
of all, there's

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.800
a lot of ink on these
surfaces, the stuff that's

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.350
printed on the piece of paper
or printed on the surface.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.200
There was a lot of
ink here, and we

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.794
felt like it was
doing a lot of work.

00:18:57.794 --> 00:18:59.710
NICK BUTCHER: For me,
this feels kind of funky

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:04.970
because the second, the angled
screen shot, the content

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.700
will scroll underneath
the tab, right?

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.760
If you scroll the surface,
breakfast, it'll go under it.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.950
So you're almost making
another seam at that point

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.449
because you're
expecting it to split

00:19:13.449 --> 00:19:16.900
into another middle surface,
while the app bar itself casts

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.280
a shadow while you look at it.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.230
So it's like you have
three surfaces almost.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.270
ROMAN NURIK: At the same time,
an even more important point,

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.760
as Nick pointed out
earlier, was that

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.460
what happens when the
other content scrolls?

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.030
What happens when you scroll
the schedule up and down?

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.220
It'd be weird if
the ink scrolled

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.090
along the surface,
and the surface

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.400
itself didn't just move.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.610
It's a much more natural
thing for a surface

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:46.324
to slide up and down than for
ink to slide along a surface.

00:19:46.324 --> 00:19:47.740
It's a weird way
of explaining it,

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.380
but it's how we perceived it.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.770
And so in this case where
there's a single surface where

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.440
the tabs and the tab
contents were printed

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.940
along the same surface, it
didn't really make sense to us.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.990
And so we moved it on
to the second iteration

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.320
where we actually merged
the tabs with the app bar.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.240
This also better
followed the spec anyway,

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.010
so it was kind of a win-win.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.940
But here, a lot of things
worked out really well here.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.910
First of all, all
the, quote unquote,

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:22.740
"chrome" became part of one
physical entity, one surface.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.520
And all the actual content
was on a surface below it.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.120
And so it also
solved the problem

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.820
where as you start
scrolling the content,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.450
it slides underneath
all of the chrome.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.370
It also was a much simpler
visual presentation.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.720
It was just, in
general, cleaner.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.459
So that's why we
went with this route.

00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:43.500
NICK BUTCHER: The next
element of material design

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:49.180
that we definitely went
into to utilize was motion.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.015
So I'd say we didn't have enough
time to work on as much motion

00:20:52.015 --> 00:20:53.940
as we'd like, but
some areas, we did

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.780
craft some kind of key
details which I feel really

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.500
do add to bringing life
to the application.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.300
So one of Roman's
favorite, which

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.580
he uses multiple times
a day, was the use

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.310
of the floating action button.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.920
ROMAN NURIK: So yeah, the
floating action button

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.070
is probably one of
my favorite elements

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.880
not just because the floating
action button itself,

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.560
especially when it straddles
the seam between two surfaces,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.600
not only because it's
just so characteristic,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.660
it's such a signature
element of material design,

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.970
but also because there's
so much you can do with it.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.690
It's such an expressive element.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.730
So in our case, we had
this floating action button

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.000
that when you press it on
the session detail screen,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.660
when you press it, it adds
the session to your schedule

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.430
and it goes from a plus
sign to a check mark.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.070
And when you press
the check mark,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.980
it goes back into a plus sign.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.620
And so there's a couple of
interesting tidbits here.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.430
It's a floating action
button that has two states.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.190
It has to have an on
state and an off state.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.570
And also, this is a
case where there's

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.390
a transition between
the two icons,

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.440
between a plus and a check mark.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.610
And in material design,
basically any time

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.400
you have an icon
with multiple states,

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.910
for example a refresh button
that turns into a loading

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.840
spinner, or a plus that
turns into a check mark,

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.370
or something like that,
that's a great opportunity

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:20.920
for a delightful animation.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.830
And so we used this
opportunity to introduce

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.070
some kind of character
into our app.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.150
We also used this
opportunity to transition

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.570
the state of the background
coloring from blue to white,

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.170
which we'll talk about in a bit.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.380
We used that opportunity
to actually make

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.650
that transition, a background
color, even more interesting,

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.050
to also kind of use stuff
from material design

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.090
to make it feel like, as a user,
you're pressing on this button,

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.770
and the background
color is changing right

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.430
under your fingertip.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.840
It's like you're initiating
this change of background color.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.060
And this kind of ripple
effect that we use

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.980
helps show that, helps
demonstrate that.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.970
NICK BUTCHER: I
love the idea of you

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:09.510
as a user imparting energy into
the interface that radiates out

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.440
from your touch point.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.430
It makes you feel very
much like you're in control

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.429
and you're very powerful,
which is kind of cool.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.320
So another place where
we used this kind

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.290
of the same animated
touch feedback

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.180
is the use of the
ripples in order

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.020
to communicate touch
states as well as to have

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.980
that same kind of feeling
like the user is in control.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.980
So you can see here that we used
some customized touch ripples

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.190
in both the bounded and
unbounded states, which

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:43.040
you can see in this video,
to give that sense of control

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.730
to the user.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.650
As I alluded earlier,
we ran out of time

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.150
with implementing
everything that we

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.090
wanted to do in
this year's update.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.580
But one thing
which is definitely

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.460
on the books for the
next time we look at it

00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.435
is to add some more motion
to the major scene changes.

00:24:00.435 --> 00:24:03.150
Material design definitely
talks about helping

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.340
to give the users more
consistency by explaining scene

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:11.117
changes rather than doing a
jump cut, as you might call it.

00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:12.950
So one place which we
felt was a natural fit

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.362
for this was when jumping
from a collection view,

00:24:16.362 --> 00:24:17.820
kind of like the
home screen, which

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.100
shows a whole group
of different sessions,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.870
into one of the
session's details.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.740
We felt this would be
like a natural place

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.720
where we could nicely
animate up the image,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.120
maybe move the title inline,
ease that transition,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.460
keep the user in
the sense of things

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.170
rather than doing this jump cut.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.392
So maybe next year,
we'll get to that.

00:24:39.392 --> 00:24:42.670
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and another
thing we had to think about

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.350
is for these hero
transitions, obviously there's

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.470
a place in our app where
it makes a lot of sense.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:52.090
When you're exploring
a list of sessions

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.520
or that grid of
sessions, after you've

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.605
chosen some filters and so on,
when you press a grid tile,

00:24:58.605 --> 00:25:04.000
it can expand up and show
the session detail screen.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.210
So the image in
the grid tile can

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.765
expand into the banner
image for the detail screen.

00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:11.140
The only issue
with that, though,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.840
is we had a lot of overlays.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.560
We had color overlays
in some cases.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.570
We had text overlays.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:21.080
And we really had to think
hard about how exactly each

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.710
of these elements transitions.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.710
And like Nick said, we
just didn't have the time

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.670
to really solidify this, to
really play around with it

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.940
and get it just right.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.780
And so we decided basically
to take a shortcut

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.326
and just use the standard
non-hero transitions,

00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:39.060
but definitely something we
want to look for in the future,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.480
and definitely something
that, for simpler cases, where

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.220
you have just a grid
of basic images,

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.140
it makes the most
sense to include

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.590
these types of hero transitions.

00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:52.435
NICK BUTCHER: Next
up, we're going

00:25:52.435 --> 00:25:54.518
to talk about our use of
color in the application,

00:25:54.518 --> 00:25:59.281
and here with the correct
spelling of the word "color."

00:25:59.281 --> 00:26:00.780
So these are some
early explorations

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.370
we threw together,
really playing around

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.340
with different layers,
the different treatments

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.140
for images.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.370
As Mike mentioned earlier, we
had a lot of different ways

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.165
to organize the items
and [INAUDIBLE] model.

00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:18.440
So a particular session
could belong to both a track,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.160
like Android, as
well as a theme,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.230
like design, or
develop, or distribute.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.780
So we were trying to play with
ways that we could represent

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.760
that to the user so
they could navigate

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.795
between related sessions
as well as recognize

00:26:31.795 --> 00:26:34.360
a schedule from a glance.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.750
So here's some
early explorations

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.250
where we were trying
different color

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.270
overlays, different colored
action bars, and so forth.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.800
And at the same time, we
were working-- obviously,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.050
this Android app doesn't
live in isolation.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.960
We were working with
the team building

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.320
the website and the rest of
the branding for their site

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.484
on the overall color palette.

00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:53.650
Do you want to talk about
how that developed, Roman?

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:58.260
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so in
terms of the color palette,

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.100
definitely know
that the I/O team--

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.905
we started working on this right
around the time the I/O core

00:27:03.905 --> 00:27:06.230
team was working
with their folks

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.570
to figure out what the
overall brand is, kind

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.300
of evolving the
brand from last year.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.700
And they're definitely
including or incorporating

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.080
material design
elements early on.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.420
And so their first set of
core colors, or actually I

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.070
guess the final
set of core colors,

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.030
were taken straight out of the
secondary material design color

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.470
palette.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:34.250
So they chose beautiful
colors actually, like indigo,

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.180
pink, the light blue.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.290
And we actually found
that this works really

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:44.980
well in the context of the app
where the indigo 500 served

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:49.460
to be the primary action
bar color in cases where

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.360
the current screen
is not branded,

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.870
or doesn't have a color
associated with it, a session

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.260
color.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.350
And then, we used the light
blue and pink versions

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.300
as accent colors.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.270
And so I actually talk about
this a bit more in the design

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.150
byte on the IO app
and material design.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.772
But it worked really, really
well in the context of our app

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:12.230
and the context of
material design,

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.710
where basically you want a
slightly more muted yet still

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:21.701
colorful primary color, and then
a very strong, very bold accent

00:28:21.701 --> 00:28:22.200
color.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.589
And we chose two accent colors
for different situations.

00:28:25.589 --> 00:28:28.130
NICK BUTCHER: I think this is
an interesting point, actually.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.588
Even though the
material guidelines

00:28:29.588 --> 00:28:31.047
come with a set
of color palettes

00:28:31.047 --> 00:28:32.630
which you can use
in your application,

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.380
it really isn't prescriptive.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.530
You should really be
using color to reflect

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.374
the brand, the personality,
of your application.

00:28:41.374 --> 00:28:43.290
And so like here, we've
used two accent colors

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.623
rather than just using a
single accent color throughout,

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:47.300
because that gave us
the range we needed

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.600
to express a bunch of
different key concepts

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.670
in the application.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.820
So really don't feel constrained
by the color guidelines.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.947
Use them for inspiration
and learn from them.

00:28:55.947 --> 00:28:58.030
But don't ever feel like
they're holding you back.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.180
MIKE DENNY: Could it be that
the light blue was a reminiscent

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.960
throwback to the [INAUDIBLE]
blue of yesteryear?

00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:11.790
ROMAN NURIK:
Potentialy, possibly.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.498
No, probably not.

00:29:12.498 --> 00:29:14.485
NICK BUTCHER: Just no, no-go.

00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:15.340
No-go, Mike.

00:29:19.414 --> 00:29:21.330
ROMAN NURIK: One other
thing I wanted to show,

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.245
or I guess talk
about really briefly,

00:29:23.245 --> 00:29:28.240
is color is important
for-- color,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.100
we also took it as
a piece of content.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.720
Our sessions are colored
based on their topic.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.940
So for example, Android
sessions are green.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.750
We tried to make this make
as much sense as possible.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:44.760
Sometimes, you have
pretty vague or there

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.320
aren't natural mappings
for certain topics,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.690
like for example, UX.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.390
How do you color the word
UX, or the concept UX?

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.999
NICK BUTCHER: We actually
tried to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:55.999 --> 00:29:57.790
ROMAN NURIK: Plaid-patterned,
that's right.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.430
So we tried to make it make
sense as much as possible.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.010
But we ran into a
lot of situations

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.390
where we really needed to
make some tough decisions on,

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.520
do we use the session
color here or not?

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.320
Because of all the other
components of the app,

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.540
for example, the
floating action button,

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.370
we had to make
some tough choices

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.300
as to how and when
we incorporate color.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.340
NICK BUTCHER: And staying
on the topic of color,

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.048
I went into a deep
dive on a little piece

00:30:27.048 --> 00:30:29.930
of the work we did when we
were thinking about using

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.910
these different colors per
session to reflect its topic

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.250
or track or so forth.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.890
And we were really investigating
how to then contrast

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:44.210
that with the featured action
button, floating action button.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.310
So one of our
first instincts was

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:51.050
to pick an accent shade to
go with each of these theming

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:51.890
colors.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.620
So you can see on this
top row of screens

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.110
here that every
single color, we're

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.840
trying to pick out something
that would represent the two

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.060
states the button had, add
to schedule and reflecting it

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.460
was in your schedule.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.710
But in doing so, it ended
up just getting too noisy.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.230
It ended up being, this
is a really key action

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.324
that we want to call out.

00:31:11.324 --> 00:31:12.740
But it'll end up
looking different

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.160
on a bunch of different
screens you're going into

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.800
and just not really working.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.310
And also, it caused us a
lot of work to think about,

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.060
is this button going
to do the same thing?

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.590
And so forth.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.940
So then, we started trying
to find single colors that

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.860
would work across all of them,
which started off being quite

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:37.530
hard, but we ended up going with
a white FAB for sessions which

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.980
were already in your schedule,
and this hot blue FAB

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.290
for sessions which
weren't, which ended up

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.730
contrasting really
well with our palette.

00:31:51.464 --> 00:31:52.880
ROMAN NURIK: And
this is something

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.510
that we talked about
before, where we also

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.530
had a really nice
way of transitioning

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.290
between these states
where, when you press

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.490
the blue plus or the plus
sign on a blue background,

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.900
there's this little
white ripple.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.610
The background changes
to white in a ripple,

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.540
and it kind of fills
the space, almost

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.010
like a paint bucket
effect in Photoshop.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.770
And so on we were deciding
how and when to use color.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.635
And as Nick pointed out,
the FAB, the floating action

00:32:22.635 --> 00:32:24.120
button, played a
big role in that.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.869
And so one of the tools
that we used here,

00:32:25.869 --> 00:32:30.140
to decide actually which colors
to use for sessions which

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.660
had a brand, quote
unquote, for each session,

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.370
We actually used this
little exploration

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.430
file where we started with the
material design color palette.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:41.900
We threw those colors
into these square blocks.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.540
And we used the accent, our
light blue accent color FAB,

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.680
and we just dropped that
in adjacent to all these

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.270
items just to see what the
juxtaposition looked like.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.590
Was there enough contrast?

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.280
Were there color clashes, things
that just didn't look right?

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.400
And so we used this
kind of temporary file

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.370
to start messing with
those color values

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.336
to make sure that
they contrasted well.

00:33:05.336 --> 00:33:07.210
At the same time, we
also wanted to make sure

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:11.020
that all these session
colors contrasted well

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.540
with each other.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.290
Actually, not necessarily
contrasted well,

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.690
but they weren't too different.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:19.590
When you looked at one session
detail page versus another,

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:24.850
there weren't glaring
brightness differences.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.900
So one of the ways
we did that, kind

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.790
of stabilize the
overall kind of contrast

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:35.653
profile of our screens, was that
we took this exploration file

00:33:35.653 --> 00:33:38.940
and desaturated it, and then
we made a bunch of changes

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.450
here and there to
these color values

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:47.430
to make sure that the actual
brightness, overall brightness,

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:51.360
of the session colors was
within an acceptable, well

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.800
defined range, that we didn't
have anything that was way

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.990
too bright or anything
that was way too dark.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:00.420
And so that was one of the ways
in which we ensured that this

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.670
would be both usable,
would be legible,

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.540
but also would just
look good overall.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.870
NICK BUTCHER: I think the last
step we went through, then,

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.260
was then this example
of the specing work

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:22.540
that we did in order to document
the layout sizes and so on.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.730
One thing I very much
enjoyed about using this

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:29.449
was referring to the
material typographic scale.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:32.681
I found that by utilizing
the typographic scale,

00:34:32.681 --> 00:34:34.639
using things like you
can see on the left here,

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.030
when you're setting the
title of the session details

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:42.280
page, the title scale, it
really gave a great structure

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.370
to the application.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.810
I hope that as more and
more applications converge

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.615
on this material
typographic scale

00:34:49.615 --> 00:34:52.579
and then deviate when
needed, it will really

00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:54.120
help with the
scalability of the app.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.578
You'll be able to instantly
pick out, oh, that's the title,

00:34:56.578 --> 00:34:58.160
I recognize.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.580
At some subconscious level,
I recognize the way it's set,

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.527
that it's [INAUDIBLE] for
example, that's a title,

00:35:04.527 --> 00:35:05.360
and I can scan that.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.479
I can jump to that
on the screen.

00:35:07.479 --> 00:35:09.020
So I find that I
really enjoy working

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.705
with the typographic scale.

00:35:11.705 --> 00:35:14.080
MIKE DENNY: In general, we've
been talking about material

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.220
spec and material
guidelines and how we feel

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.820
they're not as
prescriptive as before.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.360
Hollow had a very
distinct personality.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.280
In the same vein,
material does, as well.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.560
And Google's products
expressing themselves

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.250
using material design system
will feel very Googley.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.400
And you, and all of
your apps, should

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.190
be able to express their own
brands using similar elements,

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:45.940
like sticking to the 4 or 8 DIP
grid using primary key lines.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.240
Even if you deviate
in meaningful ways,

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:54.580
it'll still feel at home on
Android devices and on the web.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.860
In addition to that,
the typographic scale

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.220
that Nick was just
talking about,

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.360
if you don't use
the material spec

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.950
recommended typographic
scale, create your own.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.870
Don't have a million
different font

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:13.100
sizes and weights
and attributes.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.270
Be consistent and be
purposeful in your deviations

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.159
from the spec.

00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:19.700
ROMAN NURIK: I guess
one thing to add

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.720
there is while we're on
the topic of typography,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.470
a big part of your
brand is typography.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.815
And so in material design,
we talk a lot about Roboto

00:36:28.815 --> 00:36:33.755
and we have very specific styles
for headline text and body

00:36:33.755 --> 00:36:35.769
text, and they're all
basically using Roboto.

00:36:35.769 --> 00:36:37.560
It doesn't mean that
Roboto is the only way

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.140
to design an Android app.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:43.320
A lot of great, really well
designed Android apps today

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.640
use different typefaces.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.280
And material design is the same.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.820
You don't necessarily
have to use Roboto.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.920
You should probably
use pretty good

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.540
looking sans serif typefaces.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:03.170
You probably should avoid using
too many serifs in your apps.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.060
But it's definitely
something where

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:09.320
that is an area where you
should be true to your brand.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.920
You shouldn't try to force your
brand into Roboto unless you

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.730
feel like it is harmonious
with your brand.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.172
So yeah, that's just another
thing that we thought about.

00:37:19.172 --> 00:37:21.630
Obviously, Roboto makes a lot
of sense for Google products.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.530
But a lot of other
apps, it's not

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.060
a necessity you have to use it.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.710
We think it looks great, though.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.767
One other thing I guess
on the concept of type,

00:37:28.767 --> 00:37:31.350
and I guess we may have talked
about some previous [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.990
or maybe not, but when
you do choose a typeface,

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.170
it's important to test
it on Android devices.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.940
Some typefaces just
don't render too well.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.142
There's all sorts
of weird hinting

00:37:44.142 --> 00:37:47.890
and weird stuff that happens,
especially at smaller sizes.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:50.440
So just do make sure to test.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:55.070
And if you do test and
you find that there's

00:37:55.070 --> 00:38:00.060
some rendering issues, then try
to work with the original type

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.750
foundry or whatever, see if
they have a more optimized type

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.270
face for different use cases.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.910
In a lot of cases,
there's different variants

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.990
of a type face for use
in different situations,

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:16.407
some print design, some for
UI design, things like that.

00:38:16.407 --> 00:38:17.740
NICK BUTCHER: Wow, so thank you.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.410
That was a whistle stop
tour of the updated design

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.900
of the Google I/O application.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.570
There's tons more
features in there

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.465
which we didn't get to cover.

00:38:25.465 --> 00:38:27.090
So do go and check
out the application.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.715
Download the L preview version.

00:38:29.715 --> 00:38:32.010
We'll put a link to it
in the bottom notes here.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.760
And take a look at
some of these features.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.593
We didn't even cover
designing for wearables

00:38:35.593 --> 00:38:36.980
and other such features.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.310
So there's lots in
there to go check out.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:39.900
So finish up.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.995
Let's just talk about
our one favorite feature

00:38:41.995 --> 00:38:46.050
of designing the Google I/O app.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.100
I'll go first, and I'll say that
my absolute favorite thing was

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.275
working with the baseline
grids and the key lines.

00:38:52.275 --> 00:38:54.400
I felt that gave you really,
really great structure

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.910
to the application,
which was really

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:59.120
kind of a joy to work with.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.240
Mike?

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.740
MIKE DENNY: I really
ended up liking

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.520
the way we presented the
schedule in columns based

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.240
on the two days
of the conference.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.690
Previous years at Google had
been three days or two days.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.406
This year, it was
two days, and we

00:39:14.406 --> 00:39:17.720
were able to present
that in swipeable tabs

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.750
on smaller screens, and
then just straight up

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.550
two columns on larger screens.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.890
And it ended up being a
really nice experience

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:29.410
to be very glanceable while
I was at the conference.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.080
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, I
think my favorite thing,

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.940
and before I jump
into that, I'm going

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.310
to quickly plug a couple
of things that we released,

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:39.420
the design byte episode,
the eight minute or nine

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.110
minute design byte on our
design process for this app.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:47.360
I talk about this, and also
in a Medium post, a blog post

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.390
I posted on Medium.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.260
I talk about this.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.740
But one of my favorite things
is really the use of color,

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.650
specifically the primary
and the accent colors,

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.700
and the way we introduce
those into the apps.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.080
You can't really see it in the
vignette screenshot shown here.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.530
But it's basically awesome.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.155
We got to use a strong
accent color, a really

00:40:09.155 --> 00:40:10.930
bold, bright,
beautiful accent color

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.280
in a number of situations.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.730
And on L, it's
super, super easy.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.320
We basically said
hey, Android system,

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.205
here is the pink we want
to use for our accents.

00:40:21.205 --> 00:40:22.580
And it just kind
of automatically

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:26.090
colored a lot of stuff
for us in the UI,

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.470
which was just automatically
colored based on that.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:32.390
So I just really enjoyed
working with that color palette.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:35.690
One of my favorite things now
is when we design new apps, just

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:40.300
try to pick out what's a good
combination of a slightly

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.230
muted but colorful
primary color,

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.930
and a really bright,
bold accent color.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.360
Choosing those colors is
actually part of the fun part.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.840
It's pretty subjective.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.610
It's something where
you get to think

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:57.720
about the artistic aspects
of designing an app.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.930
And that's just definitely
one of my favorite things

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.890
going forward, picking
out those colors.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.151
NICK BUTCHER: So it's not
the animated floating action

00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:04.650
button?

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.570
I was sure that was going
to be your favorite.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.780
ROMAN NURIK: Well, that too.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.890
But I feel like I've
talked quite at length

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.587
about how much I love that
little component of it we

00:41:15.587 --> 00:41:17.102
put together.

00:41:17.102 --> 00:41:18.810
MIKE DENNY: I definitely
want to call out

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:22.060
before we wrap up just
how key the use of imagery

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.230
and photography was
throughout the app.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.200
This year, our
team really pushed

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.180
to have provided
for each session

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:34.020
a photographic representation
of the speaker or the team

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.220
presenting.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.530
And I don't know we got 100%
coverage for every session

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.870
or event, but we
got a lot of photos.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:43.750
And it definitely helped the
app feel a lot more human.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.875
And gives a lot of
just beautiful variance

00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:48.165
throughout the app.

00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:49.290
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, I agree.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.130
We could have gone
with just text, right?

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.880
In previous years, we just
have a text representation.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.150
And some may argue that it's
actually easier to scan text,

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:00.164
just looking through
text to see key words.

00:42:00.164 --> 00:42:01.580
But that's what
the search is for.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.680
If you're looking for something,
search for the piece of text

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.420
you want.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:05.860
But yeah, I totally agree.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.680
The images made it
feel more human.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.320
I love the way you explain that.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.817
It feels like-- going to
I/O, it's all about speakers.

00:42:13.817 --> 00:42:15.650
You're going there to
listen to people talk.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:17.066
You're going there
to meet people.

00:42:17.066 --> 00:42:22.010
And having these people's
faces in a nice, larger size

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.070
than just a little
avatar makes it

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.040
feel like you're actually going
somewhere, going to the session

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.840
to listen to that person talk.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.870
It's a stronger connection.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:34.500
So yeah, I'm really glad we
were able to get that through.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:37.280
It was a tough process to
get approval and get people

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.520
to be on board with
taking all these photos.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.520
But I'm really glad
that went through.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.330
It was really kind of a big, big
help for the visual character

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.270
and the emotional
character of the app.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.520
NICK BUTCHER: That was more
than one thing each, guys,

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.103
but that's OK.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.860
OK, so thank you very much
for joining us for ADIA.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.020
We'll be back with
more content soon.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.980
Adios!

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.709
ROMAN NURIK: Peace out!

00:43:02.709 --> 00:43:03.500
MIKE DENNY: Thanks.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.050
See you.
