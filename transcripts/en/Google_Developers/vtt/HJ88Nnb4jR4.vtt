00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.163
MALE SPEAKER 1: With "Skyfall"
being such a high-profile film

00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:18.200
and a franchise, and the whole
50th anniversary thing, the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.530
idea that we had to come up
with had to be completely

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.685
slick and on brand.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:25.160
MALE SPEAKER 2: Well, one day,
me and my credit card number

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.279
were talking about a motorbike
scene that everyone was really

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.941
excited about.

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:33.260
What can we do to actually
engage our audience using this

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.530
motorbike scene?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.030
Because it would be really cool
to actually draw out a

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.326
motorbike online.

00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:42.370
MALE SPEAKER 3: The main
complication that really kind

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.010
of pushed the boundary out,
was the dual screen

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.000
technology, the fact that you
could actually use the mobile

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.450
phone as the controller and,
obviously, the fact that it's

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.430
actually being played inside
a YouTube masthead.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.170
Trying to get that underneath
the file size--

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.040
and we made the game
actually playable--

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.000
yeah, it was a challenge but,
I mean, it was one that we

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.140
managed to overcome.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.608
MALE SPEAKER 1: Get the
technology working first

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:05.840
before you start.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.000
Find the creative-looking
feel.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.280
Partner up extremely
quickly with

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.945
double-clicking, as usual.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:13.810
MALE SPEAKER 2: Basically,
don't give up.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.980
If you think it's gonna
work in your mind,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.930
just push for it.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.940
MALE SPEAKER 1: And make sure
everybody knows what you're

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.220
trying to achieve and what the
output is, and what the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.520
performance deadline is.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
have deadlines.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.020
MALE SPEAKER 1: And when
your deadline is.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.520
