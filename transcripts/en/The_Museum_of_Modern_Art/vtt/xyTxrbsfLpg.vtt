00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:11.264
Ann: The importance of ...
of the two factors of scale

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:14.847
and of gesture in
abstract expressionism are

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:18.824
exemplified in the
paintings of Franz Kline.

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:21.013
Usually with a white background

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:23.730
and then either only with black

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.847
or with black and some other dark colors

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:32.429
in a very sober, somber
but very strong key,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:36.373
we have canvases that
present I think perhaps

00:00:36.373 --> 00:00:42.715
a very American idea in
terms of the expaniveness

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:48.429
of the landscape in terms
of the bravado of the new.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.347
It's easy to make generalizations about

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:54.348
how serene American art differs

00:00:54.348 --> 00:00:57.346
from European art, but
in the case of these

00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:00.231
paintings by Franz Kline,
I think it's actually,

00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:01.899
it holds true.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.234
The abstract expressionists saw

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:07.429
what they felt were the elegant qualities

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:10.474
of European art as something that needed

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:13.310
to be replaced with
painting that focused on

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.506
a sort of rawness or brutality even

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:21.248
that seemed to exemplify the new world.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.149
Scale was one way. They
were making paintings,

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.950
not that you could paint on an easel,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.876
but that need to be painted on the floor

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:31.655
or just have the canvas tacked
on the wall of the studio

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:33.655
because these were
paintings that were bigger

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:37.960
than the human arm span or height

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.998
and instead these were paintings

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.401
whose scale was going to engulf you.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.334
They were not paintings
that you were going to

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:46.128
dominate, either as a maker or a viewer

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:48.175
and similarly, you are not going to have

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.843
a polite brushstroke daintily made by

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:53.245
holding a brush in one hand and a palette

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:56.043
in the other hand, but instead the kind of

00:01:56.043 --> 00:02:01.711
forceful, gestural strength
that means that stroke

00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:04.154
was made not just with
fingers, not just with a wrist,

00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:06.758
not just with an elbow
but with the whole arm

00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:09.420
and probably even the whole body

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.995
and when you look at those marks

00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:13.413
on a Franz Kline painting,

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:17.102
you have the feeling almost
of bridges in America

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:21.534
or railroad tracks or these
other parts of the country

00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:25.896
that were typical of the
technologies and the industry

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:30.347
that had set America
apart in the 19th century.

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:33.352
Franz Kline was one of the
regulars at the Cedar Tavern

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.185
and really a [unintelligible]
member of the

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:36.856
abstract expressionist group.

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.378
I think we hear a lot of stories about how

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:41.959
solitary they were in their struggles

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.431
or how moody they were

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.627
as they wrestled with their art,

00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:49.067
but in fact that wasn't always the case.

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:51.377
There was often times real camaraderie,

00:02:51.377 --> 00:02:54.406
real helping of each
other at difficult stages

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.166
and Franz Kline was one of those

00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:58.128
who was the most supportive

00:02:58.128 --> 00:02:59.777
and really inspiring to the

00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:01.793
painters and sculptors around him.
