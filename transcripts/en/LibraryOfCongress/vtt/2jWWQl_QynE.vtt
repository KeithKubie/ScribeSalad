00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:02.841
SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:07.268
I'm

00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:12.808
Carla Hayden, and I'll truly 
delighted 

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:15.895
to have you here.  You may clap

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.189
[applause] 

00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:30.404
SPEAKER: I have to take this 
opportunity to welcome those in 

00:06:30.405 --> 00:06:33.649
the home towns of our national 
student poets who are watching 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.500

Thank you to our live stream 

00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:38.501
partners 

00:06:43.062 --> 00:06:45.062

00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:17.581
   I have to also tell you that 
I was 

00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:23.141
very pleased and honored to hold
a pinning ceremony for these 

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:26.800
talented young poets in my 
office area, just less than an 

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:31.279
hour ago.  And it's the second 
time that we've been able to 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280
have that honor and I have 

00:07:34.736 --> 00:07:38.230
to say, it's one of the 
highlights of the year.  We also

00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:42.731
have two poets from the previous
year, who are with us today.  

00:07:42.732 --> 00:07:43.753
We're delighted to see them as 
well.  

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:45.754
Now...

00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:48.229
at the pinning, and the pinning,
really, you have to see the 

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.883
beautiful pins, at the pinning, 
I was joined by 

00:07:55.573 --> 00:07:56.993
Kit Matthew, Director of the 
Institute and Museum of Library 

00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:58.994
Services.  Kit.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
[applause] 

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.180
SPEAKER: Virginia Macanu for the

00:08:11.255 --> 00:08:14.096
Alliance of Young Artists and 
Writers.  You'll hear from them 

00:08:14.097 --> 00:08:16.321
in a minute, but let me say how 
much I appreciate their 

00:08:17.743 --> 00:08:17.959
stewardship of the poets program
and commitment to our next 

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.823
generation of poets.  
   Now...

00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:27.760
you'll also hear from two very 
special guests this afternoon.  

00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:29.761
Noted columnist Mr. David 
brooks.

00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:33.495
[applause] 

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:39.975
SPEAKER: And singer/song writer,
Valerie June.

00:08:41.382 --> 00:08:43.382
[applause] 

00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:48.558
powerful voices, both of our 
special guests have 

00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:56.729
found inspiration at the Library
of Congress, Mr. Brooks has 

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.172
written about the power of the 
Thomas Jefferson building, 

00:08:59.173 --> 00:09:01.173
across the street.

00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:06.693
It was there that Valerie June 

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.960
immersed herself in the 
recordings.

00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:16.655
Darius, Daniel, Alexandra, 
Heather, 

00:09:17.894 --> 00:09:19.894
Laurel, Jenson and Arianna, I 
hope you 

00:09:21.557 --> 00:09:23.252
are equally-inspired by 
beginning your national student 

00:09:23.253 --> 00:09:25.688
poet term here at the Library of
Congress, we are very proud 

00:09:28.748 --> 00:09:29.754
that you, and I'm telling you 
from previous poets, will always

00:09:29.755 --> 00:09:31.755
have that connection to us.

00:09:35.654 --> 00:09:37.654
As I told you at the pinning and
you 

00:09:39.085 --> 00:09:41.085
presented me with

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.278
autograph copies and you all 
will be jealous.  Don't forget 

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:50.279
us as you become famous.  You 
are famous now.

00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:59.734
Now, there's another remarkable 
poet, connected to the library 

00:09:59.735 --> 00:10:01.735
who is excited to be part of 
this day.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.604
And right now, she's flying back
from 

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:09.874
Alaska, where she kicked off her
second 

00:10:12.543 --> 00:10:14.543
term project, American 
Conversations, 

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.232
Celebrating Poetry in Rural 
Communities.  Before she left, 

00:10:19.233 --> 00:10:21.233
she recorded a special message 
for you.

00:10:38.789 --> 00:10:40.413
He's trying to get sound and I 
want it noted that I'm not doing

00:10:40.414 --> 00:10:42.843
this.  It makes me feel good 
when someone else has these 

00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:44.844
technology issues.

00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:52.188
I'm so tempted to try to help. 

00:10:56.217 --> 00:10:58.217
There was opening music.

00:10:59.882 --> 00:11:02.109
It's Tracy Smith, the poet 
laureate and she's in her second

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.110
year and she 

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.276
wanted to emphasize using poetry
in specifically, rural 

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.610
communities.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:19.486
   So... what we're going to 
do...

00:11:24.162 --> 00:11:26.162
and I wish I had like one iota 
of her talent because...

00:11:28.034 --> 00:11:30.034
I could actually read some of 
her poetry.  And tell you...

00:11:32.923 --> 00:11:34.923
so, you see her and she wanted 
to do this...

00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:39.459
and we will make sure this is 
available shortly.

00:11:41.712 --> 00:11:43.712
Because, I had the opportunity 
to talk 

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.470
to Tracy and asked her to record
this.  Because...

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:52.375
she believes in the healing 
power of poetry.  And...

00:11:55.697 --> 00:11:57.159
when she was selected as poet 
laureate, it was one of my first

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
opportunities to be involved 
with the program.

00:12:03.051 --> 00:12:05.051
She said she wanted to go to 

00:12:07.134 --> 00:12:09.554
communities that had needed 
other ways to talk about 

00:12:09.555 --> 00:12:11.555
difficult and challenging 
issues.  

00:12:11.628 --> 00:12:13.628
And so...

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.290
in rural areas, Native-American 
communities -- 

00:12:19.312 --> 00:12:21.989
[applause] 
SPEAKER: I'm sorry I'm not there

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.267
with you tonight, I'm actually 
in Alaska, talking poetry with 

00:12:26.268 --> 00:12:27.896
new friends, but I'm excited to 
join you tomorrow and celebrate 

00:12:27.897 --> 00:12:29.897
your accomplishments.

00:12:35.211 --> 00:12:40.108
SPEAKER: We wanted sound -- and 
we've got it, so... we'll make 

00:12:40.109 --> 00:12:42.109
sure though, that you get to see
all of her message, because...

00:12:44.832 --> 00:12:46.832
basically, that's what she's 
hoping 

00:12:48.177 --> 00:12:50.007
that you, young poets will 
realize, that your words and 

00:12:50.008 --> 00:12:52.246
your way with words have a way 
of reaching out to others that 

00:12:55.079 --> 00:12:57.730
might not have their own way of 
expressing things.  And that's 

00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:59.731
what she wanted to wish for you.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.230
Because she's found that in her 
career.

00:13:04.724 --> 00:13:06.147
And she's taking it in another 
year, to communities throughout 

00:13:06.148 --> 00:13:09.029
this country, that need the 
healing power of words.  

00:13:09.439 --> 00:13:14.933
So... I hope you will enjoy 
meeting her tomorrow, her flight

00:13:14.934 --> 00:13:18.187
is on schedule.  She will be 
here, and now I'm going to bring

00:13:18.188 --> 00:13:20.188
up Kit to continue the program. 

00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:24.616
[applause] 

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:34.934
SPEAKER: That video will be a 
treat.

00:13:39.014 --> 00:13:41.622
Thank you, I'm former member of 
the National Museum and Library 

00:13:41.623 --> 00:13:47.558
Services Board.  We welcome you 
to D.C. We always enjoy working 

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:52.837
with our colleagues at the 
library of Congress on the 

00:13:52.838 --> 00:13:55.274
National Book Festival, coming 
up this weekend.  I hope many of

00:13:55.275 --> 00:13:58.270
you will partake of that.  I'm 
delighted to be with you all 

00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:02.732
today to celebrate this 2018 
class of the National Student 

00:14:02.733 --> 00:14:08.515
Poets Program.  We are extremely
proud to have partnered with the

00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:10.975
alliance for young artists and 
writers to establish the 

00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:17.671
program which shares exemplary 
work from 

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:20.724
teen poets like we honored today
with a national audience. 

00:14:24.694 --> 00:14:27.125
IMLS supports libraries and 
museums, large and small, across

00:14:27.126 --> 00:14:29.126
the country as 

00:14:30.585 --> 00:14:33.250
they enhance many forms of 
literacy and artistic 

00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:35.286
expression, including this 
poetry program.  Writing and 

00:14:35.287 --> 00:14:38.125
libraries are always 
intertwined.  I was reminded of 

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:41.587
this last week when up in Maine.
I've been telling my Maine 

00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:47.093
friends about upcoming 
activities at IMLS.  I can't 

00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:48.914
turn off my brain about 
libraries and museums, including

00:14:48.915 --> 00:14:50.915
this poetry celebration.  

00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.761
The next day, my friend was 
driving 

00:14:57.442 --> 00:14:59.270
me on one of those endless 
winding Maine roads, my friend 

00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:04.390
suddenly turned the Jeep off the
road through a battered chain 

00:15:04.391 --> 00:15:06.391
link fence into a small 
cemetery.

00:15:08.104 --> 00:15:10.964
The grass was dry, scuffy, and 
there were very few graveside 

00:15:10.965 --> 00:15:13.639
decorations.  It seemed 
utilitarian and in fact, 

00:15:13.841 --> 00:15:15.841
ignored.  

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:20.538
At the very back edge of the 
cemetery with a very nondescript

00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:22.539
plot under a tree.

00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:26.021
Elwyn Brooks White.

00:15:29.111 --> 00:15:31.559
Various votives, rocks, 
sculptures, painted notes were 

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.560
perched on the headstone.

00:15:35.775 --> 00:15:37.775
MVP White

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.954
-- many of White's books were 
donated to a library in Maine.

00:15:48.237 --> 00:15:50.676
EB White left an inscription.  
In a letter addressed to 

00:15:50.677 --> 00:15:52.677
children in 

00:15:53.762 --> 00:15:55.762
Michigan, congratulating them 
upon their 

00:15:56.827 --> 00:15:58.457
newly opened public library, EB 
White wrote:  Books hold many of

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.458
the secrets of the world, books 
are people, people 

00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:03.756
who have managed to stay alive 
by hiding between the covers of 

00:16:03.757 --> 00:16:05.757
a book.

00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:10.652
And we can say the same of 
poetry, as White did of books.

00:16:13.738 --> 00:16:15.738
Poetry holds many of the secrets
of 

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:19.629
the world and people stay alive 
within and through poetry.

00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:23.965
Many libraries and museums 
across our nation are critical 

00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:26.000
platforms for community 
expression and advancing 

00:16:28.847 --> 00:16:30.847
literacy and learning for all 
Americans.

00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:34.769
And the National Student Poets 
Program leverages the shared 

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.770
community spaces to 

00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:40.072
create new perspectives, connect
us across generations and spark 

00:16:40.073 --> 00:16:42.073
critical and essential 
conversations.

00:16:47.194 --> 00:16:50.037
This year's five exceptional 
student writers, Darius, Daniel,

00:16:50.038 --> 00:16:52.486
Alexandra, Heather and Arianna 
were selected by 

00:16:55.565 --> 00:16:57.396
some of our nation's finest 
literary voices and leaders in 

00:16:57.397 --> 00:17:01.255
education and they rose to the 
top of more than 300 national 

00:17:01.256 --> 00:17:03.256
medalists.  That's a fete.

00:17:06.132 --> 00:17:08.132
In the scholastic art and 
writing awards.

00:17:10.206 --> 00:17:13.070
They will receive academic 
awards, opportunities to 

00:17:13.071 --> 00:17:14.890
showcase their work in 
libraries, museums, schools and 

00:17:14.891 --> 00:17:16.891
at festivals and events across 
America.

00:17:22.451 --> 00:17:23.676
And they'll serve as regional, 
literary ambassadors for the 

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:25.300
coming year.  
   Each student poet from this 

00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:27.301
year's 

00:17:28.578 --> 00:17:29.998
class is charged with designing 
a special community service 

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:35.094
project which may include 
readings, workshops, webinars, 

00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:35.300
classroom visits, interviews and
conversations with established 

00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:37.301
poets.

00:17:46.455 --> 00:17:47.881
In previous years, they've 
focused outreach on military 

00:17:47.882 --> 00:17:50.740
families, Alzheimer's patients, 
English as second language 

00:17:50.741 --> 00:17:52.741
students, homeless, youth and 
Native-American students.

00:17:55.821 --> 00:17:57.871
I look forward to hearing how 
each of you will reach out to 

00:17:57.872 --> 00:18:01.889
others.  This is just the 
beginning.  Whether reading EB 

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.982
White or participating in a 
poetry slam, I truly believe 

00:18:06.983 --> 00:18:10.639
anyone can own the power of 
poetry and have a voice.  Our 

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.640
phone winning poets are 

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.150
ambassadors for poetry's power 
to inspire curiosity, learning, 

00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:19.836
confidence and connections.  I 
want to congratulate you on your

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:22.458
accomplishments, and we look 
forward to your continued 

00:18:22.459 --> 00:18:26.082
service throughout the next 
year.  Thank you. 

00:18:34.237 --> 00:18:36.312
[applause] 
SPEAKER: Good afternoon.  

00:18:36.313 --> 00:18:38.313
Welcome... I'm Virginia 
McNearney.

00:18:41.961 --> 00:18:43.961
I'm the Executive Director of 
The 

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.250
Alliance for Artists and 
Writers.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.447
We are so honored to be 
partnered with IMLS in 

00:18:54.448 --> 00:18:56.513
presenting this wonderful 
program to poets and writers 

00:18:56.514 --> 00:18:58.514
across the country.

00:18:59.769 --> 00:19:01.803
I want to thank the Library of 
Congress for hosting us at this 

00:19:01.804 --> 00:19:07.310
event.  We have special guests 
here in the audience.  I'd be 

00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:09.311
remiss if I didn't start by 

00:19:11.181 --> 00:19:13.241
thanking and honoring Olivia 
Morgan, who is the head -- who 

00:19:13.242 --> 00:19:15.298
started the program.  Thank you,
Olivia, so glad you're here.  

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:20.260
[applause] 
SPEAKER: The inspiration behind 

00:19:20.261 --> 00:19:22.497
the programs.  I also want to 
welcome Dr.

00:19:29.164 --> 00:19:31.164
Lucie Ann

00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:36.123
Milkowitz.

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.973
She's holds the Chair in 
Astrobiology at the Library of 

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:47.468
Congress.  She included on her 
post-doc fellowship application 

00:19:47.469 --> 00:19:49.702
to Princeton, the scholastic 
award for painting she won in 

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.173
10th grade.  It gave her the 
idea she could be what she 

00:19:52.174 --> 00:19:54.174
wanted to be.

00:19:56.639 --> 00:19:58.469
I also want to acknowledge and 
thank my friends from the poetry

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.470
coalition 

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:07.247
under the leadership of Jen Ba
nka.  It's great of you to 

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.296
launch these young poets in 
their year of service. 

00:20:11.118 --> 00:20:13.118
These fine poets became eligible
to 

00:20:14.378 --> 00:20:16.005
be appointed as national student
poets, because they first 

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:18.006
received national 

00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:24.386
awards through the Scholastic 
Art And Writing Awards.  Started

00:20:24.387 --> 00:20:26.260
in 1923, about the time the word
teenager first appeared in the 

00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:30.261
dictionary.  Our mission and 
purpose is to encourage creative

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:32.262
young people.

00:20:33.328 --> 00:20:35.395
We have the privilege of 
launching these creative young 

00:20:35.396 --> 00:20:37.396
people onto their year of 
service and I wish all of you 

00:20:38.659 --> 00:20:40.659
could get to see some of them at
work, as I do.

00:20:45.191 --> 00:20:47.191
Last year, I went on tour in 
Idaho, 

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.278
with Kim Sale Houston who worked
in a number of different 

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:52.279
settings.

00:20:56.535 --> 00:20:59.088
She did a poetry workshop for 
Docents at Boise Art Museum.

00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:06.444
And spent the day at Boise High 
School where students wrote 

00:21:06.445 --> 00:21:08.445
poems about their homes.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.540
When it came time to share, one 
of the 

00:21:13.212 --> 00:21:14.825
15-year-old students started 
reading "I remember my first 

00:21:14.826 --> 00:21:16.826
home...

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.816
" and went on to describe seven 
more homes and details about the

00:21:20.817 --> 00:21:22.837
light, the step families that 
had come and gone.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.890
A stunning moment, a pause, the 
class did this...

00:21:29.751 --> 00:21:31.381
a lot of this in the Scholastic 
Art and Writing Awards and they 

00:21:31.382 --> 00:21:34.432
moved on.  I reflected on that 
student quite a bit.

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:40.416
She so aptly described how 
poetry shortcuts the expression 

00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:42.417
of complex emotions and ideas 
and how powerful it 

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:47.704
is, it has the power to connect 
us, to 

00:21:49.384 --> 00:21:51.816
explain, to provoke, to express,
to explore.  Very complicated 

00:21:51.817 --> 00:21:53.817
being a teenager these days.

00:21:55.701 --> 00:21:57.739
It always has been, but 
especially now.  What better 

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.596
pastime could they possibly grab
onto than poetry and helping 

00:22:01.597 --> 00:22:03.427
guide them through the teenage 
years?  

00:22:03.428 --> 00:22:05.254
These teen poets are 
particularly well-suited to 

00:22:05.255 --> 00:22:09.539
advocate.  They're young enough 
to be relatable to young kids 

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.540
and mature enough for adults to 
take them seriously. 

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:17.499
The 2018 Class of National 
Student Poets joins a legacy of 

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.500
young writers 

00:22:20.562 --> 00:22:22.601
who feel poetry in their bones 
and... their voices are strong 

00:22:22.602 --> 00:22:27.291
and unique and they will enter 
their year of service, fully 

00:22:27.292 --> 00:22:30.170
committed to sharing their 
voices, insights and artistry to

00:22:30.171 --> 00:22:32.171
audiences large 

00:22:33.432 --> 00:22:35.867
and small, grand and not so 
grand, like those at the Library

00:22:35.868 --> 00:22:37.868
of Congress and those at Boise 
High School. 

00:22:41.225 --> 00:22:42.427
Poetry is an ancient art form 
that continues to reinvent 

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:44.428
itself and...

00:22:46.505 --> 00:22:48.505
make itself newly-relevant, 
generation after generation.

00:22:50.378 --> 00:22:52.625
We are so proud to be here, to 
introduce you today, to this 

00:22:54.056 --> 00:22:55.473
generation's finest young poets.
   So... we have some wonderful 

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:57.474
guests joining us here today.

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:05.648
Want to thank all of you.

00:23:06.769 --> 00:23:08.769
It's my honor to welcome to the 
podium, David Brooks.

00:23:09.775 --> 00:23:14.121
[applause] 
SPEAKER: I was talking to the 

00:23:14.122 --> 00:23:19.440
students, the poets, earlier, 
and I mentioned when I was in 

00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:21.129
college, I replied to a short 
story class, the professor 

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.033
thought it was short story and 
poetry, so, to get into the 

00:23:25.034 --> 00:23:28.692
class, we had to write a short 
story and then also a poem.  And

00:23:28.693 --> 00:23:30.946
I'd never written a poem before 
in my life.  So I wrote the 

00:23:30.947 --> 00:23:32.947
story and wrote the poem and 
wrote on the bottom...

00:23:36.252 --> 00:23:37.668
"I make no claims on poetry" and
my professor wrote on the bottom

00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:40.929
"and it makes no claims on you."
[laughter] 

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.930
SPEAKER: So...

00:23:46.917 --> 00:23:47.323
I, myself, do not have this 
gift, but I'm the beneficiary of

00:23:47.324 --> 00:23:49.324
poetry.

00:23:52.009 --> 00:23:54.049
And I'm the beneficiary of the 
written word and what I thought 

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:58.519
I'd do, just for a few minutes 
was try to illustrate what the 

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.520
written word does for us.  So...

00:24:02.011 --> 00:24:04.056
I have a home, ten blocks from 
here, and I have a collection in

00:24:04.057 --> 00:24:06.320
that home, and some people 
collect stamps, I collect 

00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:08.321
accounts of different emotions.

00:24:10.241 --> 00:24:12.241
And so... I collect accounts of 
joy.

00:24:14.714 --> 00:24:17.144
And so, for example, and when 
you have all these accounts, you

00:24:17.145 --> 00:24:19.789
realize it comes in layers.  
There's physical joy that gets 

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.253
-- when people are moving 
together, my old history 

00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:26.753
professor, was named Louie 
McNeill, he was in boot camp 

00:24:26.754 --> 00:24:29.846
marching with his memo and 
experienced a moment of joy. 

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.555
He wrote:  Words are inadequate 
to express the emotion that's 

00:24:35.556 --> 00:24:41.467
involved.  A sense of pervasive 
well-being is what I recall.  

00:24:41.468 --> 00:24:43.729
More specifically, a strange 
sense of personal enlargement, a

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.730
swelling up, becoming bigger 
than life, thanks to 

00:24:47.216 --> 00:24:49.451
participation in the collective 
ritual.  So... that's one layer 

00:24:49.452 --> 00:24:51.452
of joy.  

00:24:52.953 --> 00:24:57.042
Another is what they call 
collective effervescence.  Every

00:24:57.043 --> 00:25:00.100
group of humanity dances in 
rhythm when they're joyful.  

00:25:00.101 --> 00:25:02.101
So...

00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:08.691
Zadie Smith was in London at a 
nightclub when she heard Q tip 

00:25:08.692 --> 00:25:13.009
wrapping over the music and 
describes this moment.  A rail 

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.852
thin man with enormous eyes 
reached across the sea of bodies

00:25:14.853 --> 00:25:19.967
for my hand.  He kept asking me 
the same thing over and over 

00:25:19.968 --> 00:25:23.025
"you feeling it?"  I was.  My 
ridiculous heels were killing 

00:25:23.026 --> 00:25:25.026
me, I 

00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:28.102
was terrifies I might die, yet I
felt simultaneously overwhelmed 

00:25:28.103 --> 00:25:32.590
with delight that can I kick it 
should happen to be playing at 

00:25:32.591 --> 00:25:34.835
this precise moment in the 
history of the world and was now

00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:38.051
morphing into smells like teen 
spirit.

00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:41.529
I took the man's hand, the top 
of my 

00:25:42.592 --> 00:25:44.260
head flew away, we danced and 
danced and gave ourselves up to 

00:25:44.261 --> 00:25:46.904
joy. 
   That's another layer.  Then 

00:25:46.905 --> 00:25:48.905
there's emotional joy.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.842
One of my hero's in life is 
Dorothy Day.  She got pregnant 

00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:57.130
and realized that most of the 
accounts of childbirth she ever 

00:25:57.131 --> 00:25:59.169
read were written by men.  45 
minutes after giving birth, she 

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:02.159
wrote an account of her 
beautiful 

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.108
account and it ends with a 
moment of joy.  She writes:  If 

00:26:06.109 --> 00:26:08.349
I'd written the greatest book, 
composed the greatest 

00:26:12.639 --> 00:26:14.068
symphony or carved the greatest 
figure, I wouldn't have exalted 

00:26:14.069 --> 00:26:16.069
the greatest 

00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:20.217
thing as I did when they placed 
my child in my arms.  No human 

00:26:20.218 --> 00:26:23.060
could contain such a vast flood 
of love and joy as I felt with 

00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:26.930
the birth of my young child and 
with this came the need to 

00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:29.802
worship and adore. 
   When you see these moments, 

00:26:29.803 --> 00:26:38.168
you realize the joy happens when
the skin barrier between one 

00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:40.169
person and another disappears. 

00:26:43.042 --> 00:26:45.042
David White, a good poet writes:
Joy is a meeting place of deep 

00:26:46.515 --> 00:26:48.515
intentionality and self 
forgiving.

00:26:49.589 --> 00:26:51.423
The body can be what lies inside
us in communion with what 

00:26:51.424 --> 00:26:53.671
formerly seemed outside, but now
is neither.

00:26:56.728 --> 00:26:58.991
Dance, laughter, affection, skin
touching skin, singing in the 

00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:00.992
car, music 

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:07.115
in the kitchen, the quiet, 
irreplaceable companion and 

00:27:07.116 --> 00:27:09.116
presence of a daughter.

00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:14.310
The sheer intoxablity of a world
that was us and what was not us.

00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:20.268
   A couple higher levels.  One 
is transcendent joy.  When we 

00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:21.902
think we're reaching across some
barrier that we can't really 

00:27:21.903 --> 00:27:25.765
explain.  So... I'm not a poet, 
I have a friend who is an actual

00:27:25.766 --> 00:27:27.766
poet.

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:32.700
His name is Christian Wyman.  
Very beautiful poet.  When you 

00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:34.701
talk to Chris, he's lived in 

00:27:36.226 --> 00:27:38.464
a lot of cities, he always lived
there because there was a woman 

00:27:38.465 --> 00:27:40.465
there.

00:27:41.515 --> 00:27:43.546
He lived in Buffalo, why 
Buffalo?  Had a girlfriend 

00:27:43.547 --> 00:27:45.547
there.  Same with Rochester.

00:27:50.337 --> 00:27:52.337
He lived in Prague, he had a 
girlfriend there. 

00:27:53.814 --> 00:27:56.689
He was at the kitchen table and 
a falcon landed on the window 

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.943
sill across the window.  And it 
scanned out and it didn't see 

00:28:02.212 --> 00:28:03.835
him, just was scanning like two 
feet away from him and his 

00:28:03.836 --> 00:28:08.510
girlfriend was taking a shower, 
so he went and got her and said 

00:28:08.511 --> 00:28:10.771
"come out, you have to see this.
"  She came out dripping naked 

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:13.016
and they're standing there, just
with this 

00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:20.210
falcon right there and the 
falcon turns and locks eyes with

00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:18.277
Wyman.

00:28:19.544 --> 00:28:21.544
And... his girlfriend said "wish
for something.

00:28:25.332 --> 00:28:27.332
"  Take this moment, wish for 
something 

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.886
and he later wrote a poem about 
the experience and includes this

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.620
stanza.

00:28:34.936 --> 00:28:36.968
And for a long moment, I'm still
in, I wished and wished and 

00:28:36.969 --> 00:28:39.815
wished and wished and wished 
that the moment wouldn't end and

00:28:39.816 --> 00:28:44.132
just like that, it vanished.  
   So... that's that content 

00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:46.797
that people have with nature.  
   And then finally, the part 

00:28:46.798 --> 00:28:49.646
I'll end with and I don't have a
passage with 

00:28:53.144 --> 00:28:55.585
this, some moments of joy are 
just transcendent, but moments 

00:28:55.586 --> 00:29:00.718
and then they go away, like 
Wyman's, but for some people, 

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:02.585
joy isn't an experience, it's an
outlook.  It's something they 

00:29:02.586 --> 00:29:04.586
bring into the world every day.

00:29:07.303 --> 00:29:09.570
And it comes from the habitual 
giving other people's delight.  

00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:12.635
It becomes a permanent way of 
being in the world.  I was at a 

00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:14.636
luncheon here, a couple 

00:29:16.514 --> 00:29:19.366
years ago, I was seated next to 
the Dalai Lama and the guy 

00:29:19.367 --> 00:29:22.003
laughed for no apparent reason. 
He just starts laughing and you 

00:29:22.004 --> 00:29:26.925
want to be polite, so you laugh,
he laughs, you laugh and I had 

00:29:26.926 --> 00:29:28.926
nothing to say to 

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800
the guy, he was just so happy.

00:29:34.278 --> 00:29:36.939
I finally said, he had a canvas 
bag.  I said "you got any candy 

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.830
in your bag."  He starts pulling
out the stuff in the bag.  It's 

00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:43.902
everything in the first class 
cabin of an international 

00:29:43.903 --> 00:29:46.560
flight.  A little razor -- he 
just radiates joy. 

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.440
Kathy and I have a friend, Yo-Yo
Ma, 

00:29:54.798 --> 00:29:56.798
that guy just radiates joy.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.117
That to me is a higher form of 
life.  Why have I run through 

00:30:02.118 --> 00:30:04.202
all of this?  We're born with 
relatively primitive 

00:30:05.222 --> 00:30:05.614
understandings of our own 
emotions, at least men are.  

00:30:08.632 --> 00:30:10.120
[laughter] 
SPEAKER: But what language -- 

00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:13.996
and especially poetry does, it 
educates us in our own emotions.

00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:19.908
When you've read a poem, you 
haven't gotten new knowledge or 

00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:24.988
new information, but you had a 
new experience.  It's an 

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:27.049
emotional experience and you 
widen your repertoire of 

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.050
emotions. 

00:30:31.754 --> 00:30:34.400
The greatest poet of our day, 
Taylor Swift, was once asked -- 

00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:37.041
[laughter]
SPEAKER: I sort of mean that.

00:30:41.507 --> 00:30:43.954
They said you always wrote about
sadness.  She said, there's 23 

00:30:43.955 --> 00:30:49.065
different kinds of sadness.  
She's an expert on sadness.  

00:30:49.066 --> 00:30:51.134
It's like we're born with one 
piano key for joy, but through 

00:30:51.135 --> 00:30:55.806
poetry and through language, we 
learn, there are actually 88 

00:30:55.807 --> 00:30:58.051
different piano keys and who 
would want to live with a 

00:30:58.052 --> 00:31:01.384
simplistic notion of our 
emotions when you can live with 

00:31:01.385 --> 00:31:05.101
an enriched one?  It makes life 
so much better.  And then, 

00:31:05.102 --> 00:31:07.943
finally, if you realize joy is 
the kind of thing that the Dalai

00:31:07.944 --> 00:31:13.063
Lama or Yo-Yo Ma could 
experience and project, why 

00:31:13.064 --> 00:31:14.689
would you want to live for just 
mere happiness, when you could 

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.357
have joy?  When you make that 
kind of realization, a whole 

00:31:18.358 --> 00:31:20.358
life can turn around.

00:31:21.822 --> 00:31:23.822
That's what I think you guys are
offering.

00:31:25.338 --> 00:31:26.966
The explication of your own 
emotions and giving everybody a 

00:31:26.967 --> 00:31:28.800
sense of what you learned about 
them. 

00:31:28.801 --> 00:31:30.801
So...

00:31:32.275 --> 00:31:34.275
i congratulate you, I thank you 
for what you're about to do.

00:31:36.768 --> 00:31:38.630
As I mentioned, on a serious 
note, this is a moment when our 

00:31:38.631 --> 00:31:40.631
nation needs a 

00:31:41.904 --> 00:31:43.904
story and it needs to be told 
through poetry.

00:31:47.034 --> 00:31:49.898
I ask you spend time with us 
next year filling a gap.  If 

00:31:49.899 --> 00:31:52.139
there's anything that's going to
unite such a diverse country, 

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.575
it'll be poetry and story and 
narrative.  And I'm sure you're 

00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:56.576
going play a role in that.

00:32:00.477 --> 00:32:03.124
I've never experienced the kind 
of joy that Sadie Smith did.  I 

00:32:03.125 --> 00:32:05.965
can't dance to Q tip.  But I 
have had a couple experiences of

00:32:09.014 --> 00:32:11.014
joy and this is a replication of
one of my earlier experiences.

00:32:14.527 --> 00:32:16.561
Twice in my life I had this 
experience.  Introducing Valerie

00:32:16.562 --> 00:32:19.406
June.  This is my second and 
this is joy personified.  

00:32:19.407 --> 00:32:21.407
Valerie?  

00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:26.669
[applause] 

00:32:40.031 --> 00:32:42.031
SPEAKER: Well...

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.145
I had the pleasure of spending 
some personal time with the 

00:32:46.146 --> 00:32:48.146
students and...

00:32:51.038 --> 00:32:54.914
I was asking each one of them 
about their voices.  And... I'm 

00:32:54.915 --> 00:32:57.771
a musician, but... also a song 
writer, and a poet as well, 

00:32:58.378 --> 00:33:00.378
so...

00:33:01.639 --> 00:33:03.639
the voice of the poet is really 
an interesting thing to me.

00:33:05.905 --> 00:33:08.409
And one thing they told me, each
one in their different way of 

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:12.295
how they hear the voice of a 
poem, is, it usually starts with

00:33:12.296 --> 00:33:14.756
one line.  And... I'll hear that
line and I'll live with 

00:33:17.863 --> 00:33:19.863
that line, again and again, for 
a little 

00:33:21.106 --> 00:33:23.144
bit and then I'll start writing 
the poem and the poems come 

00:33:23.145 --> 00:33:28.046
really fast once I hear that one
line and stick with it, then the

00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:30.047
poem writing is fast after that.
   So...

00:33:32.724 --> 00:33:34.724
I hope that you go to your 
regions and 

00:33:37.446 --> 00:33:39.446
you take those one lines and you
inspire everyone in your region.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.154
I know you have this power, I 
know you have the power to do 

00:33:42.155 --> 00:33:46.253
that.  It'll only take but one 
line.  I'm going to play a song 

00:33:46.254 --> 00:33:49.941
for you on my little Bailey and 
it's a song for love and for 

00:33:49.942 --> 00:33:51.982
healing.  And it's called 
Somebody to Love.

00:34:00.796 --> 00:34:03.634
   Well if you're tired and 
feeling so 

00:34:07.096 --> 00:34:09.096
lonely, you wake up at night and
you 

00:34:10.101 --> 00:34:12.101
think, only if you had somebody.

00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:17.511
Well, I'll be somebody.  
Somebody to love.

00:34:28.959 --> 00:34:30.959
If it means there were plenty of
fish 

00:34:32.216 --> 00:34:33.827
in the sea, but you're out in 
the cold and you're feeling 

00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:35.828
empty, all you're looking for is
somebody...

00:34:38.928 --> 00:34:40.928
well, I'll be somebody.

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:45.448
Somebody to love.

00:34:50.206 --> 00:34:52.206
Well, I'll be somebody, I'll be 

00:34:53.207 --> 00:34:55.207
somebody, I'll be somebody...

00:35:02.636 --> 00:35:04.636
I'll be somebody, I'll be 
somebody, I'll be somebody...

00:35:06.717 --> 00:35:08.717
somebody to love.

00:35:17.578 --> 00:35:19.578
While you're watching the moon 
rise in 

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.490
the darkness of night and it's 
unbroken because no it ain't 

00:35:24.491 --> 00:35:26.491
right, if you ain't got 
nobody...

00:35:31.009 --> 00:35:33.009
I'll be somebody.  Somebody to 
love.

00:35:43.001 --> 00:35:45.001
I'll be somebody, I'll be 
somebody, I'll be somebody...

00:35:52.442 --> 00:35:54.442
I'll be somebody, I'll be 
somebody, 

00:35:56.107 --> 00:35:58.107
I'll be somebody...

00:35:59.974 --> 00:36:01.974
I'll be somebody...

00:36:02.986 --> 00:36:04.986
I'll be somebody

00:36:07.302 --> 00:36:09.302
... I'll be somebody somebody to
love.

00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:21.951
[applause] 

00:36:27.348 --> 00:36:32.051
SPEAKER: She's a sweet baby.  
So... I'd like to invite the 

00:36:32.052 --> 00:36:34.052
poets to the stage now and Dr. 
Matthews as well.  

00:36:36.923 --> 00:36:38.923
[applause] 

00:36:53.596 --> 00:36:55.596
SPEAKER: And representing the 
Midwest

00:36:57.529 --> 00:36:59.529
is Darius, and representing the 

00:37:01.607 --> 00:37:03.607
southeast is Daniel, and 
representing 

00:37:05.015 --> 00:37:08.118
the northeast is Alexandra. 

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:18.573
Representing the southwest is 
Heather.  And representing the 

00:37:18.574 --> 00:37:20.574
west, Arianna Smith.

00:37:21.577 --> 00:37:23.577
[applause] 

00:37:26.127 --> 00:37:28.127
SPEAKER: I believe they're each 
going to read something.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:38.978
SPEAKER: Thank you, all for 
coming.  I'm the national 

00:37:38.979 --> 00:37:43.855
student poet representing the 
Midwest.  I'm Darius.  I'm from 

00:37:43.856 --> 00:37:45.856
Huntington, West Virginia and 

00:37:48.754 --> 00:37:50.754
go to school at Interlock and 
Arts Academy.

00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:54.468
This is called beautiful day of 
dance, for my father, widower at

00:37:54.469 --> 00:37:56.469
33.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.172
Mornings, when I woke up, my 
face, sagging, defeated, dad 

00:38:00.173 --> 00:38:04.295
would smile at me and wave his 
arms above his head, his legs 

00:38:04.296 --> 00:38:06.296
kicking beneath him.

00:38:07.367 --> 00:38:08.982
A desperate flail, but a chance 
to show he could move his body 

00:38:08.983 --> 00:38:10.983
as well as anyone.

00:38:12.659 --> 00:38:15.512
When the sunlight seemed to 
break and spill down his raised 

00:38:15.513 --> 00:38:17.513
chin like egg 

00:38:18.563 --> 00:38:21.212
whites and the chill bit into us
both, he's sing.  The song isn't

00:38:21.213 --> 00:38:24.062
as important to me now as the 
beauty of the dance and I'm sure

00:38:31.628 --> 00:38:33.628
the melody was a repetitious 
rip-off of 

00:38:36.258 --> 00:38:40.193
zip dido dah.  It's a beautiful 
day to the blue that filled the 

00:38:40.194 --> 00:38:42.194
space behind the clouds, to 
whoever was listening.

00:38:45.675 --> 00:38:47.675
To the way I sweat at night, dad

00:38:49.913 --> 00:38:51.913
rubbing the wet it

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.080
T-shirt that clung to my back 
whispering it's okay.

00:39:02.447 --> 00:39:04.447
Regretfully alive, but thankful 
that we 

00:39:05.931 --> 00:39:07.760
could always spin ourselves 
around, arms spread wide to live

00:39:07.761 --> 00:39:09.761
and dance and to spinning 
anyways, to sing always.

00:39:14.097 --> 00:39:16.097
Thank you.

00:39:17.104 --> 00:39:19.104
[applause] 

00:39:34.928 --> 00:39:36.960
SPEAKER: Shalom, y'all.

00:39:40.848 --> 00:39:43.280
I'm Daniel Block and I'm the 
southeast national student poet,

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:45.281
if you couldn't tell.

00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:49.367
I'm from Birmingham, Alabama and
my comb is called 60.

00:39:52.273 --> 00:39:54.273
Like his own father before him, 
at 3:00 a.m.

00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:58.559
, my father wakes, wanders the 
house a 

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.099
little, pours his cereal, no 
eggs, no bacon, my father 

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.100
doesn't touch meat.  Lifts 
softly enough to enter and leave

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.221
the world a shadow, a breeze on 
door steps.  He reads the news 

00:40:08.222 --> 00:40:13.576
until I wake.  On the way to 
school, he'll talk about the 

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.577
latest friend I didn't get to 
meet.

00:40:21.315 --> 00:40:23.748
This one was only 52 and lived 
back in Harkoff.  They let 

00:40:23.749 --> 00:40:25.749
evening make meat of them.

00:40:32.745 --> 00:40:34.745
My father shouts at the car 
swerving in 

00:40:36.224 --> 00:40:38.095
its lane ahead of us and asks 
"have you reconsidered being 

00:40:38.096 --> 00:40:40.096
vegetarian?

00:40:41.144 --> 00:40:43.390
"  I say maybe, which we both 
know means I don't want to go to

00:40:43.391 --> 00:40:47.661
the trouble of saying no and we 
pulled up to the school.  He 

00:40:47.662 --> 00:40:49.907
hasn't had a chance to talk 
about the news or say how proud 

00:40:49.908 --> 00:40:52.551
he was to watch another morning 
swell up through the cracks of 

00:40:52.552 --> 00:40:54.552
night.

00:40:56.012 --> 00:40:58.037
I haven't had a chance to wish 
him happy birthday and anyway, 

00:40:58.038 --> 00:41:00.038
what is there 

00:41:01.523 --> 00:41:03.523
to say but "good-bye my son" and

00:41:05.019 --> 00:41:07.019
"good-bye my father who is my 
son.

00:41:08.281 --> 00:41:11.941
"  Whose eyes I carry into any 
rear view mirror, any 3:00 a.m. 

00:41:11.942 --> 00:41:13.942
drive home when one car side 
swipes another behind me. 

00:41:15.392 --> 00:41:16.008
My father who knows we live in 
worlds of wheels.  All trying to

00:41:16.009 --> 00:41:18.009
catch us.  Thank you.

00:41:40.417 --> 00:41:45.791
[applause] 
SPEAKER: Hello.  My name is 

00:41:45.792 --> 00:41:48.266
Alexandra.  I'm representing the
northeast.

00:41:52.767 --> 00:41:58.034
I'm from Burlington, Vermont and
go to Burlington High School.  

00:41:58.035 --> 00:42:00.475
This is Puebla.  Puebla is 
chocolate dipped, served me 

00:42:04.368 --> 00:42:05.591
as I spoon in out of the close 
knit town surrounding Mexico 

00:42:05.592 --> 00:42:07.592
City.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:10.850
I just want to gulp it down, 
suck the 

00:42:12.337 --> 00:42:14.337
marrow from the cattle that get 
leaner every year.

00:42:15.996 --> 00:42:17.996
It smells good, being home or...

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.240
being in a place that was once 
home.

00:42:23.157 --> 00:42:24.567
I can't help but hold my breath,
obstructing my lungs because the

00:42:24.568 --> 00:42:26.568
wind here is a different flavor 
than the wind there.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.039
I thought the thing I missed 
most was the sizzle your bear 

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.083
feet make against the packed 
dirt of the evening road, but 

00:42:40.946 --> 00:42:42.946
I was wrong because I'm 
intoxicated by 

00:42:43.986 --> 00:42:45.986
the way my grandma clasps her 
hands to 

00:42:47.848 --> 00:42:50.735
my heart, like I never left.  
Puebla tastes salty as I lick it

00:42:50.736 --> 00:42:55.236
from my top lips, brushing it 
from the corners of my eyes, let

00:42:55.237 --> 00:42:57.237
it fall, absorb into my skin.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.761
I know I can't come back until 
the next thunderstorm season.  

00:43:01.762 --> 00:43:03.762
It gets easier to come and 
harder to leave.

00:43:08.668 --> 00:43:11.531
I wish I could stay in this town
where everything that tastes 

00:43:11.532 --> 00:43:15.189
like cayenne mixed with just the
right amount of lime.  It burns,

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:18.248
but... you laugh until the sour.
Thank you.  

00:43:21.252 --> 00:43:23.252
[applause] 

00:43:46.392 --> 00:43:49.847
SPEAKER: Howdy.
[laughter] 

00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:53.879
SPEAKER: I'm Heather from Mesa, 
Arizona.

00:43:54.934 --> 00:43:56.934
I'll be representing the 
southwest.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.560
This is

00:44:02.893 --> 00:44:05.347
apologizing in hindsight.  I 
hear July will bring the second 

00:44:07.614 --> 00:44:09.866
coming monsoon season and a 
Stock Market crash, each light 

00:44:09.867 --> 00:44:13.118
on the water tower will blink 
and then strobe.  A cougar will 

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:15.119
sleep under my trampoline for 
weeks.

00:44:18.612 --> 00:44:22.345
Dogs will break into every 
antique shop and devour fine 

00:44:18.612 --> 00:44:21.609
China. 

00:44:25.145 --> 00:44:25.545
From there, the moon will roll 
across a cliff and crush the 

00:44:25.546 --> 00:44:27.546
nearest mobile home.

00:44:32.088 --> 00:44:34.151
Today, they're dredging my best 
friend's body from the lake.

00:44:40.211 --> 00:44:45.155
She's wrapped in pink tarps and 
identifiable by her ponytail.  

00:44:45.156 --> 00:44:46.372
Occasionally when I take a 
shower, there's vomit already in

00:44:46.373 --> 00:44:50.854
the bathtub.  I shouldn't be 
here.  Not like this.  Three 

00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:52.855
weeks ago, we were kneeling at 

00:44:54.164 --> 00:44:56.210
the gulf of a psych ward with my
hands pressing a zip lock to her

00:44:56.211 --> 00:44:58.211
nose and 

00:44:59.252 --> 00:45:02.129
mouth in lieu of a paper bag.  
In hindsight, I'm not even an 

00:45:03.752 --> 00:45:05.752
effective attempt at a solution.

00:45:07.248 --> 00:45:11.547
A threat is still a threat when 
you pretend it's benign.  Sorrow

00:45:11.548 --> 00:45:13.801
is still sorrow with my 
headphones in.  Her grief was 

00:45:13.802 --> 00:45:15.802
still grief when I avoided it.

00:45:17.672 --> 00:45:19.672
In the future, I still hope to 
be unafraid of asking questions.

00:45:22.354 --> 00:45:24.583
Her parents with join a nunnery,
the lake will drain through a 

00:45:24.584 --> 00:45:26.584
metal slit in the earth.

00:45:29.678 --> 00:45:31.678
Her old things will appear on 
every subway in the world.

00:45:34.976 --> 00:45:36.976
In hindsight, I will look for 
the 

00:45:38.027 --> 00:45:40.892
cliff crumbs in the cuffs of her
jeans.  In hindsight, I'll call 

00:45:40.893 --> 00:45:42.893
the hospital and tell them her 
name.  

00:45:44.505 --> 00:45:46.505
[applause] 

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:17.626
SPEAKER: My name is Arianna.  
I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada.  

00:46:17.627 --> 00:46:19.627
I'll be representing the wedge 
region.

00:46:21.688 --> 00:46:23.688
This poem is entitled 
Descendant.

00:46:25.784 --> 00:46:28.629
Grandfather, burning crosses, 
smoke clinging to black skin 

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.630
like fresh cotton 

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.589
to nimble fingers, breathing in 
freedomless Zephyr.  Sunday 

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:38.590
shoes stuck in rich wet moss.

00:46:40.255 --> 00:46:42.255
Grandmother blooming out of rose

00:46:43.502 --> 00:46:45.502
milkweed from the Carolinas, 
twig-like 

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.366
brown legs skipping across 
sweeping willows,

00:46:54.735 --> 00:46:57.170
pearl velvet swaying above her. 
Father, product of Exodus from 

00:46:57.171 --> 00:47:01.909
south to north, the other side 
of the sunshine.  My father, a 

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.792
lingering love weaved from 
ancestral needle and threat.

00:47:07.828 --> 00:47:10.514
Blood line like a river, flowing
through state lines, Mississippi

00:47:12.548 --> 00:47:15.205
currents of dripping peach wine.
I descend from the other side of

00:47:15.206 --> 00:47:17.206
the 

00:47:20.097 --> 00:47:22.097
train tracks, resembling country
border 

00:47:23.114 --> 00:47:25.114
from

00:47:27.681 --> 00:47:29.681
suction lips to buttery biscuits
on the kitchen stove.

00:47:32.185 --> 00:47:34.004
Kaleidoscopes for eyes, freedom 
writer's bus in a flame already 

00:47:34.005 --> 00:47:36.005
burning.

00:47:38.238 --> 00:47:40.238
An eternity of southern

00:47:47.896 --> 00:47:50.959
acrimony.  There lay heritage,  
blood, spirit, bone.

00:47:54.222 --> 00:47:56.673
Generations gone with the wind, 
surviving through me, like DNA, 

00:47:56.674 --> 00:47:58.674
their 

00:48:00.493 --> 00:48:05.054
flesh dissolving like sugar 
cube.  Some day we will all 

00:48:05.055 --> 00:48:07.055
taste liberation on the tips of 
our tongues.

00:48:08.467 --> 00:48:10.467
[applause] 

00:48:27.943 --> 00:48:31.052
SPEAKER: Well... I think we have
two poets from last year here.  

00:48:31.053 --> 00:48:33.053
Can you raise your hands?  
Yeah... great.

00:48:36.381 --> 00:48:38.823
Congratulations, thank you for 
coming.  So...

00:48:42.294 --> 00:48:44.956
I think we're going to have 
reflections from Ann Castillo, 

00:48:44.957 --> 00:48:46.957
right?

00:48:48.417 --> 00:48:50.417
And Ben is here to add 
counterpoint, I'm sure.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.420
[laughter] 

00:48:56.376 --> 00:49:01.468
SPEAKER: Hi, everyone, thanks 
for having me back.  Welcome to 

00:49:01.469 --> 00:49:03.469
the appointment of this year's 
national student poets.

00:49:05.741 --> 00:49:07.741
I want to congratulate the class
of 2018.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.420
Darius, Alex, Heather, Daniel, 
and Arianna.

00:49:12.673 --> 00:49:16.396
And to your parents, teachers, 
friends, and supporters.  Thank 

00:49:16.397 --> 00:49:18.433
you for guiding these people who
write and envision change in 

00:49:18.434 --> 00:49:20.434
their community.

00:49:22.712 --> 00:49:25.554
I wanted to offer a quick recap 
of our year as the class of 

00:49:25.555 --> 00:49:27.555
2017.

00:49:29.409 --> 00:49:31.654
Alongside Juliet, Kimsale, Ben 
and Camila, I've had the best 

00:49:31.655 --> 00:49:33.655
year of my life.

00:49:34.947 --> 00:49:37.589
For starters, I've made four 
life-long friends.  Better yet, 

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.590
we skipped school to travel 
together to New York City in 

00:49:42.467 --> 00:49:43.682
October, the Aspen Ideas 
Festival and Carnegie Hall in 

00:49:43.683 --> 00:49:48.184
June.  We were certainly the 
recipients of a lot of 

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:50.185
generosity.

00:49:54.035 --> 00:49:56.035
People like Juan Felipe

00:50:00.421 --> 00:50:02.421
lent us their time and wisdom 
undeservedly.

00:50:04.488 --> 00:50:05.907
Thanks to the hard work and 
staff, we experienced 

00:50:05.908 --> 00:50:08.160
affirmation and received a 
platform to share poetry with 

00:50:08.161 --> 00:50:11.243
our peers.  We were given the 
space to write bravely and delve

00:50:11.244 --> 00:50:13.244
deeply into poetry.

00:50:18.402 --> 00:50:20.853
This year isn't about the 
amazing gift each poet here has 

00:50:20.854 --> 00:50:23.295
been given, don't get me wrong, 
we should say thank you often, 

00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:31.128
and sincerely.  This program is 
the culmination of many people's

00:50:31.129 --> 00:50:33.129
vision and hard work.

00:50:35.005 --> 00:50:36.627
Virginia, Hannah, Debra, Olivia 
and all the others who helped, 

00:50:36.628 --> 00:50:38.628
we thank you from the bottom of 
our hearts. 

00:50:40.495 --> 00:50:42.759
In eighth grade, my English 
teacher asked our class to write

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.760
essays, not 

00:50:46.005 --> 00:50:48.685
about the best gift we got over 
winter break, but instead, about

00:50:48.686 --> 00:50:51.567
the best gift we gave.  It 
shifted our perspective to 

00:50:53.628 --> 00:50:55.659
generosity and thoughtfulness 
and it was a lesson that stayed 

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.696
with me.  I share this with you 
because at its 

00:51:01.574 --> 00:51:04.860
heart, this is the magic of the 
national poets program.  They 

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:06.861
help us and we turn around to 
help others.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.771
I know the class of 2018 will 
change their communities, 

00:51:10.772 --> 00:51:14.031
amplify the voices too often 
left unheard.  Make more room at

00:51:14.032 --> 00:51:16.032
the table for new and bright 
poets.

00:51:17.951 --> 00:51:20.627
I know this because each of you 
is an astounding writer and 

00:51:20.628 --> 00:51:23.266
ambassador to your craft.  I 
also know this because I've seen

00:51:23.267 --> 00:51:25.267
the 

00:51:26.315 --> 00:51:28.315
same generosity in my friends.

00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:32.417
Camila spent time helping teach 
poetry therapy to immigrant 

00:51:32.418 --> 00:51:37.097
advocates and attorneys and 
connected with refugees from 

00:51:37.098 --> 00:51:39.098
Somalia and the Congo.  Juliet 
collaborated with doctors and 

00:51:40.989 --> 00:51:42.989
patients, using language to hear
emotional trauma in hospitals.

00:51:46.892 --> 00:51:49.549
Kimsale spent time with native 
students at the Sherman Indian 

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:53.830
boardk school discussing 
identity and the notion of home 

00:51:53.831 --> 00:51:56.940
and published a collection of 
their writings.  Ben was poet 

00:51:56.941 --> 00:51:59.786
and residence for summer school,
giving academic enrichment to 

00:52:01.008 --> 00:52:02.841
local Minneapolis middle 
schoolers.  They all 

00:52:02.842 --> 00:52:06.730
accomplished wonderful things, I
hope you'll take inspiration and

00:52:06.731 --> 00:52:08.731
guidance from them as you search
for your own path forward.  

00:52:10.398 --> 00:52:12.634
Before we go, the class of 2017 
wanted to give a few pieces of 

00:52:12.635 --> 00:52:14.464
advice.  Juliet says you should 
learn from everyone you meet and

00:52:14.465 --> 00:52:16.465
I agree.

00:52:20.167 --> 00:52:21.795
Ben urges you to be unafraid, to
seize the opportunity you worked

00:52:21.796 --> 00:52:23.796
so hard for.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.699
We also recommend you wear 
powder foundation in TV 

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.700
interviews.  Send thank you 
notes early.

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:34.690
Above all though, take a lesson 
from Juan Felipe who spent the 

00:52:34.691 --> 00:52:39.001
last 15 minutes of our class 
together showing us how to fold 

00:52:39.002 --> 00:52:41.002
Starbucks bags into makeshift 
poetry booklets.

00:52:45.748 --> 00:52:47.748
He was showing us how to make 
room for poetry.

00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:55.721
You're here because you earned 
it.

00:52:57.129 --> 00:52:57.945
We're standing beside you and we
can't wait to see what you'll 

00:52:57.946 --> 00:52:59.946
do.  Thank you.

00:53:00.948 --> 00:53:02.948
[applause] 

00:53:10.213 --> 00:53:12.213
SPEAKER: Can we have another 
round of applause, please?

00:53:20.604 --> 00:53:22.604
[applause] 

00:53:24.718 --> 00:53:27.965
SPEAKER: I'm the program's 
manager at the poetry and 

00:53:27.966 --> 00:53:31.013
literature center.  The task 
falls on me to close out these 

00:53:31.014 --> 00:53:34.289
beautiful festivities.  Before I
do, I want to see if we can play

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:38.160
this video.  I'm told we may 
have some luck.  Poetry keeps us

00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:40.161
pliable, so... we'll try again.

00:53:49.337 --> 00:53:51.337
[laughter] 

00:54:06.908 --> 00:54:08.908
[Music].

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:15.283
SPEAKER: I'm delighted to 
congratulate you on having been 

00:54:15.284 --> 00:54:18.341
selected as this year's national
student poets.  It speaks to the

00:54:18.342 --> 00:54:22.029
commitment that you've already 
demonstrated to poetry as an art

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.030
form and as a way of life.

00:54:29.347 --> 00:54:31.347
As I see it, poems teach us new 
ways of looking at the world.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:36.120
They give us new terms for 
describing the many active and 

00:54:36.121 --> 00:54:41.433
powerful feelings that we live 
with.  And they also allow us to

00:54:41.434 --> 00:54:43.717
listen closely to other people's
voices and their stories.

00:54:46.779 --> 00:54:50.225
I think all of that is 
indispensable to a full life.  

00:54:50.226 --> 00:54:51.868
I'm thrilled that over the next 
year, you will be able to go 

00:54:51.869 --> 00:54:56.386
into your community, doing this 
with other people, talking about

00:54:56.387 --> 00:54:58.387
why poetry matters to you.

00:54:59.441 --> 00:55:01.268
That's what I've been doing over
the last year as poet laureate 

00:55:01.269 --> 00:55:03.723
and it's been one of the most 
rewarding acts of my life as an 

00:55:03.724 --> 00:55:05.724
artist and a person.

00:55:09.024 --> 00:55:10.905
To go into communities with 
people I don't know, people I 

00:55:10.906 --> 00:55:12.906
may never see again 

00:55:14.779 --> 00:55:15.996
and feel like we actually have 
something meaningful to say to 

00:55:15.997 --> 00:55:19.661
one another.  Through the 
vehicle of poetry.  I'm sorry 

00:55:19.662 --> 00:55:21.662
I'm not there with you 

00:55:22.913 --> 00:55:24.556
tonight, I'm actually in Alaska,
talking poetry with new friends,

00:55:24.557 --> 00:55:25.776
but I'm excited to join you 
tomorrow and celebrate your 

00:55:25.777 --> 00:55:31.414
accomplishments.  [Music].
[applause] 

00:55:36.777 --> 00:55:40.638
SPEAKER: Thanks for your 
patients, I'm glad you guys got 

00:55:40.639 --> 00:55:42.639
to hear her special words.

00:55:43.897 --> 00:55:45.897
Before I close things out, I 
want to 

00:55:52.862 --> 00:55:54.862
thank our partners for The 
Alliance of 

00:55:56.955 --> 00:55:58.983
Poets and Writers and also 
Valerie June.  Before I send you

00:55:58.984 --> 00:56:01.228
off to celebrate, I want to 
remind you that the National 

00:56:03.263 --> 00:56:05.291
Book Festival is this weekend 
and student poets will be 

00:56:05.292 --> 00:56:08.391
performing at the festival twice
on the expo floor.  Come make 

00:56:08.392 --> 00:56:11.034
sure to check them out.  Also, 
the full day is lots of fabulous

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.240
programming.

00:56:14.302 --> 00:56:16.302
Make sure you check that out.  

00:56:19.397 --> 00:56:21.226
Very last thing there, are 
surveys on your chairs.  It 

00:56:21.227 --> 00:56:23.227
helps us at the library.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.894
That's all, please go out, 
enjoy, congratulate our poets
