that's when you type a search term we
 

00:25:58.379 --> 00:26:00.889
that's when you type a search term we
suggest all the related search terms so

00:26:00.889 --> 00:26:00.899
suggest all the related search terms so
 

00:26:00.899 --> 00:26:03.009
suggest all the related search terms so
for example if you type something like

low so if you build a better at widget

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440
low so if you build a better at widget

a better widget and then we all attract
more people so how do we develop the

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.210
more people so how do we develop the

developed higher quality Chinese search

00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419
developed higher quality Chinese search
 

00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:44.870
developed higher quality Chinese search
and these are third part estimates that

and these are third part estimates that
 

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.090
and these are third part estimates that
show we have better search results than

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100
show we have better search results than
 

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.460

Chinese languages being hard there's a
 

00:32:58.139 --> 00:32:59.539
Chinese languages being hard there's a
tiny bit of truth in that

00:32:59.539 --> 00:32:59.549
tiny bit of truth in that
 

00:32:59.549 --> 00:33:01.580
tiny bit of truth in that
but not not a whole lot I'll just give

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:01.590
but not not a whole lot I'll just give
 

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.200
but not not a whole lot I'll just give
you one example that we have to do some

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.210
you one example that we have to do some
 

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:06.200
you one example that we have to do some
work in and that's a segmentation so for

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:06.210
work in and that's a segmentation so for
 

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.820
work in and that's a segmentation so for
example if I were to type the following

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:07.830

engine one of the big issues you might

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500
engine one of the big issues you might
 

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.169
engine one of the big issues you might
notice is that there's no white space

00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179
notice is that there's no white space
 

00:33:15.179 --> 00:33:17.690
notice is that there's no white space
and that's kind of like being able to do

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:17.700
and that's kind of like being able to do
 

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.480
and that's kind of like being able to do
this to be able to parse or search this

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:20.490
this to be able to parse or search this
 

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.330
this to be able to parse or search this
and that seems difficult so your

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340
and that seems difficult so your
 

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.070
and that seems difficult so your
intuition might be hey just cut it up

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080
intuition might be hey just cut it up
 

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.169
intuition might be hey just cut it up
you know Carnegie Mellon University that

00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:27.179
you know Carnegie Mellon University that
 

00:33:27.179 --> 00:33:29.180
you know Carnegie Mellon University that
seems like Oh like one linguistic unit

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:29.190
seems like Oh like one linguistic unit
 

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.639
seems like Oh like one linguistic unit
but it's not that simple if you cut it

00:33:31.639 --> 00:33:31.649
but it's not that simple if you cut it
 

00:33:31.649 --> 00:33:34.730
but it's not that simple if you cut it
up if you just cut it up according to

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740
up if you just cut it up according to
 

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.240
up if you just cut it up according to
linguistic units then you Carnegie

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.250
linguistic units then you Carnegie
 

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.889
linguistic units then you Carnegie
Mellon University is one unit and you

00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899
Mellon University is one unit and you
 

00:33:39.899 --> 00:33:41.629
Mellon University is one unit and you
search for Carnegie Mellon you might not

00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639
search for Carnegie Mellon you might not
 

00:33:41.639 --> 00:33:43.549

to do to get every part information to
 

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.530
to do to get every part information to
be searchable so now that helps us build

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:41.540

everybody knows each of the vertical
 

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.950
everybody knows each of the vertical
search engines so we have a global

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960
search engines so we have a global
 

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.990
search engines so we have a global
initiative called Universal Search that

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000
initiative called Universal Search that
 

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.240
initiative called Universal Search that
says hey all of those vertical results

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:55.250
says hey all of those vertical results
 

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:57.460
says hey all of those vertical results
they ought to be aggregated into one

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:57.470
they ought to be aggregated into one
 

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:00.070
they ought to be aggregated into one
result so if you go to one search box

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:00.080
result so if you go to one search box
 

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.560
result so if you go to one search box
that should get you anything so

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:02.570
that should get you anything so
 

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.120
that should get you anything so
Universal Search really means in the

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:04.130
Universal Search really means in the
 

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.850
Universal Search really means in the
past is one search box from one index

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:06.860
past is one search box from one index
 

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.130
past is one search box from one index
but today people are doing more and more

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:09.140
but today people are doing more and more

vertical searches they might be done

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:11.060
vertical searches they might be done

search and so on because they tend to be

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200
search and so on because they tend to be
 

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.960
search and so on because they tend to be
more accurate than the generic search

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:16.970
more accurate than the generic search
 

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.730
