00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.420
This episode was proudly
made possible by Subaru.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.768
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:23.360
So, there's a term
that I really like

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.725
called the adrenaline hack.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.570
And that's this
idea that we have

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.030
co-opted biological systems--
in this case, alarm systems--

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.690
and then used them
towards cultural ends.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.240
So for example, we
get an adrenaline rush

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.050
when our over-active amygdala
responds to a perceived danger

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.370
and has to decide whether to
fight, neutralize, or flight

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.650
and run away to survive.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.240
It's a biological alarm system
inducing anxiety and fear

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.960
so that we get out of
a dangerous situation.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.860
But the fact that, as
modern cultural beings

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.410
now that inhabit
landscapes of imagination,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.250
we've created systems,
rhetorical technologies that

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.470
co-opt these biological
alarm systems

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.070
and place them in safe contexts
so that we can experience

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.950
our bio-chemical signature
or the surging multiplicity

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.700
of emotions to which we are
privy to in a safe setting.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.214
For example, watching
a scary movie,

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:23.690
going on a roller
coaster ride, skydiving.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.225
Your brain is
telling you, danger.

00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:28.030
The adrenaline rush is
the one of impending doom

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.890
and yet, the fact that you know
that you're in a safe space,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.140
allows you, on a mental
level, to be aware

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.205
that you're not going to die
and therefore enjoy the wonder

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:38.550
and amazement and the
hardly bearable ecstasy

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.360
of direct energy exploding
from your nerve endings,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.580
as Timothy Leary would say.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.140
So think about that the next
time you skydive, or you're

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.160
at a scary movie, and
you're like, all right,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.288
let me experience
the full spectrum

00:01:50.288 --> 00:01:52.250
of human emotion
in a safe setting.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.348
It's unbelievable.

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:55.560
And it's the adrenaline
hack and it's

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.320
what makes us such
creative beings.
