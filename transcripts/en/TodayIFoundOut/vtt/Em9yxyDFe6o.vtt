00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.690
The practice of jus primae noctis (“right
of the first night”) is, in simplest terms,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.930
the right of the local noble to deflower local
peasant brides on their wedding night before

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.430
their newlywed husbands.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.261
Precedence for this practice supposedly goes
back for many thousands of years, with the

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:28.989
first reference of something like it going
all the way back to the Epic of Gilgamesh

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.750
from over four thousand years ago.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.800
This practiced (apparently) reached its crescendo
during the Middle Ages in Europe, and today

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.800
is popularly depicted in Hollywood in such
films as Braveheart.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520
But did it really ever happen?

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.910
Numerous historians have studied the subject
and the result is that it turns out there

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.300
is no solid evidence of this practice happening
in reality at all.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.360
Not a single well documented incident recorded,
nor a single victim’s name passed down.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.760
It could be argued that women in these periods,
in general, would not be considered noteworthy,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.890
especially peasant women, but with a practice
spanning (supposedly) thousands of years,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.560
and the presumable rage it would induce in
the peasant populace, not to mention occasional

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.950
bastard offspring and perhaps a boatload of
secret weddings to avoid the issue, odds are

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.770
at least a few documented cases would manage
to make it down through posterity.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.039
Or even just a record of the law in some court
case, as there are such records of numerous

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.039
other laws.

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.509
But any such evidence simply doesn’t exist
outside of fictional works or, for instance,

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.939
cases where people were trying to rally the
peasant class against their lords using the

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.409
supposedly former practice of jus primae noctis
to whip the mob up.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.740
In fact, the very first mention of this in
the Epic of Gilgamesh, we see the hero Enkidu,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.939
who was sent by the gods to stop Gilgamesh
after the people cried out to the gods for

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.070
aid, physically blocking a wedding place to
challenge Gilgamesh over this appalling abuse

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.070
of power.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.829
In another early account (in the 5th century
BC), Heraclides Ponticus describes how the

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.630
king of the Island of Cephalonia instituted
this practice.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.999
Once again, the commoners weren’t pleased
and one man went ahead and dressed himself

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.259
as a bride and subsequently murdered the king
when the monarch tried to exercise his lordly

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.259
right.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.380
For his efforts, the cross-dressing man was
made the new king by the overjoyed masses.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.920
There’s also the matter of disease to consider.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.880
While these girls were all (supposedly) virgins
on their wedding day, that didn’t mean they

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.720
were free from diseases that frequently devastated
life through most of history.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.380
And, let’s face it, these lords weren’t
just sleeping with these women, but many others

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.380
to boot.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.170
If the lords were truly sleeping with many
or all of these women in their little fiefdoms,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.310
beyond spreading diseases to every corner
of their lands, jus primae noctis would have

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.670
been a deadly law for a lord of a fiefdom
of any real size, assuming he chose to enforce

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.670
it.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.780
So it should come as no surprise then, that
while it’s possible there exists a few rulers

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.290
in history who actually tried something like
this at some point, as mentioned, most historians

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.350
think the vast majority of accounts are pure
fiction or exaggeration.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.610
For instance, Louis Veuillot writing in France
during the 19th century stated: “Nothing,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.420
absolutely nothing, in the archives of Justice
authorizes us to say that our forefathers

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.870
ever made a crime into a law.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.070
If we search the evidence and the literature
we find the same silence everywhere.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.590
The Middle Ages had never heard of the droit
du seigneur [aka jus primae noctis].”

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.650
Other European scholars shared Veuillot’s
opinion.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.030
Germany’s Karl Schmidt penned a thorough
treatise on jus primae noctis in 1881, and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.960
came to the conclusion that is was “a learned
superstition.”

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.710
Over and over again historians from then to
now have tried to find hard evidence of this

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.210
occurring and come up empty, despite the numerous
accounts, sometimes explicitly fictional and

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.600
other times thought to be, throughout written
history in nearly every major culture.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.750
For instance, famed philosopher Hector Boece
in the 16th century described this practice

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.570
perfectly during the reign of the Scottish
king Evenus III and claimed the practice went

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.650
on for centuries.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.740
It turns out, though, no such king ever existed
and much of Boece’s accounts concerning

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.430
many of the legendary kings of Scotland are
thought to be pure fiction.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.120
Similar fictional trends are seen elsewhere
concerning this supposed law.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.510
Back to Europe and the middle ages, what is
true is that in many feudal societies, peasants

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.410
were required to get permission from their
lord to marry.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.410
This requirement was called the culagium.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.319
This often involved payment of a fee to be
granted such permission (some claim this law

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.040
replaced jus primae noctis, but while there
is hard evidence of culagium, not so much

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.340
with jus primae noctis, as mentioned).

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.340
Besides an extra source of revenue, another
purpose of the culagium was the nobles safeguarding

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.810
their investment by making sure they didn’t
lose their valuable serfs to a neighboring

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.010
lord for nothing.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.510
In essence, jus primae noctis in some cases
functioned as a tax due when a serf’s daughter

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.650
married a man not on the lord’s estate.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.210
By requiring the tax, it also made it easier
to track such movements in populace, as well

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.150
as perhaps deny it when prudent.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.080
In addition, in some areas the Church also
demanded payment of a fee to get the couple

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.930
out of a three day waiting period before consummating
their union.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.090
(One can only imagine how they tracked this.)

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.760
During that three day waiting period, the
betrothed were supposed to be deep in prayer

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.380
to prepare themselves fully for their physical
(and spiritual) union.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.130
Of course, payoff your local clergy and you
could go forth with a clear conscience.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.850
In the end, let’s face it, life was brutal
for peasants, and especially peasant women,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.850
in this era.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.880
When they weren’t being wiped out by some
pandemic, humiliation and subjugation were

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.650
just accepted facts of life for those born
into the lower social orders.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.990
Jus primae noctis or not, female serfs were
at the mercy of their lords (and others),

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.630
who really didn’t need an excuse, a law,
or a wedding to rape or assault the serfs

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.990
inhabiting their land.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.570
The peasant class didn’t appreciate this
(or many other such abuses) one bit, and so

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.620
it’s no surprise that they would rally around
a concept like jus primae noctis during various

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.760
uprisings and instances of political discourse.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.210
In slightly more modern times, this was, for
instance, a favorite weapon against nobility

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.150
and clergy used by the great enlightenment
thinker Voltaire.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.300
(Voltaire also, incidentally, made his fortune
by helping to rig the lottery.)

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.760
As J.Q.C.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.090
Mackrell states in his book, Attack on Feudalism
in the 18th Century France, “the Philosophes

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.169
used the Droit [jus primae noctis] as a ploy
to exaggerate the specter of oppressed Serfs.

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.950
(For them) no charge was too absurd…”

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.085
It should be noted here that at this time
in France it was also said that lords used

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:04.085
to claim the right of droit de prélassement
(right of lounging), a right of a lord to

00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:08.350
use one of his subject’s entrails, freshly
ripped from the body, to warm the noble’s

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.350
feet…

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.510
No charge too absurd indeed.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.980
Despite most movie fans connecting the nickname
“Braveheart” with William Wallace because

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.210
of the award winning film with Mel Gibson
(1995), in real life the specific nickname

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.920
actually belonged to one of the semi-bad guys
depicted in the film- Robert the Bruce.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.139
While Robert (then the Earl of Carrick) really
did switch sides several times during the

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.840
Wars of Scottish Independence, there is no
record of him betraying Wallace and the Battle

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.490
of Bannockburn wasn’t waged spontaneously
as it seemed in the movie.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.990
He had been battling the English for nearly
a decade up to that point.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:07:36.870
Robert ultimately became the King of Scots
from 1306 and held that title until his death

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.009
in 1329.
