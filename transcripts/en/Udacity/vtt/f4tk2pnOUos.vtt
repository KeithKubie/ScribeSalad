00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to Unit 5. The main topic for Unit 5 is cryptographic protocols.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're going to look at ways to use the things that we've seen in the previous 4 units

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to solve problems.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So we'll be using symmetric encryption, we'll be using cryptographic hash functions,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and we'll be using asymmetric encryption to solve problems.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And the main problem we're going to solve is how to authenticate

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
between a client and a server.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Any time we talk about cryptographic protocols, we have to think about what our threat model is.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If we want to argue that a protocol is secure, we need to understand the threat model,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which means knowing the capabilities of the adversary.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In order to argue the protocol is secure, we need to argue that an adversary

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
with only those capabilities will not be able to break the protocol.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So what are the kinds of things we need to assume?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The first main assumption is that the adversary has limited computational power.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And that generally means that we're assuming that our encryption primitives work

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and the attacker who intercepts a message encrypted with some key k

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is not able to decrypt it unless they know k

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
or have some other advantage for decrypting that message.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We also assume that hash functions have the properties they should--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that it's preimage resistant,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
so an adversary who has the hash of x cannot figure out what x was,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and that they also have strong collision resistance--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that an adversary can't find 2 values that hash to the same output.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We might also make assumptions about what the attacker can do to the network.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If the attacker is passive, that would mean that they can only eavesdrop.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
They can listen in on messages on the network, but they can't modify them

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and they can't inject their own messages into the network.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
A more powerful adversary would be an active attacker.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
An active attacker controls the network.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They can modify data and messages. They can replay messages.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That means they can record messages on the network

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then at some later time replay a message that they heard previously.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They can also do attacks like we saw against Diffie-Hellman

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
where they act as a middleman intercepting traffic between 2 parties

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and replacing it with their own traffic.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So let's have a quiz to see if you understand threat models.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Which of these threat models would be a good model for an adversary

00:02:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
who controls a router on the Internet?
