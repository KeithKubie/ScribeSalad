00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.080
Mr. T with no hair and a baby giving the peace sign

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.620
in the womb.
It's episode of 39 IMG!

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.180
When tweety bird gets

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.980
old, you're gonna have this.
And it's amazing how little

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.430
information we need to see familiar objects.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.439
It's also amazing than an iPhone can fall

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.420
13,500 feet from a sky diver's pocket

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.369
and still receive phone calls.
Well, this looks safe.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.940
Oh.
And this looks sad.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.360
Oh. This looks cool. Ohhhh.
This rock

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.809
is sad and so is food like this pear.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.180
I mean, how could you eat such sad food?
Try a hot dog instead.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.539
No, no, no. A hot dog, like really hot.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.410
Pepperoni sweater hot.
Prefer your dog to be a mouse pad?

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.890
Well, you might also prefer your rock paper
scissors to be more complex.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.270
Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is popular,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.729
but there's also Pirate Zombie Monkey
Ninja Robot or

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.289
this game which uses 15 different

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.800
items.
And don't worry, there's also RPS25.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.140
Each item has an equal chance of winning

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.679
and yes, there are explanations for each.
If remembering 25 items is too much,

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.860
don't worry, there is a flash game version.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.349
Here's a Middle Earth Map dress and is
that Steve Buscemi on your dress or are

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.130
you just really saggy to see me?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.789
Sorry if that came across like a pickup line.
It's just

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.420
I mustache you a question.
Can eyebrows

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.660
your computer?
Alright, look, no more puns. At least

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.789
not until after the soap opera.
BuzzFeed showcased some

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.910
unnecessary signs.
"Keep off the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.970
grass" and yeah, no one has to tell me that.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.599
So instead, here are some famous people
eating ice cream.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.399
Enjoy.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.420
Let's get charty.
I love these two

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.340
huge charts.
One is all about the atom, the nucleus,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.690
the distances electrons are away from it, fission, fusion.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.210
It's great. And here's one from National
Geographic that puts our universe

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.160
in perspective.
This graph distributes rage faces

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.210
according to happy, sad and degree of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.690
energy. Now, you'll never use the wrong one.
And these maps show the most popular

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.320
first

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.520
names by country.
The greasy stain on this receipt has a man's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.950
face in it. And these chairs look like they're sinking.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.520
Their bottom halves have been painted
as a projection like shadows,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.370
so that from the right angle
they come together. This

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.150
is the Firefox logo and this

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.660
is V838 Monocerotis, possibly

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.070
the largest star known to man.
I leave you

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.640
with 241543903.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.170
