1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,130
All right. Hey, what's going on everybody?

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:05,880
It's bill bar and it's time for the
Thursday afternoon, just before Friday.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:10,140
Monday morning podcast ad.
I'm just checking in on you.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,200
I'm just checking in on your
week here and usually, you know,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,580
what do I usually do? I usually sit here
and my fucking pajamas like fucking,

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,230
you know, give you a little half hour
fucking bullshit to try. But it's payday,

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,520
right?
You don't need a full show.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,820
You have probably half in the bag and
a fucking El Torito at this point.

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:28,890
If you listen to it,
you shouldn't be driving.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,880
But every once in awhile I do have
a guest. I do have a guest in today.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,060
We have the great Joe Rogan.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,490
Hey fucking uh,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,520
grand national champion at Tae Kwan
Doe sitcoms star fucking reality show a

14
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,610
commentator right across the board.
Al Conner.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,290
Wild boar hunter.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,650
I don't know what a fucking conspiracy
theory. Fucking whatever you want.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,330
This guy is his own fucking entity.
Andy, as a brand new killer,

18
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:04,410
special on Netflix entitled triggered,
please welcome Joe Rogan.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,370
Thanks Bill Burns going on. Long time
coming, dude. I know. Long time coming.

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,420
I love your show. I have on mine a bunch
of times, so I know to be on yours,

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,430
but you're a big like interview guy on,

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,300
I'm like a fucking lunatic who just sits
in the corner of his house and every

23
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:22,380
once in awhile my wife walks by and I
love the style that you do cause it's very

24
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,250
unique.
You know,

25
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,070
I've done a couple like that where
answer questions and stuff like that,

26
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,240
but it's a very unique style of,
you know,

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,820
I think it lends itself really well to
stand up and to developing bits too.

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,920
I just didn't want to deal
with having to like book.

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,460
Like you'll find you're simply okay,
come down to my studio. Perfect.

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,800
You know what I mean?
But like I just didn't want it.

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,340
I saw what other people were going
through. Like, oh, I got an audition,

32
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,110
can we make it four o'clock?
And I was just like,

33
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:50,580
I don't want to fucking deal
with that stuff. But, um,
um, but when I, if you know,

34
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:54,510
if everyone can be a guest like yourself,
can I start with the elk thing? Yeah.

35
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,160
Because I am fascinated with hunting.
I think it's bad ass.

36
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,970
I think everybody should know how to
do it. And in, I'm not one of the,

37
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:04,080
I am an animal lover,

38
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:08,130
but I'm not going to be that hypocritical
one that fucking eat chickens that had

39
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,190
their fucking beaks clipped off
and they got the roided out.

40
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,760
Mark McGuire breastplate that
tipping over in the coops,

41
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,900
all that shit that you see. And
then I'm going to be like, oh,

42
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,700
could you shoot a fucking pheasant or
whatever the hell you're shooting out

43
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:25,590
there. But um, I retweeted a
picture of you got this. What is it?

44
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,750
You said it was a 12 point
or why do you say six?

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,630
[inaudible] six by six they
call it a straight six L

46
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,940
it's a six by six or seven meets big
elk. That was the, I've shot three hours.

47
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,470
That's the biggest one by far. Then one
was monsters was huge. So what is the, uh,

48
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,240
this is the thing that always
fascinates me about hunting shows is the

49
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:49,530
nervousness and the whispering before you
take the shot though, it's like, okay,

50
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:54,090
there it is. Yeah, just relax. Can
exhale and just like if you miss,

51
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,240
I mean it's the fucking thing going to
come running at, you know, it seems like,

52
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,040
cause it does. I am not to Spook
it because you have to have it

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,920
close enough for you to shoot it.
Depending upon how you're shooting it.

54
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,130
If you shouldn't be with a bow and Arrow,
you've got to be real close.

55
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,690
You've got to be inside of 60 yards.
Most times bad ass.

56
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,120
I shot one with the bow and arrow.
That one out there,

57
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:14,440
the big one I shot with a rifle dude,
a bow and arrow. That's, that's to me,

58
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:19,150
that's the Shit I saw Ted Nugent.
He shot a fucking bear, you know,

59
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,820
which I could never do.
I fucking love bears this certain animals.

60
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:24,280
But you know what I mean? Bears
are interesting. I've, I've,

61
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,880
I've shot bears you showed up there,
so I'll get you some bare sausage.

62
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,420
I can't even bear, I've shot three bears
with, I can't eat it back. They're good.

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,020
And I knew about shares.
I bet you like delicious.

64
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,010
You're like a fucking sirloin.
Well, we, uh, a filet Mignon,

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,050
you got like no women met
on tender and juicy. Um,

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,110
I've always felt that about you,
Joe. Thank you. We think of bears,

67
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,100
I think very incorrectly because with the,

68
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,510
you know what the word
a anthropomorphization
means when you put human

69
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,140
characteristics and animals like
Yogi bear and shit like that.

70
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,160
And we make them ride a
bicycle at the circus.

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,830
We have this idea that
bears are these cute things.

72
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,470
But where my friend lives
in Alberta where I hunt,

73
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,080
they literally have to shoot them
because they don't have any predators.

74
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,020
So if bears don't have any predators and
they just breed and they keep reading

75
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,110
and then they decimate the Moose
population, the elk population,

76
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,620
and they cannibalize each other.
That's the thing that most people,

77
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,190
they kind of handle it in house sort of,
but they eat babies.

78
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,230
That's what they do most of the time.
He babies,

79
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:22,510
they eat their own babies at sliders,

80
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,710
black bear sliders. Well, why wouldn't
you? Well, it's, it's brutal to see,

81
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,371
you know,
we've,

82
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:35,371
we've stumbled across pause and stuff
from a cubs with a male bores them.

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,390
That's what the ones that you should go
out when you just find a baby bear paw

84
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,380
in the woods. I mean a party,
his soul has to just fucking,

85
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,220
it's got to die or cry out. Like I,
that's something I never want to see.

86
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,810
It's very strange. I guess I do have to
admit though that uh, bear hunting's not,

87
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,120
I don't like it as much
as hunting other animals.

88
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,930
If I had to choose like what animal's
tongue, you can eat bear by the way.

89
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,290
And that's the only things that I
hunt is what I eat. Black bear. Uh,

90
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,300
you can eat grizzly bear
but they don't taste good.

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,470
Most of the reason for that because
grizzly bears mostly eaten meat.

92
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,330
They eat a few berries.

93
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,550
If you can find a grizzly bear
that was just eating berries,

94
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,280
it would probably taste delicious.
They literally taste like what they eat.

95
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,100
Like hunters try to go after bears,
eat berries,

96
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,730
like black bears in particular in
the fall they'll eat blueberries.

97
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,550
They called him blueberry bears.
Cause like as you're opening them up,

98
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,940
their fat is like a purple color
and it tastes like blueberries.

99
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:29,920
And apparently it's the most
delicious meat in the world.

100
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,400
So without them realizing that they're
already marinating themselves. Exactly.

101
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,070
You guys leave show cells
seasoning themselves.

102
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,170
But my all time favorite animals are elk.
That's the best. They taste the best.

103
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,210
The best for you. And gave
me that, that elk meat, uh,

104
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,940
whatever. The last time I was on here and
I made a chili out of it and then the,

105
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,180
if the fucking elk burgers,
it's a little dry.

106
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,720
Somebody gave me a hint to put a
little bit of butter in there to Kinda,

107
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,690
you know.
Yes.

108
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,960
You needed something like an egg or sell
to make it stick together a little bit.

109
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,510
You don't want it to cook it too much
cause it's super lean. There's no fan. No.

110
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,110
I put a piece of Swiss cheese and
some pursuit on top of fucking insane.

111
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,340
Feel good when you eat it too.
It's a powerful food.

112
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:14,720
There's a lot of energy in those. There's
like, there's so much nutrients in elk.

113
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,420
It's like way more protein dense,
way more nutrient dense,

114
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,120
but anything kind of like the
creek because they're wild.

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,660
I know like the human like
footprint as they said, you know,

116
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:26,440
acid rain and all the fucking horseshit
and we do, but at least it's, it's,

117
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,600
I would like to think it's kind of
away from the Gmos and all that.

118
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,680
It's a type of stuff can get.
So it's who knows what Gmos do to you,

119
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,190
but like the fresh shit
tastes better though. It does
taste. Does it taste better?

120
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,250
I mean Gmos, everything's,
gee, that's a weird word.

121
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,260
Like if you talk to real
scientists about Gmos,

122
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,260
most of the time when you talk about Gmos,

123
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,380
we're talking to hippies and like yo man,
you gotta to stay away from Gmos.

124
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,510
You mentioned ethically modified.
It's giving us cancer.

125
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,690
It's terrible for the water.
But real GMOs is almost everything we eat.

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,920
Every tomato you eat is
genetically modified.

127
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,480
They've all been all alternate Koran.

128
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,750
We kind of were kind of like
Guinea pigs to see like what,

129
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,840
what's going to happen sort of.
But most of it is just splicing.

130
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,590
Like I just found this out recently,
you know when you buy pistachios,

131
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:11,200
there's a place up in northern California
with CIOs a stash. It goes either way.

132
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,720
She's not shoes. Tony, who you talking
to? [inaudible] did that. Thank you. Stop.

133
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,680
She has talent shows since
you need some pistachio.

134
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,790
I like it with the tea shelled. Of
course. I don't Sheldon. I so I,

135
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,840
I buy shelled pistachios and I feel like
I'm cheating because I just take big

136
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:29,720
handfuls of them and shoving my
fat face. You can't do that. Yeah.

137
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,780
There's a reason why there's a
shell on it because if you don't,

138
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:35,690
you're gonna need a thousand of
them. I buy them in these big, uh,

139
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,730
like a two pound boxes and I just pour
my hands on. I eat them. The good,

140
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,490
good for you too. It's kind of guilt
free, but you feel like you're cheating.

141
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:46,950
Like you don't have to crack them.
I know I stared you off course.

142
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,020
So you were still talking to the native
when they grow these pistachios is

143
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,200
pistachio trees. The pistachio
bushes are not a big strong tree.

144
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,320
So they graft the limbs of the pistachio
tree onto like an avocado tree,

145
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,370
a thicker, stronger tree and they'd
grow pistachios on and avocado free.

146
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,640
Like what the fuck? But Yo, how
are we playing God that, oh,

147
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,210
we're playing God by driving cars too,
but playing God by flying planes.

148
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,080
That shit is like, first of all, I
thought pistachios came from the ground.

149
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,270
I thought penis were in the ground.
Peanuts,

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,800
I think peanuts are in the ground is
a pistachio. Know George W was the,

151
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,440
Jimmy Carter was a peanut farmer.
How did he do it? She didn't ask him.

152
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,730
I think it was in the ground.
I don't know. Fucking upset.

153
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,570
That's why I want a hunt.
Carrots are in the ground and OCR worms,

154
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,010
they're in the ground. Do you grow? And
he says, I was trying to recover it.

155
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:40,070
That we don't notice it in the ground.
Birds are in this guy dirt.

156
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,700
Um, do I know? I mean my, my, my,

157
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,330
the guy who cuts the grass fucking
put him on. So I got tomatoes,

158
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:54,710
I got lemons and limes. But all that
did was just make me fucking booze more.

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,190
Cause I'm just,
I get totally

160
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,330
got into Kipp Tequila.

161
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,060
It's like there's only so much
guacamole you can eat and you just like,

162
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,150
what the fuck else can I do with this
shit? Um, so I kinda got into Tequila.

163
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,760
It's less of a hangover and do,

164
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,320
and I'm telling you get one of those
big square ice cubes are really nice to

165
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:11,420
keep just like a patrol in silver.

166
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,400
He put that in there and then you go
pick a fucking lime off. I'm telling you,

167
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:19,260
it's why it's why I live out here.
It's not the show Biz. It's the booze.

168
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,570
Well, you don't really have to
live out here anymore. Right.

169
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,520
And especially like your podcast, the
way you do your podcast, you just rant.

170
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,670
Like you could do that fucking thing
and you do do it anyway. But I also, uh,

171
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,640
you know, my wife's in the business
too, so she does acting. She just,

172
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,150
she's doing a voiceover today and uh,
so she doesn't have that luxury.

173
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:39,540
And then also, you know, um, she would go,

174
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,140
she would go crazy if,
if I, if I, you know,

175
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,480
if I just moved to like the middle of
fucking now my saying and lived in the

176
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:48,060
middle of fucking nowhere, but
I do, when I go on the road,

177
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:49,650
I always have that urge.

178
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,910
Like when I go to a place and I just
started thinking about, hey man,

179
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,610
these guys riding around motorcycles,
no helmets on, and it's just like this,

180
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,200
that at lake water here they
got, they got, they got that.

181
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,730
It's very lush land. Like living
out here is, is a, it's terrifying.

182
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,030
It's terrifying. Like what, what
happened to the water in silver link?

183
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:13,090
Where did they take that? They closed
several Lincoln actual lake at one point.

184
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,710
Yeah, it was manmade, but the water's all
gone now. They're going to develop it in,

185
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,390
yeah. They said they put it under ground.
They didn't really say where. It's just,

186
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,070
it's just gone. Yeah. To when I fly,

187
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,300
let's say it's one of the things I fucker
would look down and you go with dodger

188
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:26,370
stadium and then you start coming.

189
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:29,410
Then you see silver lake and I'm looking
down like where'd that parking lot with

190
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,520
the big top come from? And the guy
was like, oh, that was silver guy.

191
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,340
They drained the water. I don't know,
they said they put it under ground.

192
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,700
It's all like vague through,
do you know when I was in,

193
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,900
I was in Nashville this past weekend and
I was sitting there watching the news

194
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:46,470
during the day and they
just go like, Oh, and folks,

195
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:51,210
if you're in the downtown area and you
see the police doing something that seems

196
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:55,230
a little disturbing. Ah, tell
worry. It's just an exercise.

197
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,740
And then they continued on and it was
just like, you didn't do any followup.

198
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,020
Like there's no more information with an
exercise. What are they practicing for?

199
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,170
That whatever they're doing is,
is like scary.

200
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,000
Now I'm not saying they're
going to come at us.

201
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,970
Is it some sort of anti terrorism thing?
I have no fucking idea what it was.

202
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,804
But like just the,

203
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,880
the kind of vagueness that two days
right before the Dodgers scored the other

204
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,640
day, uh, NPR, my wife listens
to that shit and I, you know,

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,960
[inaudible] morning becomes
eclectic if you enjoy this show.

206
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,230
Fresh air with Terry Gross.
Yeah.

207
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,470
There's always those pauses and a chill
when you first started doing standard,

208
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,420
you know what I think of, of discusses
before, but it's kind of important,

209
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,770
you know what to think of
when I think of those people.

210
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,290
Do you know who that Guy John Ghomeshi is?
I like NPR,

211
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,270
but it's so easily to be made fun of.

212
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:45,120
It's easy to drive off the road into a
fucking tree when you're listening to it,

213
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,600
to you. Oh yeah, no,
there's a lot of droning on.

214
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:54,010
But [inaudible] talk,
which nobody does that super sensitive

215
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,000
leftwing style of talk. The guy that
was, uh, he'd do that really well.

216
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:00,820
The main guy that did that. It
was this guy, John Ghomeshi,

217
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,850
who was on the CBC in Canada and it turned
out he liked to beat the fuck out of

218
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,060
girls when he was having sex with them.
He would punch him in the face and club.

219
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,680
I'm in the head and it was crazy shit.
And one girl I aim at. Yeah, yeah. Want.

220
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,870
And he would do it without asking them.
It was like, you know, like the, you know,

221
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,190
that's a strong move. It's crazy
strong move in the rack. Well,

222
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,720
I mean who knows who's telling the truth.

223
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,470
Cause he was kind of acquitted of a lot
of it. It was, it's, it's, cause it was,

224
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,650
it was very difficult to find evidence
on money to get acquitted, you know.

225
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,510
Well that's true.
That's a good point.

226
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:34,910
But he was fired and there was a gang of
girls that came out and said he used to

227
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,390
pick them up. Oh wait,
wait, wait. What did that,

228
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,650
the Gao does the interviews
like this bill burrs.

229
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:45,260
So tell me one time when
I'm not saying all those,

230
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,080
I don't know what the fuck
he does in his personal life,

231
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:50,860
but Russell Peters was on there and he
just goes like, and he's like, Russell,

232
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,440
you have nine cars. And Russell's
like, yeah. And he goes, why?

233
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,300
And it just fucking like making him
feel bad cause he's doing well, he's,

234
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,641
you know,

235
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:04,210
and then Russell had the fucking basically
justified and come up with money and

236
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:08,470
now I can have it and I'm sorry I
fucking made it. Wow. And I like cars.

237
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
Wow. Yes. So No,

238
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm not saying he's a Twat that's
just saying this right there. Well,

239
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,390
even if they're that bug me,

240
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:19,090
I hate when people fucking do
stuff like that to hit somebody.

241
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,800
If you get like eight or nine chicks,

242
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,660
they're saying you beat the fuck
out of him while you're having sex.

243
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,060
Even if you get what somebody got cracked,

244
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,500
what is your number that innocent
until guilty or how many accusations?

245
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,530
Bill Cosby I gave in around 30 30

246
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,090
I heard the first,
we had heard that right around seven.

247
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,540
No, I, there was rumors of his infidelity,

248
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,890
but I never heard of drugging.
You never heard that? No, I did.

249
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,350
I heard that.
I had heard that it was like a rumor.

250
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:54,280
It was a rumor that he had drug women.
It was a rumor a long time ago. He was a,

251
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:58,840
there was a court case that
is part of this case from,

252
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,640
I believe it was like 2005 and that
was one of the reasons why they weren't

253
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:07,780
allowed to admit that evidence because
the judge had made a decision that if he

254
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,500
paid this woman off, then it couldn't
be admissible in a future trial.

255
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,470
But it was all verbal.
They didn't get anything on paper.

256
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,810
So once they found out that it didn't
get this on paper, they're like, well,

257
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:17,890
we're gonna admit this.

258
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:21,130
And then the woman came out and then he
sued the woman that he gave the money to

259
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,900
for drug inner. Oh, the whole thing is
very, very sorted. But with Bill Cosby,

260
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:29,200
I think it's up to like 50 or something
crazy. Yeah. So you got to wonder,

261
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,220
out of those 50 does probably like 12 that
are just crazy. Like he dragged me to,

262
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,390
you know,
it's about the fact,

263
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,760
but the fact that he'd still be
open 30 it's just nuts. I think,

264
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,780
you know what you know,
you know,

265
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,290
it was one when all that shit came
out about Trump, right? He did this,

266
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,770
he did that, blah, blah, blah. It was
all pretty pedestrian sort of like, oh,

267
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:52,340
he grabbed my boob and then took me
in the back. Just just really sort

268
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,430
of lights become sort of the cliched
story. And then this one woman,

269
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,100
so I'm sitting there going like,
guide, the Clintons are fucking filthy.

270
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,920
Who knows if they paid these people,
who knows what the fuck's going on?

271
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:04,910
It's right before the list of when
this is coming out. And so I was going,

272
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,950
all right, we'll see, we'll
see. And then this finally,

273
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:09,010
this woman came on and she goes,
uh,

274
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,240
so he made advancements at me and she
goes, I just pushed him away and said,

275
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:17,870
get real. Which is the perfect thing to
say, cause you're, you're in your 20s.

276
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:22,100
He's like, fucking 106 it's like, yeah,
you serious? She goes, I said, get real.

277
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:27,101
And then she said he trusted his genitals
towards me and these and said get re.

278
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,690
Yeah, she said that. And
the way she imitated them, I
was in the car with my wife.

279
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,990
I say he fucking did that dial and
there's no fucking way that it's just too

280
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:43,310
specific. Like I got the
creeps up like you hit real,

281
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,240
so wonder what the logistics are,
where the legality is rather of the,

282
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:50,690
the audio tape. Like if you
don't know you're being recorded,

283
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,080
like you know you're being recorded for
a show. You're wearing a microphone,

284
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,810
but you don't know you're being recorded
while you're on a bus and you're

285
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:59,240
talking about grabbing them
by the pussy and all that.

286
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,850
He was talking to me talking trash.
He's talking shit. Yeah, like it.

287
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,530
Joey Diaz would say something like that
and I'd be fucking crying, laughing,

288
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,230
and he would be egging it up.
He would ramp it up.

289
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,990
He would make it way exaggerated
because he knows it's funny.

290
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,570
He's gone for the land. If you're
sitting next to Trump and he's like,

291
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,030
I just grabbed by the pussy,
you'd be fucking crying laughing.

292
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,680
That's why it just ut Bush. I
defended him on my podcast. It's like,

293
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,030
I'm not saying that guy's a great guy,

294
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:28,031
but if fire a fucking guy because of
a fucking 22nd clip from 11 years ago,

295
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:29,600
what's he supposed to do?

296
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,920
He's interviewing the guy and what you
supposed to do was keep the interview I

297
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,200
happiness interviewee happy, so
he's at grand by the Po's. Hey,

298
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:39,170
grab 'em by the Pussy. Yeah. He
just didn't even say anything bad.

299
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:42,710
Billy Bush didn't say anything bad.
It just launch. This guy at work said,

300
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,340
well when he said to the woman,
go over and give him a hug,

301
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,340
he became part of the sexual
assault and I was just like,

302
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,890
what sector was no sexual assault?
What they was saying,

303
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:56,540
if he actually did it was the
whole thing was just like,

304
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,651
let's just,
you know,

305
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:01,700
I understand women get in flipping out
about it as far as obviously just the

306
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,200
whole,
it would be them,

307
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,580
but what they don't know is the way
guys taught when they're not there yet.

308
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,130
And I'm just gonna,

309
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,340
I'm going to sit to the fucking shit
that we've said and we say it for fun.

310
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,910
You don't say it because we really want
to go grab someone by the Pussy and pick

311
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,090
them up like a bowling ball and say
it because it's funny. It's funny.

312
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:23,900
And you just, you're talking completely
ridiculous and inappropriate. Yes. Yeah.

313
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,510
Like say example. I will say, if
you do have $1 billion, I, um,

314
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,780
what I'm learning through Cosby at all
these fucking guys is evidently you can

315
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:36,380
do that. And he did say that he's
going like, you get famous enough,

316
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,660
you can just want to come from grand
by the pussy. And I've just said,

317
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,170
that was just so absurd to me. I'm like,
you can do that. You can't do that.

318
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,510
But he's got so much money.

319
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,480
You've got to think when you get off
that that guy could get you six grand in

320
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:50,220
cash. If he gave me five
weeks, I just don't correct.

321
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,470
I think he's leveraged out tiny bit,

322
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,600
but I'm pretty sure he'd go
to the ATM and get six grand,

323
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,090
but I know you're exaggerating
to six grand's a funny number.

324
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,520
It's a funny number. It
is funny. I'm just saying,

325
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:05,050
right dude is like liquid rich and your
assets have paid off and then there's,

326
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,870
oh,
I got this,

327
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:09,390
I'm going to take a loan against this and
then I'm going to do that and get some

328
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:12,930
investors here and then I would stick
my fucking name on it to build my brand.

329
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,640
There's that way where you're sort
of like steroid and up your value,

330
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,070
but at the end of the day it's
like, all right, but what?

331
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,750
How much can you get me right fucking now?
Like I don't get that whole like, well,

332
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,240
all my shit's tied up and I got other
guys, you know I'm, I'm working with Lily.

333
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,390
See the Zeros. What's in your
bank account? Show me. Yes.
Phone. Yes. Sean helicopter.

334
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:38,040
That helicopter with your name on the
back. Is that paid off? Is that a sticker?

335
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,490
But he's got a sticker that they take
off and then they put fucking Mark Cuban

336
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:45,150
on the back. But if name woman showing
up at his house and you're having,

337
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,000
you're supposed to have a business lunch,
you don't know that you show up.

338
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,330
He's got this sprawling estate
that looks like a castle.

339
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,800
He's got these enormous grounds.

340
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:57,060
He's probably got 50 people working just
at his house. Cause my greeting you,

341
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,180
they're taking you into these rooms.
He comes out in a $10,000 suit,

342
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,690
he's got diamonds and Rolexes and
everything's beautiful. And you're like,

343
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:06,090
Holy Shit,
it's Donald Trump is too,

344
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:10,920
pays like 80 grand this fucking hair.
Why doesn't he go the way you and I did.

345
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,970
You and I recognize it was over because
I don't think it was acceptable back

346
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:17,490
then, but it's, except Jordan
had to make it acceptable.

347
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,100
Jordan made it except made
except for four black guys.

348
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,360
He transcends Willis curly
Neal of the globe trotters.

349
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,370
It's made it acceptable for black guys.
And then Jordan was just, you know,

350
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:33,210
everyone wanted to be like Mike.
And I remember when he was at the height,

351
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,440
there was black guys
young with the full head.

352
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,050
Their fucking hair would shave their head
just to look like those fucking insane.

353
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,130
They'll do that.
Well what about Yule Brenner?

354
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,610
Yule Brenner was the first white guy
to rocket and be a movie star. Oh yeah.

355
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,040
The king and I Westworld, the original
Westworld, not the HBO series. You know,

356
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,030
I tried to buy the rights to that like
fucking 10 years ago. You did? Yes. World.

357
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,560
Yeah. I don't know what I was
going to buy. I was just like,

358
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:59,010
this is a movie that someone's going to
want to read too because they redoing

359
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,770
all these movies from my
childhood and I was just like,

360
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:02,940
I fucking loved that movie.

361
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:06,690
And I thing really loans itself because
we're not at the point where you can do

362
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:10,390
any of this shit. So it's still in the
future. You could totally but that,

363
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,850
but they wanted like
a zillion dollars for,

364
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:13,530
I didn't really get with Michael
Crighton book and all that.

365
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,610
They wanted like millions and millions.
And I was just like, all right,

366
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,220
I don't know, I'll tell you, get it for
like fucking 30 grand, like a Prius. Um,

367
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,870
if you watch the show or this thing.

368
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,060
Then the second I sat down
and I watched the show,

369
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:26,820
I just watched the opening credits
and I was like, oh, thank God,

370
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,300
thank God I didn't have the rights to
that cause there's no fucking way I could

371
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:29,970
have pulled that off.

372
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,750
Like all the things like the horse
running in those tendons connecting. Um,

373
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,290
I've watched the first two episodes.
I'm totally in and uh,

374
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,740
I've already bugged my agent to
be like, dude, I will fucking,

375
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,960
the same way when I saw breaking bad,
I just like,

376
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,910
I watched the first two
episodes and I was like, dude,

377
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,710
I will carry a tray of meth in the
background, whatever you can plug into.

378
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,890
So I bugged him going like,
um,

379
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,050
I'm actually bullshit and
that's on my agenda today.

380
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,120
I'm going to want to get out of
this and I'm what we're done here.

381
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,960
And I'd walk home with my elk meat,
hopefully. Um, I've got pounds for it.

382
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,470
I'm going to, uh, I'm going to, uh,
I'm going to bug him about trying,

383
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,020
trying to get on that thing.
And, uh, there's actually,

384
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:09,700
there's a couple of actors in there
that I've worked with, um, that, uh,

385
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm just like that they're
on, you know, you see,

386
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,220
you see friends of yours that are
actually in there and they're on something

387
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,750
that fucking cool. Tate, my friend Tate
was on last week's episode. Yes. World.

388
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:24,070
He's on everything though. Tate's
Tate's been in, I know a hundred movies,

389
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:27,880
probably easily a hundred movies. I've
always wondered if, you know, when you're,

390
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,840
you're doing something correct because
it's so hard when you're shooting it and

391
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:33,820
how they just,
all right now his point of view,

392
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,470
we'll do the master of backpack
back and do all that type of stuff.

393
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,200
You just find yourself walking
around. Was it good? Did it, you know,

394
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,700
cause the camera crew's not
saying anything. Everybody's
fucking quiet. And it's,

395
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,260
uh, it really comes down though to the
editors and the music and all that.

396
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,260
They can either take it to the
next level or they can read,

397
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:52,960
they can make something good look great
and they can take something great look

398
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,830
fucking horrific.

399
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,500
Well something start off great and then
they don't know how to end it and they

400
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:57,280
fuck it up.

401
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,900
But there's something weird about having
a friend in a movie where you're going,

402
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,670
this movie's Great. Oh there's tape. Like
it takes you out of it. It's like, oh,

403
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:07,000
that's my friend. Like this
movie's bullshit. Yeah.
People always say it doesn't,

404
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:10,030
it doesn't, it doesn't take me. Uh,

405
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,690
it doesn't take me out of it unless
I see them like watching themselves.

406
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:16,460
Like I can't believe I'm in this
scene with this guy that then,

407
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,770
then it like pulls me out. But like I,
I, I buy in when I'm one of those guys.

408
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:24,370
Like I don't like going to horror
movies. Like they freak me out. I buy in,

409
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:26,500
I don't give a fuck what the concept is.

410
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,580
Like that fucking thing where the lady
was like flipping the light switch off

411
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,210
and then turning it on and then
flipped it off and saw the thing again.

412
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,160
And then turn it on and then flipped off.
It was right there.

413
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,720
I was literally at home and
my stop fucking turn in the

414
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,590
movies that I dunno,

415
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,460
like the movie was coming out and it
was like the thing where she's like,

416
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,680
she's like, you know when you look into
a room and you shut the lights off,

417
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:50,440
shuts the lights off and all of a
sudden there's this fucking thing there.

418
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,940
Sort of a girl sort of fucking Beasley
and it's across the room so you can't

419
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,280
quite see it. So it's just like, what
the fuck is that? Turns the lights on,

420
00:22:57,281 --> 00:23:00,580
it's gone. Shuts it off.
It's there again. Same spot.

421
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,250
Turns the lights back on.
It's not there.

422
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,180
Shuts it up the third time and it's
right in her fucking grill. Yeah.

423
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,120
Scared the fuck out of me.
Blair witch, Blair witch.

424
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:12,540
When they would go like to move, you
didn't skip me. Ralphie may go to,

425
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,160
they didn't fucking scare me.
You scare the shit out of me.

426
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,780
I saw that movie by myself.

427
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,710
I'd done a spot at the laugh factory and
went down to the Mann's Chinese theater

428
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:22,180
though.
The one that got Hollywood galaxy.

429
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,670
I don't know if that's still
there anymore. Right next door.

430
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,830
And I saw like the midnight showing
by myself. Dude freaked those out.

431
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,190
Yeah. But nobody I knew and it
was like really sort of like,

432
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,300
there wasn't a lot of people there.

433
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:37,750
And then that walked through the
parking garage. Oh Dude, I was fucking,

434
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,590
I was freaked out. I saw
that movie in Houston, Texas.

435
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:44,590
Chris Mcguire and I did a show.
We did a show at the old laugh stop.

436
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,650
You ever do the old laptop?

437
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,480
Uh, I do that one Drake
club, I think I just,

438
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,210
whatever the classic one was
that Hixon all those guys,

439
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,070
it had just moved to the new spot to
spot sucked. The new spa was not good,

440
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,480
but the old spot was amazing. And that's
where I did my first album. That was a,

441
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:04,940
I'm going to be dead
Sunday. I did in 1999. Uh,

442
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:09,530
we did a show and then McGuire and I
met these kids that worked across the

443
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,570
street at the movie theater
and they go, Hey, do you guys,

444
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,010
we have the keys to the movie theater?

445
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,030
Do you guys want to go watch
the Blair witch? Just us.
And we were like, Holy Shit,

446
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,660
let's do it. So we left. We had a
10 o'clock show. It's like midnight.

447
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,840
We'd go across the street,
they fucking cook up the popcorn.

448
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:27,080
The whole deal gave us
free Sosa locked the door.

449
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,750
You couldn't even do that today.
No, it was amazing. I mean,

450
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,420
today everything's digital, you
know, the kids spools up the fucking,

451
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,750
the real and everything like that.
And we sat down in the theater,

452
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,590
it was like three of them and two of us
and we watched a Blair witch and shit.

453
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:44,300
Our pants. It was, oh, awesome.
Oh my God, Josh screaming.

454
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:48,320
I still remember that when the kid
staring in the corner like Ooh, oh yeah.

455
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,250
When they just sorta
like went past it again.

456
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,960
All of that shit where rather than just
showing you saw in somebody's head off.

457
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,240
Just the idea.
Yeah.

458
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,600
When you think of like Tarantino talked
about that were in reservoir dogs.

459
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,740
He had one scene where they showed the
guy hacking the year off versus just

460
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:06,140
panning away and hearing the
guy screaming. It's just like,

461
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:11,141
it was way more fucking disturbing that
that ruined that song for me for a long

462
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:16,010
time. I always tell what song was
that Marvin Nash screaming. Um, uh,

463
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:19,250
now here Stephen writes voice, uh, Lynn,

464
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,880
I don't know if Phil and he said,

465
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,560
Oh yeah, that was,
that's something to stop.

466
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,820
Remember that when he fucking he through
adding a fun song to a horrific scene.

467
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,190
Oh, that was so the powerlessness
of just fucking like,

468
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,480
I can't, I can't, I can't deal with,
that's like Scarface member's car face.

469
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:47,540
When they cut the guy up with a chainsaw,
he's tied up in the, in the bathtub

470
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,050
and they forced Tony Montana to watch.

471
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,620
He's getting splattered with blood
as a hack his friend up. Yeah. No,

472
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,600
my mother

473
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,430
took us to see that.
She didn't know what it was.

474
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,390
Took all of us to see it and my
youngest brother was like nine.

475
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,340
I think if my mother said
after these changes I've seen,

476
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,210
we have to get out of here,
I would have been like, fine.

477
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,890
Cause I've been watching that
going, oh, like it was really,

478
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,190
I asked my mother years later,
she was just like, well yeah,

479
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:19,180
I thought at that point, yes, that
it might've been a little mature,

480
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,310
mature for your youngest brother. And,
but I was laughing. I was going, yeah,

481
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:27,010
but you always took us to cool movie.
She goes and she goes, yeah. She goes,

482
00:26:27,011 --> 00:26:28,030
that was a good move.
She goes,

483
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,050
I'm gonna take care of those stupid things
like she was against like the whole,

484
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,680
uh,

485
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,120
she took us to full love of Benji and
Herbie goes to Monte Carlo and then they,

486
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:39,850
my parents were just like, we're not
fucking sitting through this shit.

487
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,470
We're going to go to a movie
that we're going to enjoy it too.

488
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:42,910
And then I went from that to like,

489
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,750
and like scarf the appearances in
fuck kid man. Just said, fuck it.

490
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,380
We're going to go, we're going to go
out. We're going to go there. Yeah,

491
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,670
we're going to see something too. But
let's look at me. I'm sweating like a pig.

492
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,720
Can you turn the AC on? Yeah.
Let's, uh, let's get to, um,

493
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,070
let's get to what I wanted to promote
here. Uh, you got your stand up,

494
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:05,980
special trigger coming out.
So first it's out. All right.

495
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,150
And when is it,
when is it airing?

496
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,130
I'm not what I'm saying and I'm
going to say where did you shoot it?

497
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,670
Shot on bad as an interviewer.
I'm Ben too. It's,

498
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:16,350
I'm trying to think of what I'm
supposed to ask you about San Francisco,

499
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:20,910
the Fillmore, how you want to
do it at a comedy club. And uh,

500
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:23,420
there was like a debate
between Netflix and me.

501
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,200
Netflix wanted to do it at a huge place.

502
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,890
I wanted to do it at a tiny place cause
I did my last one at the comedy works in

503
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:32,280
Denver, which is only like a couple
of hundred people. And I liked that.

504
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,250
I think there's something about when
you're sitting in the living room and

505
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:37,080
you're sitting on the couch
and watching a comedy special,

506
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:41,010
it lends itself better to be in, in a,
like a club. When you're filming it,

507
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,490
it feels more intimate, you know, see like
you're on top of the crowd. It's like,

508
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:49,710
it's more like what it would be like the
environment that it would be. So, uh,

509
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,810
we made a compromise.
We did the Fillmore theater,

510
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:55,830
which is a fucking really cool theater,
and it's only 450 seats.

511
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,030
So it's pretty small.

512
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:59,580
It's got a high ceiling and it's kind
of a big stage and everything like that.

513
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,710
But it's fairly small place,
but as cool.

514
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,960
But next one I'm going to do
in a small place, I think,

515
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,340
I think I might do with the store.

516
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,490
Now what's funny is when I went
to go do mine at the Tabernacle,

517
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,590
you had already been there and did one.
So I was like,

518
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:11,820
how am I gonna make this different?

519
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:16,210
And I did the Fillmore in
2009 to let it go. I did that.

520
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,080
Yeah. So I think we're, yeah,

521
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,330
we're going back and forth and doing your
new one. Yeah. Uh, I did it last Friday.

522
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,130
You did it? Yep. I did it at the Ryman in
Nashville. Dude, I just, I was just there.

523
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,210
I fucking loved that play place is crazy.
He used to do the Grand Ole Opry,

524
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,260
sa Cedric the entertainer,
just a did one there. So I uh,

525
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,960
watched like the opening to his
just to see, cause I was just like,

526
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,720
cause then you've got to kind of disguise
it so it doesn't look like, oh my God,

527
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:49,020
he's at the exact same fucking
place. You know, the guy's huge,

528
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:53,040
so I had to make sure I will. It's like
all right, well we gotta try to, you know,

529
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,230
he came in with like a whole
marching band and all of that,

530
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:58,440
which is the exact opposite to my
style. So it was like, okay cool.

531
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,900
Kat Williams brought a lion. He brought
a lie in that stage. That's awesome.

532
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,950
I love that guy. That guy is fucking
hilarious man. He's fucking hilarious.

533
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:09,900
Funniest guys alive and you know,

534
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:13,950
and just having the balls to go on
stage with a fucking line is hilarious.

535
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,990
How do you come? I want to, I wish
I was in that fucking pitch meeting.

536
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:22,140
Here's the deal. What's the concept?
I'm coming on stage with a lion.

537
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,600
A lion in a cage. Like a stuff.
We're now a real one. He's,

538
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,900
he got so sweaty during this special,
he had a stop and change clothes.

539
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,671
Is that right?
Yeah,

540
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:36,170
he literally stopped cause I'll
be right back and went backstage.

541
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,700
Changed his fucking clothes was drenched.

542
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,160
I mean just completely soaked
with sweat is if they put,

543
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:46,700
when they put that HD makeup on and then
there's all those lights on you. Yeah.

544
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,160
And then then you're going hard.
Yeah.

545
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,490
Cause it's just special and you really
want to make sure you're going to get a

546
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:54,550
good one. And then if the
fucking AC is a little messed up,

547
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,830
if the crowd's all fucking packed in,

548
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:59,710
in the wrong venue yet you can
get yourself into a situation.

549
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,270
I don't wear makeup on those things.

550
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,000
I wouldn't wear it for comedy
central and award for the UFC.

551
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:06,050
I don't want her for anything.
Just like, I don't know,

552
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,800
this is what it looked like.
You know? I think it's good.

553
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,980
It came first of all from fear factor, uh,
when I first started doing fear factor,

554
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:15,280
they wanted, they would put like a little
anti shine on me, a little of this,

555
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,510
a little that and after a while I'm like,
look,

556
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,180
these fucking people are covered in blood.
I mean,

557
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,080
they've got dirt all over their face
and I'm sitting there with makeup on,

558
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,270
you have to touch me up in between scenes.
You know, how ridiculous that is. Yes.

559
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,320
And then we would go from that to
the UFC where people would literally,

560
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:32,440
their faces are getting busted open
their get giant fucking, it's funny,

561
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,310
I never noticed like when I watched you
on the UFC, I never noticed like, oh wow.

562
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,450
Like he can, he went on a TV
without makeup. That's so brave.

563
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,720
That's such a courageous thing.
I you just, you look like you.

564
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,600
Well that's what I look like. You
know, I'm just like, I'm not, you know,

565
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,970
Mike Goldberg gets it. They spray
it on. They got fucking airbrush.

566
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm not kidding. Never an
airbrush. They do it to everybody.

567
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,520
All the ring girls and everything.
The airbrush room.

568
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,450
That's what they didn't go that fight.
I got up to my giant forehead.

569
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:03,320
I gotta get some [inaudible] Dude, I
got you Pete. Dude. Oh Gee. You guys,

570
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,600
you're not in the same way. Classes were
going crazy on stage. I sweat like crazy.

571
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:10,780
I mean, my last special, I looked at it
when I was doing the editing. I'm like,

572
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:14,530
Jesus, I'm a sweaty fuck. Like, it just
looks ridiculous. It looks like I'm like,

573
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:15,364
I'm on drugs,

574
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,570
but you're up there working and you're
not like just standing there. So this one,

575
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:23,440
I didn't have any, uh, this last one.
I, I made sure the AC was cranked.

576
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,810
Like with each special I learned
something. Yeah. Uh, so I was like,

577
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:29,740
make sure the,
you know,

578
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:32,980
the AC cranked don't fucking
cake the makeup on or whatever,

579
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:34,370
just so it was just a little bit of that.

580
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,800
That's all those stupid
little fucking things.

581
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,740
You know, don't stick my parents in
the front row please. Just beyond,

582
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:49,030
beyond, beyond the Pale. Yeah. And
I don't show any audience anymore.

583
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,230
I decided no more audience. She never
did. Yeah. That's their way to go.

584
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,620
No audience shots and everything.
Kind of mostly from the waist up.

585
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:59,970
Unless you need to see my legs for like
a particular thing I'm doing. Yeah.

586
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,900
I want to give away all your secrets
because of, because now I feel like,

587
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,920
um, because there's so
many specials coming out,

588
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,360
so many fucking special's
coming out that uh, you know,

589
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,740
that then it becomes like you, you have
to have like whatever you'll look is,

590
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,091
you know what I mean?
I mean,

591
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:21,700
the thing about it is you
have such a great act that's
going to stand on anyways,

592
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:24,850
but if you can add like your own sort
of style, the way you shoot them,

593
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,880
that becomes part of your thing.
That's another way to try to get it up.

594
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,370
Cause you know, you get on Netflix with
the specialist dude, you just, yeah,

595
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,120
you're fucking scrolling, scrolling,
scrolling, scrolling. Um, I guess so.

596
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:37,720
I just wanted it to be like,
you're watching it like no cutaways.

597
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,010
I don't want to cut into the left,
cut into the rye cut

598
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,720
and for no reason. Like, like a,

599
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:43,820
there was a director that I worked
with once who was like, you know,

600
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,580
we have to cut to the audience. You know,
that's how we're going to do our edits.

601
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,150
I go, let's just try and do with no
edits. We can't. I go, of course we can.

602
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:53,750
If I do a good show, we could deal with
no edits. He was like, no, look, trust me,

603
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:56,610
we're going to do this. I'm like,
no, this is my fucking special.

604
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,140
Like I don't even know
you. Yeah. Like you're,

605
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,460
you're coming in here and you wanted
to do all this stupid shit and,

606
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:04,760
and film the crowd and you know the people
want to know the people are laughing.

607
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:07,910
I'm like, they're going to hear them
laughing. I can take it in my opinion.

608
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:10,910
It takes you out of it feel cause
or one cell phone. Yeah. Perfect.

609
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,900
He sits down for like an hour and
40 minutes killing. They never,

610
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,120
they never go to the crowd.

611
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:21,320
The background just slowly
changes different colors
and guy absolutely murdered

612
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,420
you and I were supposed to go see bill
Cosby and Vegas. We had made like a,

613
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,810
we were talking about doing it,

614
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:29,210
but we both flaked and we
never wound up doing it.

615
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:31,400
And that's one of my
main regrets to this day.

616
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,310
I would have liked to see him
for the stink hit him. I didn't,

617
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,300
I saw it right before I met him and
then three months later I saw him.

618
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,520
Do you remember when he was doing shows?

619
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:43,730
Still like all those women were coming
out and he was still doing shows,

620
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,510
like he was still doing shows. He was
like, fuck it, I'm still doing them.

621
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,090
And he went out and he still did
those shows for a little while.

622
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,120
I think he thought he was powerful
enough to just sort of ignore it.

623
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,440
And then it wasn't going to La. It
wasn't going to come around. But dude,

624
00:33:57,441 --> 00:34:00,140
I gotta tell you, if you gave me
a thousand guests, not a thousand,

625
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:01,680
but if you gave me 200 guesses,

626
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,300
his name would not be on that out of
all the fuck of all the fucking people.

627
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:08,600
Like if you, if you said, okay, this,
there's a comic out there doing this shit.

628
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,060
Really? You got your top 20 where
you'd be like, Oh yeah. You know what?

629
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,800
I never heard the rumors. I did hear
the rumors and also there was a time,

630
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,820
I don't mind, not in
the clubhouse. How am,

631
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,540
how am I a comedian this long and
I'm not fucking here in the rumors.

632
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,750
I heard it from Hollywood people.
I didn't hear it from comics.

633
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,280
I heard it from people in the business.

634
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:29,420
I heard it from like actors and from
people that like work on TV shows, sets.

635
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:32,240
I heard it during the news radio days.
I had heard it.

636
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,310
He was doing it at the show.

637
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,620
He was doing it for people that were
on the ship to two people allegedly,

638
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:43,460
who the fuck knows, but there's
something. It was something unbelievable,

639
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,390
unbelievably creepy.
But after the accusations came out,

640
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:50,120
when he was still doing shows,
he would go on stage with one.

641
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,100
I look into the left one.
I look at street movie.

642
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,530
He developed a dead I somewhere
along the line. Right.

643
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,840
So He'd go on stage with that weird,
I got him some slack. He's like nine.

644
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,490
I know they have it for the grace of
God, but he's dying. Right? I mean,

645
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:03,970
that's my point. It's like things
are falling off the wheels, right.

646
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,730
The wheels are falling off the ride and
he's got the shirt on this sweater on

647
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,530
that says hello friend.
And he's,

648
00:35:10,531 --> 00:35:15,330
he's on stage and he walks out there and
everybody's clapping and cheering and

649
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,700
some guys, yeah, no, you're
right. Best you are a rapist.

650
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,751
And then,
you know,

651
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,270
they grabbed the guy and shuffle
them out and then people going,

652
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:27,080
we love you bill. And he just doesn't
even acknowledge that. Just ignore them.

653
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:31,340
Just ignore them. Yeah. It was something
crazy about that. It was like the last,

654
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,930
the last sparks before they
threw the water on the fire.

655
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,010
It's like there's just a little hope,
like, okay, guess need some embers,

656
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,150
last spark before they to the gas
roommate. I mean, his career, his life,

657
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:45,030
they threw water on him. Like,
I mean he's just, it's over.

658
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,370
Like no one's going to go
see him live now. Right.

659
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:51,210
I mean it's kind of over a dozen
water put out the sparks. Yes.

660
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,590
That's what I mean.
Through the water on them.

661
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,830
They said they wouldn't
that mean that he had no,

662
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:58,170
I mean like you had a moment of like,

663
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,780
there was still some sparks
in its colonial. Okay.

664
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:02,580
I can't get the accusations came out,

665
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:05,210
but he was still doing these shows and
people still came out and they're like,

666
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,240
we love you bill. He's got these
shares. Sign analogies. To me, I'm not,

667
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,130
I'm not the brightest guy.
It wasn't a good analogy.

668
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,160
You're analogy is probably better.
You know, the, the blowing the,

669
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,810
the flames on the fire. It's like, we
almost had it out. Like it was almost,

670
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,880
you know, my last flight sort of caught
on fire. Why helicopter flight? No,

671
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,740
no, no. We're playing air jet. Yeah. Back

672
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:32,020
from my special Nashville to La
and we got up to cruising altitude.

673
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,190
It smelled like burnt popcorn. So I was
like, did the Stewart, he says like,

674
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,460
I'll fast forward through
this. Cause I told her, he
told them, I think I was like,

675
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:41,640
did they burn the fucking
meal or something? And

676
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,850
then it sort of went away.

677
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:48,510
Then it kind of came back and I felt
this with everybody had the shades pulled

678
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:48,710
down.

679
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,160
I felt like we were starting to descend
and then it felt really like they felt

680
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:56,100
like the wing shaken and shit
and I was like, oh wow man.

681
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:57,240
Like there must be some turbulence.

682
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:59,760
I thought he was just descending to go
underneath it and then go back up again.

683
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:01,890
You only need to get a little
bit of a smoother air here.

684
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,040
Sorry about the movie ride.

685
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:05,070
I thought was gonna be doing that
shit and never said a fucking word.

686
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:10,020
And then all of a sudden like my drink
that was in the little middle armrests

687
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,650
started sliding forward like it was going
to fall onto the floor and I'm like,

688
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,750
oh fuck. And then the stewardess
came up. She goes, yeah,

689
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:18,090
we're going to be landing here shortly,
so I have to take those drinks. Right.

690
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,880
And then the woman next to me
said landed premature. Oh yeah.

691
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:23,220
We only 50 minutes into the
flight from Nashville to La.

692
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,590
My favorite thing was the woman next to
me takes the headphones off. She's like,

693
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,720
are we here already that we just fucking,
that we were on the Concorde?

694
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,250
I was like, no, it was on fire. I
don't know. I don't know what it was.

695
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,360
I always thinking like, oh fuck, this is
going to be something in somebody's bag.

696
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:42,120
Like the luggage is shit or
some shit like that value jet.

697
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,330
Something caught on fire underneath
there and like my whole thing was when we

698
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:45,841
were going down,

699
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:50,340
I wasn't nervous because he had full
control of the plane maneuvering and all

700
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:54,300
that and I just knew like yeah you,
you smell smoke. That is a a, a,

701
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:56,160
the procedure is land immediately.

702
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,090
So that's what he's doing and we're 30,000
feet up so he's going to land quickly.

703
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:03,540
That's the shaking. That's fine.
I feel as making turns. And banks,

704
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,790
everything's working. But
my whole thing is, you know,

705
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,380
I don't know anything about planes,
but I'm just like,

706
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:10,110
if it burns through the wrong wire,
if the hydraulics,

707
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,960
like what the fuck's going
to happen? So, um, yeah.

708
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,780
And we came into a landing in little
rock and then we came in like over this

709
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:19,350
river and I couldn't see the runway.
Oh. Cause you can't see straight.

710
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:20,160
So I'm just looking at the sign.

711
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,440
I just see this fucking river
and free to be following it.

712
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,350
That's what I'm thinking.

713
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,010
Like is he going to sell you this thing
and fucking sentence under the water?

714
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,660
Jesus. Um, and I was already thinking
and you know what's gonna Happen?

715
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,040
The front part of the plane's going to
get fucked up so that door's not gonna

716
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,920
open somebody's fucking fight.
Pass these FirstClass people into coach.

717
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,470
You know what I mean? We're real people
work. So they're going to be, oh,

718
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,230
they're going to out muscle me as they
get through. I'm going to be fucked.

719
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,070
If we use the first class, do, I can
take out the check next to me. I'm fine.

720
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:48,280
People are going to be unconscious anyway,
just from the stress and the impact.

721
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,430
Do you know, was uh,
was hilarious, was the,

722
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,540
the woman across the alphabet was totally
freaking out because unfortunately her

723
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,520
dad I guess had died in a plane crash,

724
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,700
so she was totally like totally fucking
hyperventilating to the point it was

725
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:05,410
making me angry.
Like how fucking freaked out she was.

726
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,350
What kills me is she's tall.
She's totally freaking out about that,

727
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:12,670
but I swear to God, Dude, like 10
minutes earlier barefoot walked in,

728
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:17,110
use the bathroom and came back out.
Like that doesn't scare her.

729
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,770
That doesn't scare her, but a fucking
a couple of lights on in the cockpit,

730
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:23,770
you know, and the smell of burnt
popcorn. Now she's freaking out barefoot.

731
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,380
What the Fuck I put in the
bathroom is a new thing.

732
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,660
I've been flying for 20 years.
I've never seen it.

733
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,440
It started with socks and now it's fun
socks or even fucking worse. He was like,

734
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,630
you still are.

735
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,140
But whatever happened to women where
they decided to wear shoes that hurt like

736
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,440
they always have. But what the
fuck is that about? That as such,

737
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:45,340
because we chose the of the,
of their lack of power, uh,

738
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,530
they couldn't get a good job.
You know what I mean? Believe me,

739
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:49,870
if it was switched to the other way,
if you made a dollar less an hour, I,

740
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:53,140
you could imagine the shoes should
be wearing right now, Joe. US enough.

741
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,690
That's not true. Yeah. Do you know
that that whole thing about the, the,

742
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,710
the gender disparity, the wage gap is
not true. Do you know what the very,

743
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,360
that actually is? It's choices
in jobs. It's not job for job.

744
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,580
Like if you were an engineer and
you're working next to a woman,

745
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:09,550
she wouldn't be making 70 cents to
your dollar. It's bullshit. It's a lie.

746
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,280
And it's one of those propaganda
things that they like to tout out.

747
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,000
And you heard fucking Obama talk about
and Sarah Silverman talked about and when

748
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:18,310
she was trying to get Hillary
Clinton elected, it's a,

749
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:19,810
it's a weird thing that people keep.

750
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,620
I thought she was [inaudible] Sanders.

751
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,590
I thought Sarah Sylvan
was with Hillary Clinton.

752
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,590
I thought it was initially Bernie Sanders
and then maybe show us and everybody

753
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,720
jumped ship and went fucking Hillary,
including Bernie,

754
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:32,120
who then fucking endorsed Hillary.
And it's like, well, why would you do?

755
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,040
You're right. It might be
Bernie. She was endorsing,

756
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:38,580
but it's that thing that they say that's
just not true. What it is. It's two.

757
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:40,710
It's two factors. One,
there's a lot of this,

758
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,350
the less hours women
tend to work less hours.

759
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,200
They also tend to take risks
because they had less easy. Well,

760
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:50,640
it just kids and Charles Park
joking a maternity leave, one fluff.

761
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,970
There's maternity leaves as a bunch of
other factors. There are less crazy,

762
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:56,730
less ambitious. They don't have as much
testosterone. Obviously they're not.

763
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,030
It's fucking crazy man. Or be willing
to work themselves into the grave.

764
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,960
And when they're working side
by side doing the same job,

765
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,520
there's almost no disparity at all.

766
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:08,880
There's a few jobs where men get paid
more than women, but it's not much.

767
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,040
And it's certainly not
70 cents to the dollar.

768
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,070
And this is one thing that gets touted
out over and over again by people.

769
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,880
But it's just not true. I had no idea.
I'll look ahead of friend of mine who,

770
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:20,640
I've got an argument about it
when he's talking about divorce,

771
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,470
where we were talking
about a buddy of ours,

772
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:25,170
a that got fucked in a
divorce and he goes, hey,

773
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:27,960
maybe it's to make up for the fact that
women only make 70 cents an hour. I go,

774
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,531
okay.

775
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:31,920
The fact that you say that
drives me fucking crazy
because you think it's a good

776
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:34,550
point, don't yet. And he goes, yeah, I do
you ever research that? And he goes, no,

777
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:37,670
but it's a fact. I go, it's not
a fact. I go, it's not a fact.

778
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,540
They make 70 cents compared to
[inaudible]. Yes. The Guy said this.

779
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,330
He's the guy who likes to argue. He's
a friend of mine, likes to argue.

780
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,180
He's one of those guys. Use the
words. You just gotta. Yeah,

781
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:49,460
you gotta walk away from it. No,
he's a good guy. He's a good guy,

782
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,690
but he's got a fucking problem.

783
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,000
He doesn't like when he doesn't know
something and when he doesn't know

784
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:56,390
something, he would go, he
doesn't go, Holy Shit. Really,
he goes, that's not true.

785
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,650
And I go, what the fuck? It's true.
It's fucking true. Like go Google it.

786
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,710
Like we got an a big
fucking crazy or web series.

787
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:06,050
I want to watch you guys drive
from here to San Francisco.

788
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:08,420
Just watching you losing your shit.
It fucking trope.

789
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,520
A couple of times we've
gotten in these arguments,

790
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:13,570
we've gotten in like three of them.
And it's like, I, when I'm not,

791
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,640
when I don't know something,
I'll say, I don't know.

792
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,060
Or if someone says something and I
didn't know that, I'll go, holy shit.

793
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:23,690
Is that true? He's the opposite.
He's like, that's not true. So, Oh,

794
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:25,730
if I don't know something,
I'll do a bit on it twice.

795
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,110
Twice this fucking guy's done this.
Besides it being like,

796
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,780
I know what I'm talking about. I did
a bit on the wage gap on my new, uh,

797
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,140
my new special. Yeah. Well, there
you go. Well, my old thing was like,

798
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:39,830
how the fuck did they find out what
everybody makes you just call up the IRS.

799
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,280
Can we get 32 is on everybody? They're
going to give you that information.

800
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,050
Well. Uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I have
no idea, but all I know is what,

801
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:51,830
it's harder for them straight across
the board. That is the, for women,

802
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,580
just everything is harder and
all of our lives are easier.

803
00:42:55,581 --> 00:43:00,340
That's the overall fucking message. You
say you're being sarcastic? I am. Nah.

804
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:02,450
It's just like I have one of
my favorite jokes of all time.

805
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,600
What about motherhood being the
hardest job in the world? He goes,

806
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,180
how's the hardest job in the world when
you weren't fucking pajamas all day?

807
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,940
Yeah. No job you can do in your pajamas.
I loved that bit. My wife hates it.

808
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,720
No, no, I'm not saying it's not
fucking no, but it's fun. Yeah.

809
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,130
It's obviously difficult, but it's a
funny point still whole thing. Yeah. Yep.

810
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:25,430
Go work in an oil rig that fucking blows
up and as you jump into the fucking

811
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,090
like on fire water going underneath that
and then he's just sitting there with

812
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:31,580
second degree burns
and salt fucking water,

813
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,760
hoping that coast guard gets there
before the shark eats you alive.

814
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,630
I talk to me about your,
talk to me about the terrible twos.

815
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,230
I have a friend of mine who works at a
oil rig in Canada in northern Alberta

816
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:47,770
where it gets 50 below zero and I go,
well,

817
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,280
how do you do it cause they work outside.
I go, how do you do it? He goes, well you,

818
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:55,500
you keep the truck running and you work
for about seven to 10 minutes at a time

819
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:58,640
and then you have to go inside the truck
for about a half an hour. I go, really?

820
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,810
He goes, yeah. He goes,

821
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:03,140
you can't take any more cause you any
exposed skin you have is. He goes,

822
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,170
you try to cover your face up as much
as possible. You put a ski mask on,

823
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:10,520
but just your eyes just all around your
eyes is all fucked up like everything's

824
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:15,170
fucked up. It's like it's just too cold.
You just can't do it. 50 below zero.

825
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,780
They just worked for
short stretches of time.

826
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,180
Then they go in the car and then the
other guy will go out while he's in there

827
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,810
and then he'll go out for like 10 minutes
and then they take a break for another

828
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:26,300
10 15 minutes. Then the other
first guy, we'll go back out again.

829
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,140
All of those shows make me so
thankful that I'm a comedian.

830
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,220
Those fucking crab fishing shows

831
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,220
the fucking worst job you had this as far
as physically like I will kill myself.

832
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:42,150
Perform 30 if I fucking do this. Out of
high school, I've worked on a, uh, uh,

833
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,410
there was a knights of Columbus Hall that
was having a wheelchair ramp built and

834
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:51,411
I had a carry cement bags and pressure
treated lumber every day and I only

835
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:55,620
lasted a little over two weeks.
I think I lasted eight days.

836
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:57,870
I was a gopher on a construction site.
We will,

837
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:03,300
we will roofing in June or July. And I
just remember having to bring up those,

838
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:06,780
first of I brought the Ra, I bought
the wrong color, fucking shingles.

839
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:10,770
They wanted the fucking ebony one and this
was off at Bama. What the fuck it was.

840
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:14,160
So I had to go all the way back,
unload the fucking things.

841
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:17,880
I loaded on load some more back, brought
the fucking things back. I just remember,

842
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,390
dude, it was just like, I
never ate so much in my life.

843
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,720
Like I'd eat like three sandwiches
and like a half hour later I'd be like

844
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:29,490
starving and just wait was just falling
off of me. I was just like, dude,

845
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:31,480
what the fuck? This is insane. And,

846
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,710
but the thing was if I hung
in there for like a month,

847
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,780
I would've got my sea legs. But
I, I just was like, no. But I,

848
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:42,060
I didn't have it. I
knew it. I always knew.

849
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,000
I always knew like when I play drums
and everything like that as much,

850
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:46,320
every time I thought I was getting good,

851
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,010
I go into guitar center and some eight
year old kid would get on a kit and I'd

852
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:53,370
be like, holy fuck. I was like, dude,
I would pay you to give me lessons.

853
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,180
And it's just like that when you switch,
whatever you're trying to do,

854
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:00,840
when you see like a kid come in and he
fucking blow, I mean, blows your way.

855
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,530
It's just like, it's just like, all right,
I, I, this is, this is a hobby bill.

856
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,330
This is a hobby. Well, he's
not doing construction.

857
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,700
It's definitely not a fucking hobby.
It's just brutal. Backbreaking Labor.

858
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:15,990
There's inc this is a gift as far as like
seeing how things go to get, Oh yeah,

859
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:20,820
dude. There's an art to
everything. [inaudible] Louis
Ck is a fucking contractors.

860
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,310
Oh God, no. I mean as
far as building houses,

861
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:25,860
but I mean laboring like
carrying bags of cement.

862
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:28,140
There's no fucking art carrying
bags of cement. But no,

863
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:30,060
but they would give me
shit to do, like, you know,

864
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:34,530
make this fucking miter cut 45 and I fuck
the same, cut up three times in a row.

865
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,340
It was so to frame a door jam and I kept
measuring to the inside of the corner,

866
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:39,750
rather the outside of
the corner of members.

867
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,520
The third time I did it that my boss
just looked at me, grabbed the wood,

868
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:48,150
and he looked at me the whole time,
walked up to the frame and never,

869
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,180
never took his eyes off me and the frame
was behind him and he just stuck it to

870
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:55,710
the fucking wall and just stared at me.
I was so embarrassed. It was just like,

871
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,470
Oh God, dude. He's like, dude,
you're, you're going through,

872
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:02,580
you went through like fucking $20 worth
of stock to make one fucking cut. Like,

873
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:04,440
what are you doing? And I was
just like, ugh. And I was just,

874
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,750
I didn't even pick up my show.
I didn't even pick up my check.

875
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,410
I drove up to the site,
I work Monday through Friday,

876
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,480
and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

877
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:16,050
I drove up to the site and I just looked
at it and my body and everything just

878
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:20,940
said, dude, fuck this. And I just
kept driving. He never called,

879
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,610
why would he call me? I'm the guy who
wasted lumber. He doesn't give a shit.

880
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:27,990
He got free labor out of me and
I didn't give a fuck. And, um,

881
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,250
I forget what I did after that,

882
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,700
but that was a rough time for me.
But like, I always knew, like if I,

883
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:36,590
if I didn't like a job and
stuff like that, so it's
like the Deniro thing and uh,

884
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,670
what was that? The heat you gotta
be willing to walk at any moment.

885
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:43,090
You gotta be willing to fucking walk.
You got to know what's bad. Yeah.

886
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,810
That was it.

887
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:47,800
That was the probably the toughest
physical job that I had and it was also a

888
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:50,620
good, it was a good lesson because it
was a lesson that like if you worked for

889
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:54,430
somebody else and you're just doing labor,
you just doing just mindless labor.

890
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,080
You don't have any time for anything else.

891
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,870
You think you got eight hours in a day
and there's still another 16 you'll get

892
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:03,580
shit done. You're exhausted, you fucking
beaten down. I would go to the gym.

893
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:07,540
I try to work out and I remember trying
to hit the bag and I just had nothing.

894
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,050
There was nothing that I'd never felt so
tired in my life and I was only like 18

895
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,550
I should have been full of
piss and vinegar. I just,

896
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,530
I was just dead and I remember
like all my ambition wheels,

897
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:21,610
we're just ramp it up. I was like,
okay, this is not my fucking future.

898
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,620
I've got to figure out what
the fuck I'm doing cause I,

899
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:27,760
I had these delusions that I was going
to become a carpenter. I was like, wow.

900
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,330
Getting the union, I'll start building
houses. That's a good gig. Which it is.

901
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:33,810
You know, if you're, that's what I thought
I was going to do. Yeah. You know what,

902
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:37,090
it's a good gig if you're the guy telling
the people to go build a fucking house.

903
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:40,270
But if you're the guy out the poor
in the forms, you've noticed that,

904
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,160
that's mostly young guys like that as a
fucking young him even like landscaping,

905
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,610
like after a while you got to get a
crew and you've got to be the guy like

906
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:53,290
sending the crews out. Cause there's
only so long that you can just like,

907
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,190
I feel like like laborers and that they
have like the same career trajectory is

908
00:48:57,191 --> 00:49:00,790
like a professional athlete.
Somewhere around 35 to 38,

909
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,040
your body's going to be
like, dude, I can't, I can't,

910
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,170
I can't fucking do this anymore.
He just break down.

911
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,890
There was a w I had a bulging
disc in my neck and I went to a,

912
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:10,840
an MRI place and,
uh,

913
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:15,820
there was a lady who went in before
me waiting and this, uh, lady, uh,

914
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:20,500
I was looking at different people's
Mris and this lady had the most fucking

915
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:24,160
ridiculous cartoon bulge of her disc.

916
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,500
Some poor woman who,
uh,

917
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,690
I think she worked in a
laundromat or something like that,

918
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:30,670
just carrying baskets of clothes.

919
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:34,690
And her back was just so fucked up and
she was probably like 40 years old or

920
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,630
something like that. Came
over your hair from, you know,

921
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,200
Mexico or Guatemala or something. And I
remember looking at her back like in the,

922
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,470
like, this poor lady has no
choice. She has to go to work.

923
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:47,950
There's no way around this. And there's
no jobs for her other than this, you know,

924
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,810
like what she's,
she can't speak English.

925
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,580
Like she's got to deal with
the fuck she's got to do.

926
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,610
And she had you went into her chart,
Huh? He started reading right there.

927
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,310
It was just sitting up
there on the screen now.

928
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,050
And I asked the guy who's back his hand,
he goes, it's hers. I go, Holy Shit. I go,

929
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:04,390
his mind look that bad. He goes, no. He
goes, that's bad. He goes, that's bad.

930
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,050
It's real bad. Like she
could barely walk. Look,

931
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,630
she had sciatica up and down
her leg. Oh, I had that. Yeah.

932
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:11,464
Well that's what that is.

933
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:15,520
What cy Attica is a bulging disc to
disc that's pressing against the nerves.

934
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,500
You had it would you do about it? I
went to a misuse that helped. Oh yeah.

935
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:25,360
And she, she works on a, she's a
magician dude. She started with like,

936
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:28,070
uh,
I can't remember who she

937
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,730
started with, but how it came through
me was through my drum teacher.

938
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,860
So it was like MMA people.
Ah, okay. And then, uh,

939
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:41,270
you know, the whole sum drummer, a
guitarist or something was into MMA,

940
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,460
fucked up something and they
say, go to my, my suits.

941
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,390
And then she got all the
musicians with like, uh,

942
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,390
one of the tendinitis and all that
shit in the forearms. And then, uh,

943
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,500
it came around to me through my drum
teacher. And, uh, she, she's like,

944
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:58,910
I made like my left side was fucked up
like the left leg and she started with my

945
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:02,030
right shoulder. Cause your rights holders
compensating for your left side. Yeah.

946
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:05,210
So she was doing the whole either let's
try to get some information, you know,

947
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:07,670
see what's going on here. And then
she'd do something I just go like,

948
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:12,770
and she'd be like, she'd just be like, she
be like, okay, there's some information.

949
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,760
All right. And then scale of one
to 10, the pain and dude like, um,

950
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:22,370
she, what she did for me, like
literally she went so fucking deep.

951
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,770
It was like these memories come out.

952
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,310
I remember my brother used to just
give me charley horses and shit for no

953
00:51:28,311 --> 00:51:32,040
fucking reason. You remembered it?
Yeah. Like, like it was a store in La.

954
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,580
So like the pain of it, like
it just pops up. I just,

955
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,810
I wouldn't be like literally thinking
and you just have the thought like I am,

956
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,680
I probably used to always kick
me in the fucking leg there.

957
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,023
And there was another one.

958
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:44,900
I remember I was playing pickup
hockey and I had no stuff.

959
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,760
All I had was the fucking, uh, the,

960
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:50,450
the helmet and the gloves and the skate
had like sweatpants and like a fucking

961
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:53,840
tee shirt or whatever. And I'm out there
like an asshole and I've, you know,

962
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:55,760
going down the ice and all of a
sudden the other team gets it.

963
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,920
So I pop over to fucking
start skating backwards.

964
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:02,921
I caught an edge and just went up in
the air and just landed on my left ass

965
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:07,250
cheek and fucking that hose. I,
dude, I landed so fucking hard.

966
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,140
Like I couldn't breathe in. My eyes
were, it's like literally been,

967
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:14,060
when you skate skating, it's like being
thrown out of a moving car, right?

968
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,260
So I got up and everyone was laughing. I
fucked up my elbow, you know, it's hockey,

969
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,280
so just, ah, I'm fine. You know,

970
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:22,250
I get to the bench and I was fine
it and a couple of shifts later,

971
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,940
it kind of worked itself out
and I had bruised my leg so bad.

972
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:30,080
It was like three days later I was on the
road and I was showering or something.

973
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:31,550
I just saw on the side of my leg,

974
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:35,310
it looked like I'd sat in
Greece or something and I
then I looked all the way to

975
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:38,810
the back of my leg. It looked like
someone took a pipe and just said,

976
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:41,480
fucking whacked me. As hard as you
could have crossed the back of my leg.

977
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:45,980
It looks like this straight fucking line.
And I think my sciatic nerve thing was,

978
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:49,040
which is a combination
of all of that shit.

979
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,560
And then there was that
last thing that did it.

980
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:54,770
So she fucking worked
all the way out of that.

981
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,710
She gave me all these stretches and then
I found like a good chiropractor and

982
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:01,610
all that. And um, I been so good
now. Yeah, I'll do it. I couldn't,

983
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:06,080
I couldn't even sit down
because of, uh, my, my,

984
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,160
my feet were starting would
start to tingle and stuff
with numbness is way worse

985
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:12,470
than p.
That's beyond pain is what I heard.

986
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,290
It's still the numbness thing is
worse. So she goes, all right,

987
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:19,130
we're going to work you from
numbness down to pain and then pain,

988
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:23,030
hopefully down to that. And not just, I
just started going every fucking week,

989
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,860
but uh,
I've got a machine I have to show you.

990
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:28,560
It's called a reverse hyper answer
machine that decompresses your back while

991
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:31,020
strengthening it. It's your,
your lift weights with it.

992
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:33,540
You lift your legs up and
then it strengthens your back.

993
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:36,390
And then as you lift the
legs, all this shit. Well,

994
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:38,400
I work for the ultimate
fighting championship. I mean,

995
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:42,550
I've been an athlete my whole life. Every
time I get this fucking chamber right?

996
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,870
Pay attention to stuff. I
mean, that's what I do. I mean,

997
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,310
I've been intention to the wrong shit.

998
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:49,470
I've been doing martial arts
and tells a little kid, I mean,

999
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,740
maintaining your body's
a big part of that.

1000
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:55,140
It's one of the most difficult parts of
martial arts is not getting injured all

1001
00:53:55,141 --> 00:53:58,100
the time. Your con, because martial arts
are all about hurting people, right?

1002
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,210
So it's practicing,
hurting each other.

1003
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,900
So like you have to find good
partners and then you'll, oh,

1004
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,850
he's that guy in class then goes to
fucking heart. There's always that.

1005
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,160
That's Charlie made chrom about that guy.
Yeah, that's a big problem. Sent me an,

1006
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:11,750
I only lasted a couple of weeks
of the Dojo. My fucking Aidy deal.

1007
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,880
Maybe I'll learn how to cook now.
You know, I've left so I never,

1008
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,210
but I was just like, all right, here's
the deal. You're going to go down there.

1009
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,800
When was this? Oh Beck, we do in
the rich bitch tour. Really? Yeah.

1010
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,300
You were doing what kind of martial
arts? Reading, whatever style he has.

1011
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:31,290
His fucking black dude. I only, I
only lasted like two weeks. I fucking,

1012
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:34,860
I actually took Jujitsu with dom fig.
Did you really?

1013
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:39,030
In the late nineties I lasted like five
weeks of doing that actually did our

1014
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:41,670
right. I did all right.
But then the guy teaching,

1015
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:46,830
he couldn't speak English and this lady
like dislocated like her fucking rib

1016
00:54:46,831 --> 00:54:51,060
cage can, something fucked up happened
and he didn't know what to do.

1017
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,270
And I just remembered like, you know, I
was coming home with bruises and shit.

1018
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:56,940
It was like, that was like
when pilot season you could
actually get on something.

1019
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:58,890
And I was just like,
the fuck am I doing?

1020
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,430
Why don't I make enough money where
I have security that when you get to

1021
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,850
actually get on something funny, you
remember development deals. Yeah.

1022
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,520
And Shit could actually happen.

1023
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,050
You go to Montreal and get
a deal and then to be set.

1024
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:13,860
I just remember the guy who wrote skip
the heap. It's like this. Oh no good.

1025
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,770
It's like this Ah, is good. That was the
whole fucking class Portuguese. Yeah.

1026
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,870
Like these, no, like this escape,
escape shrimp, skip the heat.

1027
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,740
Whatever the fuck he was saying. And
um, you know, I, I learned some shit.

1028
00:55:25,741 --> 00:55:28,280
I still know if I'm on my back,
how to get somebody into an arm bar part.

1029
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,280
It's probably, well it was probably, I
look at martial arts, it's like comedy,

1030
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:36,430
so like I think that that worked in the
late nineties but now that would be,

1031
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:39,240
it'd be like a Corny joke now and I
just think like that movie like, Dude,

1032
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:40,260
you're going to fucking try that.

1033
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:41,700
Like an eight year old knows
how to get out of that.

1034
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:44,130
Like you're funny at the office.
You think you're going to go kill it.

1035
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:48,990
The Ryman auditorium. Yeah,
right. That's the difference.

1036
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,530
It's more like a time thing where like
that was probably state of the art shit,

1037
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,310
whatever. We stayed in the yard then.
I mean you're talking to it. Oh my God.

1038
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,890
I was like 18 years ago.
There's no fucking way that move.

1039
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,230
Everybody knows that moves.
It's like playing drums.

1040
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,010
Well actually all the standard old school
moves in Brazilian Jujitsu are still

1041
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:07,500
good. They're all still good.
If you're good. I'm like,

1042
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:12,150
there's some guys that are really good at
what you would call basic is a classic.

1043
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,650
Yeah, basics. A weird word.

1044
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:16,080
And people get upset when you
say they're Jujitsu's very basic,

1045
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,770
but some of the best guys ever
have what you call basic Jujitsu.

1046
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:22,980
It's not that it's basic,
it's just they have only a

1047
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,900
amount of moves that they use,

1048
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:30,640
but they have them sharpened to a
razor's edge and it's not that they not,

1049
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,460
they're not capable of
doing everything else.

1050
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,100
Just some guys like there's guys that
are known for just having a guillotine

1051
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:36,461
choke.

1052
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:39,340
That's all they do and you just got to
avoid that fucking guillotine choke and

1053
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:40,360
they might still get you with it.

1054
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,060
There's some guys that just
wind by triangle all the time,

1055
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,090
only by triangle and there's
guys who only win by, he'll hook.

1056
00:56:46,091 --> 00:56:50,650
There's like a bunch of different guys.
Who's is the California kid? Uriah Faber.

1057
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,820
Oh Dude,
that guy's hilarious.

1058
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:55,450
Did you see him when he was on
the ultimate fighter? Sure. Okay.

1059
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,231
That thing that he,

1060
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:59,140
when he gave that kid shit early on
when he was trying to make this show

1061
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,720
[inaudible] and whatever he got
caught and pick a move, whatever,

1062
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:04,660
the fucking rear naked choke or something
like that. And then when the kid,

1063
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:09,661
when the kid goes in and he loses rear
naked choke and daisy went out like a

1064
00:57:10,521 --> 00:57:14,080
Uriah just goes like, yeah, he goes,
that's what he's known for. Look them up.

1065
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,770
And what I loved about that,
he was like old school parenting,

1066
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,980
like no fucking sympathy.
It's just like it.

1067
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,340
And I thought it was a very empowering
thing to do to that person. Like if he,

1068
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,980
once he got past the defeat, like you'd
be sitting there going like, yeah,

1069
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:30,010
what the fuck? You know, that
this is what the guy did.

1070
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,080
Let him beat you with anything else. But
that, that's so easy and this is on me.

1071
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,670
It's so much easier said
than done. It's, it's a,

1072
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:40,540
it's incredibly difficult to stop
someone who's really good at something.

1073
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,120
If they're really good at all. I
don't think I'd have a problem. Joe.

1074
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:45,600
I rented the last 20 years.

1075
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,670
What's the, uh, what was we got to wrap
up. I do by like an hour here, so like,

1076
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,710
uh, gimme all, all things, Joe Rogan,
uh, where we can see you in a UFC.

1077
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:58,300
Things coming up.
We talked earlier,

1078
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:02,050
there's this giant one giant one in
Madison Square Garden because the UFC was

1079
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:05,860
illegal in New York for 19 years and
it was all because of corruption.

1080
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:09,880
This is a funny story. The Culinary
Union, the guys who used to own the UFC,

1081
00:58:09,881 --> 00:58:14,170
they sold to UFC. But the guys who used
to own the UFC also own station casinos,

1082
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:19,180
they own red rocks and they owned
a bunch of different uh, casinos,

1083
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:22,510
like I think 22 separate casinos,
maybe even more.

1084
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:27,460
And all their casinos were nonunion.
And this is a vote by the,

1085
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:31,180
the casino themselves. Like they got
paid well and I guess they just decided,

1086
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:32,680
look, we don't, we don't need to be union.

1087
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,920
So the culinary union was trying to
muscle the owners of the UFC into going

1088
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:42,460
union. And so the way they
would do it is, I mean,

1089
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:43,810
they have a bunch of
different things they do.

1090
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:47,620
They'll stand out and to culinary union
strong. They're huge. They're huge.

1091
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:53,250
And they met those knives that they
managed to keep the UFC out of New York.

1092
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:58,180
And then one of the guys that was in
their pocket got arrested for corruption.

1093
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:01,780
He was the main guy that was
keeping the UFC out in New York.

1094
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,500
He went down last year at a corruption
and right after he went down,

1095
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,010
they passed it in New York state because
it was passed in every single day.

1096
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,770
And they told the public that it was
all that human cockfighting. Exactly.

1097
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,390
But meanwhile they had kickboxing,
boxing, everything else was legal,

1098
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:19,750
but they wouldn't let the UFC in.
And so finally,

1099
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:23,900
it's legal now and now that it's
legal and also there's new owners.

1100
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,510
So the Culinary Union doesn't have a
beef with these new owners because they

1101
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:29,060
don't even have any casinos.
And the,

1102
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,170
the new event that they're going to put
in Madison Square Garden has three world

1103
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:36,590
title fights, uh, for
former world champions.

1104
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:38,900
Three different fighters or fought
for the title before. I mean,

1105
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:40,820
it's a fucking unbelievably stacked card.

1106
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,190
The greatest card in the
history of Mcgregor's fight,

1107
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:47,540
Conor Mcgregor's fighting Eddie
Alvarez is, it's a two, two, um,

1108
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,030
there's three title fights,
but there's two champions in the,

1109
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:51,980
in the final Conners.
The featherweight champion.

1110
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,800
Eddie Alvarez is the lightweight champion,
and if Connor wins,

1111
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,220
it'd be the first guy to hold two
titles simultaneously in the UFC.

1112
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,970
How do you get in that Conor McGregor
shape? Is it too late for me at 48 no, no.

1113
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:05,150
You can do it tomorrow and he's just
drill on. I'm going to give you a pill.

1114
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,160
I'm going to give you an that.
I'm going to give you a mindset.

1115
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,930
I'm going to teach you the mindset.

1116
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,480
You can't tell you're just fucking
with you though. Oh you think? No.

1117
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,620
I thought I had hope.
I had fucking Ho.

1118
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,140
He's getting great shape.
He's like,

1119
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:22,850
you're fucking remember Tommy Hearns like
that level shredded or Tommy was like

1120
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:26,530
a six foot tall fucking middleweight
like somehow we could make like what?

1121
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:29,450
What does middleweight one 40 well he
was one 47 when he fought sugar ray.

1122
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:34,190
Leonard was welterweight and money.
Yeah. Unbelievable. He was just like,

1123
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:38,590
just like, it was like you drew them.
Like how do you get that fucking shredded,

1124
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,900
that tiny waist and big broad
shoulders and they're ridiculous.

1125
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:46,300
Right hand at reach. Yeah. Well when
he knocked out, uh, Roberto Duran,

1126
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,550
that's one of the sick, it was a hook,
right? Uh, I think it was a right hand.

1127
01:00:49,551 --> 01:00:52,340
He face planted them. I think you
hit him with a bunch of things,

1128
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:53,510
but I think he hit him when he do.

1129
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:57,140
You dropped him twice but then he face
planted on with her right hand were Duran

1130
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:01,880
just felt like a tree. I don't
want that. Yeah, like out.
Yes, exactly. Like Marquez.

1131
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:07,040
So I'm Conor McGregor is not in the
best shape. This is what's interesting.

1132
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,330
I mean he's obviously in great shape,

1133
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,630
but he's got a problem with his endurance
and it's one of the things that makes

1134
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,460
this fight interesting.
Like he got tired,

1135
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,710
he has explosive movements,
he uses up a lot of energy.

1136
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:20,540
He's so fucking fast.

1137
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:24,530
He's so fast and so explosive that
when you have that style of fighting,

1138
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,680
it's like sprinting. Whereas
Nate Diaz, the guy fought,

1139
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,260
was more of like a marathon
runner. Like Nate. I love Nate.

1140
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,990
Nate's awesome and so is his brother Nick.

1141
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:37,310
But their style is more like they don't
go 100% they don't use 100% of their

1142
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:42,020
energy with every punch. They're more
like sixties maybe 70% and they're always,

1143
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,080
they're always fresh and they
do a lot of marathon running.

1144
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,650
They do a lot of triathlons and
they're always doing endurance work.

1145
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:53,180
So the their endurance is a big part of
their ability to recover and push a pace

1146
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:56,450
that most people can't survive from.
So Connor's not that guy.

1147
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,820
Condoms as against people like Nate d,

1148
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,430
it's like towards the end he did
a lot of looking at the clock,

1149
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:04,250
did a lot of running away
to kind of reset you ran.

1150
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:08,440
Literally ran away from him and reset
and you know, smart for reminding me.

1151
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,720
Went to,
when I first did stand up and Steve Sweet,

1152
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:14,330
he was late and I was on a material and
I just kept looking at the back door.

1153
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,900
Like the comment is he can come in.
I got nothing left.

1154
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,350
I remember those days, the
Hell Brockton, Brockton,

1155
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,630
Nick's comedy stop number.
Then you stood up on that.

1156
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:28,710
Like it was like your mother's office
stages where it was a really small stage,

1157
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:29,544
like a giant Unisex.

1158
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,310
You standing on top of her fucking
refrigerator for whatever reason,

1159
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:36,150
and you're like looking down
on the people. It was almost
like this Andy Kaufman,

1160
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:40,200
like talk show desk. But it was the
stage. I don't know if I did Brockton.

1161
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:44,460
I don't know if I did the cow loon, I'm to
it. By then I might've been gone. I did.

1162
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,110
Uh, I did the, the Randolph,

1163
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:50,730
I did Brockton Framingham and then,
uh,

1164
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:53,790
I think that was it for the Nixon.
Then there was of course the one downtown.

1165
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,350
I never just framing him either,
I don't think,

1166
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:58,590
I think that was gone to cal Lutheran.
Of course the loans do the column.

1167
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:01,020
I didn't giggles Mike Clarke's room.

1168
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:04,920
Did you ever do that giggles on route
one the street. And uh, so anyway,

1169
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:07,020
the Conor McGregor
thing, like he's not, he,

1170
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,240
I would say he's doesn't have
the best cardio in the world.

1171
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:12,240
You can't say he's not in great shape
because he did go five rounds with Nate

1172
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:16,270
DHEAS. But it's just, it's not, he's not
the same kind of shape. They're like,

1173
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,770
like Nick Diaz has swam
from Alcatraz five times,

1174
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:23,520
gets in the fucking ocean,
which shark infested northern California.

1175
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:24,691
Water's sweating.

1176
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:28,380
And then you have to be in incredible
shape to divvy out of your fucking mind to

1177
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,360
that too.
But you've got to be an incredible shape.

1178
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,780
I've got a buddy of mine who just
got done running the big foot 200.

1179
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,510
He ran 204 fucking miles.

1180
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:39,750
205 205 miles in 78 hours.

1181
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:43,830
Three days are running three and a half,
three days a second way.

1182
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,660
Woken word. Yep. It's called
the big foot 200 all document.

1183
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:51,720
It's like running 60 to 70 miles a day.
Oh yeah, yeah. Maybe be less than that.

1184
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:54,270
Fifth. Yeah. Something like
that. Yeah. Something like
that. I remember the numbers.

1185
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,170
Yeah. Seventies 21 six 63. I'm going
63 miles. I like what you're saying.

1186
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,030
Three three is nine 18. Yeah. He, um,

1187
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,100
he's run hundreds a couple of times.

1188
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:10,100
He actually ran a hundred in June to
prepare for the 200 in, uh, August crate.

1189
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:13,170
So his half marathon is a hunt,
is four marathons basically.

1190
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:16,860
Essentially he's a fucking animal.
I mean, he runs a, does he,

1191
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,960
does he run with those feet sneakers
and know we can see the toes now he's

1192
01:04:20,961 --> 01:04:24,690
sponsored by under Armour. So who wears
the under armor? A fat tire shoes.

1193
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,630
It's Nice cushiony shoe.
But he's um, he's, he,

1194
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,860
he'll run 1450 miles a day every day.
Who came up with that big foot?

1195
01:04:31,861 --> 01:04:36,180
200 savages. Fucking barbarians.
His name's Cameron Hanes.

1196
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:38,700
He's a professional bowhunter.
And uh,

1197
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,270
to get in shape for bowhunting is bow
hunting is all about like climbing up

1198
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:44,160
mountains and shit.
Especially when you're hunting elk.

1199
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,730
I hunt with that guy and it's fucking
exhausting and I'm in pretty good shape.

1200
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,950
I'm not in great shape,
but I'm pretty good shape.

1201
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,080
I could barely keep up with them.
I mean barely.

1202
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:54,060
He's barely out of breath
and I'm fucking dying.

1203
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:58,050
I'm just drenched in sweat heaving
and trying to follow cause like,

1204
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:01,110
well you don't want to bring me along
for that one. That or anybody else.

1205
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,500
I mean the way he does it is a very
unique where he's like one of the most

1206
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:08,760
successful elk hunters in the world and
one of the reasons is shape cause he can

1207
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:12,060
get to places like you see an elk
and the elk goes over the ridge.

1208
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,780
The key is you got to get to that fucking
else quickly because it's moving over

1209
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:18,060
that ridge. Right? So if
you, if you look at an elk

1210
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,170
and it goes over the top of the
hill and goes to the other side,

1211
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,710
the quicker you can get to that,
the closer it's going to be that hill.

1212
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,900
You've got to get within 60
yards and you don't know how,

1213
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:29,080
how far it's going to move in the
time it takes you to get up there.

1214
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,070
Well it takes me maybe 10 minutes to get
up there. It'll take him two minutes.

1215
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:36,250
So about those extra eight minutes,
that fucking Alex, way out of range.

1216
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:38,830
You'd go down the hill after it.
It's going to see you.

1217
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,420
You're never going to get a shot at
it. So he has, we shot opportunities.

1218
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,800
You have any like uh,
like uh,

1219
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:49,030
the one that got away sort of shot like
you had it, you lined it up and whatever.

1220
01:05:49,031 --> 01:05:51,940
Get exhaled at the wrong time and
you missed it and then it took off.

1221
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,780
That's an elk hunting.
You'd I had five of those two weeks ago.

1222
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,320
There's five of those at least.
Maybe six. Yeah, we hunted for,

1223
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:02,890
I shot that one with a rifle because we
just couldn't get close enough with a

1224
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:05,980
bow. It was just five. Do you
feel your guide going like, dude,

1225
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:08,680
are you gonna fucking kill one here?
Is there more pressure?

1226
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:13,050
That's just how it is. Elk
Hunting is hard. [inaudible]
you go, when are you going?

1227
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:17,110
When are you going to go a wild boar
hunting again? I'm going with you.

1228
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,300
You and I are going to go,
we're going to schedule something soon.

1229
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,350
We'll schedule something.

1230
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:22,780
I'm what's schedule something
like maybe after Christmas. Yeah.

1231
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:27,160
Get me an Uzi and then I'll go,
I'm going to get you a yes. Ah,

1232
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,941
as it comes running.

1233
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:31,000
Cause those things I saw when
I was standing watching the uh,

1234
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:36,190
the chef there from hell's kitchen. Um,
ah, God damn. And I said his name earlier.

1235
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:40,750
I'm the worst. Yeah. Ramsey. He made
his scrambled eggs again this morning.

1236
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:44,470
My wife fucking loves it.
What kind of scrambled eggs?
Oh Dude. He fucking, he puts,

1237
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:47,800
this is what he does. He, first of
all, he gets, he gets the pepper pot,

1238
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,810
a little pan going, a little
olive oil, put some, uh,

1239
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,320
tomato is still on the
vironment with some mushrooms.

1240
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:54,670
He just lets that fucking sizzle.

1241
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:59,200
And then he takes three eggs and like
a dollop of fucking butter puts it in

1242
01:06:59,201 --> 01:07:02,140
there. It doesn't mix. It
already puts it on the flame.

1243
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:05,230
And then he starts mixing this thing
around. He talks about all the chemistry.

1244
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:06,880
You don't want to mix it
before you put it in there.

1245
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:10,210
It doesn't put any salt in
there cause some reason that
does it. He's like, oh no,

1246
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:14,290
he's now off to hate CDA and yet do
it cause they hate, it's in here.

1247
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,700
I've watched it a Zillion fucking
times when I'm watching this thing.

1248
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,890
Heats in the pan hates into pants. So
that's the one thing that I learned. Um,

1249
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:25,840
I learned from this guy, uh,
uh, Sheff, uh, Roy who will, uh,

1250
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Roy Choi who started the whole
gourmet food truck thing.

1251
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:32,760
I did like fab roads doing the shooting
this thing and I went over there and I

1252
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,110
got to, Sidney taught me this shit
about the grilled cheese sandwich.

1253
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,200
And what I learned about these guys is,
dude, it's all controlling the heat.

1254
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,240
Like my whole shit is
just like medium high.

1255
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:44,320
I'm like medium high for 10 minutes
and it's like you're not cooking,

1256
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:47,440
you're just standing there like a
fucking bouncer or shit. It's like,

1257
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:49,000
so he got manipulated it.

1258
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:53,020
So he does all of that and when it gets
to a certain level of a coming together,

1259
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,570
then he takes this creme fresh and
puts it in there. What is creme fresh?

1260
01:07:56,571 --> 01:07:59,500
I don't know what the fuck it is, but it's
delicious. Right? And then you get it,

1261
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:03,550
you bring it back back on the heat and
in salt in, right. He puts that shit in.

1262
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:06,610
You go and you just keep stirring this
fucking thing and it almost looks like

1263
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:08,890
it's water. You don't think it's done.
You taste it. You're like, oh my God,

1264
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:11,260
this is great. Then you
take it off, right? No wait.

1265
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:13,300
You chop up a little bit of dill.
You sprinkle it up,

1266
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:16,040
you mix it in there and then the
by then the sourdough toast pops

1267
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,750
up a little olive oil on that.

1268
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,170
He put the fucking scrambled eggs on now
with the fucking tomatoes and mushroom,

1269
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,930
give it to your wife over,
Woo over.

1270
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,850
But then they love it and then they keep
telling you to make it and you decide,

1271
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,970
uh, let's just do the old scrambled
egg with the cheese in it.

1272
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:36,020
I got to get you some eggs. We have
our own chickens. I have 23 chickens.

1273
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:40,730
How long can they lay eggs before you
have to fucking retire them? Well,

1274
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:42,460
they just stop laying eggs after awhile.

1275
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:46,490
But then you still on right now
I just let them live. They just,

1276
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:49,700
they just live and then they die though.
I've had a bunch of just die. How long,

1277
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,000
how long die.
I've had chickens for now,

1278
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:58,040
I want to say five years, somewhere
around there. Four or five years,

1279
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:02,000
maybe five years. And um, they
just fucking die sometimes.

1280
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,260
I've had like a,

1281
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:06,440
but I have some of them that are like
five years old said it's still five years

1282
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:09,060
old. Just picture this chicken
at his desk, you know, this,

1283
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:12,410
those classic 1950 [inaudible] attack.
You know,

1284
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:16,460
back then when nobody knew shit about
fucking heart attacks, it was terrifying.

1285
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,320
What does everybody's
hearts just fucking stop?

1286
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:22,430
And they were all eating bacon in fucking
Martinis and all this shit that had no

1287
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:26,360
idea. And that was back when
they, you know, they had no
respect for martial arts.

1288
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:27,460
It was all like,
I'll tell you another,

1289
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,180
it's stronger than a
good old Sunday punch.

1290
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:32,210
And they'd be sitting there eating fucking
stakes and people would just dropping

1291
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:36,800
right left, like dropping dead. I
know you like conspiracy theories,

1292
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:39,710
you look a good conspiracy theory.
It's been a good one. The good,

1293
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,510
I don't like the Rogan.
Here's a really,

1294
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,390
once he get one lumped in with people
who have silly, I understand that.

1295
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,180
Here's a real, why don't we move
and it was in the New York Times,

1296
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,480
they prove that scientists were paid off
by the sugar industry in the 1960s Oh

1297
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:57,200
yeah, I have. Absolutely. They were
paid off to make saturated fat.

1298
01:09:57,201 --> 01:09:59,870
The culprit for all
these diseases and fat,

1299
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,780
fat people and heart attacks
when it was actually sugar.

1300
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:07,580
I'm 11 tries to tell him the blame away
from sugar and pin it on saturated fat.

1301
01:10:07,581 --> 01:10:10,820
So basically scientists,
bacon is actually not bad for you.

1302
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,040
Saturated fat is actually not bad for you.

1303
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:16,340
There's a giant illusion that cholesterol,
everybody thinks to collect.

1304
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,510
All your cholesterol is high.

1305
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:22,280
Dietary cholesterol barely moves
the needle on blood lipids,

1306
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,010
blood lip. It's like when they
measure your diet, when you're bent,

1307
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:27,110
measure cholesterol in your
blood has to do with the last.

1308
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,780
Sounds great to me that you're
also a standup comedian. You don't,

1309
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:33,560
you don't have a white lab coat on. I'm
sitting here like, okay, Doctor Rogan,

1310
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,240
you read,
read these things.

1311
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:40,340
But what gives people high cholesterol
was first of all the LDL cholesterol, HDL,

1312
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:42,170
cholesterol,
the good cholesterol and bad cholesterol,

1313
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,510
and you can have high of warm as
if you have higher. The other one,

1314
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:45,500
it balances each other out.

1315
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:48,980
I'll send you a podcast if you have
the fucking the time to listen to it.

1316
01:10:48,981 --> 01:10:53,690
It's 81 words. Sit there long enough.
You, Farron. It's hard. It's hard.

1317
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,730
It's hard to sit down and listen
to this stuff. But this guy,

1318
01:10:55,731 --> 01:11:00,320
Chris crusher was on my
podcast who explained it all
and scientific great names

1319
01:11:00,321 --> 01:11:03,110
of all the time. Chris Kresser,
Chris [inaudible], Chris Kresser.

1320
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:10,420
Oh. Um, but anyway, it's
not cholesterol. The, it's,

1321
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,110
it's a lot of it is hereditary.

1322
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:16,110
Like if you have high blood pressure or
dietary cholesterol or high cholesterol,

1323
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,160
let him and David Lamb and look,

1324
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,670
he didn't have an ounce of fat on him and
he needed open heart surgery. Yes. Yeah,

1325
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:24,270
yeah. A lot of that is hereditary. Some
people just get a shit roll the dice.

1326
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:27,210
Just like some kids are born with
leukemia. I mean, it's just a sound.

1327
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,730
Something you did. It's not like they've
been smoking since they were a fetus.

1328
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:34,770
You know, my big fitness thing is I'm
big, big time into body weight exercises.

1329
01:11:34,771 --> 01:11:38,850
So I'm trying to get myself strong
enough to do a front lever it fucking 48

1330
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:42,270
years away from front lever is
basically you hang from the chin up bar,

1331
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:46,560
you bring your legs straight up and you
hang in there like a fucking table and

1332
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,390
you've got to put party
wait behind the bar.

1333
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:52,650
So there's all of these exercises to
explain that. Okay. Sorry. So you,

1334
01:11:52,651 --> 01:11:56,070
you just chat them. Do you
remember planking? Yes.

1335
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,820
Just imagine if he did it on your back.
You're laying on your back in the air,

1336
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:03,240
but you're hanging from the chin up on
your legs as straight out like that. Okay.

1337
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:06,030
Yeah. So I've been fucking
with that for like months,

1338
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,000
trying to build up the strength and I
got myself to the point because the whole

1339
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:10,680
thing is you've gotta be behind the bar.

1340
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,130
And what's great is I got this big
head so it kind of fucking, you know,

1341
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:16,700
there's a lot of weight
already behind the bar but,

1342
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,510
so I've gotten to a point
now where I can actually,

1343
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,960
like I used to be almost hanging upside
down and then gradually you can kind of

1344
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:23,730
bring,
you have your legs in a ball.

1345
01:12:23,731 --> 01:12:25,440
So like the way it is
basically underneath it.

1346
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,160
And I've gotten to the point now where
I can just start to extend one leg and

1347
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:31,980
then I fall to the ground. They ain't
bad. I'm going to get there though.

1348
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:32,940
You'll get there.

1349
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,610
I just want to bust that out one
time cause I got a buddy of mine,

1350
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,450
he has a bet with me that when
I'm 70 I can't do 10 pull ups.

1351
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,210
So just to fucking Sunday no,

1352
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:45,780
when I turned 70 70 to them
to catch the veteran. Yeah.

1353
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:47,240
As long as you just keep
going, you'll, you'll get,

1354
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,110
that's the thing
Stallone's in the 70s yeah.

1355
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:51,250
But if I don't say he could do 10 pushups,
right.

1356
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:54,990
[inaudible] if I don't have that
bet. I understand how that, fuck you.

1357
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,690
So it's a great carrot that I'm
chasing them. I understand. Yeah,

1358
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,300
you could do that though. It has nothing
to do with age. You can do that move.

1359
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,470
She's going to do, it doesn't have to do
with butter. Do Bacon and shit like that.

1360
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:05,690
Lifting,
just going to,

1361
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,960
you know the best way to do it honestly
start doing body weight exercises,

1362
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,540
do a lot of chin ups and stuff like that,
but do them really slowly.

1363
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,750
That's one of the best ways to
really develop like serious strength.

1364
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,270
Like a lot of people like to do chin ups.

1365
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,800
They like to do those like kipping
Chin ups you see in crossfit.

1366
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,510
What I like to do is what's kipping like
ego like you kind of like kick up and

1367
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:26,640
you kick up.
You're saying that's like cheating.

1368
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,060
It is like cheating but it's people who
aren't their back on the bench press but

1369
01:13:30,061 --> 01:13:32,670
it's a hard workout if you do
a bunch of them, but it's just,

1370
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,760
there's a lot of criticisms.

1371
01:13:33,761 --> 01:13:36,300
Why does crossfit have to be
done in front of everybody?

1372
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,890
Why can't they just stay in there?
Jim,

1373
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:40,350
why are they was running up and
down the street like look at us,

1374
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,870
we're working out. Cause it's like,
look at us, we're working out.

1375
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,800
Should I be more mature about that? Nope.
Nope. You should rub it in their face.

1376
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,530
They're like vegans and a lot of ways
they want you to know what they're doing.

1377
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:53,730
You know, it's like [inaudible]
like that's the, that's
part of the whole thing.

1378
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:56,250
It's like you become,
there's a whole article about that,

1379
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,830
about it's replacing
religion for a lot of people.

1380
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:04,040
They become tribal and you get involved
in these group a like group activities

1381
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,060
and you,
you identify with that group.

1382
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:08,940
Like you become a crossfitter or you
become a Vegan or you become a lot.

1383
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:11,320
I mean not there's anything wrong
with either one of those. One,

1384
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:14,350
it was like the gym is a good garage.

1385
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:17,710
Jordan is wide open and they're making
all this fucking noise and it's like,

1386
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:21,520
yeah, I work out too. You know,
I, I have the door closed. Ah,

1387
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:24,400
listen to a little iron maiden lately.
But that's part of the fun of it.

1388
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:27,190
They want everybody to know they're
doing it. So you walk by and go, wow,

1389
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:30,430
Billy's in shape. You know, looking at
that, looking at him, he's fucking lifted.

1390
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:31,264
He's doing,
I've been lying.

1391
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:35,280
I've been on says having breakfast and
like outside cafe and all of a sudden 20

1392
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,330
these maniacs just run by.

1393
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:40,900
You get to the corner and then
they run back the other way.

1394
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:43,210
You just want to fucking throw
your pancakes out of. Well,

1395
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:47,470
it's worse if you're walking and they,
they fucking almost run you over like,

1396
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:51,820
Hey asshole, this is not a gym. Okay, this
is the sidewalk. Like don't, this is not,

1397
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,510
there's not a place for you to conduct
your class. Maybe it's like a dream thing.

1398
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:58,660
Like they think the treadmill
is take up too much energy. No,

1399
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,583
I think you are right.

1400
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,830
They want people to know what they're
doing and you don't have the space to,

1401
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:06,190
you know, they have a track so they
just had to use a sidewalk. You know,

1402
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:09,760
I've seen that. I've seen like groups
of people run up and down streets.

1403
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,940
It's fucking stupid nose in Santa Monica.

1404
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,220
It was fucking laughing my ass
stupid sitting there running it.

1405
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,660
Fucking accountants,
but crossfit itself.

1406
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:22,540
What it does is it gets people to get
competitive and when they get competitive,

1407
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:24,850
the good thing about it is like
there's a bunch of people around you.

1408
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:29,150
You're all pushing each other. The bad
thing about it is a lot of people, they,

1409
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:29,580
they,

1410
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:33,220
their form falls apart when they start
doing higher repetitions and they get

1411
01:15:33,221 --> 01:15:35,050
competitive with it and then
they start getting injured.

1412
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,620
I know a lot of fucking people that
have hurt themselves doing crossfit,

1413
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:42,220
a lot of bells. People always
fucked themselves up right
behind every baby. Yeah.

1414
01:15:42,221 --> 01:15:43,360
I don't fuck with crap on those.

1415
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,940
These are going to do them slowly
and doing with correct form.

1416
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:49,030
The beautiful thing about kettlebells
is you can get a great workout with a

1417
01:15:49,031 --> 01:15:49,870
light Kettlebell.

1418
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:54,100
I could get a great workout with a 35
pound Kettle Bell Light Kettlebell,

1419
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:58,780
moving it slowly and controlling in
every step of the way and you can do all

1420
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:02,590
sorts of exercises. Go from one to the
other, one to the other and he'd give a,

1421
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:07,510
you get a full body workout that works.
It's actual functional strength.

1422
01:16:07,511 --> 01:16:10,150
Like it'll apply the affluent.
Even the reservation with the,

1423
01:16:10,151 --> 01:16:12,460
I'm going all old school,
I got those atomic holds,

1424
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,840
you know like did American Ninja Shit,

1425
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:16,300
those little fucking look like
little cannon balls. It was a great,

1426
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:19,570
I got those hanging
from my ceiling and uh,

1427
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:22,450
I'm trying to get the ones that looked
like the num chuck handles and I fucking

1428
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:24,280
went to order the thing and it never came.

1429
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:27,670
And then they sent me an email going like,
did you, you still want them? It's like,

1430
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:32,320
yeah, I order to go to rogue
fitness, rogue fitness.com
they have all that crazy,

1431
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,940
well that's what I bought my rack through
those guys and I've got a speed bag

1432
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:40,540
and then I'm going to get those Swedish
buzz and see if I can get myself up to

1433
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:44,830
be able to do a fucking Cuban flag.
Oh Shit. Well, I like to, Shit Lori,

1434
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:48,000
I'm working towards something. I can't
just get on an elliptical everyday,

1435
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:52,060
like I'm doing a half hour and the big
thing is what's my new playlist because I

1436
01:16:52,061 --> 01:16:55,900
will get bored shitless with that. But I
feel like with the speed bag, you know,

1437
01:16:55,901 --> 01:16:57,850
I suck at that,
but I'm getting a little bit better at it.

1438
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,420
I'm like learning something like, you
know, it's funny, my wife wanted it. Um,

1439
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:04,200
it wasn't man enough. I didn't
want to have a thing. But yeah,

1440
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:07,090
it's something cool about doing
it. But do you know, like Julio,

1441
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,340
Cesar Chavez didn't even know how to do
that. It's kind of useless for boxing

1442
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,140
and it gives you a little bit
of endurance for your shoulders.

1443
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:15,140
But when the fuck is going, last question,
my dream punch. Somebody like this,

1444
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,540
imagine someone stood in front of
you and you punched him like this.

1445
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:20,120
I think it was to build up your timing.

1446
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:22,640
Then also build up your arms that you
can keep your arms up shoulder and

1447
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:25,520
Terrence head. Yeah, right. But
Julio, Cesar Chavez, it's hilarious.

1448
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:26,960
He's one of the greatest
boxer of all time.

1449
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:30,530
He always used to laugh because he would
like try to do it and he couldn't do it

1450
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:34,210
like you then you get knock everybody
out in the fucking kill everybody.

1451
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:38,230
I mean he was a fucking monsters and dude,
I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to get into,

1452
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,790
in the, uh, I, I, we used to go
to Gleason's gym and, and they,

1453
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,640
and they knew why I was there and they
used to call me billary swank, you know,

1454
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:48,080
cause cause a million, million, million,
million dollar baby had just come out.

1455
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:53,380
Oh No. We had a great time. Charlie
Murphy once again gave me the lady there.

1456
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,790
He gave me, no, it gave me the
lay of the land. Charlie goes,

1457
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:57,950
you go down there cause
they, okay. He goes,

1458
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,830
you're going to be down there about
three weeks. I get a bad Charlie Murphy.

1459
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,540
He goes, someone's going to
come up to you and be like, Yo,

1460
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:04,580
how long have you been boxing?
Yo Yo, nice blah blah blah.

1461
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,760
Why don't you get in the ring goes do not
get in the ring because he wants to go

1462
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:10,670
in there and try out all the shit that
he doesn't have the nerve to try and get

1463
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:13,370
some professional fighter and you're
going to get fucked up. Right. Exactly.

1464
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,600
Three weeks. Whatever the fuck he
said on the nose, this fucking,

1465
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,200
this guy comes up, black dude from
Brooklyn starts coming into a white guy,

1466
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:24,490
stand up comedian from the suburbs.
Go, Yo Yo, nice man, you can box.

1467
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:27,560
I just started laughing. I got
to get the fuck Outta here. I go,

1468
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:28,430
I'm not getting the room with you.

1469
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:33,260
When he fucking laughed and walked away
and I told Charlie thinking he would

1470
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:35,600
laugh. You know, Charlie's just
so fucking real deal. He just go,

1471
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,870
I fucking told you.
It's like I told you,

1472
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,630
Charlie Murphy is one of
the best guys of all time.

1473
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:45,540
I did that Maxim tour with him. I got to
know him. We did 22 dates together. Yeah,

1474
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,250
he's a fucking great guy. I
really that dude. I really do.

1475
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,680
He's not one of those guys.
My fucking phone went in the toilet.

1476
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:53,840
I lost his fucking number,
so I'm going gonna be able to call him.

1477
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,290
I think I got it. I'll give it to
you. Oh, okay. Yeah. I love that.

1478
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:01,100
We've got to wrap this up,
dude. I'm sitting like 9
million hours of traffic. Joe,

1479
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:04,070
you're the fucking best. You've
been one of the top comics for what?

1480
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:08,090
2025 I don't know how many fucking years
since I was in Boston when I saw you at

1481
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:12,230
the cow lune and you did you tigers
fucking bit, which sounds like, oh,

1482
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:15,380
it's just targets. Fucking dude. The
ditch, the noise you made of the,

1483
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:18,200
the tiger was fucking unbelievable.

1484
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:21,770
I still remember your bit making fun of
the chicks out there with the hair like

1485
01:19:21,771 --> 01:19:24,680
a giant room. Oh my God,
you're a fucking monster.

1486
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:26,390
So I'm so happy for you that you're a,

1487
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:30,110
you've got another spa special that's
out on Netflix. It's called trigger.

1488
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:35,150
Please watch it. If you love
it, please rate it. So, uh,
you know, stay on the front.

1489
01:19:35,151 --> 01:19:39,000
Whatever that fucking scrolly thing
is. And uh, and that's it, man.

1490
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:41,420
You Ain't gonna Hook me up with some
elk meat. Fuck you. Right. Thanks bill.

1491
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:44,360
I really appreciate you don't
feel the same way about you, man.

1492
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:46,830
You're one of my all time favorites.
We're going to have a big hug f. Dot.

1493
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:52,010
All right guys. Thanks for listening. All
right. What's up Bill Burger here, right?

1494
01:19:52,011 --> 01:19:53,030
How great was that?
Ah,

1495
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:56,600
the Great Joe Rogan finally got him on
after nine years of doing my fucking

1496
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:59,540
podcast. Finally got him on. Um,

1497
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:02,780
and I didn't do any of the advertising
because I knew that it was going to be

1498
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,760
too interesting to sit
there and talk to that guy.

1499
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:08,280
So here's a little bit of advertising.
I what you're thinking. Oh

1500
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,990
Shit. Bill, the fucking advertising.
That's boring. Well, not the way I do it.

1501
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:18,460
All right, here we go. We
got a new one here. CSOS see,

1502
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:23,460
so s e so see,
so there you go.

1503
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,660
Fuck you man. All right. See,
so was the place for comedy.

1504
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,300
They won't tell you how amazing they are,
but I will evidently see.

1505
01:20:32,301 --> 01:20:37,170
So is amazing. It's comedy for
comedy nerds by comedy nerds, CSO,

1506
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,280
spelled c.

1507

Jesus, this is a big fucking thing.

1513
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:10,550
Cause those guys, those guys
hoard those specials. Um,

1514
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:14,370
those episodes including new episodes the
day after the air at the tonight show,

1515
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,140
sour and Jimmy Fallon,

1516
01:21:16,141 --> 01:21:20,600
Jimmy Fallon from New England
or you did so great. Um,

1517
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,770
and late night with Seth Meyers,

1518
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:28,250
the day after they air and they even
have classics like 30 rock parks and

1519
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:31,890
recreation and saved by the bell.
Um,

1520
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,040
are those already classics?
See saved by the bell.

1521
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:40,220
Even British comedies like the original
office with that dangerous guy,

1522
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:43,980
Ricky Gervais. Saul, what's he going
to do with the MEC is breaking up

1523
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:50,280
a smoke a cigarette,
the entire money python catalog,

1524
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:55,670
the it crowd and Steve Coogan as Alan
Partridge discover the next big names in

1525
01:21:57,211 --> 01:22:01,500
comedy and watched the icons before they
made it before they made it big like

1526
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,770
Louis Ck, Chelsea Peretti, Amy Schumer,

1527
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,780
Paul Burnham and so much more critically
acclaimed originals and exclusive

1528
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:14,781
content like harmonquest created by
comedian Dan Harmon and funny as hell a

1529
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:21,030
variety show featuring such comedians
as Jim Jefferies are Jim Jefferies and

1530
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,240
Hannibal Burress. Um, if
you're serious about comedy,

1531
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,570
you got to go to seeso streaming.

1533

1537
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,860
they going to say what CSO stands for.
CSO.

1538
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:53,070
I'm seriously igneous,
hammered egos, sucking Oscars.

1539
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:53,701
I don't fucking know.

1540
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:56,490

From critically acclaimed original

1547
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,910
Um, all right. Hey, speaking of
Joe Rogan, his, his company on it,

1548
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:26,620
on it has a new product.
It's called emulsified MCT oil.

1549
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:28,090
What the fuck is that?
Well,

1550
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:32,530
we're going to tell you MCT oil is one
of the fastest sources of clean fuel for

1551
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:33,880
the body and the brain.

1552
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,480
It's one of the best ways to power up
your performance and kickstart a weight

1553
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:41,780
management program. And I should do
that. Rub it right on my stomach. Uh,

1554
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:46,450
there are a lot of MCT oil brands
out there, but none there is none.

1555
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:50,950
Unlike the emulsified MCT oil from Onnit,
what's emulsification?

1556
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:53,920
That's like when you got Balsamic
vinegarette just sitting there, okay.

1557
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,850
In the fucking vinegarette goes away from
the Balsamic or vice versa, whatever,

1558
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:02,050
and fucking shit up in.
All of a sudden it's been combined.

1559
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:04,480
It's been emulsified.
You get it.

1560
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,840
It's like a carburetor when you got the
air in the fuel mixture and it creates

1561
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:10,930
that foam that you can't drink,
but it looks like a latte.

1562
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,700
That's some office suffocation.
Emulsification available.
Three delicious flavors,

1563
01:24:15,701 --> 01:24:20,410
coconut, Vanilla and strawberry.
Jesus Christ, that's me right there.

1564
01:24:20,411 --> 01:24:24,070
Coconut head, vanilla
skin, strawberry, pubes,

1565
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:29,080
emulsified MCT oil mixes like
a cream easily in your morning.

1566
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:33,210
Coffee without the need for
a black, no mess, no cleanup.

1567
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,440
You can even mix it
into your favorite food.

1568
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:39,700

1571
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:49,120

get out of breath from reading out loud.

1577
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:09,940
That's how dumb I am. All
right, seat Geek. Okay.

1578
01:25:09,941 --> 01:25:14,590
Buying tickets online for
sports and concerts has been
a confusing process for a

1579
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:18,910
long time. Now. There's nothing confusing
about it. It cost a fucking fortune. Um,

1580
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:22,510
it's always hard to find the best deal
for that game or show you want to go to

1581
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:25,000
and none of those older tickets
sites want to change that.

1582
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,040
But seek geek is different.

1583
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:31,480

do something like that.

1631
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:34,030
Just give me the copy and I'll fucking
read it. Oh yeah. I remember the time.

1632
01:28:34,031 --> 01:28:38,350

know we had a snowball fight coming up.

1633
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:41,690
I get it. You put this fucking thing on
shit and you don't lose it anymore. Yeah.

1634
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:43,990
For some reason they're going
to write 10 pages of Shit.

1635
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:47,110

locates misplaced keys, wallets, bags,

precise location with the tap of a button.

phone, press a button. Ah,

rings even when it's on silent.
