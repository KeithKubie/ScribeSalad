00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.100
Write the equation of
a line that is parallel

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.260
to line 2x minus
4y is equal to 8

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.550
and goes through the point 3, 0.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.440
So because this line is parallel
to this right over here,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.080
that just means that it
has the exact same slope.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.980
So it's essentially
saying, find the equation

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.650
of a line that has the
same slope as this line

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.361
and goes through this point.

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:28.610
So first, let's figure out
what the slope of this line

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.310
is, and the easiest
way to do that is

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.040
to put this in kind of
slope, y-intercept form.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.670
So we have 2x minus
4y is equal to 8.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.280
We want to solve
for y, we want this

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.020
to be in the form y
is equal to mx plus b.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.480
So let's add-- even
better, let's subtract 2x

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.230
from both sides, so we can
isolate the y's on the left.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.510
So that cancels out.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.150
And we have negative 4y is
equal to negative 2x plus 8,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.120
and I'm writing the
negative 2x first

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.520
just because that gets us
closer to the mx plus b form.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.730
Now, we could divide both sides
of this equation by negative 4

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.790
so we can isolate the y.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.920
So we divide everything
by negative 4,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.540
and the left hand side, we
just have a y is equal to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.710
and negative 2 divided
by negative 4 is 1/2.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.180
So y is equal to 1/2x, and
then 8 divided by negative 4

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.750
is negative 2.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.350
So we could write
plus negative 2

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.790
or we could just write minus 2.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.600
So we just rewrote
this line over here,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.100
but because we wrote
it in mx plus b form,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.950
we now know its slope.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.530
The slope of this line is 1/2.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.480
That right there is the slope.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.460
So the equation of the
line that we care about

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.430
is going to have the same slope.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.130
It's going to have the
form y is equal to 1/2

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.880
x plus some y-intercept.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.060
It's not exactly
this line. b is going

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.870
to be different than
this negative 2 here,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.520
but b is going to
have the same slope.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.430
They're going to intersect the
y-axis in a different place,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.780
but they're going to be
parallel to each other.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.400
So now, we need to figure
out how to figure out b.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.970
And to do that we have this
information right over here.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.930
On this line, the one we care
about, when x is 3, y is 0.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.950
When x is 3, y is equal
to 0, or we could say 0

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.610
is equal to 1/2 times 3 plus b.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.130
We just have to find a b
that sets up this equation so

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.190
that when x is equal
to 3, y is equal to 0.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.880
So we get 0 is
equal to 3/2 plus b.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:51.450
Subtract 3/2 from both sides,
and we get negative 3/2

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.230
is equal to b, or b is
equal to negative 3/2.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.490
So we have the
equation for our line

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.510
that is now parallel to this
equation, and goes to the point

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.800
3 comma 0.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.610
It is y is equal to-- it has
the same slope as this guy

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.680
up here, 1/2x, and now we know
its y-intercept, minus 3/2.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.352
And we are done.

00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:17.810
And actually, if
you're interested,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.230
you could graph these two and
see that they're parallel.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.730
So if you were to
graph these-- I'll

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.810
do just a very rough
graph really fast.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.900
So this is my y-axis.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.890
This is my x-axis.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.242
This line up here,
I'll do in blue,

00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:35.450
which is the same thing as
this line right over here.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.560
I just algebraically
manipulated it.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.240
It has a y-intercept
at negative 2.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.010
So negative 2.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.560
So 1, 2, at negative 2,
and has a slope of 1/2.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.150
So that means that for
every one it goes over,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.540
it only goes 1/2 up, or
for every 2 it goes over,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.050
it only goes 1 up.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.990
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.110
I'll try my best to draw it.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.010
It's going to look
something like that.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.185
And so this line over here, its
y-intercept is at negative 3/2,

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:04.560
and negative 3/2 is the same
thing as negative 1 and 1/2,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.060
so it's going to
be right over here.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.730
So it's going to
be right above it.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.670
Right over there and it's going
to have the exact same slope.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.220
So it's going to
be right above it.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.910
It's going to be parallel.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.510
Right above it, just like that.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.779
I'll do my best
to draw parallel,

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.070
and so it would look like that.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.329
They're parallel, but
they're different lines

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.900
because they have
different y-intercepts.
