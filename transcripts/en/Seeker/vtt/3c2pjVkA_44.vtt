Hey potty mouths, I’m Trace and this is
a frickingDNews Short.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.860
We’ve talked before about the history of
swearing and how it can relieve physical pain.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.110
And new research published in the journal
Social Psychological and Personality Science

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.040
found that people who swear more are associated
with higher levels of honesty and integrity!

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.180
F*** yeah!

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.980
I’m super honest!

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.310
Since swearing is a form of self-expression,
the researchers say those who do it more are

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.180
portraying themselves more honestly than those
who refrain.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.720
So, if you swear like a sailor (and I know
I do), you’re probably more honest than

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.190
people who swear less or don’t swear at
all!

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.230
In the study, 276 participants told researchers
how much they swear in their daily lives.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.190
They were then given a questionnaire which
assesses a person’s honesty using what they

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.699
call a “Lie Scale.”

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.499
By comparing those results with the person’s
level of swearing, the researchers found that

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.770
swearing was associated with higher levels
of honesty.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.329
In another part of the study, the researchers
analyzed over 73,000 Facebook statuses from

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.469
74,000 willing individuals in the United States.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.500
The statuses were run through software that
was programmed to find swear words and words

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.470
that indicate deception.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.910
Once again, those who swore more tended to
tell the truth.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.530
And there are other studies that may back
these findings.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.580
For example, in criminal cases, innocent suspects
were more likely to curse than guilty suspects

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.970
when denying accusations!

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.360
Plus, people who swear during jury testimonies
are perceived to be more credible!.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.790
So the next time your mom yells at you for
swearing, just say you were being honest!

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.150
Science says that's ok.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.300
See how that goes.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.690
Speaking of lying, is it ever ok to lie?

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.010
Check out this video to find out.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.540
What do you think about these new findings?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.940
Do you think people who are swearing are most
honest?

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.720
