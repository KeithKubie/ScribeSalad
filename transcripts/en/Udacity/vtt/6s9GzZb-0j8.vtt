00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.880
So now going back to reaction time, what's the best way to measure it? Should I

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.870
use a stopwatch? Should I use a computer based time test? Should I, as a

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.710
researcher, rate reaction time on a scale from one to ten? Or should I have the

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.570
participants rate their own reaction times?
