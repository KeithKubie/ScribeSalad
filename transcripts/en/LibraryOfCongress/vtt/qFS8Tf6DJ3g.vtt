00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.130
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Well, good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen and welcome

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.380
to the Library of Congress and
to the Noontime Lecture Series

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.710 position:56%
with today's program entitled
Witness, Aleppo, Armerian, Assyrian,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.470
and Arab Music, Stories, and
Images from Pre-war Syria

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.780
by Jason Hamacher sponsored
by the Near East division--

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.950
Near East Section of the
African and Middle East Division.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.920
On behalf of all my colleagues, I'd
like to welcome you to the series.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.070
I'm Joan Weeks, head of
the Near East Section

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.000
that is sponsoring this program
this afternoon and especially

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.120
for our chief, Dr. Mary Jane Dee
[assume spelling] welcome you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.210
and give you a few kind of
overview remarks about our division

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.240
and the hopes that
you'll plan at your back

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.800
to the research in our collections.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.540
The division is comprised of three
sections and served the collections

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.920
to researchers from
around the world.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.950
We cover 75 countries and
more than two dozen languages.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.340
The African Section includes all of
countries in Sub-Saharan, Africa.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
The Arab-- Hebraica
Section is responsible

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.620
for Judaica and Hebraica worldwide.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.090 position:56%
And the Near East Section covers all

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.270
of the Arabic countries
including North Africa, Turkey,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.930
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,
Afghanistan, and the Muslims

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.120
in Western China, Russia
and the Balkans

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.070
and the people of the Caucuses.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.500
So you see it's a very
wide range of coverage.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.320
After the program, we'd like
to invite you to ask questions,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.760
but this program is being
recorded so please know

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.920 position:56%
that that implicitly gives your
permission to be taped and recorded.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.190
So now, I would like to invite Dr.
Levon Avdoyan who is the specialist

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.340
in Armenian and Georgia to the
podium to introduce the program.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.170
Thank you.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.320
[ Applause ]

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.580
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: Thank you,
Joan and thank you for coming

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.150
out on Friday, which is usually the
end of the week and a trial for all

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.580
of you to get through
to our reading room.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.530
I want to welcome you to our
division, but I also want

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.920
to call your attention
to Ms. Thea Austen who is

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.920
from the American Folklife Center
who is cosponsoring this event

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.130
with us and we've done many
successful programs together

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.520
and it looks like this
is another one.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.660
Why are we doing this program?

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.200
Well, I met Jason in
the best of ways.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.100
He came in to the reading room
seeking our reference help

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.390
when he was working on an album and
we adore meeting people in this way

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.530
because we learn from them.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.020
And I learned from him
also that I could help him

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.760
up to a certain point,
but not past that point

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.890
and as luck would have it,
a very close friend of mine

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.950
who is an Armenian specialist from
Aleppo teaching at Whitman College

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.870
in Walla Walla, which
is not easy to say.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.320
Dr. Ellisa Mergion [assume
spelling] was interested

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.090
and [inaudible] meetings
and I introduced them.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.650
And the reason I'm saying this is

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.530
that to follow what Joan's just
said, we not only help people,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.970
we establish networks for
scholars and hook them

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.430
up with resources both
here and elsewhere.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.510
So what was he working on?

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.880
Well, he was working on an album
of Armenian chants from the Church

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.730
of the Forty Martyrs in Aleppo.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.760
And that was quite interesting.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.630
But what I also found out
interesting was that Jason works

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.800
on the musical and photographic
heritage of not just the Armenian's

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.600
of Aleppo, but the Jewish
communities of Aleppo.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.430
The Armenian communities,
the Assyrian communities,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.360
the Arabic communities of Aleppo
and those that know me realize

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.210
that although I'm an impassioned
researcher of Armenia and Georgia,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.250
I view all of these
cultures together.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.610
We've coexisted together.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.120
We've live together.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.660
We've experienced things together.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.890
So this was an exciting time
because he had already met

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.450
that time the Armenian album
but an album on Sufi music.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.520 position:56%
So it was a good opportunity to
demonstrate exactly what we do here.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.960
Now, as Joan said after Jason
Hamacher's presentation,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.840
there will be, I hope time
for questions and answers.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.350 position:56%
And also at the back of the reading
room as you leave, there is a survey

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.510
for you to fill out if you would
like to live your impressions

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.510 position:56%
to this program on to Jason Hamacher
who is a musician, a photographer,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.090
a documentarian and the owner
of Lost Origin Productions.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.290
He's also a punk rocker, a
rock drummer and has been

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.360
so for 25 years in the DC area.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.750
Now from 2005 to 2010 he went

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.900
to document ancient
religious traditions

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.010
and inadvertently captured
the AIPAC's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.640
of Syria's modernization before
the eruption of the Civil War.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.850
His combination of photography,
sound and personal experience

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.440
of the Syria offers an
unparalleled immersion into one

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.860 position:56%
of the world's oldest civilizations.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.160
Hamacher has I am told an adventure
spirit, passion for people and love

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.340
of culture and that's earned
him the trust of the Syrian's

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.860
across all socioeconomic
classes which allowed him

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.000 position:56%
to truly captured the essence of
the Syrian landscape and its people.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.610
His efforts contribute to the
international conversation on Syria

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.390
with frequent television, radio
print and live appearances.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.780
So we're very lucky
to have him today.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.450
He is recently spoken at the
United Nations in Geneva.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.330
He's been a guest at Saint
Mary's Church in Cambridge,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.180
the Armenian Museum and
Library of the United States

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.930
and at Dumbarton Oaks Research
Library and Collections.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.630
And he has appeared also on NPR,
BBC World Service, Al Jazeera,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.450
Voice of America-- well,
you get the picture.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.670
I'm going to stop talking and I'm
going to invite Jason Hamacher

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.400
to come and address us on a subject
which I find extremely interesting.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.870
And I am going to close
the door, first.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.010
Please welcome Jason Hamacher.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.310
[ Applause ]

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.350
&gt;&gt; Jason Hamacher: Thank you.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.820
Thank you.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.150
Never in my life would I think I'd
be speaking inside of the Library

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.110
of Congress and it is a complete
honor to be in front of you

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.990 position:56%
and share some of these experiences.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.230
So, that was a very
overwhelming welcoming

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.200
to actually hear it
spoken in person.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.820
I want to tell you a little
bit about how this happened

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.820
and that will explain what I have
and kind of seek the importance

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.210
of where it is in the
current state of affairs.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.600
Ten year ago my band broke up.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.730
I was in Arlington and I was really
frustrated with being in a band.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:46.190
Like, at any job or at any business
you have to rely on the people

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.500
that you hang out with,
that you deal with everyday.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:56.480
Imagine being in a van that
sits 10 people for eight years.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.120
It could be a little rough.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.750
So me and this guy, we grew up.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:07.260 position:56%
We grew up together and the-- we
end up pulling the plug and I wanted

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.740
to do something new creatively.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.670
I wanted to do something that
took the essence of punk rock

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.410
and I will describe that in
a little bit and combine it

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.550
with something new and kind of
push the limits of our creativity.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.530
So I wanted to do a symphony.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.750
Thirty drummers, theses
are lofty ideas.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.790
Thirty drummers, 15 guitars,
whatever and do something

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:36.350
that crafted symphonic movements,
not pop songs, but symphonic music

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.480
to some ancient vocal
tradition, something that puts us

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.620
at the Kennedy Center
instead of the 1930 club.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.920
That was the idea.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.600
And do I'm driving
through Rock Creek Park.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.820
I live in Mount Pleasant
and for those of you

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.260
that are familiar that's-- it's
a riven and there's a tunnel,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.200
right before you exit
and go up into the zoo.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.650
And my friend called and said,

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.440
"I found these amazing
chants from Serbia."

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.850
And what I heard was, "I found
these amazing chants from Syria,"

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.230
and totally misunderstood him.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.770
And it reminded me of a book of
a guy named William Dalrymple,

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.680
who from what I remembered I read
this book a couple years prior,

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.490
found the world's oldest Christian
music in the deserts of Syria.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.950
So Bill [assume spelling]
called said, "Dude,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.920 position:56%
I found this rod chants from Serbia.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.540
You've got to check this out."

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.280
And my response was, "I
never got to go to Syria."

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.580
I got cut-off.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.250
He said, "What do you--
no, no, no, Serbia."

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.570
I was like, "I know."

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.090
It sounded so amazing I never
got to go up in Damascus

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.330
and then my phone cut,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.030
because Sprint is not a very
good cell phone coverage.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.980
And so what happened
was I go to this tunnel.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.560
It's maybe about 30, 45 seconds.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.800
I've recall reading a
couple of pages in this book

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.020
where this guy describes
allegedly one

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.410
of the world's oldest
Christian traditions

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.130
and my memory thinks
we've got to rock

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.140 position:56%
out to this ancient Christian music.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.840
So I come to the other side of
the tunnel and I call Bill back.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.420 position:56%
I said, "Hey, man, remember the book

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.500
where the guy finds the
chanting in the desert?"

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.340
He's like, "I said,
Serbia, Caucus Mountains."

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.670
I was like, "You, you
do your Serbia research,

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.100
I'm going to do my Syria
research and I'll hit you

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.400
up at the end of the week."

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.700
It's like Tuesday or something.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.960
So I go and I get my book out
and I'm flipping through it

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.860
and I'm very impatient and
I can't find the two pages

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.400 position:56%
that describe this ancient chanting.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.850
So, I get on the internet
and I find an email address

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.220
that I figured would go to either
his publicist or him personally

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.720 position:56%
or the publisher someone to read it.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.160
So I put, you know, these are
the bands that I use to be in

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.190
and this is the places
I've been on the planet.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.620
I love this book.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.900
I love to get a copy of the CD.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:08.880
And so to make sure that someone at
least opened my email in my caption

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.990
or my address, I put
potential speaking engagement

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.290
in Washington, DC.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.520
And the engagement was speaking
to me on the telephone, right?

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.100
That was the way I
was dealing with it.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:27.070
And so to my shock, he opened it
and emailed me within four hours.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.370
He was in the UK.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.890
He said, "This is great idea.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.900
I don't know where you
can hear this music.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.170
When you go to Syria tell them at
the airport, this is what the--

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.890 position:56%
how you get to the neighborhood of
high Syrian and the city of Aleppo."

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.760
He's like, it's not a
monastery in the desert,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.880
it is a church among the
worlds oldest of the cities.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.250
I was like, "I am not going to
Syria to start some rock symphony.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.660
I'm not doing it."

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.350
But the twist and this is
where everything changes was

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.010
that it wasn't a monastery
in the desert,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.210
it was a Syrian Orthodox Church
in this small neighborhood.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:10.560 position:56%
Three years prior, the last tour I
ever did, I took a week off and flew

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.340
in the deep Eastern
Turkey with my camera.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.450
I'm a photographer and drove
4000 miles over the course

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:22.670 position:56%
of six days photographing the entire
historical Armenia, Mesopotamia

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.080
and stumbled into the Syrian
Orthodox Church because I wanted

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:33.040
to hear the language of the
Syriac, Aramaic being spoken.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.790
So here we are.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.410 position:56%
All of the sudden, this music I
want to hear is from this community.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.730
So it was like, I got to email
the archbishop I had launch

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.860
with on the planes of Mesopotamia.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:50.420
So, again, I'm on the internet
and I find another email address

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.970
with no corresponding website.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.610
It's info@syrianorthodoxchurch.org.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.620
There is no website for
syrianorthodoxchurch.org.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.320
This is just an email address.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.840
So, same email.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.400
This is the authorized book
to, this is the book I read,

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.080
these are the places I've been I'd
love to get a copy of this music.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.560
And then two days later, the
archbishop of the United States

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:19.520
for Syrian Orthodox emailed me back
saying, "This is a fantastic idea.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.400 position:56%
Next time we're in your-- the next
time you're in New York come and sit

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.950
down with me and we
can go over your idea."

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.490
I was like, "Oh, OK let's talk."

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.720
So I emailed and ask if it would
be OK to talk on the phone.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.300
We had a phone conversation and he
said the music that I was looking

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.790 position:56%
for was one of their oldest
traditions and he didn't have a copy

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:46.060
of it to send me, but he could
send me something similar.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.130
And I said, "Where do I get a copy
of the music that I'm looking for?"

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.490
He said, "Well, we don't have one."

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.590
I said, "Where do I get one?

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.020 position:56%
I'm willing to pay whatever it cost
to get it shipped from Syria to DC."

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.240
He said, "We don't have
a recording to send you."

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.330
Its like, "Period, you
don't have a recording.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.320
1800 years you don't have this
recorded and I can't hear it."

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.620
He said, "No."

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.110
I said, "Do you want me
to make one for you?"

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.410
He's like, "What?"

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.880
I said, "I'll make a recording.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.580
I can make an album."

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.380
I said, "That's my music career.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.680
I can make records."

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.350
And he was just like, "Do you--
if you know how, yes, OK."

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.610
So then all of a sudden my rock
orchestra goes out the window

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.980
and all of the sudden
I'm going to faced

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.500
with a potential reservation
initiative and so we had to go

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.310
up in New Jersey and came
up with this whole proposal

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.530 position:56%
on how do I record a music, an album
on ancient chants and what does

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.680
that mean and why am I doing
it and, you know, everything.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.890
So that is the beginning
of this entire project.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.490
I totally misunderstood someone
and then just started sprinting

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.690
into the wind to preserve
the ancient chant of Syria.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:04.320
And so I was ready to go for the
first time in February of 2006,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.640
which was the same month
that cartoonist did a cartoon

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.310
and inflamed the Middle East and
my trip was promptly canceled

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:17.150
and I was told I was potentially
never going to be able to come.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.870
And then the archbishop of Aleppo,
he was the one that was kind

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.190
of bringing me and housing me.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.060
I was staying with him.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.130
He called me and said, "I
cannot guarantee your safety.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.200 position:56%
I have no idea when this will be OK.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.100
I'll let you know."

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.300
And so I told my wife,
I was just married.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.840
I've been married a couple months.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.230
I don't think I'm going to Syria.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.280
They have riots in the streets.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.010
And then my wife was like, "Great."

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.310
[ Laughter ]

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:50.770
And so in character to the region,
nine days later I get a call,

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.200
"Everything is totally fine,
you can come next week."

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.170
And I was like, "Wonderful."

00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:04.430
So, I arrive and I was confronted
with an image that was one

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:10.330
of the more life changing images
I've ever seen and it was, one,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.380
I was an official guest
of the church.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.680
I didn't know what that meant.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.470
And then, two, no one
came to pick me up.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.290
So, I'm just at the airport.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.020
I cannot speak a leak of Arabic
with my bags and a little bit

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.580
of Arabic written down the
address of the archbishop.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.150
So I'm just standing around,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.020
hopefully someone is
going to let me in.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.480
And the reason why no
one came to pick up is

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.790
because Bishop Yohanna had gone on
television with the Grand Mufti,

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.040
the head of Islam for
Syria, Mufti Hassoun

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:47.990
and together they were denouncing
the riots together in unity

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.610
and it was broadcast on television.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.880
They were standing side by side
and it was so striking to me

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:03.400
that this dual attack of
pluralism was something

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.190
that was on national television.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.310
It doesn't happen in
a lot of places.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.380
And it was very, very interesting.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.100
And so that was set the tone for
my entire experience in Syria,

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:21.050
all these extremely delicate
centuries old relationships back

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.320
and forth and it was
really incredible.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.660
And to be honest as I said,
you know, I'm a punk drummer.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.960
I know zero about the
history of Syria

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.160
at the beginning of all of this.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.230
And so the first couple
trips is just me

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.440
by osmosis absorbing the
culture, listening to everything,

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.580 position:56%
kind of spending time, a lot of time
with this much people as possible.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.160
And after that first trip in
2006, then I had to get permission

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.130
from the Syrian government.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.220
Not a big deal as someone
that's not a diplomat

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.970
or any experience politically,
whatsoever.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.130
So I put my proposal together,

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.340
fax to Syrian embassy
and called, "Hello.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.640
This is Jason Hamacher.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.610 position:56%
Do you get a chance to review my
proposal for this project in Syria?"

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.500
"No, we haven't."

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.330
"OK. When can I call
back to confirm?"

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.630
Two weeks.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.630
And I called every
two weeks for months

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.970
and months and months and months.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.710
And then a political
scenario happened.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:33.210
Hezbollah and Israel started
fighting each other and I, again,

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.650
not understanding how
sensitive that makes the region.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.310
I called and I said, hey, at
this point we're all first name.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.610
"Jason, how are you?"

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.690
"Pretty good.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.460
Get a chance to review
that proposal?"

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.410
"No, we haven't."

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.600
OK. In the very amount of
fact they not condescending,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.650
the woman that answer
the phone goes,

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.530
"Have you been paying
attention to the news?"

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.940
I was like, "Absolutely."

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.670
"So you know that Israel and
Hezbollah are kind of fighting."

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.430
I said, "Oh, yes, yeah."

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.630
"So, which means that we are on
high alert and I have no idea

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.710
when anyone is going to be
able to review your proposal."

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.520
I said, "I totally understand."

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.320
And this is verbatim what I said,

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.920
"I'll call back when
the war is over."

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.300
As it fell out of my mouth,

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.050
I realized I was never
going to return to Syria.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:33.010
I was completely embarrassed
and the woman just goes, "OK."

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.310
[ Laughter ]

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.660
And so that was it.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.960
It was over.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.640
You know, I knew that that was
just completely embarrassing.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.580
I would never be able to go.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.880
And so I just-- I don't know.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.420
I got to go one time and
see all of these things

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.360
and have all these
really nice photos

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.700
and then two weeks later I
got a call from the embassy

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:56.750
where someone had read my proposal
by accident and he's father--

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.230
one of his fathers best
friends attended this one church

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.510
in the one neighborhood in Aleppo
and had just past away and he went

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.020
to his funeral and the son went.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.020
And so he was like, "Yeah, I heard
this amazing chant at this funeral

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.620
and then I came back to work
and found the proposal trying

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.390
to record it on someone's desk."

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:20.720
He's like, "Is this you?"

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.770
I was like, "Yes."

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.010
He's like, "When can you come in
and meet with the ambassador?"

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.810
I was like, "Whenever
you want me to."

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.800
And so, that's what led to the next
several phases of this project,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.260
the former ambassador from Syria
to United States invited me over

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.010
and because I'm, you
know, a lone wolf.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:43.330
I'm not official journalist
or representing anyone other

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.520
than the sake of preservation.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.450
He kind of green-lit all
my ideas and then one

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.360
of the components was I wanted

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.570
to photograph extensively
these older neighborhoods

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.650
in the City of Aleppo.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.680
And I'll be showing you a lot
of these photographs later.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.790 position:56%
And he's like, "I'm a big art's fan.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.360
I'd love to see your photography."

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.120
I was like, "I didn't
bring any with me."

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.030
And so I was invited back
and I showed him my vision

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:18.360 position:56%
of my first trip and he kind of
tasked me to make a book on the City

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.910
of Aleppo and that's
something I've been working

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.140
on for the last eight years.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:28.450
And, at this point, I always
like to say I was never paid

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.290 position:56%
by the Syrian government in any
way, shape or form to do any of this

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.360
but far more valuable
for those of you

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.250
that are know, he cut
all the red tape.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:44.630
So, I was given inside access to
all these places inside the city

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.350
that most Syrians don't
ever get to see.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.710
And so over the years, things
developed, things developed

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:56.350
and then I made my actual
first recordings in 2008

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.210
and this is what it sounds like.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:03.430
So this-- now, I'm going
to explain why I do this

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.760
on record in a little bit.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.900
So this is called "Holy
are you God".

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.990
It is from the ancient
tradition of Edessa and this is

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.140
from that little neighborhood
inside Aleppo.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:25:32.240
[ Singing ]

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:40.690
So at the time of that
recording which is 2008,

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.940
five people on the planet
were the masters of this.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.530
That's dramatically dropped.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.090
Dramatically there are five.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.400
There are now three
since this recording.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.930
So that was in 2008.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.590
Those recordings will
be in production

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.230
with Smithsonian Folkways.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.370
This album has been in
production for 10 years.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.660
Hopefully, it will come out
within the next year or so.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:11.900
But, on that first trip in
2006, every single minute

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.600
of my time was accounted for.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.950
You know, the archbishop had
me doing everything with him.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.330
One day he had me sit and
remember I cannot speak any Arabic.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:25.570
I just sat down and he wanted
me to kind of photograph

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.500
and see what his day looked
like in the day of meetings.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.040
So, there's a big kind of
grandiose hall, about half the size

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.250
of this room, just as high
ceilings and I just sat on the side

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.630
and people came in and out all day.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:44.150
And the first person that came in
was an elderly widow who was asking

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.630
for assistance to just
keep her house

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.250
because she couldn't
afford it anymore.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.250
One was a businessman who was
coming in to plan financially.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:58.630 position:56%
They were building a hospital in one
of the suburbs which you can now see

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:03.770
on YouTube, just being
totally decimated.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.960
To the highlight of the day
was the Prince of Greece.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:13.680 position:56%
The Prince of Greece came in who
was his sister is the Queen of Spain

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.760
and the bishop thought it was
really funny always to make me all

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.310
of a sudden launch into, "Jason,
this is the Prince of Greece.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.850
Tell him what you're doing."

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:29.450
I was like, "What do I"--
I was like, "Forgive me.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:30.750
What do I call you?"

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.340
I'm like, "Is it your highness?

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.640
What do I?"

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.940
He's like, "I'm Prince Michael."

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.070
I was like, "Prince Michael" and
then yeah, I go into these things.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:39.800
And so it was back and
forth and during the course

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.620 position:56%
of this six hour extent of meetings,
this elderly man walked in kind

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.690
of unannounced and it looked
like he was lost, to be honest.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.420
He just kind of sat down
and we're sitting there

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.830
and the bishop was speaking
and he broke and just goes,

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.210
"This is the leader of the
last Jewish family in the North

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.030 position:56%
of Syria," and he just kept talking.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.840
I was like, "What?"

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.260
And so, I was, "Yeah,
nice to meet you.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.490
How are you?"

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.790
And so-- well someone had told me

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.340 position:56%
that there is this amazing
historical synagogue inside the city

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.800
and afterwards I asked
him about the synagogue.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:24.040 position:56%
And, someone's remote control car
is going out of control in the back.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.340
Is my son here?

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.990
He's three.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:32.460
So essentially, the-- I
asked him about the synagogue

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.640
and not recognizing the
weight of an official guest.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.120
He felt complied-- compelled to
take me inside the synagogue.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.870
So, in 2006, I got to go in the
ancient synagogue of Aleppo.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.160
The foundation has been
traditionally held.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.730 position:56%
It was built by King David's general

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:55.680
and the current structure is the
oldest continual used structure

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.870
in the entire City of Aleppo.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:01.760
Meaning, it was never destroyed
and rebuilt-- I take that back.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.780
It was never repurposed.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.910
Meaning, it's 1600 years old in the
dead center of town and that leads

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:13.920
to the second phase of
my experiences in Syria

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.520
which was I ended up doing
a photo exhibit here in DC.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.910
at the JCC on '16th
of the synagogue.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:27.810
A synagogue exhibit, which led to
me working with a Jewish museum,

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:33.080
that's not open yet in New York as
their documentarian and explorer

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.640
for all of the Jewish
properties in all of Syria

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.790
and the project was the photograph
document and assess what was there,

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.150
what's left, what is everything.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.290
And so, I did that
in 2008, '9 and '10.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:56.570
2010, unannounced the
government support

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.000
for that project was totally bold.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.220 position:56%
So I showed up and I was not allowed

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.040
in to anything that
was Jewish anymore.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.640
I was allowed to go.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.950
I could bring all my
equipment but I couldn't go in.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:14.230
And so I had free time
for the first time

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.750
in my six year experience in Syria.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:22.030
So I started out of boredom
recording all of the places

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.870
that I used to walk
by, just my walk.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.970
This is what my day
sounds like in Syria.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:32.650
And so, the Forty Martyrs Armenian
Church is located in a neighborhood

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.110
with the best restaurants, right?

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.950
And so I would go there and
that's where I would have lunch.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.290
There's this place called
CC House or Casa Cavalli.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.640
You know, you'll see some of
these photos in a little bit.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.460
And I went in and would asked,
"Hey, I'm-- I've got some time off.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.970
I'm a guest of the bishop.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.810
Would you permit me to come
in and make these recordings?"

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.460
So, I made them for no
other reason but just

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.840
to kill time walking
around the ancient city.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:06.830
And that was October of
2010 and then I was going

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.820
to return in May of 2011.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.780
And then, I'll never forget
this I was at Del Chess

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.530
in Dupont Circle talking with a
friend Inash [assumed spelling].

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.060
He was a former diplomat
from the Syrian embassy.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:25.180
We were talking about how
insane the Arab spring was

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.100
and we couldn't believe
how it was happening

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.650
and how it would never
happen in Syria,

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.280
neither was ever thought
it would happen.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:40.890
And then, I think it was nine days
later it kicked in and it happened.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.420
and I was in shock as most people.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.780
A part of my shock was not because
of what was happening but was

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.740
for the first time in my life, I
was connected to a world event.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.840
That's not something music related.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.590
You know my music community is
real small and it's influential

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.550
but it's not world news
in any way, shape or form.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:07.950
And so all of a sudden--
and I just become a father.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.180
So I have-- at this point,
I'm totally sleep wrecked

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.790
because I've got a daughter that's
weeks old and the war has kicked in

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:20.820
and this Smithsonian has
officially accepted the project

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.770
and it just keeps getting worse.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.500
And so, in my little Facebook feed,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.720
all of a sudden I'm
getting commercials

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.530
for Syria related things,
"Oh, you've typed Syria in.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.420 position:56%
You would be interested in buying
this or buying that," and it started

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.600
to disgust me, to be honest.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.340
That, all of the sudden,
no one had cared anything.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.850
Like, I would try to tell
people, "Hey, I'm going to Syria."

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.390
Like, "That's cool.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.090 position:56%
What else-- tell me something else?"

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:55.250
And so all of the sudden that,
there's destruction happening.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:59.640
Now it's considered commercially
viable and I'm getting ads

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.790
about this on the computer.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.910
So, I stopped working on
everything, to be honest,

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:10.140
in solidarity for what's
still happening.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.400
And so, I stopped working
on the book.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.580
I stopped working on the
albums and all of this

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.590
and then it just kept worse and
getting worse and getting worse

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:25.170
and then it came up North
and then it was in Aleppo.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:29.510 position:56%
And, now all of the sudden, at first
it was kind of mentioned everyone,

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:34.740 position:56%
you know, I am like NPR feeds or
BBC or something but now it's on TV.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.360
Now it's on the news.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.680
So people are starting to ask
me, "Hey, didn't you go there?"

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.980
I was like, "Yeah.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.770
Remember when I tried to talk to
you about and you didn't care?"

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:50.430
And so, we were-- all of a sudden,
people are now asking me "Is

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:51.790
that what the place looks like?"

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.570
I'm like, "No, absolutely not."

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.590
And so, I decided to take up,
"OK, I need to finish this book

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:02.480
so I can show people what
this place really looks like."

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:08.430
And so, I have a really good memory
for where I went but not names

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:10.640
of anything, people,
place, anything.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.350
So the way that I do my captions,

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.580
I get on Google maps
and I retrace my steps.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.540 position:56%
I retrace the way I walk and a
friend of mine was on Facebook chat.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.400
He's like, "Hey, I need you.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.520
Give me the name of this mosque
because it's my favorite place."

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:30.790
And as we were trying to figure
this out, the full blown attack

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:34.430
in Aleppo started on the
street and he was like, I--

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.320
he's like, "Dude, guns are
going off in my house."

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.150
He's like, "We should
probably get off the computer."

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:45.200
And he was like, "If I don't
make it, you're in charge

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.630
to show people, to show people."

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:55.770
And so I'm crying because,
again, I'm a punk dude.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.070
I'm not an academic.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:00.590
I didn't go to college,
which it doesn't make--

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.920
it doesn't matter a lot but all
of the sudden, I'm finding myself

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:10.150
in this juxtaposition and I
was like, "Yeah, I'll do it."

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.280
He's also a professional
photographer.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:17.570
His family have-- has been in
the City of Aleppo for 750 years.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.520
They used to be the
governors 500 years ago.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.340
And so, I said, "Yeah, I'll do it."

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:28.930
I was like, "And let's stop the
online chat so you could go hide."

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.230
He made it through the night.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.530
Everything is fine.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.830
He's still alive.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.420
And so, everything
changed at that point.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.720
I was like, "OK, it's real.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.790
Let me start doing this."

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:43.540
And so, then it just
kept-- this is 2012.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.030
This is three years ago and
it just kept getting worse

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.700
and worse and worse and worse.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.230
A friend of mine came up from
Richmond in 2013 and said,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:36:01.110
"You're sitting on a huge archive
of information and you need

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.560
to do something with it."

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.860
I was like, "I am.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.160
I've got this book.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.460
I've got this album in Folkways."

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.860
He's like, "When are
they coming out?

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.160
Where can I see them?

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.460
How do I learn?"

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.590
I said, "I don't know."

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.500
He's said, "Do something else."

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.520
And so I decided to do what
I've done in my whole life.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.720
I made more records, right?

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.720
I started my own record label.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:29.030
And so, I hadn't listened to any of
these recordings since I made them.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.540
They're just been sitting
in my house.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:37.420
So, the name of my record label is
"Lost Origin Sound" but the first

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.030
of my release it was "Nawa".

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.230
This is the Sufi album.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:50.140 position:56%
And-- So this album, this is the
first time they ever let a westerner

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.420
see them or hear them.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.720
They were practicing outside of
a Sufi lodge in the courtyard

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.590
of a 500 year old house
in the ancient city

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.700
and this is one of
my favorite albums.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.900
And my friend Bassil [assumed
spelling] that introduced me

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:12.360
to these guys, his great
grandfather to my surprise was one

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.290
of the most influential Sufi
Sheiks in Aleppian history.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.460
So he made the call and they
kind of vouched for me to come in

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.150
and allowed me to make this album.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.440
So I'm going to show you
what this sounds like.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.400
It's one of my favorite recordings.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:33.790
And so it was two different
recording sessions.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.090
It was like a trial run.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.310 position:56%
They want to see if I can handle it.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:42.150
And then there was the second one
where they kind of let me come in.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:46.020
So this is called "Fasel
Kesmet Al Sawi".

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:51.310
I'm going to play in a bridge
version because it's a very wrong--

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.930
this is essentially a prayer.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:38:01.580
And I'm going to tell you
after this why we record.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:33.180
[ Singing ]

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.580
To tell you a little
bit about these guys,

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.990
the founder of this
group was 15 years old,

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.560
and on this recording he's 17.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.530
And the guys-- the main
voice you hear, he's 20.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:52.420 position:56%
So everyone was between 15 and 55
and the 15 year old, his teacher was

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.180
in his 90s and past away and
left him a pile of manuscripts

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.100
from the mid 18th century.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.690
And so, they took these manuscripts
and they had to do it outside

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:06.700
of the Sufi lodge because they
weren't practicing these modernly

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:12.840 position:56%
and we're doing it in this courtyard
and that's what we're listening to.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.640
So--

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:53.280
[ Singing ]

00:39:53.280 --> 00:40:00.220
In rock terms, that's
called the hit, right?

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.590
I love that record.

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:05.920
And as I said my daughter was four
months old when that was recorded.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.890
So that was her lullaby
when she couldn't sleep.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:12.360
I'd throw on the Sufi recordings
and make her go to sleep.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:18.170
So, before I end with the
slideshow, there's a--

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.970
it's really opt that we're
in the Library of Congress.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:25.290
All of these traditions are
heavily academically researched,

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.590
all of them.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:31.480
And as someone that's highly
inquisitive, I couldn't find

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.040
that much on where the
research into this stuff.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.490 position:56%
And so, what I kind of found is
once I started to really try to dive

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:44.580 position:56%
into it and figure out where to get
this, this whole building is nothing

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:48.390
but information and all
these academic depositories

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.800 position:56%
and repositories all over the
earth, there's a lot of information.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.900 position:56%
And for someone like me that's an
experiential learner, it's difficult

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:01.550
to jump in to a lot of these
books that are just information.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:02.850
I wanted a story.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:05.730
Where is the story about this

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.110
or where is the story
about the Syrian Church?

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.470
And I could read all
the details about it

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:17.410
but it wasn't hitting me the
way that lyrics do, essentially.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:21.410
And so, when I decided to
start putting my records out,

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:25.930
I wanted to tell the
story of the communities,

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.150
not just the information
about the communities.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:34.860
And so, all of these records are
extremely expensive to produce.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:41.090
I say that because each individual
record has to be representative

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.870
of not just the music but of the
community that this is a recording

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:46.980
of and it's not my decision.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.980
I have people.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.620
Everyone on the recording
has to agree that this--

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.720
not just represents them but who
they are and where they come from.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.350
So there's always native script.

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:01.300
Since this is Sufi, this is Arabic.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.660
This photo was taken by my friend

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.510
that that I had told him we
should get off the computer with.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.730
He took this photo personally.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:13.190
And then for those like
me, there's always a map.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:17.250
There has to be a map that
sits the modern country

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.460
of Syria with current boundaries.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.300
And that's what brought me
to the Library of Congress,

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.170
for the Armenian album which
I'm getting ready to show you.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:31.640
How do you delicately draw the
boundaries of historical Armenia?

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.920
That's what I came to live on,
to figure out how to solve,

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:43.460
which gets me to my second album
which is the "Forty Martyrs" album.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.630
It is-- I went deep on this one.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.160
Anytime you add a fold,

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.800
it gets significantly more
pricey, so I put in three folds.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.620
So, triple gate fold.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.110
The punk rock at me has always want
to do this and never been able to.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.600
So now that I'm in charge and
I'm losing money permanently,

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.180
so let's just lose
a lot of it, right?

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:12.260
So, the native script here,
these are actually the notes

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.720
that we were taking while the
recording was happening and all

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.750
of the photography is my
photography from inside.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:22.140
Metaphorically speaking
that background of all

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.140
of these is a photograph
I took in 2002

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:30.390
of the ancient City
of Ani, and map again.

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:35.840
This one is the shortest
album, and Armenian--

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.960
the Armenian community is--

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.070
and I learned all of this
as I'm doing the research.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.500
I know none of this
until it comes time

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.400
to figure out, "OK,
what am I doing?"

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.690
Is the tradition of
[foreign language].

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.890
Did I say it right?

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:55.650
So I'm learning and
pronouncing things correctly.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.350
Inside the Forty Martyrs
Church, there's a wall

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.120
of all these different stone
carvings, which are crosses

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.340
and that tradition is actually

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.750
on UNESCO's defined list
of intangible heritage.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:12.300
And I didn't have enough
music for a two-sided album.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:18.430
So for this one, I put a silkscreen
of one of the oldest carvings

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.010
on the backside of the album

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:24.760
and this is a 16th
century stone carving,

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.040
that's the backside of this.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:30.740
So what we're getting
ready to do is,

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.880
I'm going to show you
some photographs

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:42.760
and play you some Armenian chanting
but I want to read a poem first.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.430
With all of these, this
is not a solo effort.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.110
I have to rope people in.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:50.100
I am clearly not the
expert, just the enthusiast.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:55.150
So I went to New York and I
sat down with one of the heads

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:59.880 position:56%
of the Armenian theological seminary
and he told me about this poem

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:05.970
which was written in 1947 when
they were trying to-- when they--

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:10.340
when Russia was trying to get
Armenians to move back to Armenia

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:14.290
and this guy's older
brother, he was at--

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:18.810
this guy is a survivor of World
War I, of the Armenian catastrophes

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:23.850
on World War I and had relocated,
built his life back up in Aleppo

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.380
and was thinking about moving
back to Armenia with his brothers

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.930
but his brothers discouraged
him from coming.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:34.160
So in his torments to figure out
whether he should stay or go,

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.950
he wrote this poem
called "Farewell Aleppo."

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.970
I'm going to read it for
you before I play the music

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:45.300
and the photograph I put
on here almost everything

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.610
in this photograph
is totally destroyed.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:53.220
It's either ruins or just
not in existence anymore.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.140
So this is "Farewell Aleppo".

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:01.270
"You are in Arab City,
my honorable birthplace.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:07.180
My eyes opened and I saw you,
I knew there was no other city.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.700
My second fatherland,
with your Syrian people.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.680
You became the good
protector to the Armenian.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.060
You gave us bread and shelter.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.270
We have lived always together,
as brothers Armenian to Arab.

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:24.570
We have worked always together,
as a Syria without guile.

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:31.080 position:56%
The day of our separation is near, O
alter of the light of my childhood.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.730
We shall ever remember you, O
alter of the hope of my childhood.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:40.810
Etchmiadzin's carillon rang out,
calling her children to her.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:49.990
I am parting from you with
love, City of Aleppo farewell."

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:56.230
And, that is the poem for all of us

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:00.450
since the city is essentially
destroyed.

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:04.040
And so, I'm going to play--

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.620
I'm going to show you
guys some photographs.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.220
They're minimally captions.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.830
I do it that way because that's
the way I experienced it.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:13.920
I kind of knew what I was looking
at but really and I want people

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.120
to see the beauty of the country.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.460
And a lot of people ask me,

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:23.000
"Why don't you do a before
and after slideshow?"

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.100
And it is because it
is very difficult

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.240
to erase the memory of
something destroyed.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:34.920
I always talk about going to see
my grandfather at the funeral home.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:41.800
It's hard to lose the memory of
the way he looks in his casket.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.170
It's really difficult and it
takes time for me to think back

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:51.080
to when I was six and we
were playing in the yard.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.700
So this is the yard.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:48:00.400 position:56%
This is not the casket, which brings
me to-- it's a very symbolic day.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.880
Three years ago today,
the archbishop

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.360
that housed me was abducted
by terrorist and he's gone.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:13.010
And so there's little
information about it at the end.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:15.710
And so, as you can hear, I'm
extremely emotional about all

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:17.440
of this because it's so heavy.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.670
So, this is the "Forty Martyrs"
album that we're going to play

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.930
and then I'm going to
show you some photographs.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.230
And then, if there's any time, you
guys can ask me official questions

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.530
or hit me up in the lobby.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:53:06.510

00:56:27.510 --> 00:59:19.720

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:25.640
So, clearly, the war wages on.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:30.150
Some insight the day that
the Forty Martyrs album came

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.820
out the church was bombed.

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.840
The structures that were in the
photographs are still there.

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.280
It came in the courtyard.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:43.260 position:56%
So the scope of all of this and this
archive of information that I have,

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:47.390
the information is the same but the
context changes on a weekly basis.

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:52.960
And so what I'm trying to do is
go around, put my record player

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:59.380
and my stories and my pictures
and just expose for the sake

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:05.440
of knowledge, what this place
was and the only reason I went

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.420
from the very beginning and I've
been like this my whole life

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:12.310
from my bands to my music to
this, to my photography is

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:17.250
to show the thread of how we
are the same as humans as oppose

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:21.760
to how we were different and I
hope you got some of that today

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.510
and I thank you for coming.
