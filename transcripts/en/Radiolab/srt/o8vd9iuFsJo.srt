1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Oh wait, you're listening.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,750
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N y.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,373
S. C e. Yep.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,660
Are you surprised that this is so popular?

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,770
Am I surprised? You know what I'm
surprised about? I'm surprised that,

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,270
um, this morning I was walking to
the subway and I was like, man,

7
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,930
I want to listen to my k-pop playlist.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,293
Yeah.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,040
I guess I'm a little
surprised with that myself

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,303
taking notes.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,340
Robert [inaudible] fantastic.

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,660
And I did listen to it and it
was amazing and I, it's just,

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,140
it's undeniable.

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,920
Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich,
Radiolab [inaudible] oh, sorry. No,

15
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:03,160
no, you go, no, no, no. Like today,

16
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:07,240
a story from a reporter,
Alex Young. Hi. Hi.

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,381
We're just to set it up.

18
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:13,381
This story for us connects to one we did
a few podcasts ago about Gary Hart and

19
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,740
the moment when,

20
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,360
how we covered politics changed this
story is about a similar change that's

21
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:22,460
happening right now. Right in front of
our eyes in South Korea. So we're like,

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,870
we're going to travel a few thousand
miles. Yeah. And in this one,

23
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:29,830
all the usual dynamics you would expect
in this kind of story get totally

24
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:34,670
flipped. It's not about politics at
this time. It's about music fans. Yeah.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,390
It's going to sound a little bit like
a music pieces you've already heard,

26
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:38,800
but really it's a puzzle.

27
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,850
If you really admire someone
and love them and so on.

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,910
How much do you want to know
about? About them? Really? Yeah.

29
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:48,070
Is it tell me everything
or tell me nothing.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,840
And if someone does try and tell you
everything, at what point do you say, stop

31
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,510
you ready? I'm ready. Where do, where
do you, where should we begin? Well,

32
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,960
I think before we get to like the
moment that I am very excited about,

33
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,820
I need to kind of give you guys a little
bit of of the world in which all of

34
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:17,540
this is going to happen. Okay. And so
we're going to start with this woman.

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,050
When I tell my friends about it,
I kind of describe it as a prison,

36
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,880
but it's a prison you
decide to walk into. Okay.

37
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,690
So this, this is Sarah Wolfgang. Um,

38
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,050
I was a former trainee for
Kate pop group in Korea. Um,

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,920
and I'm here to talk about
that. Sara is Korean American.

40
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:40,940
She was born in America, but I
actually grew up in Korea. Um,

41
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:45,590
my parents both worked for the military.
And you were living in soul? Correct.

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,730
Okay. Yongsan Seoul and Sarah says
that her whole k-pop adventure,

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,700
it all started with her because
when she was growing up,

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,890
I really never liked school,

45
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,880
so my parents were kind of
wanting me to do something else.

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,310
I think they still wanted me to finish

47
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,110
school, but they encouraged her to
try out acting, to go to auditions,

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,050
try out for school plays. And when I
was in high school, about 15 years old,

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,440
maybe 10th grade at her head shots ended
up getting passed to a South Korean

50
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:18,550
record company. And when we received
the phone call, they were like, oh, hey,

51
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:22,480
you want to come in and audition
for a k pop group? And I was, uh,

52
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,300
I actually denied it. I really
didn't want to do it. Oh.

53
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,030
But then she thought maybe this
will lead to an acting job.

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,100
So I went in and then they're like, okay,

55
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,610
they put me in front of a camera
and there they asked me to um,

56
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,910
sing and I'm not the best singer,

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,610
but that doesn't really
matter to K-pop. Nope.

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,130
Everything you know can be touched up
really well. To make a long story short,

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,240
they ended up offering her a contract
of more than five years and as part of

60
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:52,540
that contract, we were asked
to move into the dorms.

61
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:54,770
[inaudible]

62
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,550
there are these facilities that all of
the agencies have for further idols and

63
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,680
training. They described
it like a boarding school.

64
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,690
All the kids kind of live together and
so I moved to the dorms with six or seven

65
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:10,530
other girls and it was here that Sarah
says the company basically kept them

66
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:14,040
under lock and key. Well,
they didn't lock us in there,

67
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,020
but we weren't allowed to leave.

68
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,320
It's like one of those cockroach prisons
or like those ant prisons you can walk

69
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:25,610
in but you can't walk out. Why is
she doing this again? Well thank you.

70
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:34,720
[inaudible]

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,870
let me explain to you guys just
like how phenomenally huge k-pop is.

72
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,700
K-Pop actually started in
Korea in the early nineties,

73
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,520
but like in the last five or so years,

74
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,523
it is just

75
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,640
build out into the rest of the world.

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,530
And by some estimates it was generating
like around $5 billion a year.

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,970
And then if you throw in like
k drama, k soap operas, um,

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,100
which is called the, how you wave that,

79
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:07,101
how you wave in 2012 was
valued at $83 billion.

80
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,010
Jesus. Yeah. And nearly all of this,

81
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,320
it's based on a kind of fantasy
because k pop stars are, you know,

82
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,820
products of fantasy world.

83
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,020
That's Professor Souk Young Kim Theater
Studies at University of California,

84
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,080
Santa Barbara. I studied
k-pop industry. You know,

85
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,100
f stars are the embodied forms of Manga
and enema and all these unrealistic

86
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,350
figures that don't exist in real life.

87
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,410
So they have to have
really beautiful face,

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,770
beautiful body, you know,
excessively long legs, broad eyes,

89
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,540
pale skin flowing hair. They are
not the creature of this world.

90
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,820
They shouldn't be, you know, they own,
they can only exist in fantasy world

91
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,400
in that fantasy. That's
what trying to manufacture

92
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,030
in those dorms, like they
wanted us to lose weight. Um,

93
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,920
so we would wake up at like four or 5:00
AM in the morning and then go hiking.

94
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,770
Sarah says after the hike
they'd come back eat breakfast,

95
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,040
which usually consisted of lettuce,
then they'd have dance classes,

96
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,580
singing classes, and
then we have lessons of,

97
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,600
I think they're called like humble lessons
where basically this guy would show

98
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:24,080
up to the dorm and he would
teach us to bow correctly.

99
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,480
So like we would have
to bow in unison. Um,

100
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:29,030
so that we seem to as
like one big happy group,

101
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,850
they weren't allowed to have
cell phones, no computers, nope.

102
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,910
Or a relationship of any kind.

103
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,860
All companies pretty much don't want you
to be in a relationship. And in fact,

104
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:43,100
one of the girl too can
told me that in 2011,

105
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,760
the, one of the members of 21,
which is like a whole group

106
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,970
managed by YJ Entertainment,

107
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,740
revealed that their management said
they should not be dating before age 29.

108
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,780
What? Oh my God,

109
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,530
they shouldn't be dating because stars
belong to the public. To the fence

110
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:09,970
and

111
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,270
that was a thing. It was like a
purity thing. No, that period.

112
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,850
Angelic Virgin Madonna image. This
by the way, is k-pop writer, a g park

113
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,150
editor@largeatsoompi.com like girl groups.

114
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,130
These are calling like nations fairies.
You know, they had this pure Chast um,

115
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,930
image to them and the boy bands too,

116
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,010
because that being single makes
them more marketable and appealing.

117
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,010
And Adrian says that's, that's
the main takeaway. Of course,

118
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,920
there's all kinds of cultural
observations that you can make about this,

119
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,560
but the main driver here is economic.

120
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,910
The founders of K-pop knew back in the
early nineties that the fans would love

121
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:50,200
the starves even more if the stars
weren't just beautiful and perfect,

122
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,340
but they also seemed somehow available.

123
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,790
You would be surprised how many
k-pop stars come out and be like, oh,

124
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,630
I've never had my first kiss yet. And
they're like 1920 years old. Kind of like,

125
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,420
I have it on my first kiss.
Will it be with you? You know,

126
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,080
in feeding the fantasy
kind of thing. Way, way.

127
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,040
Is that all that different
than America? I mean,

128
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,110
didn't you feel weirder or
stranger or something or when,

129
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,670
what's when like, I don't know,
Catherine Zeta Jones married that guy.

130
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,420
Whatever his name is. Yeah. I don't really
wanna think about his name cause it,

131
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,960
it changed things for me. Me
Too. I didn't have that feeling.

132
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,130
I mean I would come on you. Oh, you're
always going on about Meryl Streep.

133
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,670
She married by the way to
me. But no, she doesn't know.

134
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,720
She is married to a chill, very
quiet man is a sculptor, you know?

135
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,340
How does that make you
feel? I look around.

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,580
It just shows to see like what does he
got through? I don't have no with that.

137
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,000
My point is, is it that
diff? I mean America,

138
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,920
the American celebrity culture has
fantasy woven into of course yet,

139
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,800
but there's a big difference
in Korea, that fantasy world.

140
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,730
It is so extremely controlled,

141
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,490
way more than in America
according to Sooki on camp.

142
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,920
And it's controlled not
just by the agencies,

143
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,880
by the fence to the extent that
it defies all of our common sense.

144
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,710
What do you mean? I'll
give you an example.

145
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,640
This one I heard from professor CQ and
Kim and also writer Leslie. Tim Bucko.

146
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm the editor in chief of soul beats.
It's a big k pop k entertainment site.

147
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,583
Okay.

148
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,880
2008 there was this new girl group,
girls generation halls, girls generation,

149
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,900
girls generation is a nine member.
All Girls Group. That was like

150
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,710
hearing on like music shows and like
variety shows being promoted as like

151
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,950
the girl next door.

152
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,840
I'll cute and you know like the ideal
girlfriend kind of idea unless he says

153
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:46,430
that on some of these shows girls
generation would appear with boy bands,

154
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,640
you know, who were also
promoting at the same time.

155
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,480
Groups such as super junior ss five oh one

156
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,670
and devious k. Okay.

157
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:03,770
So these three groups in various shows,

158
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,140
they would be like standing
next to each other on stage

159
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,490
talking to each other
during variety shows.

160
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,280
And this is where we kind of
get into the cultural stuff.

161
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,420
There are several times when
they're onstage with one
or more of these boy bands

162
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,670
and they're kind of taking the microphone
from the host or whatever and kind of

163
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:26,870
just nodding their head. Whereas the boy
bands are like doing these deep Babs,

164
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,980
some of the fans are seeing
this and they're thinking
that's disrespectful. Why?

165
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,570
Why would that be disrespectful? Well,

166
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,650
the thinking is that since
girls generation is a new group,

167
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,580
they should be bound much more
deeply than their soon bays or their,

168
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,770
their seniors being, um,

169
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,270
a rookie group is a big deal in Korea
because seniority is something that people

170
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,880
hold very strongly. And so as a rookie,

171
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,760
you have to show deference to the
superior, you know, senior groups,

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,750
they're not showing respect. They're not
showing deference just in the bowing.

173
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:59,960
That's how some of the fans were taking
it. But I mean, aside from all that,

174
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,250
and this is the key,

175
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:06,251
is that some of the fans thought that
the girl's generation girls were flirting

176
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:08,810
with some of the boy
bands, like, you know,

177
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:12,710
with these little side long glances or
teasing them. And so that interaction

178
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,730
[inaudible] seeing that fans were
very, very, very upset about that.

179
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,540
And so all the fans of the three groups,

180
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,460
the three boy bands got together
and decided to do a black ocean.

181
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,563
What is that?

182
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,653
Yeah. That we're going to get there.

183
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,870
Fast forward to June 7th, 2008,

184
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,250
all of those bands that were on those
TV shows are playing this big k-pop

185
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,720
concerts, this um, event
called Dream Concert,

186
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,740
a huge stadium show, like
more than 40,000 fans. And um,

187
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,580
the call souk young told me that there's
one thing you need to know about fans,

188
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,190
about k-pop fans at live
events. They all light sticks

189
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,490
and they come in different colors
cause each band has its own color.

190
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,770
Super Junior for example, has blue.

191
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,460
And when they appear on stage you see this

192
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,350
light sticks waving in support
of their stars on stage.

193
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,580
So they played for while.

194
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,010
And when ss five Oh one
comes out, a whole place just

195
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,771
turned to light.

196
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:25,360
Green show goes on TV
XQ comes to the stage.

197
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,120
They were like the biggest band
at the time. And then upload

198
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,430
thousands and thousands of
these ruby red literally lights.

199
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,480
And at some point girls'
generation takes the stage.

200
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,760
And here's the thing, pretty much
as soon as they walk on stage,

201
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,110
all the people in the audience

202
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,230
turn off their light sticks. [inaudible]

203
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,560
what? Suddenly there was black
out in the whole auditorium.

204
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,830
Everybody stops clapping,
screaming, silence.

205
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,240
Were you saying like the whole,
like everybody, 40,000 people? Yes.

206
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,810
And if you look at look up pictures
of it, it was a stadium performance.

207
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,430
The entire stadium was black. No
Way. Yes. Way. Look at this picture.

208
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,040
Oh my God.

209
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,633
[inaudible]

210
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,080
well I are we looking at
this? It's totally black.

211
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,280
It's like a whole football stadium. This
isn't photo-shopped or something. No.

212
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,330
Cause if you look down in the corner
you can kind of see the pink girls

213
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:25,160
generation section. Oh
yeah. There's a little,

214
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,370
there's like a list of pink
pink as their color. Yeah.

215
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,990
And then everything else is black girls
generation had to sing and dance to the

216
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:34,250
silent crowd.

217
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,270
Oh.

218
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,070
Has anything like this ever
happened before? Never. Well,

219
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,380
how on earth did they pull that off?

220
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,320
How could you get this many
people doing the same thing? Okay.

221
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:46,320
So the way that these shows happen,

222
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,070
at least at these dream concerts is that
different sections of the auditorium

223
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,140
belong to different fan groups. Oh. So
they sell it as Zeland seating. Right.

224
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:58,910
So the fan clubs actually get to
like dole out the tickets. Uh,

225
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,810
and during the show there's this moment
where some of the fan club leaders stood

226
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,420
up and held up these
signs that said, quiet

227
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,220
dude, this is that. This
is that upsetting. Yeah.

228
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,130
Do you understand about this robbery?
Like it doesn't seem like the most weed.

229
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,510
He soon I've ever heard a little blink
of an eye, a little leaning forward,

230
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,090
a little failured about, but that's
just the difference again. Okay.

231
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:27,780
Wait a second, if you, if you would
allow me to frame for a second. So yeah.

232
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,080
So what have we learned so far?

233
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:33,400
We've learned that this is a global
phenomenon mirror this well mate,

234
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,290
it's a global phenomenon.

235
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:40,291
Born of the nightmare of these stars
who seem to be tightly held in check by

236
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:44,110
everybody, the fans and the agencies.
Everybody. That's what we know.

237
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:45,280
So that's what we know. So, okay.

238
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,900
And this sort of tight control is how
it operated for quite a few decades.

239
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,100
But, and this is why

240
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,130
I wanted to do this whole story in the
first place just a couple years ago in

241
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:58,160
walks to this guy

242
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,240
and he just messes everything up.

243
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,300
Hey,

244
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,540
they are radio lab [inaudible]

245
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,703
yeah.

246
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,750
We sent an interpreter with a mic over
to the Gangnam district and sold. Oh,

247
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,030
they got numb style to speak with a guy
named Leon young Goo JPM but you know,

248
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,100
he told me to call him Mr.
Lee. Hello? Hello. Hey.

249
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,630
I hopped on the line from our studio
in New York when I got started. Yeah.

250
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,850
Are you guys ready? Yep.
Okay. So here's the story.

251
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,510
Bozo Tacome [inaudible] early 2002
y'all need to put through retirement.

252
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,850
Mr. Lee, he was working at a news
organization called sports soul,

253
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,580
which did all kinds of
things, not just sports.

254
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,780
They also did like business and
entertainment, dodgy. And then young

255
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,291
[inaudible].

256
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:52,030
He was actually in charge of all the
online news and while he was there,

257
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:57,031
I think it's fair to say that he
took his reporting very seriously.

258
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,180
Like he always had this
idea in his mind. Yeah.

259
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,800
One team, one [inaudible].
Who do I [inaudible]

260
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,980
I believe any contents that
can be published that's
possible to publish should

261
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:12,680
be freely published. That's the kind of
culture that would be better to have.

262
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,920
So he was a guy who believed
in an independent press,

263
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,160
but he also knew that there were certain
things that he just couldn't report on

264
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,070
how it looks out of your soul.

265
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,660
[inaudible] having gone that certain
subjects like politics. Oh, your mother.

266
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,360
We're just dangerous. We do.
How, how, why, what is it,

267
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,720
what you're talking about? We, we
actually need to back up a little bit.

268
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,190
Put this into a little bit of context.
So between like after the Korean war,

269
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,730
between say the 60s and the 80s, um,

270
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,860
South Korea was under a series
of military dictatorships.

271
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,720
And there was basically a
censorship of the press.

272
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,370
Things got a lot better in the 90s
when they turned to civilian rule.

273
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,960
But even today,

274
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,340
the government still has a branch
that goes around the Internet and,

275
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,170
and deletes websites, uh, for
their content. So this is the,

276
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,240
this is like the world in which the press
is living in a Brazilian [inaudible].

277
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,220
So getting back to Mr. Lee, it's 2010.

278
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:17,840
He's at sports soul having dreams of
independence and he feels like politics is

279
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:18,674
a little tricky.

280
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,200
So he does what to me feels like a
little bit of a Trojan horse moved.

281
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,740
Have you all day titled Basically he says
if I can't do independent reporting in

282
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:31,430
politics, I'll just sneak
it into celebrity news.

283
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,600
Uh, so [inaudible] [inaudible]

284
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,850
and so we looked on the Internet for um,

285
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,280
Hollywood news and media in the UK at

286
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,970
[inaudible] Hall and looked
at what they doing every

287
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,970
day. So he studied the sun, US weekly.

288
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,920
TMZ wait, he studied
TMC. That's what he said.

289
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,950
You know how they take their pictures?
How close do they get? Cause there isn't,

290
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,980
there wasn't Paparazzi in Korea and we
decided to apply that to South Korea.

291
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,330
So what,

292
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,830
what kind of tactics did you use to
get the photos in the first place?

293
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,920
She didn't publish it.
You can go on board.

294
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,760
We decided the best way to do the
reporting is, you know, by hiding it

295
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,990
a car, their first target where
these two stars, John Young,

296
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,880
who is an idol from a boy band called
shiny huge band and an actress,

297
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,700
her name is Shinsei Kyung,

298
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,130
TD Ritani is all,

299
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:43,270
first you have to go through the
information gathering process.

300
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:48,271
So they tailed both the stars on and off
for one month to get a sense of their

301
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:51,340
movement patterns, you
know, and they figure out,

302
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:55,330
they have this pattern of meeting up in
front of her apartment really early in

303
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:58,330
the morning, like three in the morning
or something. And they take [inaudible]

304
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,190
these walks.

305
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,050
So I've seen in TD detainees late October,

306
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,340
2010 it came to a point where we couldn't,
we couldn't miss the opportunity.

307
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,960
They call this, I guess they call this
the De de [inaudible] dating a date,

308
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,780
which I think is pretty funny.
And on this particular day,

309
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,400
one of Mr Lee's reporters,

310
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:21,090
steaks out the apartment and the two
stars meet up to take their walk.

311
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
Okay. And

312
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,650
you get the very first Paparazzi
photos as far as we know in Korea.

313
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,800
So these photos are, so what?
I think they're so cute.

314
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,430
It's these two idols, you
know, walking down the street,

315
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,780
hand in hand under these
yellow streetlights and they
just look like they're in

316
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:44,740
their own little world.

317
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,510
There's this one photo where he's pulling
back her hair and I think he's putting

318
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:53,140
like an earbud in her beer and
they're, maybe they're sharing a song.

319
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:57,430
They're listening to a song together.
Oh, he's got her purse on his shoulder.

320
00:19:57,431 --> 00:20:00,040
You know, he's just
holding her bag for her.

321
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,320
What happens when the photographer
guy runs up and goes, well, the,

322
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:06,970
the guys at sports, so kind of
drew this line. They're like,

323
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,300
we're gonna keep back a
distance from the celebrities

324
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,180
coming through a car window. Right.
Do they see the guy? No, they don't.

325
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,610
And that's why these photos there,

326
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,020
it's not like that typical
like hands in the face photo.

327
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:24,760
They just look totally serene this
moment. These two innocent, innocent,

328
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:28,540
they have no reason to expect anyone to
be out there. Right. Because you know,

329
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,860
before this moment there weren't Paparazzi
photographers stalking celebrities

330
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,320
like this. This is Eden
right here. This is Eden.

331
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,530
Yeah. This is before the fall.

332
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,950
[inaudible] Mr. Lee said right
before they published, um,

333
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,930
and this has sort of
become their tradition.

334
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,070
All of the reporters got together and
stayed in the office all night and

335
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:56,740
everybody was on pins and needles
because you know, they didn't know.

336
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:58,090
They didn't know what was gonna happen.

337
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,830
Are people going to be outraged or are
they gonna be totally excited about this?

338
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,640
They just had no idea
what was going to happen.

339
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,370
And you also will have no idea what's
going to happen until after the break.

340
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,443
Yeah.

341
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,430
Hey, this is mark from a story of Queens.

I hosted esoterical talk show in

00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,750

Cafe Jad Robert Radiolab.

354
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,560
Back to our story from reporter
Alex Young. So when we left off,

355
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:15,100
we were talking about leaving Gu.

356
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,450
So you need Mr. Lee and he and his team
had just captured the first Paparazzi

357
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,480
moment in South Korea. They had
taken a picture of these two stars

358
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,270
[inaudible] the photos were
pretty dark and super grainy,

359
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,460
totally pop brought
style like shot in night,

360
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,480
probably from a zoom lens like
thousands of yards away come

361
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,730
[inaudible] it was hard to
tell the photographs really?

362
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,470
[inaudible]

363
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,390
so he says that they all got
together in their office.

364
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:48,180
They were just about to publish
no idea what was gonna happen.

365
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,820
And when we first published them,

366
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,060
nothing really. Really?
Yeah, seriously. Oh, come on,

367
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:59,130
I'm kidding. There was general response

368
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,100
[inaudible]

369
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,190
people went crazy. Oh my
goodness. Oh my goodness.

370
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,960
[inaudible] the photos went viral.

371
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,670
It just took the whole country [inaudible]
there wasn't an incredible amount of

372
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:23,900
web traffic down there go so
much that our servers were

373
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,310
breaking down. So people clicked.

374
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,620
Oh yeah. When it all comes down
to it, people really want to know.

375
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,200
At first they just, you know, they
just inundated the website, uh,

376
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,820
trying to look at these photos.
But then they were like, oh, oh no.

377
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,730
So then they rushed over to the fan
sites and four of the websites from the,

378
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:48,050
the boy band, the guy crashed, shouldn't
say [inaudible] Young's website,

379
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,970
which is called the mini humpy page.

380
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,060
It just gets flooded with comments or
his file comments about how the fence

381
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,690
felt. Betrayed.

382
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,650
People were like posting deface
pictures of her in typical, um,

383
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,730
sexist ways. She got the brunt of it.
This is always the way it is, right?

384
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,480
Just like in America, that's the way
it happens. In Korea. [inaudible] put

385
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,440
[inaudible], you know, when
I talked to Lehman Goo,

386
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,530
he was the first one to recognize
that you ain't going pylon.

387
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:20,860
And Pennzoil usually when this
kind of scandal breaks, it's the,

388
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:24,260
it's the woman who gets it
worse. Yeah. Yeah. What,

389
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,510
so where would the, how we do,
how did the agencies respond?

390
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,330
[inaudible] shock in the beginning to
tell that the companies were not prepared

391
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,100
because their official
statement would be like,

392
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:40,390
we've talked to the celebrity about this
or we had no idea this was going on.

393
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,690
And you could see that the companies
were struggling. There's actually,

394
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,060
you know, a couple times later on where

395
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,200
God, the fans got really crazy

396
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,580
and they would actually protest at
like their live shows or whatever. Um,

397
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,220
and then pretty much the next
day, like after the protest,

398
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,470
the idol at the center of
that scramble would just

399
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,740
kind of vanish. Like they would just take
a indefinite hiatus from all of their,

400
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:10,190
like promotional activities. Like you
mean like the agencies just Yank them?

401
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,380
I mean, yeah, that was
the suggestion. Yeah.

402
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,360
Did the agency say
anything about that to you?

403
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,740
No one would go on the record with me,

404
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:20,630
but I did talk to some people over
email and they said that, you know,

405
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,830
when fans react this way, they're
kind of forced to take drastic action.

406
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:28,550
So they kind of confirmed that
they were disappearing idols.

407
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,210
They confirmed with me that
they were uh, taking action.

408
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,880
But here's what ends up happening and
we'll tell you [inaudible] more than just

409
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,310
calling you says, you know that very
first scandal that they broke. Yeah,

410
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,020
they got a lot of backlash,
but it showed them

411
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,480
that [inaudible] worked in the foreign
media could also work in South Korea.

412
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,410
[inaudible] so it gave us strength
to keep experimenting. So in 2011,

413
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,230
Lehman Goo and like a couple
of the people from sports,

414
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:04,070
all they break off and they formed
this company called dispatch.

415
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,880
And then the [inaudible]

416
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,410
following years, 2012 2013 this
is this really important chunks

417
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,530
time where they just start
pumping out scandals and

418
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:22,070
getting them. Gen Docs must've done
more than 10 stories. Small and baby.

419
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,680
Do you want to hit list? I do
want to hit the list for stuff.

420
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,880
There's parks Gian,

421
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,910
she's dating Mr p Hora with John Young.

422
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Then tack Jaan who gets
caught with Jessica brain
dating Kim t and you have Yuna

423
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,840
dating Lisa Sankey Selling
Chisholm. That was like a crazy one.

424
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:42,470
And of course we all remember Beck, Yan
and [inaudible], I don't remember. Oh,

425
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,980
I remember it. But according to

426
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,780
seek in Kim, you had so many scandals
in such a short period of time,

427
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,340
headlines after headlines,

428
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,700
headlines at such a frequent
rate, that fence became somehow

429
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,660
desensitized

430
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,600
by this news. It shook us and I'm
going to put myself in there now. Yeah,

431
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,300
it should go. So according
to writer Aga Park,

432
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,890
what you saw after this crazy
onslaught of scandals is um,

433
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,340
well a couple of things. So
the Paparazzi became a trend.

434
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:19,070
Something that all the crane
entertainment news started picking up.

435
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,250
There starts to be all these other
Paparazzi companies that come out

436
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,700
competitors. Exactly. Just like
dispatch, but with a different name.

437
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,760
But the craziest part I think is that you
start seeing celebrities tiptoeing out

438
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,640
and telling the truth about
their lives. Little by little,

439
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:37,490
the celebrities would get more
comfortable about revealing it themselves.

440
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,720
For instance, in 2012 on this talk show

441
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,770
[inaudible] who is a member of
this k-pop boy band, he made ways,

442
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:51,390
because he explained that
celebrities dating cards

443
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,500
in order to get away from
all these new Paparazzi,

444
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,990
they parked by the Han River
and they have their dates there

445
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,190
and there are parking lots where multiple
celebrities park and have their secret

446
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:06,300
dates inside the car.

447
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,650
This is something that people always
sort of suspected was the case,

448
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,620
but it was Kinda like the first time
it was just out in the open like that.

449
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,100
And I think that that

450
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,520
audience reaction is like super telling.

451
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,780
You can hear it in the tape
there. They're laughing.

452
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,720
So he's breaking the spell
and what you expect is, yeah,

453
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,920
what you get is casual
laughter. That's a sea change.

454
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,070
That's a real CJ. So this happened
in just two years. You're saying?

455
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,610
We probably have to say five years.
You have. It's still, I mean, that's,

456
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,700
see this actually does make me
think, I mean, well first of all,

457
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:47,240
it's interesting to think of Paparazzi
as liberator's in this game. Totally.

458
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:50,540
Totally. Because we used to think
of them as like scum, but, uh,

459
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,150
I mean if you pan out, here's
literally the thought I'm having.

460
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,620
Like there's a tendency,

461
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,210
cause we're done westerners to sort of
see what happens in places like Korea as

462
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:02,160
being very different from us.
Like culturally separate. Yeah.

463
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,770
With the city to hear that they change
that quickly makes me think in some way

464
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:10,490
that we're all very similar or maybe
we're all headed to the same place.

465
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,470
I'm like, tabloid is the great equalizer.

466
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,550
And maybe we were all gonna
just end up all of us in

467
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,943
Postcard Dashi and hell,

468
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,270
like literally like this is how far they
traveled in five years and literally in

469
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:28,271
another five years you will have the
Kardashian family of Korea dishes all the

470
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:32,060
time and we're making sex tapes
on their own, whatever it is.

471
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,230
I also thought the same thing, you
know, being from America, you were like,

472
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,790
Whoa, this is just inevitable. But,
um, I actually don't think so anymore.

473
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:41,980
Aga told

474
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,450
me a story that really changed
my mind. Uh, it was like,

475
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,830
it was our Watergate was our k-pop
gate. It was, it changed everything. Um,

476
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,210
this story, it, it revolves
around [inaudible].

477
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,410
You're still going to do that. This one
young female solo artist [inaudible]

478
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,910
she's, she's just hugely popular.

479
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,541
I mean,

480
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:10,541
they actually call her the Korean Beyonce
and in 2013 she was just killing it

481
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,690
yet by this point, Eylea
has a couple albums out.

482
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,410
Her youtube videos have
millions and millions of views,

483
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,750
but then wait a minute.

484
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,020
November, 2013, a bomb drops.

485
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,250
Oh, that's [inaudible]

486
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,410
what happens is this, this
guy cold calls dispatch.

487
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,090
Mr. Lee actually picks up and he recorded
this phone call between them and the

488
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:43,810
guy tells him I have
nude pictures of Ailey

489
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,830
[inaudible] yeah. That's really
tells the guy watching the video.

490
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,640
We need to know how you obtained these

491
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,830
guy says [inaudible] okay. I
received them. Okay. The Sukkot,

492
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,880
you want to buy this from glio
somehow [inaudible] yeah. The singer

493
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,400
[inaudible] the singer gave
them to you? Yes. Real. Why?

494
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,280
[inaudible] I was her boyfriend.

495
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,280
What is exactly as he asked you. So,

496
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,790
so he's calling dispatch to see how
much these nude photos are worth about

497
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,320
[inaudible] and when I was
talking to Mr. Lee about this,

498
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:27,321
he said that in that moment when he was
on the phone with [inaudible] Tinika as

499
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:32,100
a reporter, I was greedy about
the story and the information.

500
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,160
He said that he wanted those pictures.

501
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,450
But what he ended up telling the guy is,

502
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,540
uh, to the [inaudible] in the,

503
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,050
we don't want your photos.

504
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,470
[inaudible] and then if you keep
listening to the sound call,

505
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:49,850
you can hear him with Hello
Phil. We have that just

506
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,440
[inaudible]

507
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,530
start getting really upset with the
ex boyfriend. Like this is not right.

508
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,670
You're crossing a line. So to
make a long story short, um,

509
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:06,671
dispatch turns down the photos and
the photos somehow make their way to a

510
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,060
competitor's website.

511
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:13,090
This one American k-pop
website called all K-pop,

512
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,110
who is, um, pretty big.

513
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:19,160
They are probably the number one k-pop
site at that time in the world yet or

514
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:21,460
free for English speakers,
English speaker, um,

515
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,950
the published and they get picture
of, they're the ones who publish the,

516
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:27,230
the naked pictures, remember
if they sent it or not.

517
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:29,750
But if they did it wasn't a very
good job like you could see.

518
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,760
So the photos come out and what
would you expect to happen? Um,

519
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,970
some anger maybe a little bit and then
basically people just click on the

520
00:32:37,971 --> 00:32:40,460
pictures. No, what actually happens is

521
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:46,550
instantly the entire k
pops world bands together,

522
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,990
black ocean style and just comes
out against all k-pop. The agencies,

523
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:52,400
they start threatening to sue.

524
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,640
This competitor website starts this
boycott and in just a few days the figure

525
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:01,520
was like 22,000 Twitter followers
just stopped following them.

526
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,750
Really their, their reputation

527
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,640
tanks.

528
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,350
It was a warning to them, you know,
don't mess with us. And so, um,

529
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,500
they really haven't re,

530
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,890
I mean I haven't really followed them in
awhile but they haven't recovered since

531
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:14,724
then.

532
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,960
But what I think is the most surprising
part of this is just three days after

533
00:33:18,961 --> 00:33:19,794
the photos come out

534
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,803
[inaudible]

535
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,980
the night of one of South Korea's biggest
awards ceremonies called the melon

536
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:26,814
music awards

537
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,640
and

538
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,460
so yours are, you know,
scheduled for that night.

539
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,820
Aly was supposed to receive one of these
top 10 artists of the year awards and I

540
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,180
think to everyone's surprise,

541
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:44,390
she actually showed up [inaudible] go are
the top 10 in about two hours in I end

542
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,950
the io elite.

543
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,770
[inaudible] no know they call
her name and she stands up,

544
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,320
walks the center stage,
he goes to the presenters,

545
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:00,380
she takes a bow and she looks,

546
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,860
I think she looks fraught
or at least overwhelmed,

547
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,330
but then she faces the crowd, right?

548
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,313
[inaudible]

549
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:23,210
at one point her face crack and she puts
her head in her elbow and she starts

550
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:24,894
crying.

551
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,173
Ooh,

552
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,970
so the sum total and ammonia,
does she go, she says,

553
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,350
it really means a lot to me that you
supported me, that you believed in me.

554
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:45,420
We go to, she go, despite
everything that's going on,

555
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,050
[inaudible] comes home.
Nida, thank you. It's Vegas.

556
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,110
And then she walked off stage

557
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,030
for me.

558
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,730
The story shows that they're going to
draw a line in the sand that's different

559
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,260
from ours for now.

560
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,570
For a long time or can you say,

561
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,430
I mean when I asked a j
park the same question,

562
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,780
do you think that it's going to go the
way of the West? I mean she said no way.

563
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,940
I don't think it's ever
going to be that way. I know,

564
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,070
I mean culturally Koreans
were a little more strict and

565
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,670
also a, I think there's also a part
where we look at these us and we're like,

566
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:42,504
come on guys.

567
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,740
You know like we see them as an
example of let's not totally go there.

568
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,463
Okay.

569
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:49,511
Yeah.

570
00:35:49,511 --> 00:35:53,350
So like the u s is a cautionary tale or
something like don't ever get to that

571
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,250
point guys.

572
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,420
And maybe this is one of those ones
where you really wonder like is there a

573
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:04,110
cultural difference that runs deep enough
that you can say [inaudible] to your,

574
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,710
the part of you that said, I want to
know. I want to see, I want to hear.

575
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,210
And I think that that ultimately there
might be a culture, I don't know,

576
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,630
something Paul, part of me
thinks that is as the, as the,

577
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:21,050
when it gets so easy to know the most
intimate details about anyone we'll all

578
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,970
give in. I know this part of me, it
just feels that way. But humans. Yeah,

579
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,370
I dunno. I have to go with
Robert on this one. Well, I'm,

580
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,910
Oh, me too. Thank you Alex. Thank you.

581
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,010
