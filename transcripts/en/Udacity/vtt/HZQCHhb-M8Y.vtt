00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.428
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Looking back at the past four polynomials that we've factored, we can notice

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:08.844
something super important about each of the factors that we got. And that is

00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:13.434
that there are no common terms left within any of these factors. So we don't see

00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:18.054
anything like 3x minus 9 in here, for example. Because if we saw that, we would

00:00:18.054 --> 00:00:22.338
know to rewrite it as 3 times the quantity x minus 3. So you always want to

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:26.628
double check at the end of your factoring process that each of your factors is,

00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:30.930
in fact, fully factored itself. Keep that in mind with this upcoming problem.
