00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.510
Solve the system of equations
by substitution.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.300
Check your solution by graphing
the equation.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.500
Let's do it by substitution.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.890
We know that y is equal to this
thing over here, and we

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.270
also know that y is equal
to this thing over here.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.270
So they're going to intersect
when they both equal the same

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.410
y, or when this thing is equal
to this thing, or when

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:29.540
negative x squared is equal to
2x squared plus 3x minus 6.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.915
The x value, which these two are
equal, is going to be the

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:35.610
x values where these y's are
equal, so that's going to be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.480
their point of intersection.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.900
That will be an x and y
pair that satisfies

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.070
both of these equations.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.600
Let's solve for x here.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.270
A good starting point-- let's
just add x squared to both

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:55.990
sides, and we end up with
0 is equal to 3x squared

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.010
plus 3x minus 6.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.520
Then, just to simplify this on
the right hand side, we could

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.030
divide both sides of the
equation by 3-- we can divide

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.150
everything by 3-- and we're
left with 0 is equal to x

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.500
squared plus x minus 2.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.810
We could do the quadratic
equation, or complete the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.840
square, or all sorts of crazy
things, but this is actually

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.460
very factorable-- 0 is equal
to two numbers, which are 2

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.590
and negative 1.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.270
When you multiply them, you get
negative 2, and when you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.130
add them, you get positive 1.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.500
So this is x plus 2
times x minus 1.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.430
That tells us that x plus 2 is
equal to 0, or x minus 1 could

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.420
be equal to 0.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.100
Subtract 2 from both
sides of this.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.210
You could get x is equal
to negative 2.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.890
Or add 1 to both sides of
this, x is equal to 1.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.290
These are our two solutions-- x
is equal to negative 2 or x

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.350
is equal to 1.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.540
Let's verify it.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.750
When I put x is equal to
negative 2-- let's do it over

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.670
here-- what do I get?

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.020
Negative 2 squared
is positive 4.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.160
And then you put a negative
there, so it's negative 4--

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.520
the point here is negative
2, and then negative 4.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.540
That's what happens when you
put negative 2 there.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.060
And then what happens
when I put 1?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.370
1 squared is 1, and then if you
put a negative there, it's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.110
negative 1.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.630
So it's 1, negative 1.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.200
And so these are both points on
this equation right here,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.600
on this function.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.610
If you look at this one over
here, if you put negative 2

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.080
over here-- 2 times negative
2 squared.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.660
Negative 2 squared
is positive 4.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.140
2 times positive 4 is 8.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.535
3 times negative 2 is negative
6, so 8 minus 6.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.010
8 minus 6 is 2, and 2 minus
6 is equal to negative 4.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.910
The point negative 2, negative
4 is on this function.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.460
They both share that
point in common, so

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.980
they intersect there.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.400
If I put 1 into this, I
get 2 plus 3 minus 6.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.280
2 plus 3 is 5, minus 6, when x
is 1, which is negative 1.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
The point 1, negative 1 is
also on this top graph.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.670
We can plot these points:
negative 2 comma negative 4.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.745
Negative 2-- 1, 2, 3,
4-- is right there.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.010
That's going to be a point
of intersection.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.770
Then we have the point
1, negative 1.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.330
1, negative 1 is also going
to be a point of

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.160
intersection there.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.550
Let's graph this second one and
just verify-- they say,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.530
check your solution by graphing
the equation.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.530
Let's graph the first one.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.770
This is pretty easy to
graph-- y is equal

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.430
to negative x squared.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.140
It's going to intersect
the point 0, 0.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.910
It's going to be a
downward slope,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.730
downward opening parabola.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.390
When x is positive or negative
1, y is going to be negative

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.660
1, because you square them and
then you take the negative.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.820
When x is positive or negative
2, y is going

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.030
to be negative 4.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.690
So the graph will look
something like this--

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.720
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.800
The graph will look something
like that.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.700
That is that equation
right here.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.100
This is going to be an upward
opening parabola, and a quick

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.920
way-- we could do all of that
completing the square, but if

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.250
you think about it, let's just
apply the quadratic equation

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.820
right here.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.140
I want to show you something,
a quick way of where the

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.120
vertex formula comes
from when you apply

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.190
the quadratic formula.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.900
If you take this, and you wanted
to find its zeros, you

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.380
would say x is equal to negative
b-- which is negative

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.250
3-- plus or minus the square
root of b squared-- which is

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.530
9-- minus 4ac.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.000
Minus 4 times 2 times
negative 6.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.780
All of that over 2 times
a, or 2 times 2.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.260
Now, we can evaluate this and
figure out the zeros of this,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.550
but the real point why I wanted
to show you this is

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.780
because we always have
two solutions.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.570
Let me actually write
down the quadratic

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.220
formula here for you.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.110
The quadratic formula is
negative b plus or minus the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.150
square root of b squared
minus 4ac over 2a.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.050
You always end up-- or if this
is a positive number-- with

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.360
two solutions, and they're
equal distant.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.990
They're this far away, this far
over 2a away from negative

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.620
b over 2a-- we could write this
as negative b over 2a

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.380
plus or minus the square
root of b squared

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.210
minus 4ac over 2a.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.430
You have at most two solutions
that are equal distant from

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.380
this x value right here.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.520
We've seen in multiple videos:
what is that point that is

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.310
equidistant from the
two solutions,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.400
that is right in between?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.170
That's going to be the line of
symmetry, or the x value of

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.300
the vertex.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.320
This is where the x value of the
vertex formula comes from:

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.720
x val of vertex is negative
b over 2a.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.500
If we wanted to find the vertex,
the x value of this

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.800
guy right here, we just take
negative b-- which is negative

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.200
3-- over 2 times a, 2
times 2, which is 4.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.770
So, x is equal to negative
3/4 is the

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.480
vertex of this parabola.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.130
And when x is equal to negative
3/4, what is y?

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.990
We could actually-- that's a
little bit more complicated

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.090
right here, but I'll
just go through it.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:51.310
It's going to be 2 times
9 over 16 minus 9

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.300
over 4 minus 6.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.540
Let me actually get the
calculator out for this one.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.850
It's going to be 18 over 60.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.240
Let me just get the calculator
out, because it will be

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.130
simpler, and I don't want
to waste your time doing

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.380
arithmetic.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:23.530
It's going to be 18 divided by
16 minus 9 divided by 4 minus

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:29.300
6 is equal to negative 7.125.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.110
This is equal to
negative 7.125.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.220
So the vertex occurs when x is
negative 3/4-- when x is right

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:42.190
there-- and y is negative 7.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:50.170
This is essentially 7 1/8, so
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.125.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.980
So it's a little over 7.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:58.240
The vertex of this top graph
is right over there.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.630
It's symmetric around
the vertex.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.610
That is the line of symmetry,
and so this top graph is going

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.920
to look something like this.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.100
Just like that and we're done.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.160
We've found our two points of
intersection, right over there

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.870
and right over there, and
when you graph it it

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.490
looks pretty good.
