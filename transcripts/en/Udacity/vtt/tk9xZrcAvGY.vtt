00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.250
My answer is, it depends.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.630
This should probably be okay for simple
conditions that could clearly be treated

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.920
this way without first
seeing the patient.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.100
In fact, doctors do this
now when they're on-call.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.330
They may talk to patients
they've never seen before and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.860
make decisions based on information
the patient gives them.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.780
More complex problems requiring
a physical exam to gather data

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.340
probably should be initially
seen in a traditional visit

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.670
before remote technology is utilized.
