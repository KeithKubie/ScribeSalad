00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,960
This is Radiolab.

2
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:05,961
You are Robert Krulwich and you're Jad
Abumrad and today our topic on radiolab

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,470
is sleep. Yep. It is something that
all of us do. We can't help but do it.

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,460
It's dangerous to do. It's so good
and it's universal. I think about it,

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:14,611
you know,

6
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:18,360
sleep is dangerous and if sleep could
have been circumvented in some way,

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,850
natural selection probably
would have found a way to do it.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,250
But Steve Lima again from Indiana State
University. Yeah, it because it would,

9
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:28,410
it just, it'd be such a great idea
to not sleep, don't I know it,

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,450
but there are times when
you just can't sleep. Right.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,560
Maybe you're one of the
35 million Americans I am.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,310
Who has chronic insomnia.
Yeah. You just can't sleep.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,110
You don't know why it just doesn't happen.

14
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:44,340
Or maybe you do it to yourself and you
pull all nighters for school or you have

15
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:46,890
to drive long distances or,

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,630
and here's what we want to
turn our attention to next.
Maybe it is done to you.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,690
That's the case with
producer Hannah Palin.

18
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:58,380
She kept this audio diary of her own
experiment with sleep deprivation.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,650
She has an 18 month old son.

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,050
It's two 54 for the record.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,340
[inaudible] [inaudible]

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,750
today was my first day back at work.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,870
We were discussing budgets. I just,

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,011
I just,

25
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:33,011
I couldn't even articulate what it was
that I was seeing on the computer screen

26
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:37,690
and try to communicate that to
the curator that I work for.

27
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,690
The words didn't come

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,450
down on me instead of
saying, well, Nicolette,

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,890
I believe that that choice
was made because no, no.
All that came out was like,

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,500
um, honey buckets. I mean,

31
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,850
nothing, nothing would come out.
There's just no brain cells really.

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,920
Wow. So anyway,

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,710
that was my first day back at work.

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,000
[inaudible]

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,500
where do you stop it Dominic? Well,

36
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,520
not sleep.

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,410
I'm trying to get him to sleep
and kind of at my wit's end

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
cut. This just sucks. It totally sucks.

39
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,620
Here's the funny thing.
Everybody has a theory,

40
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,720
and I was talking to my sister in law
tonight and her theory is that he's not

41
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:43,780
getting enough milk because milk has some

42
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,140
agent in it that would help him sleep
and he doesn't like milk. It's true.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,740
Other people say, Oh, if
he just read exercise him,

44
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,470
if he just gets fresh air and
exercise, he'll sleep all night.

45
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,170
If he just let him cry,

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,390
would sleep all night if you just would
do whatever it is we're not doing.

47
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,670
He would sleep all night.

48
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,820
Okay. And there's this feeling like

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,900
there's a feeling like I am doing it
all wrong and that I'm a failure as a

50
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:25,590
parent and I don't know how to do this.

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,220
Come here sweetie. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

52
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,563
So anyway,

53
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,920
I needed to record just one thing really
quickly and that is that yesterday and

54
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,720
today I've been struck by fantastic.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,910
I'm instructed by these waves of

56
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,410
satisfaction and delight with being
alive in this amazing landscape with

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,970
the funny kid [inaudible]
mountains and, and water.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,260
And I don't know,

59
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:07,320
maybe it's just getting a little more
sleep in the last couple of days,

60
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,910
but I suddenly feel
like, wow, I'm so lucky.

61
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,090
Okay, I've got to take my
kid to play now. Here we go.

62
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,530
Do you know the Muffin
man? The muffin man?

63
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,150
[inaudible] okay. That
whole I'm loving life.

64
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,550
Yeah. That's all gone now.

65
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,360
And it's pretty much because
Dominic won't take a nap.

66
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,170
We came home from the beach, which
I thought would wear him out.

67
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,580
Then we sat down and read some
stories, which for some reason,

68
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:47,330
and I realized that an element to the
sleep deprivation and an element to this

69
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:52,331
whole thing is that I get angry from
having my own needs subverted to the needs

70
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,100
of this little tiny person,

71
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,780
which when you're not sleep
deprived is not a big deal.

72
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,930
Oh, tired. I tired. I don't cry.

73
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,463
[inaudible]

74
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,760
I don't want to wish a minute of Dominic's
childhood away cause it's so precious

75
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,000
to me. But I,

76
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,330
I'm looking forward to,
uh, that moment when,

77
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,760
um, I am able to say, honey, I have to
go to sleep and he does it die here?

78
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,460
No, not die. [inaudible]

79
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,060
eyes. Your Eyes Buck. Okay.

80
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,360
Close your eye.

81
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,360
There's my personal take on what it's
like to be sleepy and to crave sleep as

82
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,980
much as you crave water

83
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,790
or breath. I crave it.

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,010
Thanks to Hannah Palin and her son,
Dominick and her husband Steve.

85
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,680
I know poor Hannah, but there is a science
question looking in the background,

86
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,070
which is when you know,
when Hannah was so tired,

87
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,810
why does she feel that way?
You know what? W W what?

88
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,610
Because she's, she hasn't been sleeping.
Oh yeah, but, but what makes her,

89
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,200
you know, what is the essence of
tiredness? Lack of sleep. Hello?

90
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,970
Chemically, I'm asking you chemicals.
What is it happening to her?

91
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,500
If you were way down in herself, could
you see something tired like going on?

92
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,030
That's what I, that's a
good question actually.

93
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,180
I'm glad you think so because I know
a guy who has a theory about this.

94
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,460
Did you see Tiger yesterday? [inaudible]

95
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,380
of antibody. I mean,
the guy is unbelievable.

96
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,610
This is doctor gallon pack and in
addition to being a rabid golf fan,

97
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:59,090
he's also a rabid, but can you
be a rabid biologist? Sure.

98
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,770
At the University of Pennsylvania,

99
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:04,670
he's been looking at sleep down at the
cellular level and one thing that he's

100
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,200
found over and over and over,

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,250
and that's been shown in Moses has been
shown in rise, been shown in fruit fly,

102
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,580
is that inside certain cells
in all those different animals,

103
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,460
when they're sleep deprived and Shelly,

104
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,430
what happens is you don't get
proteins properly for all the,

105
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,253
excuse me,

106
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,360
proteins properly folded a phenomenon
called the unfolded protein response.

107
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,530
What on Earth does that mean? Is
that a good thing or a bad thing you,

108
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,080
you're asking why do you need
proteins to properly fold? Yeah,

109
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,310
I guess that's what I'm asking.
Well, you are made of proteins.

110
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,050
Proteins are the essence of you.
So if your proteins are misshapen,

111
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,130
if they're not folded properly,
don't fold the proteins properly.

112
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,250
They don't have the right three
dimensional structure, and as a result,

113
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:50,330
they start accumulating inside the
cell and then these different unfolded

114
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,920
proteins can aggregate
together and front clump.

115
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,713
Whoops.

116
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,520
Inside the cell and essentially clog it
up and it's really quite toxic to cells.

117
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,320
Clumpiness equals tiredness
as would be his formula.

118
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,600
Remember when Hannah was
so exhausted? Yeah. God,

119
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,550
this just sucks. Well, because she
hasn't slept much inside herself.

120
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,660
Lots of these valuable little proteins
have not folded properly that he thinks

121
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:23,030
is the consequence of
not having enough sleep.

122
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:27,260
So maybe what's going on is the cells
can't do their business quite as well and

123
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:31,670
things start to break down and that adds
up across the whole of your body to a

124
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,620
fueling. But when she gets to sleep,

125
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,550
remember when she's so happy, suddenly
feel like, wow, because of the sleep,

126
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,030
I'm so lucky. A group of cleaning
reppers have gone through herself,

127
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,000
removed the toxic and misshapen
proteins so that in effect,

128
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,170
sleep is the best housemaid you've
ever had in the hotel. Have you,

129
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,480
and this idea, the,

130
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,840
the idea of sleep as a cleaner wrapper
might even explain one of the most basic

131
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:06,310
things about us as humans, how we learn.

132
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,560
That's the notion of doctor Giulio
Tononi testing, testing, testing.

133
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,160
My producer Ellen Horn and I went to
visit him at his offices in Madison,

134
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:15,994
Wisconsin.

135
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,810
What are we expecting? What does he
look like? We don't know what else,

136
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,630
like pop player, a football
player, but like a quarter backer.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,650
Tight end. Not like a

138
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,780
so big but not overwhelming. Yes. Yeah.

139
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,480
How do you even know
that website? See, but

140
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,130
totally wrong. Now, to be fair,

141
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,420
he is a very attractive guy, has
sandy blonde hair and glasses,

142
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,990
so he's actually the more that sensitive
guy intellectual than a linebacker.

143
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:51,030
Okay. Introduce yourself.
I'm Julia [inaudible].

144
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,390
I am a professional psychiatry here at
the University of Wisconsin Madison,

145
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,420
but when it comes to the subject
of sleep, which is his specialty,

146
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,010
he takes sleep very seriously.
Like what got you didn't sleep.

147
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,010
Sleep is the annihilation
of consciousness,

148
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,310
so it's a terrible time in
which everything disappears.

149
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,080
The universe and yourself with it.

150
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,040
I think if people didn't sleep and
didn't have the unconscious sleep,

151
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,840
they possibly wouldn't even realize
that consciousness is an enormous gift.

152
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,370
So being awake then is wonderful, but
it's what happens when you're asleep.

153
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:27,810
He says that's what allows you to make
very important connections in your life.

154
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,740
And he noticed this first, you may
train when he was connecting with the,

155
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,750
I believe it was a guitar, just playing
music. I used to play, for instance,

156
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:34,800
I played classical guitar.

157
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:39,801
I'm sure many people who play musical
instruments know that you may train and

158
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:44,580
train and train on a piece during
the day and you get better for sure,

159
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,850
but you're never perfect. Oh,

160
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,680
and then you sleep over it
the next day you wake up,

161
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,400
you play it again and now it's smooth
and you know it flows. Beautiful.

162
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,233
That happened. Yeah,

163
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,880
it happened to me. It
happens to lots of people.

164
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,400
That happened to me all the time.

165
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,490
I discovered that sometimes if I
worked on a piece and put it away,

166
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,290
I went to bed and cut some rust.

167
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,640
I had it better learned than if
I stayed up all night cramming.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,710
Yeah, definitely. There's one story,

169
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,190
and I hadn't thought about this for a
long time, but, well first of all, Robin,

170
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:22,810
I like play in a band together.

171
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,140
The band is called the sisterhood
of convoluted thinkers and we switch

172
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:28,570
instruments like a lot. She's
usually the bass player.

173
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,550
I was going to play drums, I
had to learn how to play drums.

174
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:31,960
So we rented a cabin,

175
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,740
we went somewhere to rehearse and
at night she was really just kind of

176
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,950
practicing and practicing and trying to
get this written one in particular be

177
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,870
like, I've worked on it like a lot.

178
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,930
I just keep going and going and replaying
that one thing again and again and

179
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:44,764
again.

180
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,280
And I finally just gave up and went to
sleep and the next morning I got up and

181
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:56,050
went like straight to the kid and
I just played it like immediately.

182
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,240
The bucket, the stool,
she was going [inaudible]

183
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,213
you could just do it.

184
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,060
I thought it was magic or you could
just learn stuff in your sleep.

185
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,671
So wait,

186
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:12,150
they were showing the middle of the night
somehow the things that your fingers

187
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:16,230
did repeatedly and the notes that you
were using to propel your fingers.

188
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:18,750
All those things somehow
got into that more.

189
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,550
Got Better learned. So you
learned overnight or you,

190
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,850
I mean what does have to do with it or
you remember better in the morning? No.

191
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,450
What happens is that the next day you're
a bit better off what happens during

192
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,920
the night to make you better off.
This is up for contention to nannies.

193
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,930
Contention is that sleep helps
you remember by forgetting
and I don't know what

194
00:12:40,531 --> 00:12:43,050
that means. Let me explain
to you what he, what he say.

195
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,190
He says there's a limited
amount of space in your brain.

196
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:48,730
The real estate in the brain speed limit,

197
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,390
unlimited amount and makes sense as
a small little guy up there. Yup.

198
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,320
And yet every experience you have during
the day he's going to take away some

199
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:58,350
space, uses up a little of what
you got when you are awake.

200
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,040
Inevitably you learn
whether you want it or not.

201
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,430
You are going round talking to
me. Okay. I was having breakfast,

202
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,350
have a medium coffee, going to work,

203
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,660
then yakking on the phone with the you
went. Your friends pop into your mind.

204
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,660
Very different from from the friends.
Then going home, taking a bath,

205
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,230
they'll take a bath. I get it again.
Everything you do during the day,

206
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,090
every thought you think,
no matter how small,

207
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,520
it all causes your brain
to form new connections.

208
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,530
This conversation as we're
having it is reshaping my brain.

209
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,520
A little pathways are forming that
weren't there before I sat down exactly

210
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,770
whether we recognize it or not.

211
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,250
Lots of things I go on to change your
brain by the end of the Waking Day.

212
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,880
So if in the middle of the afternoon
you sit down with your guitar and you

213
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:45,540
practice the guitar
intently, those two hours,

214
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,230
you're also making connections
and because you're concentrating,

215
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:51,290
maybe you're making more
connections than usual.

216
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:57,090
These are guitar connections and all
those synaptic connections made during the

217
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,210
day. Wow. Just have a meeting [inaudible]

218
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,990
by the time you're ready,

219
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,730
I'm ready for sleep up in your

220
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,153
kitchen.

221
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,060
[inaudible]

222
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,440
and that is where we think sleep kicks
in. Well, I'm going to guess here,

223
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:24,310
but I think you think that sleep is a
garbage detail that comes into is okay,

224
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:27,490
you're done. You're done. You're done.
It's actually even simpler than that.

225
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,810
According to Noni, there's not really a
janitor who comes in and decides, okay,

226
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:35,260
you have to leave. You get to stay.
Nothing like that. Instead he says,

227
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:35,951
what happens?

228
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:40,930
We think that doing sleep
waves of electrical activity,

229
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:44,770
kind of like a late evening
bath wash over your head.

230
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,200
They start at the back of your
head. I mean you move to the front.

231
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,860
These waves are called slow or salacious
and the course of the night 1000 times

232
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:57,590
a night, those waves wash through
all the experiences of your day,

233
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,970
all the little synaptic connections that
you made all day long and every one of

234
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:06,050
those connections, all of that
gets just a little bit softer.

235
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,300
They get weaker progressively, gracefully.

236
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:13,301
They get weaker even he says the things
you want to hold onto like the guitar.

237
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,470
Wait a second. Wait a second.

238
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,140
You are the one who said you learned
how to play the instrument in the

239
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:21,950
afternoon. You went to sleep and you play
the instrument better in the morning.

240
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,980
Yep. Why would you wake up the
next morning playing better?

241
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:29,600
You should play more weekly with
less confidence and less memory.

242
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,680
Because after all, you've just given the
whole place a bath. It's all relative,

243
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,840
sir. What he means by relative is this,

244
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,480
that that mass of new
connections in your head.

245
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,720
Some of those connections are softer.
Some of those connections were louder.

246
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,790
The random things you ordered for lunch,
they're softer. Okay? But the guitar,

247
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,610
cause you spend so much time
thinking about guitar technique,

248
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:51,650
you spend so much energy
on it. That's louder.

249
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,840
So we're just measuring connections here.

250
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,290
Now imagine that sleep is a big volume
na so listen to what happens when you

251
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:01,820
lower the volume on the whole day

252
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,340
and lower.

253
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,980
You hear how the softer stuff just falls
away. You can't hear it anymore. Yeah.

254
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,430
Bad. The Guitar, while
it's getting softer too,

255
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:20,480
because it was so loud to begin with,
now it stands out a bit more clearly now.

256
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,230
Yeah. The signal seems to
have survived reasonably well,

257
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,410
are heard better because the
background has become more silent.

258
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,190
So your ability to play the guitar better
the next morning is not because you've

259
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:35,090
learned these skills overnight that you
didn't have before is because all the

260
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,050
other stuff taken up.

261
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:41,051
Your brain has gone down in volume and
you're left with relatively speaking,

262
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,180
a better guitar fingering technique.

263
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,680
You put your finger on it.

264
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,870
So Mr Schenone feels that sleep is a
little bit like we didn't rain like the

265
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,880
process of erosion at the end of the day,

266
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,500
or rather at the beginning of the morning,

267
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,920
the things left standing are
the things you need to know.

268
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,790
We should, uh, we should
go to break. Okay.

269
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,420
So coming up next for those of
us who can get this leap next,

270
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,120
our change to dream. This is radio lab.
I'm Chad, I'm rod and I rapid rolling.

271
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,000
We'll continue in a moment.
