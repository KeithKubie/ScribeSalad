00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.840
MALE SPEAKER 1: Firstly, we
accept no responsibility for

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.960
any damage caused by
playing the game.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.210
MALE SPEAKER 2: We were hoping
that the game was going to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.100
work as kind of a social
lubricant in Hangouts.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.150
The goal was just to make
something really

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.940
ridiculous and fun.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.777
One of the key things about
having a game with a lot of

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:30.740
little micro games in it, was
it was good for getting

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.400
everyone on the team a little
piece of the project

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
that they could own.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.100
MALE SPEAKER 1: The creative
process went from the very

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.580
start to the very end of
the production cycle.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.235
MALE SPEAKER 2: All the key
points that we wanted to

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:45.210
fulfill with the ideas, ranging
from feasibility right

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.045
up to awesomeness, so we
had to tick all the

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:48.880
boxes in each concept.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.440
MALE SPEAKER 1: I think we did
some prototyping and some

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.510
testing just to see what sort of
data came out of it and how

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.370
we might use it.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.250
We had a basic system just to
begin with and it kind of

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.500
quickly became apparent that
it wasn't going to hold up.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.940
We went back to the drawing
board, basically, and spent a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690
lot more time planning out
how all the multi-player

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.700
interaction was going to work.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.010
We were trying to hit a game
a day for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.660
in the second week, and
we almost got there.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.160
I think we were planning
on doing five games.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.660
We ended up getting to four.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.220
We had a lot of squeaking
seats.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.140
You'd be sitting around coding
and you'd just hear the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.900
[SQUEAKING NOISE].

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.820
You'd turn around and someone
would be like rocking around

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.620
on their seats.
