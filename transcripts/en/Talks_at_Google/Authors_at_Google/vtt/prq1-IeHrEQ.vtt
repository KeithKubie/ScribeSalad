JAMES MOREHEAD: Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.870
Live here in the room and on
live stream around Google.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.300
Kari Byron is no
stranger to fans

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.940
of her multiple reality-based,
science-oriented television

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.580
shows, from Discovery
Channel's Mythbusters,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.620
to Netflix's White
Rabbit Project,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.390
to the Travel Channel's
Thrill Factor,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.100
and many other programs.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.985
Kari is also no
stranger to Google.

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:31.610
I had the privilege
of interviewing her

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.710
for talks at Google
a couple of years ago

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.990
and she co-hosted the
Google Science Fair

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.390
with YouTuber, Simone Giertz.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.780
And Kari just joined STEM
toy company, Smart Gurlz,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.770
as their Chief Creative
Officer, as though she hasn't

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.070
had done enough amazing things.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.040
So today we're welcoming
Kari back to Google

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.890
to talk about her
autobiographical first book,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.190
Crash Test Girl, which
applies the scientific method

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.040
to the ups, downs, and
in-betweens of life.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.720
Please welcome Kari to Google.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:07.660
KARI BYRON: I like
how you intruded that

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.210
as her first book,
as if there's going

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.770
to be so many more after this.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.400
JAMES MOREHEAD: Well,
I hope there are

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.080
because your book is awesome.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.660
So I had a chance to learn a
new word, galley copy, which

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.720
is something I had to Google.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.460
It's a pre-released copy of the
book before it's totally done.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.510
KARI BYRON: I had
to Google it, too.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.050
I didn't know what they
were talking about.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.480
JAMES MOREHEAD: I had
no idea what it means.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.230
I didn't want to ask
the publicist, what's

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.612
a galley copy, because I
feel like I should know that.

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:30.070
So you didn't just
write this book.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.660
You created some
amazing sketches,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.910
and we're going to show some
of those in a little bit,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.830
and illustrations to
complement the text.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.650
Walk me through how you
created the opportunity

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.140
to write the book, not just
the book itself, but how you

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.880
actually made that
opportunity happen

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.280
and the process of
writing a first book.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.450
KARI BYRON: I would like it
to be something very grand.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.660
So I was in a bar in Iowa
and I was sitting around

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.895
with this random
group of people.

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:57.840
I mean, it was Thomas
Dolby, the guy who wrote,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.160
she blinded me with science.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.090
And if you're an audio
nerd, you probably

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.680
know who he is
because he's invented

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.900
so many amazing things.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.660
Homer Hickam who wrote Rocket
Boys, which became October Sky,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.030
he was there.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.560
I had Space Gal,
you know, Emily.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.470
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yep.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.390
KARI BYRON: Also, there
was a storm chaser.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.480
Reed Timmer was there
and a former astronaut.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.489
And we just had this
wild group of people

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.780
that had done a speaker series.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.750
And we were all hanging
out closer to last call

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.290
than I'd like to admit.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.840
And Homer Hickam's like--

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.380
we're trading all
these travel stories--

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.740
you should write a book.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.540
I was like, no, I
don't want to do that.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.060
I was like, that's what you do.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.170
Writing is really hard.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.045
Every time I do a blog, I
agonize until the last minute.

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:42.920
And it's constantly
being written in my head.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.760
And then it's stressful, and
then I write it, and I'm happy,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.290
but that happiness
is so short-lived

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.150
because it's just all at the
end because I got it done,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.080
and it's never perfect enough.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.722
And he's like, no,
just write a book.

00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:52.930
You've got all these stories.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.070
You've got so many stories.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.030
Write a book.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.110
And I said, no.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.245
And he basically
double dog dared me.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:00.399
And I went, fine, fine, fine.

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:01.690
You can let your agent call me.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.130
So his agent called
me and he said,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.171
Homer tells me that you're
going to write a book.

00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.210
I was like, no.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.430
Nothing counts at that
time in the morning.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.150
I'm not writing a book.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.070
And then I just let it sit.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.430
And I was talking to my
daughter about something

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.470
that she had going on
at school, something

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.850
that she was afraid of.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.250
And I was looking at her, saying
the words, OK, honey, bravery,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.180
it's not what superheroes have.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.900
It's not having superpowers.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.220
It's being scared to death
and doing it anyways.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.640
And I went, ah.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.160
And I walked out of the
room and went, damn it.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.440
I got to write a book now.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.040
So I called back the agent and
I was like, how do you do this?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.910
What do I do?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.500
And he walked me through this.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.120
You got to write
a book proposal.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.610
So I wrote a horrible
book proposal

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.860
that was like 90 pages long.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.750
And I took it to
some publishers.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.970
And I didn't get the reception
that I was hoping for,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.155
so I pulled it back.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.780
And I actually hired
someone to help me

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.910
with the book proposal, a
writer that's actually good.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.690
So I was like, how do
I make this something

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.290
that people actually
want to buy?

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.440
And so she cut it into
pieces and brought it down

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.120
to 30 pages instead of
90, which is insane.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.190
And I went back to a
bunch of publishers

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.964
and got a whole bunch
of different offers.

00:04:18.964 --> 00:04:20.505
So it's really just
the presentation.

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.830
I'm like, OK, this is
actually kind of cool.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.640
Writing a book is hard, but the
learning process is amazing.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.700
And it has all of the things
that I've always preached

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.930
to my daughter, you know?

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.070
Don't be scared.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.810
Make opportunities.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.870
Learn from failure.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.940
So the first going out with the
book was somewhat of a failure.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.440
Learned from it,
called an expert.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.270
Very Mythbustery.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.790
Went back out with it,
got a bunch of offers.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.160
And then all of a
sudden I went, oh, now I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.870
got to do it for real.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.470
So I spent a lot of time
stress eating and drinking wine

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.137
during the day in
my living room.

00:04:54.137 --> 00:04:56.220
Maybe I should be more of
a role model about that,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.770
but that was just my process.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.042
I took a bunch of
stories from journals.

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:03.000
I had a bunch of stories
written on my computer

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.310
already that I had written
down along the way.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.670
I had videos from all
these years at Mythbusters.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.795
I talked to all my friends.

00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:11.503
I'm still friends with
a lot of the gang.

00:05:11.503 --> 00:05:13.207
So I'd be like, hey,
remember that time?

00:05:13.207 --> 00:05:14.290
And then I'd be like, yes.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.135
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:05:15.135 --> 00:05:16.590
I remember that.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.360
And they're like,
are you taking notes?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.700
I'm like, yeah.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.340
So I put together a lot.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.030
I have never realized
how collaborative

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.060
a book process is as well.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.050
You've got a designer
that tells you

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.800
your pictures are good
or bad or the wrong size.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.320
You've got two,
three editors that

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.020
keep coming back at you with
new versions of the book that

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.690
take entire chapters
out to say things like,

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.130
nobody wants to read
about your childhood.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.080
OK.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.817
That's gone.

00:05:44.817 --> 00:05:45.900
More embarrassing stories.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.733
Could you give us more
embarrassing stories?

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:50.730
I'm like, ugh, yes, OK.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.680
So, finally, after--

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.360
I think it takes about a year or
so before I had the end result,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.040
and I'd already
spent the advance.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.470
So I put out my version
of mortified for everyone.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.160
There's a lot of
stories that are very--

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.376
I make myself very vulnerable.

00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:09.000
I definitely talk
about a lot of things

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.458
that I don't think
people expected.

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.450
It's not a science
book for kids.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.850
It really is my personal memoir.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.320
I always liked memoirs.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.320
And I never liked them
about people who were clean

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.470
and had it all figured out.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.340
I like messy people who
learned along the way.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.570
So that's my book.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.350
JAMES MOREHEAD: And
building on that,

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.850
I wasn't sure what to expect
because I got this galley copy.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.599
I knew it was a book
and it was about you,

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.040
and that's all I knew going in.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.730
And I was really surprised-- you
just touched on this-- that it

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.410
was so raw and personal.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.480
It wasn't the pristine
social network

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.994
fantasy that represents nobody.

00:06:42.994 --> 00:06:44.290
KARI BYRON: Hashtag Instagram.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.030
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yes, it
was kind of a real version

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.720
of Kari Byron.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.985
So what was it like
sharing so many aspects

00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:49.860
of your private life?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.020
And did you draw
the line anywhere?

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.670
Where did you decide
to draw the line?

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:59.290
KARI BYRON: I mean, I put a
lot of private stuff in there.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.220
And it wasn't until after I
turned it into the editors

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.640
that I realized that, oh my god.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.320
My dad and mom are
going to read this.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.974
And I told the story
of losing my virginity.

00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:12.390
I want to puke right now, but
I already spent the advance,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.410
so it's too late now.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.910
JAMES MOREHEAD: I
think that's going

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.130
to be the theme of this talk.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.850
KARI BYRON: Pretty much.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.390
Go.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.305
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yeah.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:20.610
So you also narrated
the audio book.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.020
You can't do a book
now pretty much

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.190
without doing an audio book.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.584
Was that fun, tedious,
painful, all of the above?

00:07:27.584 --> 00:07:29.250
KARI BYRON: It was
somewhat excruciating

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.270
for a couple of reasons.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.620
One, I've never liked the
sound of my own voice.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.240
I don't think anybody does.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.860
But that's a long period of time
to listen to your own voice.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.920
Also, when I read the
whole thing out loud,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.970
I wanted to change stuff.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.490
Because I had done it so
silently for so long that

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.740
the audio book
version is actually

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.540
slightly different
than the finished

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.220
process of the actual book.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.210
So the more polished
version is in words.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.382
So I prefer you read
it than listen to it.

00:07:56.382 --> 00:07:58.340
Because there were a
couple of things I'm like,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.465
that doesn't sound like me.

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:00.710
Why did I write that way?

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.277
No, change.

00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:03.860
JAMES MOREHEAD: So I'm going to
do a little show and tell now.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.900
It will give the
editing time for--

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.410
let's see.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.040
So there's a lot of really
cool artwork in the book.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.501
And I want to have Kari--

00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:15.000
KARI BYRON: That's
very kind of you.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.970
They're more like sketches
that mostly were in my journal

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.360
that I just traced.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.600
JAMES MOREHEAD: All right.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.890
I can't go through all
of these, but I will just

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.400
talk about this.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.309
It Says, love is the
smile that smiles back.

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:30.100
KARI BYRON: Can I give
you a little secret?

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.590
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yes.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.726
KARI BYRON: Originally,
that was for something.

00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:33.850
I took it out of a journal.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.659
It originally
said, you die alone

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.000
so you might as well
be happy with yourself.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.791
But they didn't like
that, so I changed it.

00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.059
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.500
I changed it to fit the chapter.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.219
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yeah, that's--

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:45.510
KARI BYRON: Inside information.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.520
I've never told that story.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.420
JAMES MOREHEAD: That's
why you have editors.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.295
That's a good choice.

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:50.390
Now, going to the other
end of the spectrum,

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.425
this is a weapon that you
could use to attack a zombie.

00:08:54.425 --> 00:08:55.800
KARI BYRON: I do
go through and--

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.210
this is part of my
zombie apocalypse kit.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.100
I do really have
this in my house.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.200
It has a roll of duct tape.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.940
It has a machete.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.000
Because for some reason over
Christmas a couple of years

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.850
ago, two different
people gave me machetes.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.280
I don't know what
that says about me,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.821
but I got two machetes
one Christmas,

00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:15.560
so I've got one in my
zombie apocalypse kit.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.150
I mean, everybody
has that, right?

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.130
And then a bottle of
unopened champagne.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.020
Because at the
end of the world I

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.360
want to be able to savor a
bottle, drink the champagne,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.290
and I have two weapons, a very
sharp bottle for a good eye

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.519
socket gouge and a
machete because machete.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.310
JAMES MOREHEAD: So I'm
a zombie fan myself.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.950
Now, I've had many debates
with prior companies

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.402
about zombie attacks.

00:09:35.402 --> 00:09:37.110
This is not one of
the questions I wrote,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.690
but I want to ask it now.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.210
Where would you rather be
in a zombie apocalypse?

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.950
Would you rather
be in a basement?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.810
Would you rather be
in a deserted island?

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.340
Would you rather be on a boat?

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.770
Or would you rather
be in your apartment?

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.582
KARI BYRON: Jamie's workshop.

00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:52.040
JAMES MOREHEAD:
Jamie's workshop.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.120
That would be a
good place to be.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.920
All right, I'm going
to choose one more.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.460
Let's see.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.969
Oh, I like this one, all
right, because I think

00:10:00.969 --> 00:10:02.260
it's a good theme for the book.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.760
The harder I work,
the luckier I get.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.400
And I think that there's a lot
of threads in the book that

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.584
tie back to this concept.

00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:10.500
So what does that mean
to you, that statement?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.910
KARI BYRON: Well, I know it's
a Thomas Jefferson quote,

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.810
but I saw it at the
back of a tattoo parlor.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.360
And it was just about
this scrappy guy

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.519
that just made his
way, even though he

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:23.810
had some physical disabilities.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.360
And I was like, yes, that
guy's successful because he

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.860
worked very, very hard.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.760
And for me, I've never
necessarily had it easy.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.490
I mean, yes, I am a
white suburban girl,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.170
so I haven't had it too hard.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.620
But I have always worked very
hard for my opportunities,

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.350
from getting my
job at Mythbusters.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.790
I worked for free and busted
my ass to stay in that job.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.620
And I've always
worked very hard.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.060
And it's created opportunities.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.490
The reason I'm
sitting here now is

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.420
because I keep pushing
myself as much as I can

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.610
to do weird and wild things.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.860
And it's generally
beyond the scope

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.160
of what I'm comfortable with.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.420
I'm constantly making
myself uncomfortable to get

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.854
to the places I want to be.

00:11:06.854 --> 00:11:08.510
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.130
So I love the
premise of the book.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.020
That the scientific
method can be

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.790
applied to life, not just
science and engineering

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.290
problems.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.059
And I thought that was a
really cool hook for the book.

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:19.850
So how do you define
the scientific method?

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.220
But more importantly, how
did that concept become

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.780
the unifying theme of the book?

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.430
KARI BYRON: Well,
I needed a good way

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.680
to tell the story
that was very cohesive

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.010
with a lot of strange,
different pieces of my life.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.870
And very early on
in Mythbusters we

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.540
realized that the
perfect narrative

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.360
vehicle for busting
a myth and telling

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.980
a story in the allotted
amount of time that we had

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.360
was to use the
scientific method.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.850
And that was the story
arc for all of our myths.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.990
And the scientific method
is really just a tool

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.370
in critical thinking.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.480
And so you can apply that to any
decision that you have to make,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.190
because it's all really about
creating an experiment--

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:03.350
slurring-- and then
analyzing it and finding

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.670
the conclusions that are
going to help you learn.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.660
So whether you fail or
if things turn out well,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.600
it's all about going
through that process.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.240
JAMES MOREHEAD: So you devote
an entire chapter to money,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.490
among many other topics.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.235
You weren't born with a silver
spoon to carry you at all.

00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:21.360
And people may not assume
that, given your success.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.860
You really hustled
to pay the bills.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.690
You worked multiple jobs, nights
as a sampler for liquor brands,

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.740
arbitraging, secondhand
clothing via thrift shops.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.270
What did you learn
from those days

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.205
of hustling to pay the bills
that helps you out today?

00:12:35.205 --> 00:12:37.580
KARI BYRON: I mean, the hustle
is hard when you're young.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.210
And I really did learn that
there's always a way as long

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.010
as you keep looking for it.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.840
I really did enjoy--

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.330
San Francisco, I'm sure
a lot of you remember,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.030
used to be just this
real thrifty haven.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.820
And you used to be able to
go out to the rich suburbs,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.359
and you'd look around
for designer shoes

00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:56.900
and be like, oh,
those are Ferragamo?

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.950
Yes, $2.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.960
Thank you, charity run by nuns.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.840
I'm going to go to San
Francisco and sell these for $20

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.190
at the thrift store on Haight.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.050
And I used to make
a huge living--

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.250
well, huge.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.630
I paid the rent with that.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.200
But I think that I just
learned that there's always

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.700
a hustle somewhere
and you just have

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.060
to think outside the box,
which you guys do well here.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.670
I think everybody probably
has the hustle here.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.680
JAMES MOREHEAD: I like
that, having the hustle.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.420
You also touch on love.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.180
And I won't get into
losing virginity stories.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.050
Awkward.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.090
But you also share this
really touching anecdote

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.340
about your husband and fellow
artist, Paul, giving you

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.080
the gift of 365 love letters,
one for each day of the year.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.440
Whoo, that raises the bar.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.532
Celebrities seem to
struggle with relationships.

00:13:42.532 --> 00:13:44.490
What has given your
relationship staying power,

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.150
despite celebrity?

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.740
And you write about
imperfections along the way.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.470
KARI BYRON: I'm an
accidental celebrity.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.697
I'm not somebody who sought
out this life in any way.

00:13:54.697 --> 00:13:56.280
And I live in San
Francisco, you know?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.140
We don't have a big
celebrity culture.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.139
And I met my husband before
all of this nonsense.

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:02.805
And he's always been
a big support to me

00:14:02.805 --> 00:14:04.320
and I'm a big support to him.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.230
And I honestly think
that I fell in love

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.800
with the person that felt like
a chemical reaction rather

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.580
than an analog.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.140
He didn't check the right
boxes, but he just felt right.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.050
So for me it was more about
biology than it was, say--

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.190
I think Tinder and all that's
an amazing thing for filtering,

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.500
but I think it's the
real human contact that's

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.890
going to keep you together.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:28.765
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yeah.

00:14:28.765 --> 00:14:35.700
And that human contact, you meet
a lot of people in your role.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.930
And they know you through
your media persona.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.050
And you write interestingly
about sometimes feeling lonely

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.790
when around lots
of people and that

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.684
you don't mind being
alone, necessarily.

00:14:44.684 --> 00:14:46.600
And you write about
amazing experiences you've

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.957
had with complete strangers.

00:14:47.957 --> 00:14:49.540
What have you learned
about friendship

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.746
when so many people assume
or want to be your friend?

00:14:53.746 --> 00:14:55.120
KARI BYRON: Well,
I feel like you

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.527
have different places that
you have different people

00:14:58.527 --> 00:14:59.110
that you need.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.276
You might have that one
friend that you bicycle with

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:03.160
and that one friend
that you get everything

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.520
you need from for a day and you
may not ever see them again.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.790
So when I'm traveling
a lot, I'm not

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.770
famous enough for somebody to be
pointing me out on the street.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.120
I can go to a bar, and still
hang out with a stranger.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.280
And sometimes I meet
the most amazing people

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.740
just while I'm on
the road and having

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.030
one-on-one conversations.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.070
And I never tell them
what I do for a living.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.260
I kind of skirt
around it and I can

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.910
have a friendship for a minute.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.360
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.330
All right, I want to do
a little bit more show

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.290
and tell because there's so
many cool things back here.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.676
All right, so this is
where editing comes in.

00:15:35.676 --> 00:15:37.300
KARI BYRON: But isn't
it live-streamed?

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.010
JAMES MOREHEAD: Oh,
the live stream, they

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.180
can see all the unedited.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:40.680
But--

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.650
KARI BYRON: Edit
it in your brain.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.220
JAMES MOREHEAD:
--YouTube is going

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.303
to get the edited version.

00:15:43.303 --> 00:15:44.800
All right, so tell
me a little bit

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.376
about this interesting
piece of art.

00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:50.710
So we'll see how that's--

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:55.150
KARI BYRON: So I have grown
a passion for black powder

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.970
over the years.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.570
And it's not just the
explosive nature of it.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.060
I always liked the
detritus it left behind.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.400
And I always notice that
after we do explosions,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.750
I would go check out the
mayhem that it left behind.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.800
And there was a beautiful
artisticness to the chaos.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.197
So I will use black
powder in paintings.

00:16:13.197 --> 00:16:14.530
I will fence it off in some way.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.330
I always thought
round things always

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.860
just look like planets to me.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.320
And I try to control the
chaos as much as possible,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.880
but you can't replicate
it twice the same way.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.390
So I explode black powder
of different grains

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.370
and then I paint within
it to try to make

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.930
these spacey-like themes.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.770
And interior designers
seem to like them.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.500
I either saw them at art
auctions for charity,

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.246
or this one's going into
somebody's home, I believe.

00:16:38.246 --> 00:16:40.120
JAMES MOREHEAD: Do you
have challenges at TSA

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.953
if you go get on a
flight right after you've

00:16:41.953 --> 00:16:43.759
done black powder art work?

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:45.050
KARI BYRON: I'll tell you what.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.270
I have gone straight from
the bomb range through TSA

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.050
several times with
it just all over me,

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.040
exploded ordinance, and
didn't get tagged at all.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.590
But you make fun of the
TSA once on social media,

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.270
and Tory and I are completely
separate parts of the lines,

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.210
and both of us got
the serious pat down.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.480
Apparently they found
explosives on my phone.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.339
I mean, it's been years.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.557
I think I'm on a watch list now.

00:17:18.557 --> 00:17:19.640
JAMES MOREHEAD: All right.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.290
So, now, you actually talked
about some of these last time.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.569
And you graciously
agreed to bring--

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.240
I'll hold this up for the--

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.600
so describe what
this little fella is

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.374
and where it came to be.

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:36.290
KARI BYRON: So there's
two kinds of parenting.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.420
There's the good
parenting and then

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.711
there's the creative parenting.

00:17:38.711 --> 00:17:41.170
I'm the kind of mom that,
when my kid isn't brushing

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.360
her teeth, I'll show her
pictures of meth teeth

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.280
and be like, eh, you
want to be like this?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.191
Because this will happen to you.

00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:49.440
She hasn't figured it out yet.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.710
She hasn't Googled.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.090
So these little characters are
a series of creative parenting

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.810
that I touch on in the book
where my child and I work

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.400
through her disgusting habits--

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.670
and all children have so many
that there's a lot of material

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.510
there--

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.910
by creating these
monsters that are supposed

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.430
to be mommy's manners monsters.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.490
These are lessons.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.000
So this guy is the
nail biting monster.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.544
It's attracted to the smell
of freshly chewed nail beds.

00:18:15.544 --> 00:18:16.960
And when you fall
asleep at night,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.510
if you'd chewed your nails, it
will come in and finish them

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.180
off.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.906
These are the booger monsters,
which they live in your nose.

00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:26.530
And if you go up
there, pick your nose,

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.477
and you steal
their food, they're

00:18:28.477 --> 00:18:31.060
going to get hungry and go into
the next available hole, which

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.910
might be your ear.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.130
And it will go into your
brain, and it will eat that,

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.240
and then you won't
learn to read.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.570
JAMES MOREHEAD: Just one more.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.960
So this is a pretty macabre.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.240
And think you put this
out on in social media,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.014
but describe what
this is all about.

00:18:46.014 --> 00:18:48.430
KARI BYRON: I just do do a lot
of tiny, little sculptures.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.221
I lived in San Francisco
and everything has

00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:51.540
to be tiny and compact there.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.750
So I work very often in this
size or much, much smaller.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.680
But this one was
somewhere around the time

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.779
of contract
negotiations, I believe,

00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:04.820
where I was being told to
be part of the machine.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.100
So I do a lot of sculptures
that just are how I work out

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.660
my feelings at night.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.460
It's better in a little studio
than, say, getting very angry

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.210
and putting out blogs.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.590
I make them personal.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:19.590
JAMES MOREHEAD: So, yes.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.570
By doing that angry email that
you send in a few seconds,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.930
a little hard to do the
angry sculpture because you

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.150
have a little more time
to reflect, and refine,

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.347
and decide.

00:19:28.347 --> 00:19:30.180
KARI BYRON: I make
better decisions that way

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.982
than Facebooking my angst.

00:19:31.982 --> 00:19:33.690
JAMES MOREHEAD: So
you write in your book

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.420
about having an
artsy, punk aesthetic,

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.250
about redefining
yourself as a rebel.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.450
How important is style?

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.392
And how important is that for
young people to think about?

00:19:42.392 --> 00:19:44.100
KARI BYRON: It was
really important to me

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.372
when I was young.

00:19:45.372 --> 00:19:46.830
I mean, when I
started Mythbusters,

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:54.270
I had so many piercings that it
all fell away the older I got.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.670
But I think that
it's important to be

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.400
respectful for the right
places that you're going to.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.830
You're definitely not going
to wear your boobie shirt

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:02.790
at grandma's.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.140
But I think that it definitely
is something when you're young.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.640
It's a really
interesting process

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.320
of how you're trying
to define yourself

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.778
and the people that
you are around.

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:12.750
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.625
So there's a couple of
areas of the book that

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:15.750
get pretty serious.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.020
And I want to touch
on a couple of those

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.390
because I think it's
viable for other people

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.920
going through similar things.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.950
You're right about that you
like the control of sobriety.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.100
And that said, you write
openly about alcohol,

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.840
both as a liquor
brand ambassador

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.020
and going through what you
call a saturated period.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.590
What was your trigger to change
your relationship with alcohol?

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.580
KARI BYRON: I mean, mostly it
was having a job that I really

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.390
cared about.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.400
You can't really show
up with a hangover

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.550
when you work with power tools.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.990
Though it's an Australian
production company,

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.780
we had a very healthy
relationship with the end

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.270
of the day, and alcoholic.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:57.600
It slowly became more
interesting to me to not overdo

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.640
it.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.580
I have depression and so
I found that in my youth

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.460
I self-medicated a
lot with alcohol.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.685
And it's something that
I see a lot of kids

00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:09.060
do because they
don't understand.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.020
They're depressed.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.450
They think that they just
have problems with the world

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.180
that they're in.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.890
And I think a lot of kids start
drinking very young and very

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.470
heavily to fix that.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.720
And so I wanted to
put it out there

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.570
that that's what I was doing
and the mistakes that I made

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.480
so that maybe you
figure out that you're

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.340
going through
hormonal depressions

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.910
rather than ending up an
alcoholic because you're

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.410
trying to fix something that
isn't actually a problem that's

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:34.920
external.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.790
It's internal.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.080
JAMES MOREHEAD: I mean, that's
a perfect lead into an area

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.121
that I thought was the
most powerful in the book,

00:21:39.121 --> 00:21:41.640
was where you talk
openly about wrestling

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.140
with depression for many years.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.110
And it is not something
people would probably

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.210
assume from this media persona
that evidently follows you

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:49.710
around.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.080
So how did you become
aware that you had

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.585
something called depression?

00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:54.960
KARI BYRON: I
mean, it really was

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.180
when I started on Mythbusters.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.370
And I had this dream job.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.386
And I had a husband--

00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:02.010
well, he was my
boyfriend at the time--

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.801
but I had this man that
I was in love with.

00:22:03.801 --> 00:22:05.010
I had a great apartment.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.154
I had everything, and
there was nothing wrong,

00:22:07.154 --> 00:22:08.820
and I couldn't assign
blame to anything.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.903
And I was like, oh my god.

00:22:09.903 --> 00:22:12.090
This feels chemical.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.250
This is something
that I can't control.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.870
And so that's when I started
to address it in that way.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.180
And that's how I figured
out how to deal with it.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.350
But the reason that
I put it in the book

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:27.790
is because I had met a woman
on the road, a young woman.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.330
She was in college and she
was saying, I get depression.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.030
And how do you make
it through when

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.940
you're trying to achieve these
goals but you're weighed down?

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.369
And I started to tell
her, I had the same thing.

00:22:39.369 --> 00:22:41.910
And I could see it in her eyes
that it was almost like relief

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.730
to her that this person that
she saw on TV, that she thought

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.830
was always happy and
always had it together,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.550
had the same thing that she had.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.540
And it touched her.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.860
And she told me later.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.130
She's like, that
really helped me.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.692
And I thought, OK, well,
if I can do that, I mean,

00:22:57.692 --> 00:22:59.150
I might as well
put it in the book.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.149
What have I got to lose?

00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:01.980
I can help somebody
possibly with it.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.150
JAMES MOREHEAD: And
you tried everything.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.160
You tried all kinds of
different strategies,

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.260
medicinal strategies,
toughing it

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.534
out strategies,
everything in between.

00:23:09.534 --> 00:23:11.700
And different things will
work for different people.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.407
What has helped you
manage depression,

00:23:14.407 --> 00:23:15.990
even though it's
probably always going

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.698
to be with you for
the rest of your life?

00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:19.440
KARI BYRON: Scientific method.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.720
I did a lot of experimenting.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.040
And, I mean, for me
personally, being

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.980
somebody who likes
the dark, arty side,

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.390
medicating didn't work for me.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.250
I found the side
effects horrendous.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.260
I found it very difficult.
And I tried and tried

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.010
in different ways.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.790
And I honestly find I
go completely sober.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.450
I exercise like a crazy
person for the endorphins.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.460
I eat super-duper healthy.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.500
And I know that
it's going to pass,

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.142
which is, now that
I know what it is,

00:23:46.142 --> 00:23:47.350
I know it's going to go away.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.900
It's made it a lot easier.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.440
I also put myself in social
situations with other people.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.500
I find that it
actually really helps

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.539
to not lock myself
away and hide it.

00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:01.830
JAMES MOREHEAD: Well, thanks
for sharing that so openly

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:02.200
in the book.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.630
Because there's other
people that will probably

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.160
never would have assumed that
and it will make a difference.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.890
So just a couple
more questions before

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.639
I open it up to the Dory
and the folks in the room.

00:24:10.639 --> 00:24:12.430
KARI BYRON: But you
actually read the book.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.888
A lot of people that interview
me, they just ask Mythbuster

00:24:14.888 --> 00:24:16.500
questions the whole time.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:16.800
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yeah, no.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.841
I actually read the book.

00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:21.120
I read the book on a flight
to Nashville, actually.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.450
And it is a perfect four-hour
round trip length flight book.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.500
KARI BYRON: Oh, fantastic.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.390
Dear airport bookstores,
James Morehead says--

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.431
JAMES MOREHEAD: Exactly.

00:24:33.431 --> 00:24:33.930
Exactly.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:34.680
KARI BYRON: Yes.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.680
JAMES MOREHEAD: So Mythbusters
was an amazing contribution

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.877
to reality television.

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:41.460
And it was really sad when the
show inevitably came to an end.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.060
You dedicated an entire
chapter to setbacks, including

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.650
how Mythbusters ended.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.540
What have you learned
from those setbacks

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.910
that helped you going forward?

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.440
KARI BYRON: I mean, I thought
that the world was ending

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.510
for a minute when I left
Mythbusters because that

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.280
had been my first--

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.750
it was just such a huge job.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.062
It was over a decade long.

00:24:59.062 --> 00:25:00.270
And it was everything I knew.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.728
And it was everything that I'd
put all my passion and heart

00:25:02.728 --> 00:25:04.800
into for so long that I
was suddenly completely

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.410
unqualified to do anything
else, because nobody

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.920
needs you to drive a
forklift and blow things up

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.120
in regular jobs.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.099
I was terrified.

00:25:13.099 --> 00:25:13.890
I went to the mall.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.264
I bought a pair
of Theory slacks.

00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:17.890
I was about to get my
LinkedIn all ready.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.042
I'm just like, OK.

00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:20.730
I don't know if this is--

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.870
there's just no
boxes for what I do.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.150
I have no idea.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:29.880
So being able to gather
myself from that and go, OK.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.850
What do I like to do?

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:31.850
What do I want to do?

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.760
I kind of like this TV thing.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.960
Maybe I can do this TV thing.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.750
I'm going to keep going.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.170
So I actually just started
going out and pitching shows

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.220
on my own, and letting people
know that I'm still here,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.803
and I'm ready to
work on other things.

00:25:40.803 --> 00:25:42.360
And other shows
started showing up.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.943
They're like, oh,
Mythbusters is over?

00:25:43.943 --> 00:25:44.690
Come over here.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.920
And Travel Channel's
like, we would love you.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.560
Come do science on
roller coasters.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.180
And it was a good lesson
that life continues beyond,

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.070
even when the
wonderful things end.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:00.210
So that's why I've
continued on with TV,

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.355
and I'm moving into new
fun fields myself now.

00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:04.230
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yes, so
that's a perfect lead

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:09.930
in to my last question,
because it's your next gig.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.150
You've recently joined a
cool startup, Smart Gurlz.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:12.650
Is there--

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:13.680
KARI BYRON: Oh, I have one.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.010
I do have one.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:14.880
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yes, you
got to do show and tell.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.171
This is our last show and tell.

00:26:16.171 --> 00:26:20.790
OK, so I'm looking
forward to understanding

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.280
more about the cool
startup, Smart Gurlz,

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.250
that you recently joined as
their Chief Creative Officer

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.820
that's creating self-balancing,
programmable robots,

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.280
targeting girls
with action dolls.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.984
What will your role
be and how did you

00:26:34.984 --> 00:26:36.400
get connected to
this opportunity?

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.460
And you should
definitely show this.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.740
It's really cool.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.050
KARI BYRON: Let's see.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.130
Can I show it on the floor?

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:41.810
Should I try to show it up here?

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:42.893
JAMES MOREHEAD: Let's see.

00:26:42.893 --> 00:26:44.600
I think probably up here.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.710
KARI BYRON: All right, move
these little guys over.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:46.111
JAMES MOREHEAD:
Let's move these.

00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:46.170
Yeah.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.755
KARI BYRON: So I
did not invent this.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.780
JAMES MOREHEAD: So it's
like a little Segway?

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.930
KARI BYRON: I don't
want her to drop off.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:56.640
Give her some room.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.515
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yeah.

00:26:57.515 --> 00:26:58.572
KARI BYRON: Hold on.

00:26:58.572 --> 00:27:03.370
OK, because she's trying
to learn to self-balance.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.590
JAMES MOREHEAD: Almost, yeah.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.430
KARI BYRON: Well, if
she jumps off the edge,

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.346
it'll be more like me.

00:27:06.346 --> 00:27:08.730
JAMES MOREHEAD: Well, that
will be a Mythbusters moment,

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.570
so there you go.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.500
KARI BYRON: She's got
her little Segway.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.300
She does that to self-balance.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.940
So that's her.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.570
I thought to myself, what
do I want to do besides TV?

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:27.729
Because I like TV, but
it's feast or famine.

00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:29.520
Sooner or later I want
to do something new.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.274
And I always wanted to do toys.

00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:32.690
And that's next
on my bucket list,

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.140
is I want to work in toys.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.989
So I just started getting on the
Google and researching places

00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:42.030
that did it, and how they
did it, and what they--

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.870
I talked to everybody I
knew about connections.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.530
And just a friend had
talked to a guy who

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.240
was involved in this company.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.450
I cold-called him and
asked him out to coffee

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:55.370
to pick his brain.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:59.830
And by the end, he's like, wow,
this is kind of your brand.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.270
I mean, this is a
STEM for girls brand.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.030
So this is a doll on
a self-balancing robot

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.920
that is completely codable.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.840
And it teaches block
coding to girls

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.670
using their tablet
or their phone

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.890
so that the doll can
move through challenges.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.780
It can dance.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.530
Music comes out of it.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.980
But it speaks to
the way girls play,

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.740
which is they do a
lot more storytelling.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.620
And I feel like, at one point,
the whole revolution was, OK,

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.080
we've got to teach girls STEM,
so don't make anything pink.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.350
Because that's too girly and
STEM doesn't have to be girly.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.820
And I feel like
now the revolution

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.570
against the revolution is,
or the girls like pink,

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.870
let's also teach them
coding and computer science.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.860
Let's make toys for everyone.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.450
And this is supposed to
reach girls at the age

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.177
that they stop being interested
in coding and computer science

00:28:52.177 --> 00:28:54.260
because all the toys start
getting very masculine.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.520
They're robots,
and they're cars,

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.970
and they're things that destroy,
whereas my daughter who's

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.760
in love with Minecraft
and loves coding

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.630
is now one of only two girls in
her entire after school program

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.880
because every year they
dropped off, they dropped off,

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.960
they dropped off.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.980
Because she likes to code in
ways that creates stories.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.080
And she makes these
big castles that all

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.310
have a reason for everything.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.790
And then the boys in the
class go in and blow it up.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.650
So they're both really good.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.780
It's just I think
that sometimes we

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.230
need to make it easier for girls
to continue on in this field.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.169
So this is just the launch toy.

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:33.210
This is the one that-- it
was seen on Shark Tank,

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.345
and that's where
they got their start.

00:29:34.345 --> 00:29:35.490
JAMES MOREHEAD: Oh, cool.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.220
KARI BYRON: And they won
out of 40,000 companies.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.320
And they've got such a
great hustle going on

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.240
that I met the founder
and I was just like, yeah,

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.699
I would like to
join with you guys.

00:29:44.699 --> 00:29:47.114
I'm going to help them in their
next round of seed funding

00:29:47.114 --> 00:29:49.020
so that we can actually
start making more.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.270
And then I've got a
bunch of new coding toys

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.100
that will probably be
coming out by Christmas.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.100
JAMES MOREHEAD: Awesome.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.090
That is so cool.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:01.510
So we are now going to shift
to audience and Dory questions.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.237
But before I do, I have
two copies of the book.

00:30:04.237 --> 00:30:05.820
I learned, as I
mentioned before, this

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.860
is the galley copy, the
one that I actually read

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.500
with all the post-it notes.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.330
KARI BYRON: You didn't
tell them what that means.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.200
JAMES MOREHEAD:
Galley copy, well, I

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.991
didn't know what it
meant, so I Googled it.

00:30:11.991 --> 00:30:15.780
So galley copy is
a pre-released copy

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.050
of the book, not
entirely finished.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.597
I someday will read
the released copy

00:30:20.597 --> 00:30:21.930
to see what the differences are.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.150
How significant are
the differences?

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.650
KARI BYRON: They're
not significant,

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.650
but to me they were.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.210
They were important
changes to me.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.170
They're very small.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.510
JAMES MOREHEAD: So
the book is fantastic.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.930
I strongly recommend you pop
out your smartphone right now

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:34.920
and order up a copy.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.750
And I see there are copies
already in the audience.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:37.370
It just came out.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:38.190
KARI BYRON: Yay, thank you.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.231
JAMES MOREHEAD: And it's
just a really good read.

00:30:40.231 --> 00:30:41.250
It's very unexpected.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:45.690
So with that, we will
get my assistant,

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.140
who's an engineer with our
team, to get the microphone.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.159
All right.

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:51.450
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming in.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.200
The book, I haven't
quite finished it yet,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.230
but it's great.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.090
It's so easy and interesting.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.210
I really appreciated, and you
touched on it a little bit

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.730
already, that you were
very honest about dealing

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:07.080
with depression and how
it was hard on Paul, also.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.080
I'm wondering if you have
any advice for people

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.010
who find themselves in Paul's
place, who want to help,

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.264
but don't know how to do so.

00:31:15.264 --> 00:31:16.680
KARI BYRON: It's
really tough when

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.100
you're married to somebody
who does have depression.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.880
And I think that
in any family it's

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.570
very difficult because you
take it very personally.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.039
When that person
is sad or angry,

00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:27.830
it's always going to
feel like it's at you.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.371
I think that the
most important thing

00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:30.690
is to remember it's not you.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.660
And you also have to just
take care of yourself.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.430
The partner of someone
who's depressed

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:40.530
has to really understand
that it's not something

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:45.171
that they caused, and just be
as understanding as possible.

00:31:45.171 --> 00:31:46.920
But I think it's also
the depressed person

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.540
has to, as well, be
very understanding

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.880
that that situation is something
that is going to happen

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.049
and that you have to take
extra care of each other.

00:31:55.049 --> 00:31:56.340
JAMES MOREHEAD: Great question.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.419
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:57.419 --> 00:32:00.085
JAMES MOREHEAD: All right, let's
take another one from the room.

00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:00.585
Yeah.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.100
AUDIENCE: So sort of
a two-part question.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.704
We become who we are
from our experiences.

00:32:08.704 --> 00:32:10.870
So would you say that
everything you've gone through

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.080
in your life has been
necessary, or would present-day

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.230
you go back in time and
try to change something

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.640
that you did in the past?

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.740
KARI BYRON: That is
something somebody asked me,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.540
and I put some of
it in the book.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.770
Present-day me would go
back and invest in Google.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.340
I would have stocks
in all of that.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.900
That would be amazing.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.980
But, yeah, I mean,
it definitely took

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.150
a lot of tripping and falling.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.440
And I don't think that
I would be here or be

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.630
as happy as I am
with my life now

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.410
if I hadn't had all of these
scary, awful experiences

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:45.810
or wonderful experiences.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:49.640
So I wouldn't say I
don't regret anything.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.736
I just say I've
definitely learned a lot.

00:32:52.736 --> 00:32:54.110
JAMES MOREHEAD:
So from the Dory,

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.859
somewhere out on live stream.

00:32:55.859 --> 00:32:57.650
You probably get this
question quite a bit.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.608
What's the myth you most
want to have revisited

00:32:59.608 --> 00:33:01.140
because you think
it has to be true

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.077
but was busted on the show?

00:33:03.077 --> 00:33:04.410
KARI BYRON: That has to be true?

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:04.473
JAMES MOREHEAD: Has to be true.

00:33:04.473 --> 00:33:06.620
It was busted on the
show, but it just

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.889
didn't feel like it
should have been busted.

00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:10.930
KARI BYRON: I don't know.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.040
I kind of agreed with
most of our results,

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.990
except for fireworks man.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.850
Fireworks man, we launched
a guy with fireworks.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.120
And I feel like the producers
wanted it to not be real,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.530
so they came up with a different
conclusion that I came up with.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.200
But in the end, it was the
group ruled against me.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.710
So I wouldn't want to actually
retest that one because it

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.700
was kind of ridiculous.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.410
In fact, most of them, I'm
pretty satisfied with how

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.460
they came out in the end.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.630
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yeah.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.940
I think you made a big
difference around the cell

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.854
phone at the gas station.

00:33:44.854 --> 00:33:45.520
KARI BYRON: Yes.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.686
JAMES MOREHEAD: I love that.

00:33:46.686 --> 00:33:48.730
I thought that had a
very positive impact

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:49.589
on gas stations.

00:33:49.589 --> 00:33:51.880
They used to put a sticker,
no cell phone near the gas,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.840
even though it's totally absurd.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.850
KARI BYRON: I would like
people to stop firing bullets

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.950
into the air when they're
celebrating because we

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.060
know that they come down.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.650
That was another
one that I thought

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.580
was very good, that we actually
had some statistical research

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.090
happen from the show.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.650
Also, the one that I really,
really like people to believe

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.900
is the airport
lines when you are

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.360
boarding a plane,
where it doesn't

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.550
matter the zones you are.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.723
If everybody just boards
and does it efficiently,

00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:19.389
the most efficient
people will generally

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.090
get to the front of the line and
they'll do everything quickly.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.400
And then the slacker people,
which somehow always end

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.030
up in first class, just like,
oh, let me put my dog here,

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.810
they're always in the front.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.170
And I think it would be
so much faster if we just

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.734
let nature take its course.

00:34:34.734 --> 00:34:36.650
JAMES MOREHEAD: Or you
know what we should do?

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.239
KARI BYRON: I feel
very strongly.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:38.110
I fly a lot.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:41.920
JAMES MOREHEAD: Every time
you fly, you should be timed,

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.739
and then your next flight
is adjusted based on how

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.114
you performed the last time.

00:34:46.114 --> 00:34:46.409
KARI BYRON: Yes.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.070
JAMES MOREHEAD: And then
that will sort it all out

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.840
all the time.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.860
And the people that
don't mind, they

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.320
don't mind taking a long
time, they'll be at the end

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:51.940
and they don't care.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.898
KARI BYRON: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:52.898 --> 00:34:55.710
JAMES MOREHEAD: So we got
another from the audience.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.940
Here we go.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.875
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

00:34:58.875 --> 00:34:59.480
Hi.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.790
So I'll admit I haven't
read the book yet,

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.440
but it seems you've done a
lot of traveling in your time.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.872
And I was wondering what
the biggest piece of advice

00:35:06.872 --> 00:35:08.330
you have is for
someone who will be

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.510
spending some time in
an unfamiliar place.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.060
KARI BYRON: It depends
in different countries.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.836
If you're in Egypt,
you didn't drop

00:35:15.836 --> 00:35:17.710
anything, no matter how
many people say, hey,

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.100
you dropped something.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.810
Don't stop and turn around.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:22.561
You didn't drop anything.

00:35:22.561 --> 00:35:24.560
I would say it would be
my best piece of advice.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.840
But, no, I think
sometimes you've

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.390
got to not look at
the travel blogs

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.297
and just let it go and explore.

00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.880
Because I think that's the most
interesting part of traveling,

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.360
is just stumbling into things.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.930
It's great to have an idea
of where you're going,

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.370
but I generally--

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.740
even in the United
States, we do a lot

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:50.040
of filming in places like
Philadelphia, for example.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.050
I knew that I had six hours
before I had to be anywhere,

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:59.360
so I looked for the best vegan
cheesesteak I could find.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.560
And it was miles away.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.185
I'm like, OK, I
want to walk there,

00:36:02.185 --> 00:36:04.310
no matter what neighborhood
I have to walk through.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.250
And along the way, I
found so many cool things,

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:12.530
like art galleries, and weirdo
people, and oddities shops.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.690
And the Mutter Museum
was on the way, which

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.930
is the medical oddities museum.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.420
So I found so much
craziness along the way

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.010
just to get to the
vegan cheesesteak.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.320
And it was the journey,
not the reward.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.175
It was delicious, by the way.

00:36:26.175 --> 00:36:28.160
So I had this whole
entire adventure

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.130
because, instead of, OK, I can
sit in this hotel room for six

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:34.850
hours, I made some sort
of arbitrary destination

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:37.220
and just let my feet
take me into the weird.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.840
JAMES MOREHEAD: So we'll
take one more from the Dory

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.131
and one more from the audience.

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:42.920
So I'm sure you get
asked this a lot, too.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.130
If you had a chance to do
Mythbusters again, would you?

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.120
Or is that part of your
life, had wonderful bookends

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.389
and that's that?

00:36:51.389 --> 00:36:52.430
KARI BYRON: I don't know.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.260
Because Mythbusters can't
be Mythbusters again.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.176
Because I've learned a
bunch from Mythbusters.

00:36:56.176 --> 00:36:58.100
And the whole amazing
thing of the journey

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.280
is that I had no
idea what I was doing

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.560
at all from the beginning.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.990
Everybody thought Mythbusters
was a science show.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.040
It wasn't a science show.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.581
None of us have a
science background.

00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:12.750
We all were just experiencing it
together and learning together.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.950
And I almost feel
like, at this point,

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:20.500
I don't know if I would have the
same giant reactions to things

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.760
because I know when stuff's
going to blow up now.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.770
So I'm not sure if
I could do it again.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:28.401
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool, so who
wants to be our last question?

00:37:28.401 --> 00:37:31.530
Hand raise, or down here.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:32.030
No pressure.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:33.071
You're the last question.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.890
AUDIENCE: I don't mean to
fixate on Mythbusters, but--

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.820
KARI BYRON: It's OK.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.124
That's the whole
reason that I'm here.

00:37:42.124 --> 00:37:43.540
AUDIENCE: Jamie
and Adam have been

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:49.000
pretty open about the
chemistry or lack thereof.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.510
At Google, we talk a
lot about cultural fit

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.900
when we talk about a candidate.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.070
But it sort of seems that
their lack of chemistry

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.860
has actually produced
something really great that

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.242
lasted for as long as it did.

00:38:01.242 --> 00:38:02.950
Do you think it's
actually more important

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:06.400
for a successful project
to have good team chemistry

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.770
or to have that clash
of personalities

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:11.620
that the two, I
guess, hosts had?

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.050
KARI BYRON: Well, you can
have a clash of personality,

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:17.680
but you still have to have
a respect for each other

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.810
and what you bring to the table.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.540
When that's gone, it's over.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.250
My team, with Tory,
and Grant, and I,

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.770
we had amazing chemistry.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:32.560
And so the three of us had the
same fun Mythbustery results

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.900
than Jamie and Adam
that had the clash.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.060
But I think that
the common thread

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.430
is that we all respected
each other's skill set

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.520
and what we brought to the table
and appreciated the diversity.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.950
Because I really do think
that diversity is the best

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.296
way to solve any problem.

00:38:46.296 --> 00:38:47.170
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.690
KARI BYRON: And we
still all hang out.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.830
I still torture
Tory all the time.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:53.630
We still prank each other a lot.

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:56.749
That's kind of my dream,
is to have a prank show.

00:38:56.749 --> 00:38:58.540
JAMES MOREHEAD: What's
your favorite prank,

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.290
if you could choose just one?

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.456
You talk about some of this
in the book, the pranks.

00:39:01.456 --> 00:39:02.170
And that--

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:02.860
KARI BYRON: I mean,
on Mythbusters, we

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.270
did a lot of different pranks.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.990
But Tory and I, at one point,
trying to create a prank show--

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.050
it didn't get bought,
but we actually

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.510
perpetrated an amazing
prank on some unknowing

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.730
people that thought they
were on a reality show.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:22.060
We brought them in to watch
the process of cryogenics

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.640
and told them that
it was all real,

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.624
and then had the cryogenically
frozen people turn into zombies

00:39:28.624 --> 00:39:29.290
and attack them.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.390
And it was hilarious.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:35.980
And I'm dying to put it on
to the YouTube at some point

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.424
secretly.

00:39:37.424 --> 00:39:38.590
Maybe somebody will leak it.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.472
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yeah, if YouTube
and [INAUDIBLE] watch it.

00:39:41.472 --> 00:39:42.635
Cool.

00:39:42.635 --> 00:39:44.990
KARI BYRON: But that was the
funnest I ever perpetrated

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:46.190
myself on a grand scheme.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.890
But other than that,
Tory's made me vomit a lot

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.020
by drinking things
that I thought

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.590
were bodily fluids that
actually he switched it

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.420
with some special effects.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.150
All of the sudden he's drinking
an entire beaker of old saliva

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.740
and I'm throwing
up on the floor,

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.754
but it turns out it was
just tea and he's a jerk.

00:40:04.754 --> 00:40:06.170
JAMES MOREHEAD:
Well, with that, I

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:09.092
think it's appropriate that
we end with a Tory story.

00:40:09.092 --> 00:40:10.300
KARI BYRON: OK, what you got?

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.972
JAMES MOREHEAD: No, [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:11.972 --> 00:40:12.680
KARI BYRON: Darn.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.420
JAMES MOREHEAD: So
I want to thank you

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.570
for coming back to
Google a second time,

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:18.710
trekking down from the city.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.724
And everyone, Crash Test
Girl, it's a fantastic book.

00:40:21.724 --> 00:40:23.390
You're going to learn
something from it.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:24.355
It's very personal.

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:24.980
It's emotional.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.470
It's not what you'd expect.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.980
And I highly recommend it.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.200
And I actually read the book.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.330
So hopefully your other
book tour interviews,

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.090
you get a mix of people
who read the book.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.430
So I want to thank you again
for coming back to Google.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:38.910
It's been a pleasure
having you here.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.680
KARI BYRON: Well,
thanks for inviting me.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.305
I love it here.

00:40:40.305 --> 00:40:43.950
[APPLAUSE]
