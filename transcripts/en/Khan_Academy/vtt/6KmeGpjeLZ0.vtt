00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
 

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.850
SAL KHAN: I am very
excited to have

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.180
Vi Hart visiting the
office over here.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.410
And we were just having a
very mathematical conversation

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.210
earlier today.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.405
And she mentioned something
that is fascinating.

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:11.780
VI HART: Yeah, I
was just telling

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.230
Sal about a cool thing
called Benford's Law.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.470
SAL KHAN: Benford's Law.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.020
And what is Benford's law?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.430
VI HART: It's this
weird phenomenon

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.110
that you get when you're looking
at numbers in the real world.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.930
So for example, we've
got some graphs here.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.490
If you take the populations
of all the countries and you,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.770
say all right, what
is the first digit

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.370
of the population
of the country?

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.610
Whether it's 1 million
or 1,000 or 100,000,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.340
we'll say, OK,
that starts with 1.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.840
So we'll count up all of the
countries that start with 1.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.170
And I guess here
we've got 27 of them.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.400
SAL KHAN: Yes, about 27.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.954
So literally anything
that starts with a 1 here.

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:53.120
So it could be a country
that has a population of 1,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.720
a population of 17, or a
population of 1 billion,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.520
300 million, blah, blah, blah.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.985
They would all fall into
this bucket right over here.

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:03.610
VI HART: Right.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.349
And then if you
start with 2, you

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.590
fall in the second bucket,
and so on and so forth.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.760
SAL KHAN: Better color.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.560
Oh yeah, go ahead.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.870
VI HART: Yeah,
definitely better color.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.540
SAL KHAN: Better color.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.990
VI HART: Oh, that's great.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.540
SAL KHAN: Yeah, that's
the blue, better contrast.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.692
VI HART: So the
question is, all right,

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:17.920
you'd think you'd have kind
of random numbers here.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.560
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.827
For that first digit,
it's kind of random.

00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:21.410
VI HART: Yeah.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.230
I mean, there's huge differences
in populations of countries.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.075
Some have billions
and some have--

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:27.950
I don't know what the
smallest population is.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.320
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.310
It's, like, Montenegro
or something like that.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.470
VI HART: Yeah.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.217
So--

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.800
SAL KHAN: Montenegro
is not a country.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.730
What am I thinking?

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.090
I'm thinking of-- what's the one
that's on the French Riviera?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.298
Anyway, we can edit that out.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.464
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:40.380
VI HART: I don't know.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.170
I would be interested
to see for populations

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.910
of states and everything.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.486
SAL KHAN: The Vatican is the
smallest country, I believe.

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:49.360
VI HART: Yeah, it is.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.380
Does that still count?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.880
I guess--

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.120
SAL KHAN: I think
the Vatican counts.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.500
They have their own-- yes.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.280
VI HART: I don't know exactly
what the requirements were

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.640
to be. [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.230
SAL KHAN: But it would
include the Vatican, which

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.810
I think would be in,
like, the thousands.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.460
VI HART: Yeah.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.200
And so why would this happen?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.750
Why would you see
more 1's than 2's?

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.977
Like, what is going on?

00:02:06.977 --> 00:02:07.601
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:09.324
And it's not some small chance.

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:11.115
I mean, we were talking
also about the idea

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:16.280
that it is more likely to
have odd-numbered addresses

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.605
than even-numbered.

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:19.220
We were talking
about that earlier.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.860
VI HART: Yeah, I just
learned about that recently.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.735
And that makes sense.

00:02:21.735 --> 00:02:24.210
SAL KHAN: That makes sense,
because every house will

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.644
have a number 1 on it, or a 10.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.810
VI HART: Right, every street,
if your street starts,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.726
you know, with house
number 1, house number 2,

00:02:29.726 --> 00:02:32.310
house number 3, if you have
an odd number of houses,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.060
then your street has more odd
numbers than even numbers.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.880
SAL KHAN: Exactly.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.400
And if you have an even number,
you have the same amount.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.800
VI HART: Right.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.300
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.383
VI HART: But that's starting
with 1, which is odd.

00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:42.830
Whereas here, populations
don't start with 1.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.580
SAL KHAN: Exactly.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.590
And that phenomenon that
we're talking about the street

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.430
numbers, it's not an
extreme phenomenon.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.780
It's like, 50 point
some 0-- you have

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.470
a slightly higher probability
of having an odd-numbered house,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.104
or I guess a 1 house,
than everything else.

00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:01.520
VI HART: Yeah, it's kind of
exactly what you would expect.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.228
SAL KHAN: It's exactly
what you'd expect.

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:05.810
But here, it's a significantly
higher probability,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.380
of a random
country's population,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.501
that its first digit is a 1
versus its first digit as an 8

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:13.000
or a 9.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.677
I mean, it seems a
little bit strange.

00:03:14.677 --> 00:03:15.260
VI HART: Yeah.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.050
And this isn't
just in countries.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.910
You see this if you're looking
at a lot of financial stuff.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.637
Like, how much money
does a company make.

00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:23.220
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.170
The 1's just show up as a first
digit much more frequently.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.670
VI HART: Much more
frequently, yeah.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.706
And here, we have
another fancy graph,

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.590
which is completely crazy.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.200
It's the first digit
of physical constants.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.911
So what would be examples
of some physical constants?

00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:42.410
SAL KHAN: I'm
assuming that-- and we

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.840
weren't able to figure out
exactly what they applied

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.540
here-- but I'm assuming it's
things like the Gravitational

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.950
constant, Planck's constant.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.470
And this seems kind
of crazy to me,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.300
because it depends on the
units that you're using,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.895
it depends on a
whole bunch of things

00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:56.270
that you have to
assume about it.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.310
But even when you use these
kind of arbitrary physical

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.610
constants, which I'm
assuming they're doing here,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.140
the most significant digit
in these physical constants

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.170
is still much more
likely to be 1.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.170
It almost exactly
follows Benford's Law.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.207
And it kind of gives
you goose pimples.

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:13.790
VI HART: Yeah.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.510
So the challenge here
is to-- oh, by the way,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.990
Benford is the guy
with the glasses.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.810
SAL KHAN: Oh, yes.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.200
Yes, you might be wondering.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.100
These aren't-- yes.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.784
These are--

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:24.200
VI HART: They're
not both Benford.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.500
SAL KHAN: These are not Benford
pre-shave and post-shave.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.700
No.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.800
This right there is Benford.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.500
And obviously it was named
after him, Benford's Law.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.800
But we put this gentleman,
who didn't shave--

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.300
VI HART: Yeah, the cool guy
with the beard is Simon Newcomb.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.800
SAL KHAN: Simon Newcomb.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.000
VI HART: Not Duke Nukem.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.292
SAL KHAN: Not Duke Nukem.

00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:44.000
And we put him here
because he's actually

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.650
the first person who
stated Benford's Law.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.000
He obviously did not
call it Benford's Law.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.541
VI HART: And he had
the better beard.

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:50.300
SAL KHAN: And he
had, yes, the most--

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.300
he was overall a more
imposing character.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.200
At least to me.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.116
This guy looks a little
bit like Harry Truman.

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:57.800
Maybe this is Harry.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.475
I don't know.

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:01.100
Yeah, maybe I've got
the wrong picture.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.417
Anyway, let's just--

00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:05.000
VI HART: So the question, what
is kind of a pure case of this?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.500
I mean, when you've
this random data,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.583
you see some fluctuations.

00:05:07.583 --> 00:05:09.375
Like, in a country,
right, there are more--

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.874
SAL KHAN: It's
pretty close, though.

00:05:10.874 --> 00:05:12.350
It's pretty close to that curve.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.100
VI HART: Yeah, and our
sample size is pretty low.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.600
I mean--

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.600
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.500
VI HART: --when
you've only got--

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.950
SAL KHAN: There's,
like, 200 countries

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.300
or something like that.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.900
VI HART: Yeah.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.800
SAL KHAN: It went
up by, like, 50--

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.400
VI HART: It doesn't
perfectly follow it.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.900
SAL KHAN: --after the Soviet
Union fell and all that.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.400
But yeah, it's not a
huge number of countries.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.900
And even physical
constants, I don't

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.600
know how many physical constants
they randomly sampled over

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.200
here, but it is shockingly
close to Benford's law curve.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.200
But there's kind of a more
pure way of studying it.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.100
VI HART: Right.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.200
So when we look at
this other graph,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.492
this is kind of like
the pure Benford's Law.

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:40.700
SAL KHAN: Pure Benford's Law.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.500
So that's this curve
that we're kind of

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.759
fitting to that other,
more rough data.

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.300
And what's amazing
here is that if we

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.400
take kind of pure
mathematical constructs,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.200
like the powers of 2, or--

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.000
VI HART: Or the
Fibonacci series.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.800
You'd think that in
the Fibonacci series,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.917
you're adding all this
stuff up, and why--

00:05:56.917 --> 00:05:59.000
SAL KHAN: And then you
just take the first digit--

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.600
VI HART: Just the first digit.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.400
SAL KHAN: --and put
them in these piles,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.700
it would actually exactly
match Benford's Law.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.900
Like, no deviation.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.800
It is exactly--

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.700
VI HART: Right,
mathematically [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.300
SAL KHAN: Mathematically.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.700
So let's just be clear,
because this is fascinating.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.575
So if you were to take
the powers of 2's, you

00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:18.182
get 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

00:06:18.182 --> 00:06:19.640
I'm gonna go pretty
high so you can

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.200
start to see how
we're doing this.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.100
128, 256, 512.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.900
And you just keep
going on and on forever

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.100
with every power of 2.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.200
And you say, OK, how many
of these start with a 1?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.300
And you would go
and you would say,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.442
well, this starts with
a 1, this starts with--

00:06:34.442 --> 00:06:35.900
or the most
significant digit is 1.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.700
That starts with a 1,
that starts with a 1.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.158
And you would just find the
percentage that start with a 1.

00:06:40.158 --> 00:06:42.725
And you would plot
it on-- you would

00:06:42.725 --> 00:06:44.600
give the 1's that credit
for that percentage.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.300
And then you'd say, OK, the
ones that start with a 2.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.100
And you'd say, OK,
that starts with a 2,

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.384
and that starts with 2.

00:06:50.384 --> 00:06:51.800
But we want to
keep going on this.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.300
And we could probably do
this with a computer program

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.000
or something, where we'd
go really high powers of 2.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.800
And then you would
say, what percentage

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.200
of all of these powers
of 2 start with a 2?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.434
You would, say, get this
percentage right over here.

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:05.600
The numbers that start with
a 9, you would get this.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.200
And you would perfectly
match Benford's Law.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.000
This seems magical.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.542
VI HART: It does
seem pretty magical.

00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:14.458
SAL KHAN: And this isn't
just for powers of 2.

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:16.100
This is powers of any number.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.284
VI HART: Almost any number.

00:07:17.284 --> 00:07:18.200
There's special cases.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.400
SAL KHAN: I believe it
might be every number.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.850
Oh, yes.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:20.900
No.
VI HART: Well, powers of 1.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.800
SAL KHAN: 1 would
not work, right.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.300
VI HART: And then there's,
like, powers of 10.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.424
SAL KHAN: Powers of 10
would not work as well, yes.

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:28.100
But every other-- numbers that
kind of mix it up a little bit.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.975
VI HART: Powers of 0.

00:07:28.975 --> 00:07:29.900
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.800
You are correct.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.000
Every number that would
mix it up a little bit.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.300
VI HART: Yeah.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.700
It'd have to have a
certain amount of mixing it

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.367
up a little bit.

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:35.325
SAL KHAN: Right, right.

00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:38.300
But every other, yes, they would
exhibit Benford's distribution.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.617
And so we want to challenge
you to think about why that is.

00:07:41.617 --> 00:07:43.700
And maybe you could even
put your own explanations

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.700
in our little message board,
on either YouTube or our page,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.600
if you're curious.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.600
But we'll challenge you
to think why that is.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.200
And then we'll offer at least a
decent shot at an explanation.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.717
Maybe we'll have
other explanations.

00:07:55.717 --> 00:07:56.300
VI HART: Yeah.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.800
SAL KHAN: So actually, we'll
leave you there in this video.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.600
And the next video
will explain why

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.550
we think-- an intuitive
reason why it works.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.067
