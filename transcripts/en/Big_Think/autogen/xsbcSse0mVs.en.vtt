great potential benefit and and a great
 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.990
great potential benefit and and a great
potential risk and I think it's

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000
potential risk and I think it's
 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.030
potential risk and I think it's
generally a terrible thing that these

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040
generally a terrible thing that these
 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.020
generally a terrible thing that these

it didn't go awry it certainly could
have gone awry right so I think the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340
have gone awry right so I think the
 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.700
have gone awry right so I think the
these substances can give tremendous

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710
these substances can give tremendous
 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.679
these substances can give tremendous
insight I would say you can also get

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689
insight I would say you can also get
 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.560

even without a bad trip or some tragedy
you can get a lot of illusory insights

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030
you can get a lot of illusory insights
 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.209
you can get a lot of illusory insights
use it using these things also I mean

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219
use it using these things also I mean

certain domain you can access with
 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.940
certain domain you can access with
psychedelics then when you bring them

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950
psychedelics then when you bring them
 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.360
psychedelics then when you bring them
back into this logical and empirical

people can lose sight of that also so

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190
people can lose sight of that also so
 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.160
people can lose sight of that also so
that you know there's a mix of amazing

just the the risk of things that are

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739
just the the risk of things that are
 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.559
just the the risk of things that are
meaningful in some sense but illusory

experiences can can also be engineered
and and you can you can make much more

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519
and and you can you can make much more
 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.400
and and you can you can make much more
finely tuned modifications to the mind

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410
finely tuned modifications to the mind
 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.220
finely tuned modifications to the mind
of the AI then we're able to do with

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230
of the AI then we're able to do with
 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.520
of the AI then we're able to do with
with the human brain so and I think the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530
with the human brain so and I think the
 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.060
with the human brain so and I think the
potential from hybridizing a human brain

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070
potential from hybridizing a human brain
 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.680
potential from hybridizing a human brain
with an AI in an engineered mind is also

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690
with an AI in an engineered mind is also
 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.170
with an AI in an engineered mind is also
quite quite fascinating right because

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180
quite quite fascinating right because
 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.290
quite quite fascinating right because
then this AI

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300
then this AI
 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.550
then this AI
can read out the state of the human

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560
can read out the state of the human
 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.030
can read out the state of the human
brain understand the structure of the

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040
brain understand the structure of the
 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.400

brain and mind and again with this kind

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410
brain and mind and again with this kind
 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.330
brain and mind and again with this kind
of cyborg type experience I think we can

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340
of cyborg type experience I think we can
 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.570
of cyborg type experience I think we can
get much finer grained and more

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580
get much finer grained and more
 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.730
get much finer grained and more
interesting guidance of states of

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740
interesting guidance of states of
 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.710
interesting guidance of states of
consciousness and then we can then we

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720
consciousness and then we can then we
 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.340
consciousness and then we can then we
can with with any drugs that that we

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350
can with with any drugs that that we
 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.040

that we have right now so I'm I'm very

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050
that we have right now so I'm I'm very
 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.440
that we have right now so I'm I'm very
much looking forward to all the new

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450

states of consciousness we can explore

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.390
states of consciousness we can explore
once we can you know Jack our brains

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400
