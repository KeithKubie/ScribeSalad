00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.049
&gt;&gt; You know, we have today the highest level
of unemployment ever

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.550
recorded.
And the highest level of youth unemployment

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.820
ever recorded with three
times higher than adults in many countries

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.650
and in some regions
50 percent of all unemployment.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.369
And we are facing a jobless recovery in a
number of countries.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.259
So the key question is put job creation at
the center of the recovery.

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:31.050
How could I put it politically?
We need to put the same policy decisiveness,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
the same creativity, the
same capacity for out-of-the-box thinking

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.390
that went into saving banks,
into saving jobs, into creating jobs into

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.180
the investment process that
necessary and also for youth employment.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.820
How do we do it?
We can't repeat the mistakes of the past.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.220
We're not going to get out of the crisis by
repeating the policies that

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.320
led us into the crisis.
So the International Labor Organization has

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.150
put the policy of global
jobs back to be able to address in a primary

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.310
and a fundamental way the
issues of jobs and particularly for youth.
