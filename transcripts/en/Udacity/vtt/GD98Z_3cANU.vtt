00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem, we want to modify add<u>to</u>index

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
such that a particular URL appears only once for a given keyword.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
As the code stands here, if a keyword appears twice in a URL,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the URL will be in the index twice for that keyword,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if you could follow along.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The solution to this is actually really simple and only a single line of code.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
First let's go over add<u>to</u>index really briefly.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If we want to add this URL to this keyword in the index,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we're going to go through everything in the index,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and when we hit the right entry for that keyword,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
as it stands now, we simply append the URL to the URL list.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But we're going to add 1 line of code that says only append to the URL list

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
if the URL doesn't already appear in that list.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We also need to fix our tabbing--very important--and that's it.
