ERIC SCHMIDT: Google is about
starting conversations with

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.520
data and trying to start with
some basic scientific

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.910
observations and getting
the measurements right.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.130
And I think that's one of the
things that you guys could be

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.450
proudest of, is that you started
from a fact basis as

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.430
opposed to an emotional one.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.340
Robert, do you want to
introduce everybody?

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.460
ROBERT STONE: I'm
Robert Stone.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.260
I'm the producer and director
of the film.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.230
This is Stewart Brand, Gwyneth
Cravens, Mark Lynas, Michael

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.020
Shellenberger, all of whom
started off being very

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.270
anti-nuclear.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.470
MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER: The view
that we all sort of came

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.290
to in our own ways is that
cheap, clean energy is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.500
arguably the most important
thing from a human development

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.600
and an environmental
perspective.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.530
From cheap, clean energy,
everybody in the world can

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.700
have medicines.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.960
They can have clean water.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.770
They can have longer lifespans,
healthier lives.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.370
And you can use that energy,
then, to grow more food on

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.950
less land, letting more of
nature go back to wilderness.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.180
This is why Bill Gates says
cheap, clean energy is the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.010
biggest human development goal
of the 21st century.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.570
STEWART BRAND: The most energy
efficient way to live is right

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.050
on the edge of desperate
poverty.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.760
In the favelas and slums of the
world, there are people

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.660
who are really using very, very
little material and very,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.510
very little energy.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.570
They are so green, and they
are so eager to stop being

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.930
that kind of green.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.570
And the main economic and
demographic event in the world

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.920
now is people are getting
the hell out of poverty

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.740
all over the world.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.020
Where you've been traveling,
I think you're seeing this.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.350
And in even the most desperate
slums, people are in those

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.210
desperate slums, rather than
back in the village, because

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.530
in the village, they
were stuck.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.450
In town, they've got a shot.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.070
And they're taking that shot.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.260
And you'll see wires everywhere,
because they need

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.660
electricity to do all
the stuff that means

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.360
being part of a city.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.670
But as you're finding in
Pakistan and elsewhere, if

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.150
it's uneven, if it's unreliable
electricity, then

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.240
everything slows down.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.160
School slows down.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.500
Medicine slows down.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.980
MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER: If you
can get the one billion

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.560
richest people in the world to
cut their energy consumption

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.570
in half, to get the other 7 or
8 billion people up to that

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.730
standard, you're still going
to have to triple or maybe

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.540
quadruple global energy
consumption.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.360
So the math actually
doesn't work out.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.940
MARK LYNAS: The fact that we've
got enough mined uranium

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.590
and spent fuel already to run
the entire country at 80

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.960
gigawatts, which is its current
energy consumption,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.030
for 500 years is interesting.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.240
And you could run the US for a
thousand years on stuff that's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.070
already sitting around in
junkyards in Kentucky.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.740
We don't have a fundamental
energy shortage, which is the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.500
complete reverse of the way
we've always had this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.860
discussion.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.110
Why do you need to conserve
energy and switch everything?

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.480
Or we'll say to Chinese that
they can't have standards of

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.830
living that we've all
become-- there is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.570
no shortage of energy.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.310
We've just got to accept that
we're going to use different

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.350
technologies.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.130
The reality is that since the
anti-nuclear movement really

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.450
came up in the early 1970s,
maybe a bit earlier, the US

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.610
has invested in 150 new
coal-fired power stations.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.630
So every single nuclear plant
that was proposed and then

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.640
canceled because of anti-nuclear
activism either

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.200
was replaced by a coal plant
right there, and in some

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.510
places they actually tore out
the places where the reactors

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.970
were going to put, and they put
coal boilers in the exact

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.320
same locations or
somewhere else.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.910
And so the environmental
movement has made the world

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.010
safe for coal, unintentionally
of course, and somehow now has

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.160
to look to a future where they
want to eliminate coal, just

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.820
as the rest of the world--

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.300
Asia, China, India, so on---

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.370
getting to the standard of
living or hoping to get to the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.840
standard of living in energy
consumption that the US and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.696
everyone else put in
some time ago.

00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:47.130
ROBERT STONE: We're starting to
realize real costs for not

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.010
dealing with climate change.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.500
Hurricane Sandy, I think,
has cost $60 billion.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.320
What if we get another
one next year?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.890
I mean, that could happen.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.180
The catastrophic pollution
that's going on in Beijing

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.940
right now--

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.630
there are costs that are
starting to emerge from not

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.450
tackling this problem.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.760
STEWART BRAND: A lot of the
environmental movement that

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.760
took shape then was one, leftist
and two, romantic.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.570
It was part of the hippie
counterculture thing, which I

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.930
was part of.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.880
And so ideology and romanticism
encourage you to

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.980
basically have a narrative
and a few notions.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.035
And then everything fits
into that narrative.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.160
It doesn't work with
climate change.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.080
With climate change and with
greenhouse gases, you've got

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.940
to work back from
the solution.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.830
My fellow environmentalists have
this romantic attachment

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.390
to a certain view of the world,
which does not fit with

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.280
actually dealing with the
engineering problem

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.180
address.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.680
ERIC SCHMIDT: But isn't there
another problem, which is

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.630
people are loath to change their
minds and admit that

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.230
they were wrong?

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.490
And you all each, actually,
in the movie say,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.830
this is what I thought.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.560
Some new data came along,
and I changed my mind.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.930
ROBERT STONE: I actually
don't agree with that.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.340
ERIC SCHMIDT: No, you don't
agree with that?

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.470
Go ahead.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.100
STEWART BRAND: This is the
difference between

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.470
evidence-driven and
ideology-driven, is ideology,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.020
you double down on your theory
of the world, even thought

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.420
it's wrong.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.190
ROBERT STONE: Most documentaries
function and are

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.580
marketed and have a life out
in the world by reinforcing

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.230
people's preconceptions
about the world.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.740
What we've done here with
this movie is to

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.010
take a different tack.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.060
And it's not like coming at you
in your face and saying,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.610
oh, you're wrong.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.160
This is why you're wrong.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.465
It's we are you.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:37.240
And we were wrong about
some things.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.550
And we were wrong for a whole
variety of reasons, because we

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.240
were given information
that was wrong.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.740
And so it takes you
on a journey.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.080
But what I found--

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.200
and this was one of the
surprises that came out of

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.710
showing it at Sundance--

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.960
is that it actually--

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.140
it's like in a religious
conversion.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.200
It's actually a really--

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.310
I don't know if the right
word is enjoyable.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.650
It's a cathartic experience.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.470
It's actually a more satisfying
experience than

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.030
being told what you
already believe.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.670
Like, that's nice to be
told, oh, I'm right.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:15.880
But it's actually even more
exhilarating to have your mind

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.340
changed-- or no, not to have
your mind changed but to

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.700
change your mind, to come to
your own conclusions about

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.190
something based on
new information.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.680
You have to look at the worst
case scenarios that have

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.990
happened with even the most
ridiculously designed reactor

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.070
ever built, which is the
one at Chernobyl.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.630
The worst-case scenario turns
out to be not the apocalypse

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.940
that we all thought it was.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.900
I trust the United Nations and
the World Health Organization

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.370
that's done the definitive
studies on this.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.070
And their conclusion is that
Chernobyl has killed 56

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.860
people, which was probably the
most astonishing fact I came

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.310
across in making
the whole film.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.170
So if you look at all of the
various ways that we produce

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:05.940
energy and figure out the deaths
per terawatt, how many

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.710
people die per unit of energy
produced, nuclear is the

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.920
second safest after wind.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.720
It's even safer than
solar panels, as we

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.350
point out in the film.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: Because people
fall off the solar panels.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.700
ROBERT STONE: Well, no, it's
actually making solar panels

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.670
is a toxic process.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.010
ERIC SCHMIDT: Really?

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.000
ROBERT STONE: The materials,
the cadmium and lithium and

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.250
all these things, right?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.860
So the safety thing, we
can obviously make

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.030
reactors much safer.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.100
And we show that in the film--
new types of reactors that are

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.050
passively safe, that they
don't have all these

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.810
redundancies built into
them, because

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.060
they're inherently unsafe.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.850
But even the reactors
that are--

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.380
these gargantuan things that
were sort of a crazy thing to

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.730
be built, anyway--

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.330
have turned out to be
remarkably safe.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.020
GWYNETH CRAVENS: I just wanted
to add one thing that changed

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.160
my mind about nuclear power,
which was visiting nuclear

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.520
plants and another nuclear
facilities and nuclear waste

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.720
repositories and so on.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.180
Seeing it for yourself, you
realize how many barriers

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.180
there are between the public and
the radioactive material.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.560
And if people were more used
to these plants, which look

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.360
formidable in the distance
because of their giant cooling

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.350
towers and stuff, if people were
educated early on about

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.190
how nuclear power worked and
what radiation can and cannot

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.400
do, I think that would
help significantly.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.960
ROBERT STONE: Well, one of the
main stories in the film is

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.169
the development of the integral
fast reactor, which

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.490
was a reactor that was developed
in the late '80s and

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.960
early '90s in the United States,
where they set out to

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.820
really solve a lot of
the basic problems

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.190
with nuclear power.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.880
And one of the key
ones was safety.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.380
And this was a reactor
that was--

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.490
they tried to melt it down.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.602
We have film of it, and those
of you who haven't seen the

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.500
film, there's film of
them trying to melt

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.360
the thing down twice.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.120
They ran through shutting off
all the safety devices, just

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.810
letting the thing completely
run wild, and sitting back,

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.550
not touching anything, not
touching the dials.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.450
And the thing just passively
shut itself down.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.780
As it got hotter, the reactivity
diminished and it

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.710
shut itself down.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.170
So this was a reactor that we
developed that does have these

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.910
kind of advance passive safety
devices or designs that are a

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.260
central part of fourth
generation reactors.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.210
And it was killed really
for political reasons.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.440
So nobody here is advocating us
ever building the kinds of

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.370
reactors that caused Chernobyl
or caused Fukushima or

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.050
anything like that.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.100
What we're advocating for is
innovation and R&amp;D on advanced

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.870
designs that don't have these
kind of problems.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.060
ERIC SCHMIDT: Look at
aviation today.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.110
The recent statistics are
that aviation, flown by

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.790
professional pilots and
commercial airlines, both

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.000
globally and in the United
States, is the safest it has

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.470
ever been since the
introduction

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.100
of commercial flight.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.940
That is the progress of 50
years of smart people,

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:07.050
regulators, reproducible
designs, competitive

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.040
financing, lots and lots of
learning, investigations, all

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.090
those kinds of things.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.890
The fact of the matter is you
put enough airplanes in the

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.940
air, at least one of them
is going to crash.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.290
But if you can then design in
such a way that crash didn't,

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.520
you improve it.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.560
And I think we have to get
to that conversation.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.290
Facts actually do change.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:23.930
Data--

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.050
we do actually learn things.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.840
Society does actually change.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.680
And I think as a result of this
conversation, I'm now

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.170
quite convinced that the problem
is not a fact-based

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.190
one, it's a trust-based
one, that I think

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.360
Stewart, you said it right.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.950
The dialogue really sort
of named that.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.590
Because until there's some basic
trust by the average

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.210
person that the smart people,
representing by you guys, are

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.940
going to do the right thing or
the governments or something,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.480
we're going to be in this
quagmire for, in my

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.840
view, far too long.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.090
And I think we have an
opportunity with some of these

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.930
new technological ideas to
actually have a real

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.700
breakthrough.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.350
It'd be nice if we actually got
that and we got it before

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.600
we destroyed the planet.
