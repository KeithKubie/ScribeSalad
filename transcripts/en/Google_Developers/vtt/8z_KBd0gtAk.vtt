00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.090
So if you go back, we talked about games.
Another important class of applications is

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.440
content, newspapers, magazines.
When you read a magazine, it is a really nice

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.560
experience. So how do you create that same
experience on the Web?

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.159
This is an important problem, and we have
reached out to magazine publishers to help

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:27.619
create these experiences. To show what you
can do in terms of producing content on the

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.560
Web, I would like to invite Terry McDonnell
who is the editor of Sports Illustrated.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:45.420
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Terry McDonnell: Walking out here it occurred

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.420
to me that I might be the oldest person in
the room.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.980
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Terry McDonnell: But this is fine with me.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.450
In my business, still standing is a very good
thing.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:08.620
My brand, Sports Illustrated, is a monster
traditional brand. Storied, extremely lucrative,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.740
started from a very simple idea, self-defining,
becoming more and more complicated. And now,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.700
changing faster than it ever has.
And it's not just Sports Illustrated.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.620
In my company, Time, Inc., every single one
of the iconic brands, and I am talking about

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.320
People, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly and
Time, is changing very fast also.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.780
The reason for this is that empowered engineers
and developers like all of you in this room

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.920
are, in turn, empowering and helping me as
an editor to create new versions of Sports

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.799
Illustrated.
That's why I'm here.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.810
I'm going to start with a video here, and
then we will go live. The video hopefully

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.830
will have a little swagger to it and it will
show you sort of where we are coming from

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.890
at Sports Illustrated.
It starts with the first cover in 1954.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:34.810
(Video Playing)
&gt;&gt;Terry McDonnell: Okay. We are live now.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.599
Driving today is the always the dangerous
David Link, founder of the Wonderfactory and

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:47.590
S.I.'s development partner in creating this
live HTML5 prototype that will hopefully show

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:56.090
some of the possibilities of bringing an enriched
magazine to laptops, netbooks and tablets.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.230
It's really -- he is opening it in the Chrome
store.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:08.560
It's really a very simple idea.
It's to somehow pull together the best of

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.471
the Web, the best of the magazine. This came
off fresh yesterday in Merced, our plant in

00:03:13.471 --> 00:03:20.270
Merced.
To pull out the absolute most important things

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.750
in the DNA in the magazine and translate them
in a way that they are even more enjoyable,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.239
like the photography for example. This goes
very deep for us. We have staff photographers,

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.519
one of the most popular things we have.
And the rest of it of course.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:44.870
What I am talking about here is a tightly
edited, curated, free, open, social, searchable

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.220
take on sports that you can customize for
yourself by rearranging it.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.801
It's also going to have, of course, live video
feeds, live news, live scores, like we have

00:03:57.801 --> 00:04:02.980
here.
All of this built on a foundation of strong

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.620
journalism and informed opinion about the
stories of the moment, like Tiger here.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.560
And additional content that in fact will pull
new further, that will allow you to participate

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.530
in this sports world.
This is a poll that we are doing live right

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.410
now about how to build a baseball franchise.
It's not necessarily good news for the Giants.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.520
This is one of our sports columns. We have
one of these every week. This is boxing which

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.680
is enriched by a video which happened outside
the room, behind the velvet ropes in the background.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.540
(Video Playing)
&gt;&gt;Terry McDonnell: You don't want to mess

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.480
with Floyd.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe in my skills and I believe in

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.910
my talent.
&gt;&gt;Terry McDonnell: And of course here is hockey,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.180
here is your golf, here is your NFL. Always
need video there, always need highlights,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.220
these of the number one draft choice, Sam
Bradford out of Oklahoma.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:10.960
Of course you might want to not watch this
now, might want to save it for later which

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.350
you can do here.
But most important, I think, is to always

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.009
know where you are in this magazine so you
can find what you want and go directly to

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.660
it.
For example, here is a piece on the end of

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.850
the road for Shaq.
[ Laughter ]

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:39.490
&gt;&gt;Terry McDonnell: Kind of a bad call.
The typography here is very, very important,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:47.240
because you came here to read this story,
and nothing retards reading like the formula

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:55.610
fonts that we are so used to online. And say
here, here is a strong portrait of Shaq. We

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.539
can deliver for you the video of this photo
shoot and how we put that cover together.

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:10.139
We can do this.
(Video Playing)

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:21.220
&gt;&gt;Terry McDonnell: The idea also that you
need to go deeper is very important because

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.550
you might want additional stories about Shaq
and his future.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.759
There they are.
You might want to go wider. You might want

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:34.100
to go into the NBA to see about Lebron, or
you might want to just see pictures of the

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.330
last time they played together and see what
that was like.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.270
And finally you probably want to share any
and/or all of this with your friends or whoever,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.230
and you have a number of choices there.
And as you are running through this, you can

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.889
always keep up with what other NBA fans are
thinking and saying about the league on Google

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.220
Buzz.
All of this stuff works very hard for the

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.240
user. And the advertising I think has to work
very hard, too.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.400
No more image messaging, really.
What we need is stuff that is actually useful.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.370
So this advertising, I submit to you, can
become so useful that it becomes content in

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.650
and of itself.
This is a new idea in advertising.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.569
Or it's not a new -- It would be new to actually
deliver it.

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:26.740
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:33.259
&gt;&gt;Terry McDonnell: You can -- But as you see
here, you can change the lens and see what

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:39.070
that's like. And then of course you want to
buy it, so we can show you where to buy it.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:45.600
So what you can see that we are going for
here is additional content of every kind,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:55.210
content that is enriched and of the moment
and feels different and right, and like a

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.490
magazine experience, like nothing else that
you see on the Web today.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:07.050
And when it is on the point of the most important
stories of the moment in sports, say like

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:15.220
in this case the impact of soccer on world
peace coming into the World Cup, this is a

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.500
very good and interesting thing for us to
be working on.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.940
There we go.
Now, like I said, this came off the press

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.570
in Merced. It is that.
Some of that was a little bit different, but

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:34.429
it was live, but this is something that we're
very, very excited about coming forward with.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:43.500
And the reason for that is that in the fall
of last year, not long after S.I. released

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.899
a video demo of what an enriched magazine
might look like on a tablet, I found myself

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:57.339
in a very small conference room in Mountain
View, and it hit me there that I was at the

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:08.239
beginning of a veritable storm of innovation
that might not be so new in Mountain View,

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:15.700
but that was going to allow the journalism
that I want and that my company Time, Inc.,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:25.739
stands for to flourish and to completely reimagine,
remake the business model to support it.

00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:33.499
So I'm thinking about, you know, that quote
in the sports movie "Field of Dreams" where

00:09:33.499 --> 00:09:40.660
he says, "If you build it, they will come."
I would add an addendum to that. It has to

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:48.019
be built open, it has to be well edited, it
has to be searchable, it has to be social,

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:52.970
and it has to be everywhere.
And if we do that, we can charge for it.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.209
It's great to be with you.
