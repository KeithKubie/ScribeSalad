00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.700
So now let's talk about how to reduce the waste,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.140
how to have fewer than 2 to the nth counters

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.460
and yet have a long history. So, we will talk

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.116
about the history-based predictor with shared counters. So again, the

00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:16.379
motivation for this is that with N-bit history, the way

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.760
we've just seen it, we will need 2 to the

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.548
nth counters per entry, if we want to do things the

00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:26.400
way we've just done them. And we also know that

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.590
for repeating patterns, only about N counters out of 2

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.409
to the N are really used. In reality we are

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.450
using about N plus 1, but basically the important thing

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.950
is that we are using the number of counters that is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.917
proportional to the size of the history. But we need

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:43.500
to have 2 to the nth counters, because we don't

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.270
know which histories will be important. So the idea here

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.680
is to share these two-bit counters between entries instead of dedicating

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.350
2 to the nth two bit counters to each entry.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.660
We will have a pool of two bit counters that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.828
entries will then use, but it is possible that different

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:03.854
entries with different program counters and different histories end up

00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:06.331
using the same two bit counter. So there is a

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:09.386
possibility of conflict, but if we have enough of these

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:12.831
two bit counters, because each entry really doesn't need too

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.790
many of them usually, we will have very few conflicts
