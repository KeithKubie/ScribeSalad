One kind of educational technology that
people are probably very familiar with

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.450
is educational games,
or game based learning.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.380
These are games that are developed
not just to be fun and engaging but

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.360
also to teach some material.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.670
I grew up on educational games.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.080
I remember things like
Super Solvers to Operation Neptune.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.440
And they're still some
of my favorite games.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.780
And the real power of those games is
that the learning in those games is very

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.810
authentic.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.620
They find a way to take the material
they want you to learn, and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.260
make a game out of that material.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.330
And that's where educational games
can really have a lot of power,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.650
is when they make the real
material itself come to life.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.340
But there can also be a dark
side of game-based learning.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.953
If what we make into the game is
not authentic to the material,

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:40.265
if we just kind of staple on
things like achievements and

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:41.740
badges onto a learning activity.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.616
We risk creating very inauthentic
motivation around that learning

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.680
activity.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.963
So when we talk about game based
learning we're really going to focus on

00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:53.300
how we can make the authentic parts of
the material come out in an engaging

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.916
and fun way.

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:58.194
As opposed to stapling on gaming
conventions just to make the activity

00:00:58.194 --> 00:01:02.480
more fun, but ultimately not make
the fun authentic to the material.
