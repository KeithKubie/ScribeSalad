[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.965
SPEAKER 1: I'm honored to host
Paul English and Tracy Kidder.

00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:14.920
We're here talking about
that Tracy's recent book--

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.470
"A Truck Full of Money,"
which is a fantastic book.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.260
And I want to start
off with Tracy.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.170
Tracy can you talk about the
research process involved

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.229
for making this book?

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:29.020
TRACY KIDDER: Yeah.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.170
Most of it was
following Paul around,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.070
which meant sometimes taking
six o'clock in the morning

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.990
trains from South Station
or red eyes from California

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.804
back to Boston.

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:45.040
It was interesting.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.240
It was fun.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.360
It was pretty much the
way I do it all the time.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.570
I mean, I've done
it now for-- I don't

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.510
know how many years-- 30
some years, 35, 36 years.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.300
I try to be a good
guest in person's life.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.640
He can tell you
whether I was or not.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.180
But I--

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.989
PAUL ENGLISH: Usually.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.780
TRACY KIDDER: Yeah.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.385
Hang around.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.850
So I think of that as
the primary research.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.390
I started this with a
curiosity about what

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.240
had happened to the world of the
digital in the last 35 years.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.050
Because back in the
early 80s, I published--

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.210
I watched a team of
computer engineers

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.180
build a new computer
back in Massachusetts.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.550
And I left that subject
as fast as I could,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.730
just because I wanted to
see the rest of the world.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.110
And that book, because it was,
to many people's surprise,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.360
including mine, a
success, I wanted

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.654
to make use of that
success by exploring

00:01:50.654 --> 00:01:51.570
the rest of the world.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.840
I did that for 30 some years.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.030
But then I got sort of curious
as to what had happened,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.130
or thought anyway it
might be fun to look into.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.050
And I knew Paul from Partners
in Health-- Dr. Paul Farmer's

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.602
organization-- and asked
him to show me around.

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:10.060
And after a while,
I thought, well,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.750
my guide should be my subject
as well, partly because

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.920
at least at that
time, it seemed to me

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.090
his career spanned a very big
segment of the digital age.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.270
I mean, really late
in the development

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.830
of the personal
computer to now--

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.950
and also his experience has been
pretty broad-- and a programmer

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.330
and a manager of programmers
and an entrepreneur,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.310
starting his own companies.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.420
But as time went on, I got--
I think of it as looking

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.670
for a window on this world.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.780
And it was an
interesting window.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.780
The view was interesting,
but I found the window

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.087
more interesting than the view.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.244
So I did different
kinds of research.

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:03.160
I'd go out and talk to
people who'd known Paul

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.690
and talk to experts in
various departments.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.540
Paul's life is pretty varied.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.790
So I ended up
learning a fair amount

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.430
about things like bipolar
disorder and myasthenia gravis,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.290
which your mom had, as well
as trying to learn something

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.260
about the World Wide Web.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.150
I had the great privilege
during all of this

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.490
to interview Donald Knuth.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.610
It was really the-- I
think a lot of people

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.241
would say-- they might call
him the progenitor of computer

00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:39.740
science.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.340
That wouldn't be entirely
fair, but he organized.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.300
And the first volumes of "The
Art of Computer Programming"

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.184
seems to have pulled
together the best that

00:03:48.184 --> 00:03:49.600
was known and
thought at the time,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.930
including some of
what he had done.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.500
He's still working on
it-- fascinating guy.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.530
And I was going to tell
you-- this is completely

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.865
off the subject-- but
it was wonderful for me

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:00.490
to talk to him.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.457
I enjoyed reading him immensely.

00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:04.040
Not "The Art of
Computer Programming,"

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.160
which was not meant for
the likes of me-- but he

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.161
writes really lucidly on
interesting philosophical

00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:10.660
subjects.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.310
There's a book that
I highly recommend,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.980
if you don't know it, called
"Things that a Computer

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.180
Scientist Rarely Talks About."

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.360
And he's quite religious.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.015
He has fascinating takes on God.

00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:26.520
And one of his many
published interviews

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.360
that people have with him,
he uses the word geeks.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.390
This is one of my
favorite things about it.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.500
He says, just sake of
brevity, let's say people

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.310
like me are geeks.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.340
And we are 2% of the population.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.735
And he goes on to
explain that in his view,

00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:44.110
it's probable that
the people who

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.879
built the pyramids years
ago-- the 2% of them--

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.670
would have been great
computer programmers,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.336
if there had been
computers at the time.

00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:54.670
So computer programming,
the great gift for it,

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.280
was probably something
he thinks in-born,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.530
awaiting its instrument.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.830
And he has some empirical
evidence of that.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.070
Anyway, I don't know
how I got off on that.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.120
But the term geek is
interesting to me,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.712
because like so many of these
words that were really nasty--

00:05:10.712 --> 00:05:12.670
a geek I think once
referred to these guys that

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.630
would play wild men in
those traveling caravan

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.470
things around the country.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.750
And as for nerd-- nerd and
geek are now terms of praise,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.340
often used by people who call
themselves nerds and geeks.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.535
I'm a basketball nerd.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.910
Anyway, I got off the subject.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.320
But that's one of the
great things about my job,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.840
is that I get to
talk to such people.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.760
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.580
And I noticed that
Donald Knuth's book

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.080
is like 2,200 pages long.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.330
TRACY KIDDER: Well, he's
working-- as I understand it,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.541
I think it's volume four.

00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:50.790
He's been on that a long time.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.640
I think volume four has
several-- five volumes already.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.626
But it's tough because he's
been writing about algorithms.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.390
I met him because of
a close old friend

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.670
of named Carl Barry, who is
one of the people who helps

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.930
to maintain the program tech.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.090
It was a lot of fun.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.460
SPEAKER 1: So behind the
name, "A Truck Full of Money,"

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.300
what inspired that?

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.305
TRACY KIDDER: There's a story.

00:06:23.305 --> 00:06:24.930
Some of the people
here know this guy--

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.930
Bill O'Donnell-- a very fine
programmer indeed-- lovely guy.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.830
When Bill O'Donnell left
Kayak, the engineers

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.720
stood and gave him
a standing ovation.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.400
That's, I'm told, very, very
rare in a world of computer

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.220
engineers.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.680
Some years before, Billo and
Paul Schwenk and Jeff Rago

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.389
had all taken a break
from Paul, and had started

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:52.430
their own little company.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.970
It wasn't doing very well.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.140
They had nobody really
to sell their product.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.530
And Paul came to visit them
in their shabby little office,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.480
and he said, I'm
starting something new.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.790
This is well before
Kayak-- long before.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.620
And they said, well,
we'll think about it.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.690
And Paul left, and Bill
and Rago and Schwenk all

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.130
remember this story
exactly the same way.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.350
They said, well--
Rago and Schwenk said,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.090
we'd like to sort
of keep trying.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.860
We think this still might work.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.180
And Billo said, look, guys,
I feel bad about this.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.790
You can have all my stock,
but I'm going to go with Paul.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.180
And then he felt it was
necessary to explain.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.260
He said, because
someday, this boy

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.230
is going to get hit by
a truck full of money

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.520
and I'm going to be
standing beside him.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.290
And he was actually
when Kayak was sold.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.680
And also he was standing there
after Boston Light was sold.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.690
And Paul took his share
of the $33.5 million

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.120
and divide it in half and
distribute it to the employees.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.700
People remember
that sort of thing.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.510
But I meant the title
with some irony,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.720
because I think that the
year-- several years that I

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.231
spent with Paul-- I think
were difficult years for him.

00:08:07.231 --> 00:08:08.730
And I think it's
difficult sometimes

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.520
to recover from a great success.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.640
I suppose there was something
autobiographical about that

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.010
in my mind, because I
do remember when I wrote

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.990
"The Soul of a New Machine."

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.160
I was only 34 years old.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.330
And suddenly, I was given the
Pulitzer Prize and the National

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.150
Book Award, and I
got very confused.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.560
I drank a lot.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.900
I just found it
difficult. I was suddenly

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.883
separated from all my brethren--
all my writer friends.

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:38.159
So I was on the
lookout for this.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.900
And I think Paul
was casting around,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:46.890
looking for things to do--
the right things to do.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.960
What am I saying?

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.780
Anyway, a truck
is-- I know Billo

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.352
meant that in a very casual
way-- the truck full of money.

00:08:57.352 --> 00:08:58.810
That's just meaning
a lot of money.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.710
But I thought of
the actual truck

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.430
as something that hits you.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.040
I meant it with a bit of irony
because I don't think-- the one

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.020
thing I think-- my way of
thinking that Paul isn't, is

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.980
meretricious.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.340
He's not tremendously
materialistic,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.242
except about cars.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.480
SPEAKER 1: So winning the
Pulitzer in your early 30s--

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.836
I mean many authors wait their
whole entire lives to get

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:24.770
an opportunity.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.040
A lot don't get it.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.540
So what did it feel like to hit
such a grand accomplishment?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.620
TRACY KIDDER: It was
a little daunting.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.110
I was elated at first.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.770
I couldn't believe it.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.110
And then I did
have writer friends

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:48.090
who ceased to be
friends-- were so envious.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.310
I probably would have been
the same in their place.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.750
It was strange.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:57.840
I was pretty young--
even young for my age--

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.330
just barely out of adolescence,
possibly-- I don't know.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.840
A lot of young men are I think.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.910
One of the things
is you really want

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.710
to believe, when you
get a prize like that,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.010
that you deserved it.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.570
It's sort of like
being an American

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.903
and having quite a lot of
privilege, and thinking, well,

00:10:17.903 --> 00:10:19.450
I've earned my privileges.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.120
But in my case, I was a
judge for the Pulitzer's

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.510
later and also for the
National Book Award.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.700
And what you realize is that
usually those prizes are given

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.260
to-- you have a committee.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.450
And pretty much
everything-- the prize goes

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.769
to everybody's third choice.

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:44.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.254
But I did meet the guy who
had been-- a wonderful writer

00:10:47.254 --> 00:10:48.670
really-- who had
been my champion.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.230
At least he told me--
I forget how I met him.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.240
He was a wonderful writer
named Paul Fussell.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.961
And he said, you owe me a drink.

00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:01.460
I said why?

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.405
He said, I was your
advocate for the Pulitzer.

00:11:03.405 --> 00:11:06.929
And I said, I'll
buy you two drinks.

00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:08.845
SPEAKER 1: Well, when
you talked about winning

00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:11.320
the Pulitzer and your feeling
very humble towards it

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.590
because it's such an honor.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.590
TRACY KIDDER: I wasn't humble.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:16.806
On the contrary--

00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:18.336
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:18.336 --> 00:11:19.710
SPEAKER 1: Well,
it's interesting

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.870
because when Paul sold Kayak,
he was told by a lot of people

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:25.600
how great he was.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.440
And then Paul said to
himself, I didn't actually

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.162
work that hard, he thought.

00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:33.370
I'm just good at something
that makes a lot of money.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.330
TRACY KIDDER: Yeah.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.450
If there was one
thing Paul told me,

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.435
or one thought that I
overheard the whole time I

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.810
was with him, that's the one
I think would stick with me.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.260
If there was just going to
be one that stuck with me.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:54.310
Because it strikes me as true
and unusually honest and open.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.430
And unusual too
probably for some

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.150
of the people in
this general area

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.590
who have made great fortunes.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.540
I do think we tend to feel
in America that making

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.600
huge amounts of money is almost
an apotheosis in itself--

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.700
both evidence and just
reward for one's superiority.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.830
And I'm not necessarily
blaming the tycoons,

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.120
though some of them I
suppose do buy into it.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.780
And it's even more extreme
because this is technology.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.830
And so one gets the
feeling, these people

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.540
are masters of the
future, as well as

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.290
the present-- the vertebral
Darwins and Newtons.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.460
It gets quite excessive
like so many things.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.200
But I don't think
Paul ever bought

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.680
into that cultural grandiosity.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.534
SPEAKER 1: So what's one of your
favorite stories from the book?

00:12:52.534 --> 00:12:53.700
TRACY KIDDER: A lot of them.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.760
I like them all.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.430
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.520
TRACY KIDDER: I like the
story that the book begins

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.280
with of his going to
Boston Latin School

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.750
and learning how to-- inventing
for himself the fishing

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.632
to get the control of attendance
so that he could play hooky

00:13:13.632 --> 00:13:14.590
for the next six years.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.210
It probably has set him back a
ways in his professional life.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.070
But the one I really
like a lot, and I

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.120
think it's really
interesting, is that time

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.610
when you felt you'd
been fired, and you

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:34.515
were in a deep, deep
depression-- partly, no doubt,

00:13:34.515 --> 00:13:35.855
from bipolar.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:44.850
And he latched on to the
idea of doing something

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.645
with Chinese chess, and
ended up making this-- along

00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:49.270
with Carl Barry, just
the two of them--

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.580
making this really
for its time, quite

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.880
remarkable elaborate website.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.589
A regular xiangqi palace--
Chinese chess palace,

00:13:57.589 --> 00:13:59.880
where you could go and you
can watch other people play.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.320
And you could kibbitz.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.280
And the second most
popular board game,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.370
I guess in the world--
and I liked the fact

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.799
that what Paul--
the way I understood

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:15.340
the story-- I think
you would agree--

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.310
is that he coded his
way out of depression,

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.690
which is quite remarkable.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.250
I mean it's much better
than languishing in it.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.630
SPEAKER 1: It's true.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.230
I've noticed in
American history,

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.525
we go through generations
of wealth creation.

00:14:30.525 --> 00:14:32.400
And for the longest time
in American history,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.220
wealth was handed down from
one generation to the next.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.180
And now we're seeing
people such as Paul,

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.600
who comes from
humble beginnings,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.382
now coming into wealth.

00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:43.590
So I'm wondering-- your
humble beginnings in Boston--

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.922
how did affect your
success in tech?

00:14:46.922 --> 00:14:49.130
PAUL ENGLISH: So I grew up
in a working class family.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.520
My dad was a pipefitter.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.110
He worked for the same
company for 49 years.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.910
And my mother was
a social worker.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.810
And I grew up in
a family of nine.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.795
We had a three bedroom
house with one bathroom

00:15:01.795 --> 00:15:05.660
so it was pretty modest.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.080
Well, first of all, when I
would see people who had money,

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.980
I just thought of them as
just a foreign species.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.490
I thought moneyed people
were very different

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.536
than my family and me.

00:15:18.536 --> 00:15:21.160
I have this funny thing, to this
day, when I get on the shuttle

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.457
to New York from Boston,
where I live now,

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:26.790
and I see all these guys get
on the plane wearing suits,

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.260
I actually get uncomfortable
with people wearing suits.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.900
It's just something
bizarre about it.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.400
I don't quite understand
it-- but the whole prestige

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.070
and power, particularly
people who work in finance,

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:40.000
just feels very foreign
and uncomfortable to me.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.212
The guys I hang out most
with now in Boston--

00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:46.420
there's a group of six of us.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.840
And we've been playing poker
since we were 12-years-old.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.290
And one of them--
[INAUDIBLE] is a landscaper.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.615
Bob's a plumber.

00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:57.140
Arthur's a
manufacturing engineer.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.580
Andrew's in IT guy.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.775
Ray is a marketing guy.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.580
It's like my comfort zone--
just kind of like normal guys.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.450
And a lot of times in
tech, even though I

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:14.650
love team building and
design and customer support,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.530
the business part of tech
is something I actually

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.018
have very little interest in.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.880
SPEAKER 1: Now, the
business aspect of tech,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.840
did you partner with
Schwenk in Kayak?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.570
Did he handle those aspects and
did you mostly handle the day

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.960
to day engineering operations?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.230
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.396
So my Kayak co-founder is
a guy named Steve Haffner.

00:16:34.396 --> 00:16:36.190
Steve was one of
the founders Orbitz.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.410
And the idea for
Kayak actually came

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.720
in a conversation
between Steve Haffner

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.010
and one of our investors, Joe
Kotler at General Catalyst.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.660
And the two of them,
with Steve leaving

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.020
Orbitz, which was, what I would
describe as a travel store,

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.080
they basically came up with the
idea of creating a pure search

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.440
engine where nothing is sold,
but every product is indexed.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.926
And in 2004 when
we created Kayak,

00:16:59.926 --> 00:17:01.300
there was no one
website that had

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.310
every single flight
and every single hotel,

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.950
like Expedia for
example-- and to this day,

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.117
will only show hotels where
they make a commission.

00:17:08.117 --> 00:17:09.450
They don't show you every hotel.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.109
And so Kayak-- I think there
were two things we focused on.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.605
One is making sure we had more
inventory than anyone else.

00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:16.980
Even if people didn't pay us,
we had them on the website.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.210
We were really obsessed.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.876
And we showed their
actual phone number,

00:17:19.876 --> 00:17:22.630
their actual website address--
just complete transparency.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.780
And then the second
thing we focused on--

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.290
that I focused on at Kayak
was-- I saw other travel sites

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.150
at the time as bloatware.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.230
They were big and innovative
graphics and slow.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.080
And it was shocking to me
how it would take 45 seconds

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.860
to find a flight.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.470
So we begin this quest,
which I worked on

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:46.150
for 10 years, which was how to
do something that wasn't faster

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.210
than Expedia, but was shockingly
different because it was

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.590
so much faster than Expedia.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.160
So we were the first guys to
do subsecond search for travel

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.670
across every vertical.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.130
It was non-trivial
to build that,

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.588
because we're sitting on top
of systems that are themselves

00:17:59.588 --> 00:18:01.510
decades old.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.530
But yeah, we wanted to be full
inventory and really fast.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.760
SPEAKER 1: You mentioned when
you had your start at Boston

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.620
Light, after you
guys were acquired,

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.130
you came across a
sizable equity valuation.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.710
There were certain
people who weren't

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.880
receiving as much money.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.429
And you decided to
spread that money around.

00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:24.970
What was going through your mind
when you decided to do that?

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.160
PAUL ENGLISH:
Usually, every time I

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.000
do an M&amp;A deal, whether I'm
buying a company, to become

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.440
part of my company, or
looking at selling a company--

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:39.790
and I've sold I think
five real companies.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.720
Four were successful.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.637
One, I lost $2 million
which was very painful.

00:18:42.637 --> 00:18:45.219
It was a time in my life where
I just made money and then lost

00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:45.730
it.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.500
But when I look at
selling companies,

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.982
I actually never have done
the math, even at Kayak,

00:18:50.982 --> 00:18:52.690
about how much money
I was going to make.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.360
But I knew how much
money my assistant made.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.640
I knew how much stock
people had on my team who

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.900
didn't have very much stock.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.510
And even for a new company
Lola, we're only a year old.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.170
So it's crazy, crazy premature
to even think about exit value.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.920
Hopefully that's many
years away because I

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.710
like running companies
independently as long as I can.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.730
But when it comes time to try
to find an exit for Lola, I'm

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.000
going to try to figure out,
can my assistant buy a house?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.324
And I have a lot more
stock than she has.

00:19:21.324 --> 00:19:22.990
So if she can buy a
house, I'll probably

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.610
be able to buy a lot
of houses-- not that I

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.693
would buy a lot of houses.

00:19:25.693 --> 00:19:28.450
But it just, to me,
it seems to make sense

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.010
to think about a
company in terms

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.220
of how would a
financial outcome impact

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.930
the people who have the
least amount in the company?

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.660
So I don't know why
I think like that.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.977
But I know how many
shares my assistant has.

00:19:40.977 --> 00:19:43.560
I know how many shares my travel
agents have who work at Lola,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.010
my new company.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:50.452
And I would like to make sure
they all do well financially.

00:19:50.452 --> 00:19:51.160
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.780
I mean it's really
hard to determine

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.860
how you're going
to spread the cap

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.330
table at the beginning
of the venture

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.538
when you don't know how
things are going to play out.

00:19:57.538 --> 00:19:58.510
PAUL ENGLISH: Exactly.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.570
SPEAKER 1: Now, it seems like
your mentor, Thomas White,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.240
inspired some of your thoughts
towards charitable work

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.240
and also towards
running businesses.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.215
Can you explain his
impact on your life to us?

00:20:09.215 --> 00:20:10.006
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:20:10.006 --> 00:20:16.262
So Tom is a guy that I met back
in, I want to say about 2000.

00:20:16.262 --> 00:20:18.220
He was the uncle of a
childhood friend of mine.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.270
And I had sold a company,
Boston Light to it.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.232
I made a bunch of money.

00:20:24.232 --> 00:20:26.190
I wanted to give away
most of the money I made.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.510
So I call this guy Tom White.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.740
He was 80 years old at the time.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.220
And I asked him if
he could teach me how

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.290
to give away money efficiently.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.960
And I remember
one funny story is

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.620
I did a little bit of research
on him before I met him.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.020
And I learned that the biggest
beneficiary of his work

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.547
was his doctor, Paul
Farmer, who had created

00:20:47.547 --> 00:20:49.380
this organization called
Partners in Health,

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.160
and I serve on the board now.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.320
And when I met Tom,
I said, I understand

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.570
that Partners in Health
has raised $30 million

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.940
for Haiti to help
with health care.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.640
And he is very proud of that.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.350
And then I said, but I heard
that $20 million of that

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.671
came from you personally.

00:21:04.671 --> 00:21:06.670
You probably think that
makes you a good person.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.860
I think it makes you a
really shitty fundraiser.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.180
And then I worked
with Tom on trying

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.790
to figure out how to make
him more highly leveraged.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.110
Because he made about $100
million over his career--

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.780
was an estimate.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.420
He had told me once.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.450
And he told me that his
plan was to die penniless,

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.220
with owning no possessions.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.720
And so I kind of
have the same goal,

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.053
that I want to die with nothing.

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.600
I don't die with
nothing, but I want

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.780
to die-- I want to have a bed.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.300
I probably want to have
whatever the iPhone 56 is,

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.380
a Kindle, and a clock radio.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.130
And I think that's
pretty much all I need.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.213
TRACY KIDDER: You're sick.

00:21:41.213 --> 00:21:44.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.280
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.340
Now, can you talk about your
idea generation process?

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.590
Because it seems like you're
just constantly coming up

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.580
with new ideas and new ventures.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.371
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:21:53.371 --> 00:21:56.060
I actually teach
entrepreneurship at MIT

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.770
and I lecture on
entrepreneurship

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.799
at a pretty diverse
set of universities.

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:03.590
I lecture at Rhode
Island School of Design,

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.464
which is phenomenal
design school on the East

00:22:05.464 --> 00:22:09.050
Coast, Berklee College of
Music, Dartmouth Film School.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.650
And I really enjoy
focusing on innovation

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.179
in industries outside of
tech and trying to figure out

00:22:14.179 --> 00:22:15.470
how you encapsulate innovation.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.460
Like what are the key elements
that make something new?

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.310
And the work that I've
done across those multiple

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.930
industries has taught me,
the most important thing

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.200
to do as an innovator is to
pick the right problems to fix.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.369
And if you confront a problem
that really bothers you-- that

00:22:33.369 --> 00:22:35.410
bothers you so much that
you can imagine spending

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.570
five years of your life
working on the problem,

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.445
and it's also a problem
that bothers millions

00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:42.130
of other people, if you
find the right problem

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.930
and it's a real
problem that is causing

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.330
serious issues for people,
then all you need to do

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.930
is lock on to it, hire
an exceptional team

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.800
and just keep trying stuff.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.630
And most likely the first thing
you do won't be successful.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.597
But if you've picked
the right problem

00:22:59.597 --> 00:23:01.930
and you're committed to solving
it, eventually you will.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.250
So the advice I
give to my students

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.770
is become problem detectors
before they become solution.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.290
A lot of entrepreneurs, when
they look to raise money,

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:12.862
they pitch what they've
built. I, as an investor,

00:23:12.862 --> 00:23:14.570
am less interested in
what they've built.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.770
What I'm interested
in is the team

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.478
and what problem
they're trying to solve,

00:23:17.478 --> 00:23:21.530
because the initial solution is
usually not the final solution.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.887
Being a problem detector means,
if you're really good at it--

00:23:24.887 --> 00:23:26.720
and I think it's something
you can practice,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.790
just like you can
practice mindfulness--

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.040
being a problem
detector means you

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.370
look at all kinds
of problems in life.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.430
So I remember I gave
a lecture on this

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.620
at Dartmouth Film School.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.520
And there was a girl
sitting in the front,

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.950
and she had a Dunkin'
Donuts coffee cup.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.520
And the Dunkin' Donuts--
you flip the top back.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.647
And sometimes when you're
drinking the coffee,

00:23:48.647 --> 00:23:50.480
the thing flips up and
hits you in the nose.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.438
I don't know if anyone's
ever experienced that.

00:23:52.438 --> 00:23:54.899
And I had asked her, when
I saw that coffee cup,

00:23:54.899 --> 00:23:56.940
has that ever flipped up
and hit you in the nose?

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.898
She said, yeah, it has.

00:23:57.898 --> 00:24:00.350
And everyone kind of got a
big laugh in the audience.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.300
And I said, well, why haven't
you done anything about it?

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.091
And since then, people
invented coffee cups

00:24:04.091 --> 00:24:09.440
that you just turn-- you just
spin it and two holes line up.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.150
I think it's just,
notice a problem.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.430
If the problem really,
really bothers you,

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.680
just keep thinking up
solutions, solutions, solutions.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.221
I'll tell you an
example of something

00:24:20.221 --> 00:24:23.070
that bothered me today as we're
walking around San Francisco.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:26.380
I am bothered by noise.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.680
And I'm really bothered by car
horns and rudeness of car horns

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.470
when drivers beep overly
aggressively at people

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.590
for not necessarily
doing something bad.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.400
And so I always think
of solutions like,

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.590
how can I have less beeping?

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.060
And a couple of solutions
that a few of us

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.820
talked about this week is one,
what if you made a regulation

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.370
that there was a car horn placed
inside the passenger cabin

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.380
as well as under the hood?

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.480
Another one is, what if you
had the steering wheel give

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.330
a minor electric shock?

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.945
So you still could
beep the horn but there

00:24:56.945 --> 00:24:59.380
would be a little bit
of payback in doing it.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.630
So yeah, to me
innovation is about when

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.050
you see something that is
wrong, just obsess on it,

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.084
and say, I don't know the answer
yet but I know this is wrong

00:25:09.084 --> 00:25:11.000
and I know I'm going to
find a solution to it.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.750
SPEAKER 1: Gotcha.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.880
Instead of trying to
sell a solution-- trying

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.740
to find a problem.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.031
Find the problem and
build the solution for it.

00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:17.822
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:25:17.822 --> 00:25:19.060
SPEAKER 1: You mentioned
how important it

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.480
is to have a team around you.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.380
I've noticed
through your career,

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.046
you have these people
called 20 plussers

00:25:23.046 --> 00:25:25.650
who have been around with
you for 20 plus more years.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.880
Can you explain how
that came to happen?

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.560
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.280
I don't think it was
explicitly intentional.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.160
Back like when I cut my
Bos Light stock in half,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.330
so I could dilute everyone else
up so everyone else could get

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.370
much more of the company, I
wasn't explicitly thinking

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.110
then, I'm doing
this so these people

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.610
will be with me for 20 years.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.899
I think that was one of
the things that contributed

00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:52.690
to people following me
company to company--

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.880
is they saw that I
treated people well.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.900
But I'm just someone who values
longevity in relationships.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.510
And I don't know how much
this has to do with my family,

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.660
growing up in a small
house with nine people.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.520
But the fact that, again, I
still hang out with these guys

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.350
and we've been playing
cards since we were 12,

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.330
I just value long-term
relationships.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.310
And I think that if you
create a work environment

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:19.240
that's really fun and where
people really like each other,

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.730
and where you debug-- I
probably spend 5% of my time

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.702
as a psychologist, where
I observe body language.

00:26:24.702 --> 00:26:27.160
And I try to find things in my
company that aren't working,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.084
and where is stress.

00:26:29.084 --> 00:26:30.250
And I try to eliminate that.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.600
And I name it and then
bring people together

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.290
and say, Hugh, how come you
interrupt Cathy all the time?

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.624
Or whatever it is, I'll try to--

00:26:40.624 --> 00:26:42.789
SPEAKER 2: That's one way
to get a word in edgewise.

00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:43.628
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.628 --> 00:26:46.319
CATHY: It's the
other way around.

00:26:46.319 --> 00:26:47.110
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.110
I think if you spend
a lot of time trying

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.570
to make sure the team dynamic
is really, really strong,

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:54.970
people will love their job.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.910
They'll help recruit more
people and they'll probably

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.790
stay there for years.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.750
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.750
Can you explain-- like
you mentioned your family

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.640
growing up and there's
nine people living

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.320
in a three bedroom house.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.340
In the book, it
mentioned that your job

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.316
was to make people feel happy.

00:27:12.316 --> 00:27:14.502
Did that psychology
also influence

00:27:14.502 --> 00:27:15.502
your business practices?

00:27:18.265 --> 00:27:20.515
PAUL ENGLISH: I never thought
of it exactly like that,

00:27:20.515 --> 00:27:22.930
but no one ever
assigned me to be

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:24.190
that peacemaker in my college.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:30.170
My dad was a drinker and
we had strife in my home.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.060
I don't know why I
became the peacemaker,

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.480
but I took on that role.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.400
And when anyone in my
family was in crisis,

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.780
I'm the one that they call
to help manage situations.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.710
Like I have a brother with a
brain injury that I manage.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.000
I host a family dinner
every Tuesday night.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.440
And I organize my
business travels

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.730
so every Tuesday night
I can be home to cook.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.130
And my siblings all come over
and a 90-year-old neighbor

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:52.210
comes over.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:28:01.690
So I think-- yeah, I
think problem solving

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.880
is all about maintaining
relationships.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.630
Like in my small house I grew
up in, because it was congested,

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:13.280
if someone was drunk
or angry or fighting,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.490
it caused strife
across the whole family

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.830
that rippled across and
everyone could feel it.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.890
If instead, you could debug
that and try to figure out

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.524
how to alleviate some of
the stress in the family,

00:28:23.524 --> 00:28:25.190
it made it a happier
place for everyone.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.250
And I that's true in
the workplace as well.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.770
I've always promised people who
have come to work and for me

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:34.540
that I will make this the best
place they've ever worked.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.300
And I'll make them more
productive than they've ever

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.089
been.

00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:39.880
And I take those comments
pretty seriously.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.695
And if I promise
someone that I'll

00:28:41.695 --> 00:28:43.570
make this the best place
they've ever worked,

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.580
and yet they're sitting
next to someone who's

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.210
kind of an asshole and
cause a lot of stress,

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.010
I'm going to fail
on my commitment.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.290
So I need to debug
that and figure out

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.900
why are two people
not getting along.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.400
So I guess the
peacemaker part of me

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.450
that grew up in this family--
large family in a small house--

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.910
translated into
in the work, I try

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.530
to be a bit of a
peacemaker as well.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.320
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.200
And you also mentioned
that because there

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.670
are so many things
going on in your house,

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.310
one constant would be
being able to program.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:18.250
And that sort of gave kind
of consistency and an escape.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.044
Do you find that
the main driving

00:29:20.044 --> 00:29:22.210
passion for you to code--
or were there other things

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.079
involved that pushed
you towards computers?

00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:25.870
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.420
I always took work
pretty seriously.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.840
And part of it was work
was a way for me to have

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.940
an identity outside the house.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.000
Inside the house, it
felt very controlled,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.090
and outside the house so you
could form your own identity,

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.710
get your own job,
make your own money.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.729
And I remember, I was
making minimum wage,

00:29:44.729 --> 00:29:46.270
which back when I
was in high school,

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.030
I think was $2.65 an hour.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.780
And I worked at a drugstore
at the Dedham Mall

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.580
outside of Boston.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.910
And I remember one
time on a Friday night,

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.560
we used to go out
drinking after work.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.390
I think I was 16 at the time.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.270
And I remember always having
a pizza, a bottle of wine,

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.960
and then maybe smoking some
weed or other things like that.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.650
And I woke up one
Saturday morning really,

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.570
really, really hangover.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.740
But it wouldn't ever crossed my
mind to call in sick to work.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.980
And I think I was still so hung
over that I couldn't drive,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.540
even though I had owned a car.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.659
So I took a taxi to work.

00:30:23.659 --> 00:30:25.450
And my father was
furious when he found out

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.460
that I would spend
money on a taxi.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.550
But I got to work and
I worked that day.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.230
And to me, I was
just always proud

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:36.940
of forming your identity
outside of home and work

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.822
as a part of that.

00:30:37.822 --> 00:30:38.530
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.220
And then also you worked
while going to school

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.960
at the same time,
taking night classes.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.751
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:30:42.751 --> 00:30:44.140
I worked full-time in college.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.810
I actually didn't
apply to college.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.767
I wanted to be a musician.

00:30:48.767 --> 00:30:50.350
And I went to a very
good high school,

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.391
one of the best schools
in the country-- in fact,

00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:55.180
Boston Latin, founded in 1635.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.727
And I tested at
the top of the city

00:30:56.727 --> 00:30:58.560
for getting into that
school but I graduated

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.120
at the bottom of a class.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.180
30 of my classmates got
accepted to Harvard,

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.180
so it's a really
good high school.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.800
And I didn't apply to college.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.540
I was just going
to be a musician.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.130
And then my parents
found out I could

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.790
go to a state school for
free because I aced my SATs.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.160
I test well.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.550
And the only state school I
could get into at that point

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.170
was UMass Boston.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.750
And lucky for me, they
had an amazing jazz band.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.140
So I wrote for a 15-piece
band and then worked full-time

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.567
as a programmer and
went to school at night.

00:31:25.567 --> 00:31:27.650
It took me five years to
get my bachelor's degree,

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.680
but then I stayed on two more
years to get my Masters degree

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.965
and I ended up teaching there.

00:31:30.965 --> 00:31:31.840
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.611
Now, going to night classes,
you see a different crowd

00:31:34.611 --> 00:31:35.110
of people.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.470
So you're probably with
more adults, and veterans.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.939
Did that influence you too?

00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:39.730
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:44.620
I remember taking a class and we
were studying the Vietnam War.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.840
And the guy on my
right was a vet

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.506
in a wheelchair,
injured from the war.

00:31:52.506 --> 00:31:54.130
And then the guy
sitting in front of me

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.810
had lost his son in the war.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.950
They were debating
the morality of war.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.480
And I remember thinking like
my friends going to Harvard

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.971
are not having this experience
that I'm having right now.

00:32:02.971 --> 00:32:05.470
So there were certain advantages
of being in a poor commuter

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.470
school, that you
got to experience

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.990
different cross-sections
of the city

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.560
that you might otherwise not, if
I just stayed-- if I went down

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.060
like an Ivy League path.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.960
It's kind of like last year,
I drove Uber for a while.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.450
And I really loved
that because--

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:23.830
SPEAKER 1: In your Audi, right?

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.460
PAUL ENGLISH: In
my Tesla, actually.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:25.990
SPEAKER 1: Oh your Tesla.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.782
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:32:26.782 --> 00:32:28.531
SPEAKER 1: And that
was an UberX ride too?

00:32:28.531 --> 00:32:29.500
That's quite a deal.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.310
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.900
And I really enjoyed it.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.060
I did it for research
for my company--

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.120
for my new company,
Lola-- as something

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.430
that I wanted to learn
about around ratings.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:44.740
But I was also surprised to
learn that my world is actually

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.720
quite narrow.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.060
In Boston, generally
the only people

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.139
that have communication
with are my family,

00:32:52.139 --> 00:32:53.680
people who work in
tech or people who

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.138
work in Haiti,
because that's where

00:32:55.138 --> 00:32:57.317
I spend most of my time--
in those three areas.

00:32:57.317 --> 00:32:58.900
And driving Uber
around, I got to meet

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.180
all kinds of crazy people
who lived in Boston.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.190
And it reminded me
of my college days,

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.394
where it just was a very,
very diverse set of people.

00:33:06.394 --> 00:33:07.060
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.143
And you learn more about
yourself in that process,

00:33:09.143 --> 00:33:09.790
don't you?

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:10.520
PAUL ENGLISH: I think so, yeah.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.170
Yeah.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.390
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, one
of my best experiences

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.024
going through was
community college,

00:33:15.024 --> 00:33:16.940
and I worked while going
to community college.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.580
And I just met so
many different people

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.640
at different walks of life
and it definitely impacted me.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.410
Now, growing up in your
economic situation,

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.690
and then all of a
sudden selling Kayak--

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.200
and now you have $120 million.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.109
What was going
through your mind?

00:33:33.109 --> 00:33:33.900
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.650
Again, when we sold
the company, first, we

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.510
took it public in July 2012.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.170
And then we sold it
to Priceline in 2013.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.605
I didn't do the math
first to figure out

00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:44.530
how much money I made.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.062
But I remember how much
money my assistant made.

00:33:47.062 --> 00:33:49.270
And then when I did figure
out how much money I made,

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.770
it just felt surreal.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.650
And it felt that I
didn't deserve the money

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.720
and I didn't deserve
to keep the money.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.880
So I thought that the
money was something

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.220
that would temporarily
replace in my bank account,

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.990
but then I needed to find
things to do with the money.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.210
Because money sitting in a bank
account is kind of useless.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.410
That's not the point of money.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.326
The point of money is
to conduct transactions.

00:34:07.326 --> 00:34:10.900
And sitting in a bank account,
you're failing its objective.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:16.150
So my goal is to invest
that money in nonprofits,

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.840
and try to find ones that
are meaningful to things

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.949
that I care about.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.350
And hopefully I
will liquidate all

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.090
my Kayak money
for the nonprofits

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.409
I'm working with now.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.070
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.860
And once you did that--
the IPO event-- sorry,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.530
once you did sell
the company, were you

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.870
getting like thousands
of requests of your time,

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:35.889
for donations?

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:36.680
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.960
I still do.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.510
It's very painful.

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:45.489
I probably get 200
to 300 e-mails a day,

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:49.830
and I probably get a dozen
personal requests for help.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.560
I had a woman today ask me
if I'd pay her mortgage.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.679
And I get a dozen nonprofits
a day, soliciting me.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:57.820
And it's painful to say no.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.100
But the reality is I just
don't have the bandwidth

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.832
to engage with that many
dozens of people every day.

00:35:02.832 --> 00:35:03.540
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.860
And it's heart
breaking too, isn't it?

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.651
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:35:05.651 --> 00:35:06.940
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.100
So can you talk to us about
your background with Haiti

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.770
and how you got
involved in there?

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:12.561
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:14.840
Haiti has become a
big part of my life.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.320
I first went to Haiti in
2003 but I've been many times

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:18.820
since then.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.827
I was in Haiti a week ago.

00:35:21.827 --> 00:35:23.410
I look at-- some
people describe Haiti

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:25.060
as the poorest country in
the Western hemisphere.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.740
I don't think of it
like that at all.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.500
I think of it as the country
with the most opportunity,

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.800
because my work is all
outside of Port Au Prince.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.930
Port Au Prince is complete
insanity-- the capital.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.159
And it's confusing and
I'm intimidated by it

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:42.700
because there's so much stuff--
crazy stuff-- going on there.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.730
But when you go into the central
plateau or down south or up

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.540
north, there are very
simple communities

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.330
with very little technology.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.450
Even like the
farming instruments

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.950
are in many cases,
100 years old.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.730
It's not even modern
farming technology.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.900
So being someone who
has resources and has

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.900
a network of people that
know about health care,

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.990
et cetera, et cetera, it's
been really fun for me

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:13.830
to work in Haiti because I get
extremely high ROI for money.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.590
Like in Boston, I support a
number of projects in Boston,

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.980
and I know what $10,000 will
do for a non-profit in Boston.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.631
But I also know
what $10,000 will

00:36:22.631 --> 00:36:24.880
do for a nonprofit in Haiti
and it's transformational.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.866
For $10,000, you can put
water in a village, where

00:36:27.866 --> 00:36:29.740
people previously had
to walk hours and hours

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.074
to get clean water.

00:36:31.074 --> 00:36:32.740
In many cases, they
would send the kids.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.823
The kids wouldn't actually
go to the clean source.

00:36:34.823 --> 00:36:37.720
They'd go for a river
that's contaminated.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.520
And you can
transform health care

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.250
of a community of 1,000
people for just $10,000.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.780
So it's kind of exciting.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.240
My latest project
is in education.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.480
And my project is
called Summits.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.490
The website is summits.org.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:56.230
And we run a network of 41
schools in the central plateau.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.390
We have 350 teachers
and administrators

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.250
and we have 10,000 students.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:04.660
And it's really exciting
to begin a project

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.420
where we took over these
schools which have been failing.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.480
We have 10,000 students.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.480
And if we can change the
lives of these students

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.660
and how they learn and change
lives of these teachers,

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.570
it's going to have massive
rippling positive effects

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.487
for that region and
hopefully for the country.

00:37:18.487 --> 00:37:20.570
SPEAKER 1: Can you explain
the teaching techniques

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.120
you guys use in the classroom?

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.436
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:37:23.436 --> 00:37:25.060
So I don't have an
education background

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.260
but I've been learning
quite a bit about it

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.650
since I've been on this
project for the last two years.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:32.830
I'll describe a scene
in the classroom--

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.730
when I was in the
classrooms in May,

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.520
I visited two different schools.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.520
And then I was visiting
three other schools last week

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.780
in Haiti.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:45.970
And in Mau, the way schools
operate in many developing

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.080
countries, the teacher is
at the front of the class,

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.160
the students all sit-in rows.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.166
They may or may not have books.

00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:54.790
And it's almost like
a call and repeat,

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.470
where the teacher will call
out a lesson and they'll write

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.761
on the chalkboard, and the
students just have to repeat

00:37:58.761 --> 00:38:01.240
what the teacher said, in
some cases not complete;y

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.190
understanding what
the teacher is saying.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:06.550
Particularly in Haiti--
this is a bit of a tangent--

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.330
but the way French is taught.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.540
The native language is Creole.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.290
Sometimes French is
taught because it's

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.620
the language of government,
but the teachers themselves

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.550
don't actually speak French
in these rural areas.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:18.008
So it's kind of
ridiculous watching

00:38:18.008 --> 00:38:19.540
them try to teach
French and they're

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.560
conjugating incorrectly, and
their pronunciation is bad.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.522
And there's no books in French.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.370
The call and repeat
thing just was not

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.220
a very good environment.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.950
We worked with three
different groups

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.200
that we researched for a year.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.120
We picked three groups to help
us completely change pedagogy

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.680
and content as well.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.840
And then when I was in
the classroom last week,

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.580
the kids are all
sitting in circles now,

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.850
in all of the classrooms
in all of our 41 schools.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.290
And the teachers
have been trained

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:53.500
that the best thing
they can do for teaching

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.750
is to get the students
talking to each other.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.966
And so the teachers
now will lecture,

00:38:58.966 --> 00:39:01.340
but then they ask the kids,
what do you think about that?

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.330
What do you think about that?

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.450
And they have the kids
interviewing each other

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:05.580
in the class.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.750
And it was completely
transformational,

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.829
like from May to last
week to see that change.

00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:13.120
And it was a result of a
teacher training program, that

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.120
took us a year to put in
place, but we executed on it

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:16.780
this summer.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.920
It was pretty exciting.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.795
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:39:18.795 --> 00:39:21.010
I mean, you're developing
a group of free thinkers

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.960
who are given the power
to actually talk, be

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.300
able to have the ability to
take part in their education

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.800
and not feel like
they're just going

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.950
to be just memorizing the same
facts over and over again.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:37.090
Now, you talked about
meditation and Buddhism.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.270
Have you guys practiced any
mindfulness in those classrooms

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.549
or experimented with anything?

00:39:41.549 --> 00:39:42.840
PAUL ENGLISH: It's interesting.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:48.370
One of the teachers who works
in the south area of Haiti

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:50.050
called Fond Blanc.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.390
He's a physician and a teacher.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.735
And he meditates.

00:39:53.735 --> 00:39:58.900
In fact, the first time I
meditated with this guy,

00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.920
it was very funny.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.247
Dr. Pierre-- we were talking
one night about mindfulness.

00:40:04.247 --> 00:40:06.580
And he said, would you like
to meditate with me tomorrow

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.080
morning?

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.205
And I said, I'd love to.

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.580
And he said, do
you want to start

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.500
at five o'clock or six o'clock?

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.640
And I said, six o'clock.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.848
And he said, do you want to
do one hour of meditation

00:40:14.848 --> 00:40:15.600
or two hours?

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.410
One hour.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.270
This guy was hard core.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.600
And there are people
in Haiti, as there

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.850
are in every country in
the world, who meditate.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.100
And we're trying to figure
out how to bring meditation

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.132
into the schools.

00:40:29.132 --> 00:40:31.090
There have been a couple
of little experiments,

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.330
but I'd like to bring it
formally into the school.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.260
Realistically, I
think that's probably

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.055
January or next
September, because we

00:40:38.055 --> 00:40:40.180
have a number of change
that we're doing this fall.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.050
SPEAKER 1: Gotcha.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.020
And do you have a regular
meditation practice yourself?

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.690
PAUL ENGLISH: I do
very simple meditation.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.440
I meditate usually just for 15
minutes, sometimes 30 minutes,

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.430
in the morning.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:56.330
More than meditation, I
do mindfulness exercises--

00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:00.220
I think are almost as good as
meditation-- just making sure

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.560
that you're always
extremely present

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.660
and noticing people around
you and objects around you,

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.370
and not getting
lost in your head,

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.842
and trying to-- let me see.

00:41:11.842 --> 00:41:13.550
One of my favorite
stories of mindfulness

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.924
is a Vietnamese
Buddhist I really

00:41:14.924 --> 00:41:16.665
like named Thich Nhat Hahn.

00:41:16.665 --> 00:41:19.140
In one of his books,
he told the story

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.100
where he had an American
Buddhist visiting him,

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.610
and Thich Nhat Hahn
had made him a dinner.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.700
And after dinner, the
American took the dishes

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.560
to go to wash them,
and Thich Nhat Hahn

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.950
said to the American,
no, no, no, no.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.030
Don't wash the dishes.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.410
And he said, no, you've
made me this great meal.

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.740
I want to wash the dishes.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.114
And Thich Nhat
Hahn said, but you

00:41:38.114 --> 00:41:39.580
don't know how to wash dishes.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.930
He said, of course I
know how to wash dishes.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:41.620
I'm a bachelor.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.050
I wash dishes in my
apartment all the time.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.990
And Thich Nhat Hahn said, well,
why do you wash the dishes?

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:48.410
And the American,
in the presence

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.590
of this great Buddhist, tried
to think of some clever answer,

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:54.560
and said, well, we wash
the dishes to prepare,

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.800
to cleanse the plates, so that
another delicious meal can

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.830
be delivered tomorrow
in these same dishes

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:03.699
and Thich Nhat Hahn said, no,
you wash dishes to wash dishes.

00:42:03.699 --> 00:42:05.740
And what he means is while
you're washing dishes,

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.660
you're supposed to
focus on just the flow

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.330
of the water and the suds.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:16.160
And there are exercises like
that I've done now for maybe 10

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.080
or 15 years-- that
I try to focus

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.619
on pushing all of the
thought away another

00:42:20.619 --> 00:42:22.160
than the thought of
the task at hand.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.690
And those exercises
have helped me a lot,

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.360
particularly with
anger management.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.930
I'm someone who had a lot
of anger management issues

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.560
when I was in my 20s.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.494
And now, it's rare
that I get angry.

00:42:33.494 --> 00:42:34.160
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.720
I noticed in the
book, you mentioned

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.760
that when you see brake
lights, you look at them

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.199
as the face of the Buddha.

00:42:39.199 --> 00:42:39.990
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.550
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.925
PAUL ENGLISH:
That's another one.

00:42:41.925 --> 00:42:44.120
I also learned that one
from Thich Nhat Hahn.

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.350
I remember I was driving an
ex-girlfriend to the airport

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:52.510
in Boston-- Daria Logan--
there was crazy, crazy traffic.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.620
And traffic doesn't impact me.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.120
And she was shocked
that I wasn't

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.080
upset at all at the traffic.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.255
And I remember telling her that
this other thing that I read

00:43:03.255 --> 00:43:05.830
about Thich Nhat Hahn is when
you see that tail lights come

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.200
on in front of
you, it reminds you

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.950
of the smiling eyes of Buddha.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:11.900
And you have the
incredible privilege

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.030
at that moment to breathe.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:17.830
So there are things that
are stressful in our life

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.330
that we can turn into joy.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.560
And it's just a decision.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.100
I think getting angry at
someone is bringing cancer

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:25.850
upon yourself.

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:29.240
It's kind of like, imagine if
someone cut you off in traffic.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.400
Would you, as a result
of that, hit yourself

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.483
in the head with a hammer?

00:43:32.483 --> 00:43:33.700
No, because that would hurt.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.000
But why get mad at them?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.041
Because when you get mad
at them and yell at them

00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:40.160
and swear at them, that's also
bringing damage to your body.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.120
It's internal damage.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.620
And so if you just
make that choice,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:47.870
that if you recognize that
anger brings violence internal--

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.830
there's a Buddhist
saying that anger

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.970
is like drinking
poison and expecting

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.094
the other person to die.

00:43:54.094 --> 00:43:54.760
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.140
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.960
SPEAKER 1: And you have
a quote from Brenda

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.870
that used to say that.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:00.620
She would say, anger
is an incredible gift

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.970
that someone is giving you.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.678
It gives you an
opportunity to figure out

00:44:03.678 --> 00:44:04.730
something about yourself.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.930
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:05.763
I think that's true.

00:44:05.763 --> 00:44:07.780
SPEAKER 1: That's
a great reflection.

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.930
Going back to startups-- so
you started Blade and then

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:15.800
from there, you decided to
create a company called Lola.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.059
Can you talk about Lola?

00:44:17.059 --> 00:44:17.850
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:22.330
So with Kayak, I spent 10
years of my life trying

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.740
to revolutionize online travel.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.590
And with Lola, I'm
just what year one in,

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.110
but I'm guessing might
be another 10 year

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:33.890
project of trying to
revolutionize offline travel.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.970
So offline travel means travel
booked actually on the phone,

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.470
like in a phone call.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.720
And surprisingly to
most people in tech,

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.510
46% of travel booked
in the United States

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:44.870
is booked over the phone.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:48.050
You get people call Marriott, or
Delta, or an old school travel

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.180
agent, or a corporate
travel agent,

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.070
a cruise specialists,
safari specialist--

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.140
there are many different
types of agents.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:59.340
And that industry has had no
tech innovation in decades.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.762
And so what Lola
is trying to do is

00:45:01.762 --> 00:45:03.970
we believe that if you throw
out all the travel agent

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:07.760
software, which is a substantial
amount of technology,

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.370
and you rewrite it from scratch
and give travel agents tools

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:13.580
that they have never had before,
those tools can provide a user

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:18.640
experience that is impossible
to get through any other method.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.137
And so what we've found
is that uses sometimes

00:45:21.137 --> 00:45:22.220
want to talk on the phone.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.511
Sometimes they want to message.

00:45:23.511 --> 00:45:25.530
Sometimes they want to email.

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.354
And we have a mobile app that
allows you-- and will soon

00:45:28.354 --> 00:45:30.020
allow you-- to do
more things like that.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.780
So it's a multimodal app that
allows you to communicate

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.410
with Lola any way you want.

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.510
And there's a human travel
agent on the other end

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.801
that is doing all the research
and planning and booking

00:45:38.801 --> 00:45:40.070
for you.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.600
SPEAKER 1: And are
the travel agents

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.690
located in the United States?

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:43.481
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:45:43.481 --> 00:45:46.240
So the first 20 are located in
Boston next to the engineers

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.950
because I want them
to feel the pain.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.860
I want the engineers to feel
the pain when things don't work

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.690
well for the travel agents.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.060
The ultimate plan is to
let anyone in the world

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.161
apply to be a
travel agent on Lola

00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:01.410
and have them go through
some extensive exams-- online

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.330
exams-- and video.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.150
We just got video exam.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.420
And then once we
verify their expertise,

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.085
we can plug them
into the platform.

00:46:08.085 --> 00:46:09.300
SPEAKER 1: Oh, nice.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.915
So they're kind of like their
own independent contractors

00:46:10.915 --> 00:46:11.498
working there?

00:46:11.498 --> 00:46:12.248
PAUL ENGLISH: Yes.

00:46:12.248 --> 00:46:13.122
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:46:13.122 --> 00:46:14.620
Because you
mentioned with Kayak,

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.729
you had like a red phone that
people could call directly.

00:46:17.729 --> 00:46:18.520
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.300
It was funny but I saw
something earlier today

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.390
that when I left Kayak the guy
who I promoted to take my job

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.210
is an extraordinary
CTO-- I think

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:29.169
he must have had a
list of 10 things

00:46:29.169 --> 00:46:30.960
to change about the
company the day I left.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.080
And one of them was he
unplugged the red phone.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.010
The red phone-- I literally
had the phone number--

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.160
if you clicked the
help button on Kayak,

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.982
the help screen comes up
with a bunch of options.

00:46:41.982 --> 00:46:43.440
And for 10 years
while I was there,

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.490
there was a phone
number as well.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.830
And that phone number rang
the red phone on my desk.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.830
And I bought a phone that
was particularly loud.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.100
It had a mechanical ringer.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.280
And I bought the
phone thinking it's

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.220
going to really annoy the
engineers, which was my intent.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.300
And the engineers would say,
that's really effin loud.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.680
That's really distracting.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.320
And I would just say, there's
a very simple solution.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.690
This is a two-part phone.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.190
If you lift up this top
part, the ringing stops.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.880
And then if you put that top
part to your head, and you say,

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.780
hello?

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.980
There'll be someone
on the other end that

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.420
will teach you something
about your product

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.380
that you don't know.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.088
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:47:20.088 --> 00:47:22.410
PAUL ENGLISH: So to me,
phone calls and customers--

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:25.440
I feel like companies should be
paying customers to call them.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.750
Because it's funny that
marketing organizations have

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:34.590
primary research budgets,
and yet people put these IBRs

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.300
and frequently asked questions
and all these systems

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.390
between customers
and the engineers.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:41.556
Where I think that if you
let the engineers actually

00:47:41.556 --> 00:47:43.740
talk to customers, you
can accelerate learning.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.536
SPEAKER 1: You
mentioned in the book,

00:47:45.536 --> 00:47:46.660
it says that you tried to--

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.280
TRACY KIDDER: He did mention.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:47.400
He did--

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.441
SPEAKER 1: Mention, yeah.

00:47:48.441 --> 00:47:50.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.320
You tried to buy a lighthouse.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.120
Can you explain that story?

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:54.930
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:58.595
Actually, why don't you
describe that story.

00:47:58.595 --> 00:47:59.604
Yeah.

00:47:59.604 --> 00:48:01.770
Because I was sort of manic
at the time, and I think

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.145
Tracy was sane at the time.

00:48:04.145 --> 00:48:05.270
TRACY KIDDER: More or less.

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:06.910
More or less.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:12.410
Well, as I recall,
there was a notice

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:15.360
of a lighthouse up for auction.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.600
It was the most seaward
lighthouse in Boston Harbor.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.720
That is right out in the
ocean on a pile of rocks

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.550
called Grave's Ledges.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:27.210
Paul loves parties
and he wanted to make

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.150
a new kind of party place.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:31.250
I saw the e-mails.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:34.242
Anyway, the description
of the lighthouse

00:48:34.242 --> 00:48:35.700
wasn't all that
encouraging though,

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:40.020
because it had no
plumbing, no electricity.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.780
And to get to it,
which was really

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.330
unsafe to do in calm weather,
but to get to it-- to get

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:49.890
into the lighthouse, you had to
climb on a ladder 30 feet long.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.410
And I was kind of
interested to imagine

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:53.800
the people in
their party clothes

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.410
looking down at
these crashing waves.

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:03.330
The next day, Paul awoke and
thought, what have I done?

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:06.000
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever done.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:12.480
But I guess hypermania is not
entirely unusual in Boston

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.102
because someone bid
more for the lighthouse

00:49:15.102 --> 00:49:16.537
and got him off the hook.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.250
Most of Paul's fits of hypomania
were as harmless as that.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:30.690
When I mentioned that story to
Brenda, your significant other,

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:34.212
she just laughed for about
five minutes and she said,

00:49:34.212 --> 00:49:35.580
it's nothing.

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.780
What harm did that do?

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.615
Something good would
have come out of it.

00:49:40.615 --> 00:49:42.780
I don't know.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:48.330
I must say, hypomania is a
fascinating phenomenon to me.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:50.850
I did some research on it
and I spoke to a great expert

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.570
on it-- and a
clinician researcher,

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:58.920
and I said, somehow I
can't quite explain it.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:03.720
I kind of know when this guy is
about ti-- when this thing is

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.910
beginning to take over.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.695
And he said, well,
that's perceptive of you.

00:50:08.695 --> 00:50:10.320
I don't think I know
any clinicians who

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.920
deal with people who are subject
to hypomania, who wouldn't

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.440
tell you that it's contagious.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.150
They would say it
was contagious,

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.990
in the sense that you feel it.

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:22.980
I think of a guitar
string being plucked

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:27.200
and the other instruments
sounding board, vibrating.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.060
A sense for me of things
coming just a little too fast--

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.200
and the story I've
told which it seems

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.930
innocuous, but these
winter days-- I

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:39.592
remember these winter days
where Paul was off at a meeting.

00:50:39.592 --> 00:50:41.050
He had about 10
meetings every day.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:46.920
But get to a restaurant,
get our coats hung up,

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.890
everything's going OK.

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:51.270
And Paul says something and
I want to write it down,

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:55.730
and I write this down,
because I like to take notes.

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.320
And I look up and
suddenly somehow he's

00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.312
in his winter coat.

00:50:59.312 --> 00:51:01.020
And he's standing
there and he's smiling.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:05.210
And he's saying very
pleasantly, ready to go?

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:08.125
It's just the way I think of it.

00:51:10.249 --> 00:51:11.040
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.330
The hypomanic stuff
I think has been

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.880
a contributor to my success.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.280
Bipolar has the
downs and the ups.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:23.210
And the downs for me were near
crippling when I was in my 20s.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.400
I would spend a lot
of time housebound

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.490
and on the floor of my bedroom.

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:30.470
I couldn't even sleep on a bed.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.800
It's hard to explain
why that was the case.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.800
And luckily at some
point, I discovered

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.220
a med that works really
well for me for the downs.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.780
I used to have
panic attacks a lot.

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.990
But I haven't experienced
any of the real downs

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:47.650
or panic attacks for
more than 10 years now.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:50.240
But on the ups, the
tricky thing about it

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.510
is the meds that
I will get to work

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.720
for me, after about
a year on a new med,

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.290
my visualization of what happens
is the brain finally figures

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:03.970
out how to work its way around
the med and rewires itself.

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:05.140
And the med no longer works.

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.220
Then you begin this cross.

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.719
But the problem is when you go
through a manic phases, which

00:52:08.719 --> 00:52:12.340
for me, last weeks at a
time, sometimes months,

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.390
it feels really, really good.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.030
It feels very electrifying.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.430
Like I can feel it in
my arms all the time.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:27.610
And the problem with being manic
or hypomanic is left untreated,

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.550
you can do really stupid things.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:32.350
And you're filled with
grandiosity and your mind

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:33.970
races.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:37.760
People become really slow
and I have this perception

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.700
when I'm manic, that other
people just can't understand me

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.800
and they can't keep
up with me, which

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.550
I know is just the grandiosity
speaking when I'm saying--

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:49.870
and I pursue with vigor lots
of crazy different ideas

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:52.640
all the time.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.180
And there's other downsides
of being manic as well.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.830
I write large checks.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:05.720
I hook up with people I
shouldn't be hooking up with.

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.300
There's a lot of things I do
when I'm totally manic that I

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.180
then end up later regretting.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.130
But I think overall,
it's been really

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.590
useful as an entrepreneur to
have these weeks at a time

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:19.300
if not months of
this crazy energy.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.680
SPEAKER 1: Do you have
like totems or things

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.470
you use to like
remind yourself, like

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:25.550
if you're caught in
this manic state,

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:28.032
like oh, I'm being
manic right now?

00:53:28.032 --> 00:53:29.740
Maybe I need to take
a couple steps back.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.640
Or is it--

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.431
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:53:31.431 --> 00:53:35.570
A lot of it, I notice, for
some reason when I'm driving,

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:39.530
I'm very-- I notice
very strongly lighting.

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:41.930
I've always been
interested in lighting.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:44.410
And I'll notice the
sides of buildings.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:46.972
Lets say I'm driving
by a brick building.

00:53:46.972 --> 00:53:49.430
I can almost tell what time it
is by the color of the brick

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:50.990
because the quality
of the sunlight

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:52.700
changes during the day.

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:57.100
And when I'm manic, the
brick sort of lights up

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.530
and it turns a different color.

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:05.320
And I just become really, really
perceptive of things around me.

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:07.050
And if there are
people in my car,

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.740
the people become
invisible and I just

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.830
focus on the grass
or different things

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.660
around me start
becoming electrifying.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.570
And I don't know.

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:16.345
Have you have been
in a car accident?

00:54:16.345 --> 00:54:16.970
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.320
PAUL ENGLISH: You
know like a moment

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.570
where there's a collision, your
body jacks with adrenaline.

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:21.278
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:54:21.278 --> 00:54:24.634
PAUL ENGLISH: So when I'm high,
that last for days at a time.

00:54:24.634 --> 00:54:26.550
And the first time it
started happening to me,

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:28.050
I was in my 20s.

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:29.870
It is a very
uncomfortable feeling.

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:31.090
It feels like something's
wrong with you

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:32.464
and you should go
to the hospital

00:54:32.464 --> 00:54:35.570
because you're completely
jacked with adrenaline,

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.390
and there's no way to stop it.

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.530
But later, when you
learn to manage it,

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.350
it's kind of a fun thing.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:44.200
I do know when these
incidents happen,

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.420
and I start with this-- I
call on fire-- many times

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.280
when I wake up first
thing in the morning,

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:53.380
I do know that I should
check with my psychiatrist,

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.390
and just say, if
I've been going days

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:57.284
at a time with very,
very little sleep,

00:54:57.284 --> 00:54:58.700
I should probably
have a med check

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.830
and see if I need to do
something different just

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.450
to keep me from
going a little bit

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:04.840
too far where I
disconnect from reality,

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:08.350
I disconnect from people, and I
make really rash decisions that

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:09.554
are sometimes bad decisions.

00:55:09.554 --> 00:55:10.220
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:11.590
And it seems as
time has gone on,

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.215
you've been able to
channel that energy

00:55:13.215 --> 00:55:14.510
towards more constructive aims.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:15.160
PAUL ENGLISH: Hopefully.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:15.990
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.965
PAUL ENGLISH: Yeah.

00:55:16.965 --> 00:55:19.090
SPEAKER 1: Well, thank you
guys very much for this.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:21.470
I'm going to turn this
section to audience questions.

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.420
So if anyone has
audience questions,

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.905
feel free to come up to the mic.

00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:26.280
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious in response

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.410
to that, have you ever
come across in your career,

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:32.260
the works of EF Schumacher--
Buddhist economic, small

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.010
is beautiful.

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:34.510
PAUL ENGLISH: I have.

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:36.176
AUDIENCE: Maybe you
can say a little bit

00:55:36.176 --> 00:55:38.890
about how his thoughts
reflect on your career.

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:41.460
And also, I'm curious
what do you teach or talk

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.460
about when you teach at
the Berklee School being

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.490
a musician?

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:47.620
PAUL ENGLISH: So I guest
lecture there are an innovation

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.120
and creativity.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.120
I used to be a musician.

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.340
I'm not musician anymore.

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:55.310
But I know enough
about music that I

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:56.570
can speak to music students.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.360
And we talk about that business.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.140
Musicians are
actually entrepreneurs

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.440
because every business
every musician

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.470
has to create their living,
and most musicians I would say

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:06.760
are entrepreneurs.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.700
It's all talk about
entrepreneur skills you need,

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.070
even if you're quote
unquote just a musician.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:15.700
Entrepreneur work is
not just for engineers.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.220
It's for anyone who's a
sole practitioner trying

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.759
to create a business.

00:56:19.759 --> 00:56:21.800
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so
much for joining us here.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.690
TRACY KIDDER: You're welcome.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:24.648
SPEAKER 1: Let's give
them a round of applause.

00:56:24.648 --> 00:56:27.840
[APPLAUSE]
