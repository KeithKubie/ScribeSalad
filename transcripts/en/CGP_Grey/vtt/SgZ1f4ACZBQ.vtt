00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
Who owns the Statue of Liberty?  New York or New Jersey?

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.980
It should be straight forward, but the island upon which the statue stands, Liberty Island…

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.460
…  has been part of a long fight between the states over their river border…

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.000
… and the islands between them, …

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.460
… with rounds in the 90s, the 80s, the 30s (the 1830s) and possibly more beyond 2000.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.220
But to understand we must first go back to the 1600s.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.160
New Netherland was minding her own business, when England using bigger-navy diplomacy made the Dutch colony hers.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.000
Here the trouble begins, for England split New Netherland in twain, but not cleanly.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.040
The mess wasn't entirely England's fault.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.200
She was far away and maps in the 1600s, while they weren't bad, they weren't good either.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.900
Thus, the charter splitting New Netherlands reads [*clears throat*]: …

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.160
"THIS INDENTURE made the four and twentieth day of June, in the sixteenth year of... [*mumbles*] ...

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.680
...Whereas... by Letters under Patents of the Great Seal of England, bearing date on or about the twelfth day of...

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.000
... [duhduhduhduhduh... OK, OK], did... give and grant...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.620
… all that tract of land... belonging to the westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island…

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.260
… and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river...

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.120
… which said tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name... of...

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.200
… New Caeserea? Or New Jersey.”

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.700
You pick.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.660
Ugh, hoo-boy is this not an easy read.  Paragraph breaks, England, you should try them.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.020
This charter has uncertainty about the names of everything, wrong latitude and longitude numbers, and incomplete descriptions of the rivers.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.800
It's all a vague mess.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.440
For example, is this part of the Hudson river, or not? The charter doesn’t say.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.360
And "bounded on the east" but where?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.700
And there's another part about "several other islands" but, which islands exactly?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.080
Like, say Ellis Island and Liberty Island?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.960
England said, whatever, your problem now and left the young colonies to three hundred years of squabbling.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.820
New Jersey said the Hudson flowed out to sea, and her border ran down the middle of the river,…

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.400
… like it does in every other colonial charter, and thus the islands Staten, Ellis, and Liberty were hers.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.740
But New York, the Empire State, disagreed.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.340
The Hudson river? Flows roundward then onward.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.860
These islands?  New York.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.600
And also the river, the whole river, and the piers you've built into the river.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.680
All New York. All belong to us.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.920
New Jersey didn't agree, but when borders are vague, bigger stick diplomacy rules.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.400
And with the wealthy and powerful city of New Amster-- er... New York at the heart of the conflict, …

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.520
… New York got what New York wanted.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.820
When New Caeser-- er... New Jersey asked: "Why don't we split the river?"

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.940
New York asked: "Why don't you make me?"

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.720
And also: "Where are my taxes from those piers?"

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.900
And also: “This island is a small pox quarantine now."

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.200
And also: "Stop hitting yourself."

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.700
By 1832, New Jersey had enough and called in the teacher, er... Supreme Court.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.680
New York didn't show up -- saying the court had no authority to settle a disagreement between the states.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.180
Which sounds crazy now but was kind of an unsettled question at the time.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.200
Because America was having power struggles with unruly states then…

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.240
… and New York blowing off the Supreme Court wasn't helping.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.600
Worse: if the Supreme Court ruled New York must share her borders (which seemed likely) …

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.140
… New York would comply... whoops, NO, New York was going to tell the court to get bent.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.960
America, trying to grow up to be a powerful federal goverment, did not want this.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.900
So the Supreme Court decided to not take the case right now, maybe later …

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.780
… and then America used some political leverage to get New York to agree to settle the matter privately with New Jersey.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.340
So the two states haggled:

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.580
New Jersey gave up her claims to Staten Island and in return…

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.060
… New York agreed New Jersey's northern border extended into the river and down the middle…

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.160
… past Ellis Island, past Liberty Island...

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.200
... squeezing around Staten Island before going back out to sea.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.820
Ah hah!  So the Statue of Liberty is in New Jersey!

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.960
No, New Jersey also gave up Ellis Island and Liberty Island too.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.020
Which seems like giving up a lot, but look, river access in the age of steam boats was a big deal.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.420
And sacrificing a couple islands to get her piers back was worth it.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.240
And America was happy because a power struggle between her and the states was averted.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.100
And everything was going to be smooth sailing…

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.340
Ohhhhhh.......

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.660
Uh, anyway, both islands are New York enclaves inside New Jersey's border.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.100
Which does make answering the question "Where is the Statue of Liberty?" …

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.420
… with "In New Jersey" technically correct in the most pointless kind of way.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.040
Now in the midst of all this, America noticed Liberty Island's rather strategic position…

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:36.460
… and she took it for herself as federal land and built a pretty star fortress upon it that could shoot in every direction.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.240
Look familiar?

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.580
Later when France sent America the Statue of Liberty as a symbol of their eternal friendship …

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.220
(A bond forged side-by-side in the heat of the young rebel's battle for freedom from the Empire …

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.820
… a bond America would surely "hashtag" never forget.)

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:59.800
… America said: "I will put it right here where it will be the first thing everyone coming to the United States will see!  BFFs, France!  BFFs, forever."

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.080
So the statue was put atop an old Federal Fort on Federal Land and, pow, made a National Monument.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.220
So America owns the statue?

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.740
This opens a book titled “What is Federal Land, like what does it mean? for real though?”.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.460
Which will be firmly closed as a story for another time otherwise we will never finish this.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.160
It's still only the 60s and we have yet to talk about the squabble over the land below the water... yesreally.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.600
So back to Ellis Island for a moment.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.220
Which, a hundred and fifty years after borders were supposedly settled, New Jersey claimed as hers again, partly.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.820
See: in the 1800s the island was yay big, but by the 1990s, it was *yay* big.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.620
And because the rivalries of youth never really end, New Jersey again brought in the Supreme Court.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.680
This time New York showed up promptly.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.780
The added land, New Jersey said, was hers.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.100
New York disagreed saying the embiggened island was still her island.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.060
Now, how did Ellis island get bigger?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.900
Well New York claimed while digging up the subways she dumped the dirt, uh, here.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.060
In New Jersey's half of the river.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.500
But her dirt = her new land, which is an interesting territorial acquisition strategy.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.780
But neither New York nor New Jersey could find any paperwork for the court to prove where the land came from.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.980
So how Ellis Island grew three sizes is just lost to history.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.280
But whatever. The court ruled everything above the water was New York …

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.500
… and everything below the water was New Jersey.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.800
But if below became above, New New Jersey it would be.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.720
And thus this island belongs to New Jersey with just this little original part being New York.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.160
Which is a sublime and ridiculous border that opens the door to one squabble remaining.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.500
Liberty Island was originally yay but now it's *yay*.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.340
Which, means, this part should be New Jersey, not New York.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.700
Though it hasn't been fought over yet, (possibly because neither state has noticed)…

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.060
… and while it would still leave Lady Liberty on the New York side.…

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.640
… you know what would be on the New Jersey side?  The Gift Shop.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.400
And the only thing more important than who owns the monument…

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.580
… is who owns the gift shop for the monument.  We will see.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.540
But as it is, within the waters of New Jersey, there's an island of New York …

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.540
… that's federal land...atop which the national monument of the Statue of Liberty stands.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:20.120
[music]

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.400
Oh, there's also Shooter's island.  The State border runs... right through it.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.660
I’m not sure anyone noticed.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.240
Uhh... it's a bird sanctuary run by New York, so whatever.
