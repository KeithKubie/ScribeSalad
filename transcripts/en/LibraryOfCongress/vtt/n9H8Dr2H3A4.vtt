00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Good morning everyone.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.220
Well-- I feel like I
should be standing here

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.520
and singing the national anthem.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.820
But I don't want to
scare anybody away

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.000
since we have a nice crowd here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060
My name is David Mao and I
have the honor of serving

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.830 position:56%
as the acting Librarian of Congress.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.260
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.390
It is our nation's oldest,
Federal, cultural institution.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.790
Excuse me, I should say our first,
Federal, cultural institution.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.180
And we are just so
delighted that all

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.460
of you could be with us here today.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.390
We are the Library of
Congress and we were created

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.940
by Congress 216-- almost
216 years ago.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.520
And have been generously supported
by Congress over the years

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.160
to become the world's
largest library.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.200
And we're very proud of that fact.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.460
But we are the nation's library
but as our name suggests.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.200
We are the Library for Congress.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.440 position:56%
And so that's why I think it's
particularly appropriate that we are

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.140
in this room today for
this very special program.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.200
This room in this building when
it was opened in 189-- 1897.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.270
Served as the reading room for
the House of Representatives.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.930
And today it's known as the
member's room and reserved

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.510
for the use of members of Congress.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.320
And so with that, we're
very delighted to have

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.900 position:56%
with us 2 members of Congress today.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.070
In this room, to tell us a
little bit about their careers.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.670
Chairman Candice Miller
from Michigan

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.390
and Representative Janice
Hahn from California.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.330
They're here to kick
off our celebration

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.640
of women's history month.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.940
Both Chairman Miller

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.770
and Representative Hahn have
had distinguished careers

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.070
in public service.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.610
And so we're very much looking
forward to hearing from them.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.260
Their thoughts about
their time in Congress.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.680
And in particular the
role that gender plays

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.960
in today's political
leadership and landscape.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.540
Our discussion will
be lead and moderated

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.180
by my colleague, Doctor
Colleen Shogan.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.840
Who is the director
of our national--

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.440
excuse me, Deputy Director
of National

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.790
and International Outreach
here at the library.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.200
Today's topic though, of course, is
of particular interest to Colleen.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.150
Because as the former
Deputy Director

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.780
of the Congressional
Research Service.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.490 position:56%
She had authored at her time in CRS,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.410
an often cited CRS report
on Women in Congress.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.290
So-- please join me in welcoming
all of our distinguished members

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.940
of Congress and Doctor
Colleen Shogan.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.210
Thank you [applause].

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.040
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.600
and this beautiful
room this morning.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.660
As at the end of our
program we hope to have time

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.960
for questions from the audience.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.490
But I'm going to kick
it off this morning.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.070
You both have had very long and
distinguished careers in politics.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.530
But you both had different
entries into public service.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.960
So can you tell us about how
and why you became interested

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.520
in government service
in the first place?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.400
Chairman Miller.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.840
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Well
for me, I live in-- Chairman--

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.100
or David Mao was just talking
about the tenth district.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.030
You know, in Michigan we have a map
of the state on the end of our arm.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.670
So I-- live in this area here.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.480
This is my-- district.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.520
And-- on the Great Lakes and my
family was in the marina business.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.920
So I actually sold
boats for a living.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.690
And-- I raised sailboats and
that was sort of our-- hobby.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.320
And our way we made our
living, our social-- everything.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.620
Everything was boating oriented.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.980
And when I was in my mid-20's,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.450
the local township
decided they were going

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.540
to pass an ordinance
to tax all the marinas.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.360
Because about 40% of
the commercial tax base

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.740
in our area is all marina oriented.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.990
And in a family business
you do everything.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.410
I mean everything, right?

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.740
From doing the books to
selling boats to whatever.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.390
And I remember telling--
I was doing the books.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.020
And I remember telling my dad.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.560 position:56%
I said, "We just can't afford this!"

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.780
They were going to tax so
much for wet storage in the--

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.570
in the water storage,
so much for dry storage.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.870
And I said-- you-- I don't know.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.620
I probably said, "Taxation
without representation"

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.260
or I don't know what
I was saying you know.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.980
And my dad sort of
padded me on the head.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.780
He says, "Oh no-- " Because
he used to call me Candy--

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.690
don't tell anyone that
but-- [laughter].

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.480
Yes, yes but then when
I ran for office I said,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.020
"I have to be Candice now."

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.160
But anyway, he said,
"Well Candy, you know,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.050
you can't-- fight city hall so-- "

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.350
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.650
Right.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.950
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: "You
know, this is what we got to do."

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.250
I said, "Well then-- " I
just couldn't believe it.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.550
So I went around to
all these marinas

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.850
and got these petitions signed.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.570
And long story, short went
into the township off--

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.370
the township board meeting.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.860 position:56%
And you know, gosh I was so riled up

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.420
but I was sitting way
in the back of the room.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.850
And I'll never forget when
they got to our-- agenda item.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.350
All these guys that own the
marina said, "Okay, you know,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.650
get up there and tell them."

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.950
And I went [Gasp].

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.250
I still can remember
my heart pounding.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.970
Because I had never spoken
publicly or anything.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.780
Never thought about politics.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.080
And sometimes for me,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.310
I think anxiety almost
manifests itself in anger.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.970
So I was like, "Listen!

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.530
[laughs] can't do this".

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.830
And we were successful.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.130
I thought, "Oh my gosh!

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.970
If you're really obnoxious you
could become a politician!"

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.150
You know [laughs] so
then I'm looking

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.840
at all these other
people on the board.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.540
And it thought, "Hey
I could do that."

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.500
So then I ran, I was too young
to know I wouldn't win but I won.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.030
And that's-- here I am.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.790
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Representative Hahn.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.470
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: Well I had
a-- sort of a different entry.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.780
You know your family was
in boating and marinas.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.830
My family actually was in politics.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.350
So it's really everything
we talked about.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.250
We talked about politics
at the dinner table.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:48.470
My dad was a 46 year elected
official in Los Angeles County.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.240
My brother was the City
Controller, the City attorney

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.400
and then the Mayor of Los Angeles.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.930
So our family-- it was
really our family business.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.300
I didn't quite embrace it.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.440
In the beginning, I actually
have my teaching credential--

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.760
my secondary teaching credential.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.370
I actually taught junior
high and high school.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.350
I went into small business.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.090
I worked for an investor-owned
utility.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.250
I worked for a trash company.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.280 position:56%
I sort of did all these other things
and then I think it just hit me.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.280
The DNA kicked in.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.220
It's one of those moments
where you're sort of,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.610
you know, lying in bed at night.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.020
And you're like, "You know what?

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.650
What am I supposed
to be doing here?"

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.410
And it was very clear to me that
the best way I could affect change

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.460
in my community and my neighborhood
was to run for-- public office.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.770
I lost my first race.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.710
I was like the first
member of my family

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.880
to ever lose in a race [laughter].

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.450
It was very humiliating
and embarrassing.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.750
But you know what?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.480
I knew that that's
what I wanted to do.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.480
And then 8 years later I
ran again and was elected

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.010
to the Los Angeles City Council.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.290
You know I waited so
long to actually--

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.110
it wasn't until I was 49 or 50

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.130
when I actually had my
first elected office.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.570
And so, sort of funny that
finally when I got elected in 2001.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.250
It was the same night that
my brother was elected Mayor.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.220
So [laughter] I joke
that even my mother went

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.970
to his victory party, you know?

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.060
[laughter].

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.360
That's how I got into politics.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.750
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: At a certain
point one day you both decided

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.290
to run for Congress.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.600
Can you tell us about that moment

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.440
when you decided to
run for Congress?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.080
And what influenced your decision?

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.660
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Well
I had 2 different moments

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.390
because I ran in 80-- gosh.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.690
Isn't it terrible?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.780
I can't remember if
it was '84 or '86?

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.080
I ran for Congress.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.380
I was 30 at the time,
trying to remember.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.600
So-- anyway and lost and lost.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.670
And so-- I was-- I was you know.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.390
I had been the Township supervisor.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.710
I started my career, political
career as a Township trustee

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.010
for a short period of time.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.310
Then I became a supervisor
in Michigan.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.580
That's really like
being a Mayor right?

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.370
And we had one of the larger
townships in the state.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.530
And so then I ran for
congress and-- lost.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.980
And-- that's the only
race that I've lost.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.980
But I recognize all the
reasons why I did loose.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.040
But anyway, then I-- was
still the Township Supervisor.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.580
I think I ran for one
more term after that.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.320
Then I was the County
Treasurer in Macomb County

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.010
which you sometimes hear this term.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.870
The Reagan's-- Reagan democrats.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.740
That term had its genesis really

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.300
in the political nomenclature
in our County.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.550
And you-- you'll probably hear
tomorrow night at the Fox Theatre

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.310
with the Republican
Presidential debate.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.340
And-- when the dems
are in Flint on Sunday.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.280
They'll be talking a little
bit about Macomb County.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.530
Because it's about whether we
don't even know if we're democrats,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.190
republicans, what we
are half the time.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.620
We're like we're in a
Petri dish, you know?

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.640
They're like, "What are they going
to-- what are they going to do?"

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.010
But anyway, then I was the sec--

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.970
Michigan secretary
of state for 8 years.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.520 position:56%
And we have term limits in Michigan.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.720 position:56%
And as secretary that's one of the 4
constitutional offices in the state.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.820
And so you know in term
limits it's a-- [Noise].

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.400
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: That's the
ghost of the members room.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.700
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Oh!

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.000
[Laughs].

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.300
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Don't worry about it.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.600
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
What's its name?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.900
[Laughter] Woo-hoo!

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.740
Anyway, he does not
like term limits.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.040
That's what I was talking about.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.370
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: That's right.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.670
Right?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.280
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Anyway,
the-- so term limits it's you know,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.220
"nice job but drive thru."

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.430
And so then I was trying to
decide, "Should I go back

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.900
into the private sector
selling boats?

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.200
Or doing something else?"

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.120
And-- then I decided
to run for Congress.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.120
And so I came here the ra--
the race was in '02 [noise].

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.880
I got-- I have the
microphone Mr. Ghost.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.180
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right?

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.720
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: I came
here in '02, started in '03.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.860
And I have been here
now-- so this is 14 years.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.350
And of course both
of us are deciding

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.190
to do something else
with our-- lives, right?

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.810
We both have another dance
in us, whatever that is.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.180
So-- I'm just finishing
my seventh term.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.630
Which has been the most incredible
experience I have ever had.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.490
Representative Hahn.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:20.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: So that after I
lost the city council race in 1993.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.530
Until I won the city
council in 2001.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.430
Those you know 8 years,
I was really focused on--

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.110
I was a single mother at the time.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.410
I was raising my 3 kids.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.120
I was an investment banker.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.230
This was when I was
really just focusing

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.450
on you know jobs and making money.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:47.490 position:56%
And in 1998, my member of
Congress, Jane Harman decided to run

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.080
for Governor of California.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.910
So she stepped down and now that
I'm back here I understand how the

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.820
individual caucuses work.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.500
And if some member wants
to give up their seat.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.870
Man, it is a full court press
to find a good candidate to run

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.870
in their race and replace them.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.840
So they came after me [noise].

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.430
It's the ghost of former
members [laughter] which is

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.720
where we're going to be very soon.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.740
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
We'll be back here haunting.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.040
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: Yes, right.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.410
So I got phone calls
from Steny Hoyer.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.440
I never heard of Steny Hoyer.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.930
I got-- actually got a call
from President Clinton.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:32.350
Vice President Gore, they were
all trying to recruit someone

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.770
who had a similar profile
to Jane Harman, right?

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.750 position:56%
A woman, same initials-- [laughter].

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:44.130
I-- in my heart of
hearts wasn't feeling it.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.620
But I-- it got to the sort of
answering the call to my country.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:52.400
You know, they're really asking me
to do this so I did it and lost.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.710 position:56%
It was apparently one of the closest
congressional races in the country.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.070
Lost by just 2 percentage points

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.260
which is not very much
in a congressional race.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.560
But you know what?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.800
It's like the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.950
I do believe that things
happen for a reason.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.020
You don't always know it
when you're going through it.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.900
And it's never fun to lose.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.120
But as a result of me not
going to Congress in 1998.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.760
That's when then I was elected
to the local city council.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.880
And I got to cut my own political
teeth at the local level.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.050
And that was important
for me as a woman.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:33.840
I sort of grew up being the
daughter of-- and the sister of--

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.940
these 2 very successful make
politicians in Los Angeles County.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.880
So it was really important for
me to cut my own political teeth

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.730
in the Los Angeles City Council.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.880
So for 10 years I served there.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.120
We also have term limits
in City Council.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.190
So I was bumping up to my 12 years.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.120
And once again, Jane Harman.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.950
She went back and after I lost.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.960
She was like, "Well clearly
Janice couldn't do that.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.790
I have to come back
and win that seat."

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.750
And then she called me again
one early February morning.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.090
And said, "I'm resigning
from Congress this week.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.440
And I think you ought
to run for my seat."

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.640
So thought about it.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.720
You know, kind of called
my political consultants

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.260
and we had our website
up by noon [laughter].

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.730
And this time it felt right.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.030
It felt good.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.780
And so I was elected in 2011
in the special election.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.360
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Throughout your careers,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.870
you both witnessed a transformation
of women's political participation

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.530
in particularly electoral politics.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.330
Can you tell us how has
that transformation?

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.540
How has that evolution
affected you personally?

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.840
From the time in which you
began your public service.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.310
When you began your career.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:54.180
How it was then to what you
see now as more women start

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.100
to participate in electoral
politics?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.400
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Me first?

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.700
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Sure go ahead.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.000
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: You
know I would just say this.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.600
I think-- when I was-- when I
was first running for office.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.880
I was also a single
mother at that time.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.430
And I couldn't afford a babysitter.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.270
And I dragged my little
daughter around.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.980 position:56%
Whose now in her 40's and the mother

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.730
of the world's 2 most
beautiful grandchildren.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.030
But I--

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.330
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn:
Wait until you see mine.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.630
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Know
you would argue with that one.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.930
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I know.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.230
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
But I dragged her

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.530
around the neighborhoods
going door to door in a wagon.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.830
I tried to make a game
out of it, you know?

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.130
Because I just couldn't
afford a sitter.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.890
And there we-- and people
were looking at me going.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.190
First I was young, right?

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.810
I mean in my 20's but
then more than that.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.320
They'd say, "I mean
you're like a woman."

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.620
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.920
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
Seriously, you know?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.220
"What are you doing?

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.520
And now you want to be
you know the supervisor?

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.820
Oh yeah right."

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.250
And so I was the first female
supervisor in my community.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.480
And then I was the
first County Treasurer

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.980
in my County-- first woman.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.110
Then I was the first woman
secretary of state in Michigan.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.470
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
There's a theme here.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:54.770
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: You know?

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.580
Well-- but you know all of these
things and sometimes you know I'm--

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.230
as you might know I'm
the only woman chairman.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.530
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.830
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: In
the House of Representatives.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.130
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yes.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.430
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: But you
know what the truth is really.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.730
I mean I got the whole woman thing.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.230
But I've never really, you know.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.620
"Oh you're the woman
member of Congress."

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.920
I'm like, "Well I don't know.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.800
I'm like the-- I'm the
member of Congress.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.080
And in issues that they
talk about for women."

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.840
I think all issues are
women's issues, you know.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.220
Sometimes they'll say,
"Oh well okay.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.520
Here's the health issues.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.040
Now, you know, this is
the woman's issue" Right?

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.470
You and I sit on transportation.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.770
What's more important
to women than--

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.070
&gt;&gt;Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.370
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
Transportation.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.670
Really, right?

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.000
Whatever they're-- whether they're
flying or being in their car or--

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.300
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Exactly.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.330
&gt;&gt;Rep. Candice Miller: Safety in
rail or-- you know everything.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.840
And I'm the Vice Chair of the
Homeland Security Committee.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.160
What's more important
to women than security?

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.270
Security of the homeland, etcetera.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.040
But it has changed over the years.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.340
Because where it was a negative.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.290
Then at one point it seemed they
said, "Well people would now vote

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.590
for you because you are a woman."

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.890
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.190
&gt;&gt;Rep. Janice Hahn: Right.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.490
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
And really I think

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.790
if it can just be because
of the merits.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.020
That's really where we all need to
go but I've also always said this.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.840
I think we need more women
to be involved in politics.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.190 position:56%
Whether you're democrat, republican.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.630
Whether you're running for
Congress or you're running

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.480
for your local school board.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.830
We need to have more women.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.790
We need to have their view.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:13.400
And I think it is for all of
us that do hold public office

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.750
to conduct ourselves well.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.640
As well as we can because
you know what?

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.080
It's very generational.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.710
And the next generation of
women need to be thinking

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:27.380
about how they can succeed in
politics and have an impact.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.580
Because it is-- we do
have a different mindset.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.830
We are all biological
beings after all, right?

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.800
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I-- am
pleased with the evolution

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.500
of seeing more women
participating in politics.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.340
Particularly running for
office and being elected.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.370
I think the evolution
has helped, you know,

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.610
those of us who are
women and in office.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.010
And those who may be
thinking about it.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.650
When I first ran for office,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.210
there were very few women
who were my role models.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.750
Who had been elected to office.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:10.790
Very few. In fact, my staff
always cracks up at this story.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.090
Wasn't really funny at the time.

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:17.290
But when I went through my
divorce, my ex actually filed

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.890
for full custody of the children.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.930
Because he said if I
was elected to office,

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.250
it would make me an unfit mother.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.550
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Wow.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: So yeah I know.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.150
You kind of laugh about that now.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.210
But you know there was this
feeling even you know in the'90's.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.850
It's hard to believe.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.990
That there was still this
feeling that that's not

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.420
where a woman really belonged
was in the political arena.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.010
So I think it helps
that more women are--

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.780
running for office
and being elected.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.470
And as Candice said, you
know, we need more women.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.410
In congress, we're
only 20% of women.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.860
Even though we're 50%
of the population.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.240
We're only 20% of the
members of Congress.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.400
You know, I think one of the
statistics that was amazing

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.710
to me when I got elected.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.700
I, you know, all the
years in Congress.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.950
There'd only been 212, you
know, women elected, you know.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.290
And now of course--

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.590
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
It's hard, yeah.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.310
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: We're you
know kind of upping that number.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.110
But I do believe that
women come to the table

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.630 position:56%
with a different set of experiences.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.610
I do believe we have sort
of a different perspective.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.310
And I like the way we govern.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:30.250
I think we govern more--
with more collaboration.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.860
I think we like to find
common ground and consensus.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.490
And solve problems so I
like the way women govern.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:44.360
But I'm wondering if we're almost--
it's now, it's going the other way.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:50.950
Because when I'm looking to
recruit for political offices.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.680
I'm looking for good women.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.090
I have a hard time now.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.440
There are women who now,
you know, have careers.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.840
And actually watching politics,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.030
particularly during
this presidential year.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.040
There's a lot of women
that are like,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.490
"I don't really want to do that.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.920
You know, that's really nasty.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.060
That's-- do we really want to
put our families through that?

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:16.320
Do I really want to, you know, have
everything in my life scrutinized?"

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.500
So I think it's-- I'm finding less
women now who are wanting to run.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.370
They'll be involved, will
help you on your campaign.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.950
More and more women are
understanding what it means

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.690
to make a contribution to a-- to
a woman who's running for office.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.720
But I'm thinking women
are sort of now, you know,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.820
like not as excited
about being in office.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.940
Because of what's happened
to our politics of civility.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.050
Which sometimes you wonder
if that even exists anymore.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.350
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: I'm
going to ask you to both--

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.960
you got into this a little
bit Representative Hahn.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.350 position:56%
But I need to ask you both to engage
in the thought experiment with us.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.440
As you said, 20% of members

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.590
of Congress are women
in the current Congress.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.070
And I want to ask you, what
would the institution--

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.680
what would congress look like?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.610
Or how would it operate differently
if 50% of its members were women?

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.920
Or even 51% of its
members were women?

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.970
How would the institution
operate differently if at all?

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.190
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: I do
think it would be a bit different.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:22.180
I do think-- I think most of us
would agree that women have a bit

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.020
of a different perspective
on how they approach things.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.260
Whatever your political ideology
is, more of the cultural way

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.790
that you approach various things.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.530
Where you are trying
to reach a consensus.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.200
I think more often than just you
know, "Okay I don't agree with you.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.500
I'm going to put on
the war paint here.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.800
We're going, you know?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.800
Let's just think about
how we might be able

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.100
to get through these things."

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.240
And now, I'm not talking
from an ideology standpoint.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.540
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.880
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: But just
the approach to problem solving.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.030
I think is a bit different.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:54.010
And-- so I think in-- of all
the various issues in that.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.440
If we just had more
voices for women.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.450
I think-- I think that
would be an important thing.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.750
But I will agree with you.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.980
I think where you had an
easier time recruiting women.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.050
Because I've done candidate
recruitment for my party.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.350
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: Right.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.650
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: I
know you have for you party.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.200
It does seem it's a-- it's a--
it's a little more difficult now.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.180
And-- which is not good.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.480
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: No.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.780
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: It's
not good for the country.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.810
Although with all of our
problems, only having 20%

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.140
in the Congress, I'll tell you.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.630
You know one of the opportunities
I've had in this job is travel.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.930
You know, you have as well.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:28.620
But I can remember going to
Afghanistan and we landed in Kabul.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.250
Which you know is sort
of like a saucer, right?

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.910
With all the mountain
range around it

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.280
and all the snow melt
was coming down.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.950
And these children
are standing there

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.050
in the snow melt with no shoes.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.350
And you know, you could
just see they were--

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.590
they're not going to
make it, you know?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.050
And they don't have
any facilities there

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.620
for their women or their children.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.730
These-- some of these societies,
I'm sorry, they just don't care

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.290
about their women so much.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.750
And then traveling to
we went to see Karzai.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.520
And traveling to the
Presidential Palace,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.710
it was like teeming with people.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.200
And I kept saying, "Well
where are the women?

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.500
Where are they?"

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.800
It's so bizarre.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.040
So for all of our problems,
you know,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.720
I tell young women
that all the time.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.700
Just go do it man.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.620
Because you-- have
opportunities here.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.920
You might have challenges

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.270
but you don't have the
challenges your sisters

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.920
in many other countries have.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.220
So take advantage.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.510
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: Anyhow I
was thinking about this question.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.080
What would run differently
if there were more women?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.380
I don't know.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.680
Maybe we would carpet all
the marble halls [laughter].

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.210
Because there's so
hard on our high heels.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.720
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: This
is a sensible shoe caucus.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.020
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I know.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.090
I got shin splints my first
year in Congress [laughter].

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.150
But I-- think beyond that you know.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:43.300
I find that my friendships
with the few women

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.510
in Congress are really special.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:55.010
And they, you know, it allows me
even across the aisle to find,

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.010
you know, areas of common ground.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.840
Areas of consensus
and there is not the--

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.220 position:56%
you know, the hostility that exists.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.960
I think sometimes between the men.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.260
I mean we don't have testosterone.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.620
That changes a lot
of things [laughter].

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.890
Changes a lot of the--
you know, the atmosphere.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.060
It changes a lot of where
you go on a conversation.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.660
It changes a lot of you know
the agenda of-- the house.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.130
So I would love to see
more women in Congress.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.380
I think it would you know
really be an opportunity

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.270
to show you know the world.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.360
That you know we can be
from different parties

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.250
and yet we can get along.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.690
And we can find common ground.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.470
And I think it would-- I think it
would help if we had more women.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.590
I'd love to see more women
you know chairs of committees.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.980
I just think, you know--

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.280
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: You
don't think one is enough?

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.580
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I know right?

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.880
I know. You know--

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.180
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
One is not enough?

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.810
We could have a few more [laughs].

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.820
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I, you know,
I think we run things differently.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:59.220 position:56%
Again, I think we just bring
different perspectives to the table.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.680
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Unfortunately
you're both retiring from Congress

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.100
and leaving us later this year.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.400
I wonder if you could share with
us some of your future plans.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.950
And what you're most
looking forward to doing?

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.560
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
Well you know first of all.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.490
When I first came here I
never thought I would stay

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.860
as long as I have stayed.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.160
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Huh?

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.460
&gt;&gt;Rep. Candice Miller: And I
know a lot of people say that.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.520
And I think also people
say, "You sort of know

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.820
when is your time to go" right?

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.120
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.420
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
When you're done.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.720
And that was really true for me.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.260
But I thought I would be
here 6 years, 8 years maybe.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.080
You know I'm going
to tell you though.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.440
It's like any other job I guess.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.850
Maybe more so than a lot of jobs.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.420
It's sort of insidious, you know.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.340
Pretty soon you think,
"Well now I'm the chairman.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.710
I can't leave now or I got
this issue I'm working on.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.010
I can't leave now".

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.310
Well pretty soon you're
never going to leave.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.610
And then they're going to
maybe take you out on a gurney.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.060
And I don't want go
that way [laughter].

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.160
And I truly love Michigan.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.540
I'm a Michigan girl.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.450
And I want to go home to Michigan.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.090
So I'm looking forward
to whatever it is next.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.390
I'm not quite sure what?

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.180
But I'll tell you the
experiences that I have had here.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.340
There's absolutely no second.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.800
And so I-- you know,
I don't know how--

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.300
I hope to be of value at somewhere.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.170
I might run for office
again, you know.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.670
I might not.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.210
I might go back into
the private sector.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.150
But I also say this.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.660
This is just my personal feeling.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.240
I-- really do think the
founding fathers always thought

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.950
that for Congress.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.800
Particularly in the House, that
you would come from various sectors

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.680
of your-- of the country.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.880
And do your thing for
some period of time.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.930
And then you would go back.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.840
Not just be here forever.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.690
And really if you want
to know the truth

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.650
and this is not a partisan thing.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.510
Sometimes I think part of the
gridlock problems we have is

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.150
because some people don't leave.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.450
They never go.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.300
So even when you have a
Presidential election.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.760
Now you have a new President but
then you still have-- then they go.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.060
"Oh okay well here's this new guy.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.000
But here they-- they've
all been here."

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.300
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.600
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
So I don't know.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.960
That's-- I'm not-- and I'm not
saying about any particular person.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.890
I'm just saying in my observation
I do think it's the people's house.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:02.260
You know, I don't-- I don't know
what the right amount of time is.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.240
But I don't think it
should be forever.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.540
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.500
Representative Hahn.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.800
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: So I'm--

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.580
well have been here
only 5 years this July.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.510
And when I end my term
at the end of the year,

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.070
it'll be like 5 and a half years.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.430
But I am going home to Los Angeles.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.770
And I'm currently-- I'm
going to be on the ballot

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.110
for County Supervisor
in Los Angeles.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.730
So it's the same job my
dad did for 40 years.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.010
I sort of grew up in the
County of Los Angeles.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:36.180
And kind of really understood what
a supervisor was in LA County.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.370
So I'm really looking
forward to going home.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:45.200
I think-- you know, when I said I
cut my teeth on the City Council.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.800
I-- really believe for
me, it's a better fit

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.730
for me, is local government.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.740
I like the idea of sort of
where the rubber meets the road.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.740
I like you know seeing my
constituents in the grocery store.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.160
And you know they want their tree
trimmed or their pothole filled

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.800
or their sidewalk-- I like that.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.350
I like actually seeing
the fruits of my labor.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.090
Seeing a problem and solving it.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:13.130
There's only 5 members of the
County Board of Supervisors.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:17.410
And actually with my candidacy,
there is a historic opportunity

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:20.610
for 3 females to be on the LA
County Board of Supervisors.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.180
For the first time in the
history of the County.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.480
My dad was there.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.070
It was you know the
old boy's network.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.810
It was-- they called
them the 5 kings.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:32.350 position:56%
And-- but now with diversity and
more women I look forward to working

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.170
with 2 other women, you
know, out of-- out of 5.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.760
To really, you know, talk about
you know issues that matter

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.540
to most people in the
county of Los Angeles.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.380
So I'm-- I know where I'm going.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:49.220
And I feel good but I-- will
look back on my time here.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:54.650
As of course being such
an amazing experience.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:59.920
Really such an opportunity to
serve as a member of Congress.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.600
It's really been a very
special and satisfying to me.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.200
But frustrating also
just in the gridlock.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.980
You know I think I landed in one of
the more partisan political divides

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.050
that Congress has been
in a long time.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.990
And I don't enjoy it.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:22.650
I decided I don't enjoy
partisan politics.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.310
Los Angeles County
Supervisor is non-partisan.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.000
You just you know you look at
a problem and you solve it.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.920
And you don't really have
to worry about one side

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.700
or the other making
political points.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.100
And I think it'll be
a better fit for me.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.450
And if I never get on a
plane again [laughter].

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.340
It will be too soon.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.450
I have a 3,000 mile
commute every week.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.860
I fly here on Mondays and fly
home on Thursdays every week.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.410
And that has taken a toll.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.710
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: So-- which is
why I was trying to pass legislation

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.130
about seat sizes [laughter].

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.270
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
Yeah [laughs].

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.570
Why? We have 7 inches.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.590
How much room do you need there?

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:08.070
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: After 6 hours
like, "Oh, it's so uncomfortable."

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.370
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Chairman Miller.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.670
We have one last question for you.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:11.970
It's sort of a humorous question.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.460
I wonder if you could tell
us about your nickname?

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.680
And-- "old goat" and how
you got that nickname?

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.870
And why you are so
proud to have earned it?

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.720
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Well,
jeez the old goat [laughter].

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.230 position:56%
I told you I used to race sailboats.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.530
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:30.830
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
And my whole family does.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.320
But anyway, there is
sort of a Marquis race--

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.770
Freshwater Sailboat Race
in the world really.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.430
Is on Lake Huron.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.440
It's Port Huron to Mackinac.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.310 position:56%
Any of you heard of Mackinac Island.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.610
&gt;&gt;Colleen Shogan: Yeah.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.910
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: So there's
this Port Huron to Mackinac race.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.840
There's another one in
Chicago to Mackinac.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.330
And-- first of all I
will tell you I was

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.470
in the first all-female crew
in the Chicago Mackinac.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:55.290
And also the first all-female crew
in the Port Huron to Mackinac.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:56.590
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yay.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.890
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
Many years ago.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.190
I was 15 at the time.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.490
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Very cool.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.790
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
"Oh my gosh, I can't even--

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.090
" I'm really dating myself.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.710 position:56%
But anyway, in Port Huron race after
you compete in 25 of these races.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.760
They induct you into what they
call the Old Goat Society.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.520
And I've done 29 of them.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.810
So I am actually an old nanny goat.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.400
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh!

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.700
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: And--

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.000
&gt;&gt;Colleen Shogan: You're a goat.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.300
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
And I know this to be true.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.050
I am the only old nanny goat
in the United States count.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.570
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Wow, there you go.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.870
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: [Laughs].

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.800
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: And you
can keep that title [laughter].

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.540
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
I earned it baby.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.840
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: Right.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.140
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: [Laughs].

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.440
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So now we--

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.740
can like open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.760
If you do chose to ask a
question, please just be aware

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.460
that we are videotaping
this conversation.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:45.100
So if anybody would like to ask a
question, please raise your hand.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.680
Take questions at this time.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.980
Robert.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.550
&gt;&gt; Robert: I'd like to ask the
members if there were any books

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.020
that they've read along the way

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.240
that influenced their
thinking in Congress?

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.970
Or influenced their
thinking about leadership?

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:04.830
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
I'm not going to say

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.130
"The Art of the Deal" [laughter].

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.750
I don't know if there was
ever any one particular book

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.490
that has influenced me.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:20.240
But-- I don't know if I
can answer that question.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.160
Really I can't think
of one particular book

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.760
that really influenced me.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.110
People more I think.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.810
Individual experiences and that.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.180
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: So I had
fund reading "Game Change".

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.180
And I had fun reading "This Town."

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.490
Those were really a little
bit behind the scenes

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.860
political campaigns.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.520
And kind of what goes into
that and how that translates

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.580
to actually being in governance.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.890
I found those books--
and I enjoy the books

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.310
that were having our
congressional dialogue.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.610
&gt;&gt;Rep. Candice Miller: Yes.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.910
&gt;&gt;Rep. Janice Hahn:
"Lyndon Johnson",

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.210
"Reagan" and "Kennedy" coming up.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.320
I've really enjoyed those to kind

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.060
of really take us back
to the way it was.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.010 position:56%
It was like, again though, in those
books it's like where are the women?

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.310
But--

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:08.610
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yup, I did.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.690
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: Still
those really have in--

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.100
have-- reminded me where I am.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.520
And reminded me who's
gone before me.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.100
And reminded me of the, you
know, sometimes incredible fights

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:30.210
that went on to achieve certain
policies for the American people.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.090
So I've really enjoyed those.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: That's true.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.690
The history of this place--

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.990
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I know.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.290
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
Is sometimes, you know,

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.590
honestly I'm sure we
all have this feeling.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.080
You know sometimes in the winter
when-- it's days are short.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.000
And you're walking across
Independence Avenue over here

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.570
to go vote at the Capitol.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.260
And there's the Capitol all lit
up and you know you're walking--

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.090
you're looking at the
lady Freedom Statue.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.900
Thinking, "Man you go girl".

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.200
That's really something, right?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.500
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I know, right?

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.800
&gt;&gt;Rep. Candice Miller: And you
just pinch yourself thinking.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.630
"How, what-- am I even--
how did I even get here?"

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.870
With all the history
that has happened here.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.320
And really in this Capitol
it's quite something.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.340
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Other questions?

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:11.710
Anybody else in the audience?

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:16.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You spoke to the importance of
the diversity in gender in Congress.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.780
And I'd like to hear both of you
speak to how you think we are doing

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.880
in terms of diversity and
ethnicity in Congress?

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:31.370
And what are our losses
and gains related to that?

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.440
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: We are
not doing particularly well.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.740
I don't think.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.210
Certainly on my side of the isle,
we need to do a much better job.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.240
And don't think that
we're not all aware of it.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.820
I will tell you though, I
think in politics generally.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.390
I mentioned to you earlier
I mean I was the Secretary

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.800
of State of Michigan.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.870
And when I first ran for that
job I was running against

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:54.130
and older African American
incumbent.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:57.550
And the truth-- and here I was
running as the first female, right?

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.990
And really I will tell
you in all sincerity.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.110
That race-- I don't
think anyone ever said.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.890
"Oh well we need to vote for him
because he's an African American.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.230
Or we need to vote for her
because she's the woman."

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.590
It really was about the issues.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:13.150
And I have always thought about
that because at some point that's

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:17.130
where we need to be
as a country, right?

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:22.020 position:56%
Whatever the-- whatever the-- issues
are, is always got to be paramount.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.530
And you know this is the land
of opportunity and all men

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.730
and women are created equal.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:31.170
So but we need to do
a much better job.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.770
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I will say
I'm proud of the Democratic caucus.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.260
Actually has-- this is
I think our first time

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:42.750
when we've actually had a
majority of minority representation

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.300
in our Democratic caucus.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.950
So we have more women,
more African Americans

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.260
and more Latinos and
Asian Americans.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.870
Than I think ever before
in our caucus so--

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:56.080
but I-- do-- I agree you know.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.150
It should be about the issues.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:02.160
And I actually represent a
minority district right now.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.520
I represent a district that's--

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.170
you know, 48% Latino,
28% African American.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:14.760
So I represent a very you
know diverse district.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.310
But I-- it's sort of
like women though.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.790
I do believe people come to the
table with different experiences.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:25.020
And I think for those, you
know, our diverse ethnicity.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.900
Our African Americans, our Latinos,
our Asian Americans, our LGBT.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.600
They come with a different
set of experiences

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.310
and a different perspective.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:37.990
And they have seen life
differently and I think that makes

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.390
for a better congress
and a better America.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.400
And you do the best you can

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.070
to represent the people
that have elected you.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:52.720
But I do love the different
perspectives that come

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.920
from all over this country.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.510
And people who have lived a
different life than I have.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.000
And I think that makes
for better policy.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.600
That makes for better judgement.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.810
That makes for I think
a better understanding

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:14.190
of what the American
people are wanting from us.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.490
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Any other questions?

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:19.460
Oh. Oh David, oh okay, go ahead.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.760
I didn't--

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.060
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Reflecting--
thank you very much

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.360
for your presentation today.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.680
It was fascinating.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.390
Reflecting on your careers though.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.360
If you were speaking
to a young woman

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.170
who is starting out
in politics today.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.970
Whether it be on the
local level, state level

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.710
or even a new member of Congress.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.030
What one piece of advice
would you give them to think

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:42.940 position:56%
about to guide them along their way?

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.100
&gt;&gt;Rep. Candice Miller: I would say
that they need to find the balance

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.210
between their professional
life and their family.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:50.820 position:56%
And that they can find that balance.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.120
&gt;&gt;Rep. Janice Hahn:
How do you do that?

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.420
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
Yeah [laughs].

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.720
Well they need to do it.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.020
Otherwise and that's--

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.640
I think that's why women
don't want to do it, right?

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.090
And often times because not
only are they the caregivers

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.390
for their children.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.790
They're usually the caregivers
if they have older parents.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.310
They're all of these things, right?

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.240
And then women also have a--
just for whatever reason.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.400
Whether it's because of
the way we were all raised.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.090
We have an aversion to asking
somebody for money for us, right?

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:18.390
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yeah.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:19.690
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: You don't
mind asking people for money

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:20.990
for the local schoolboard.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.380
Or the you know the
hospital board or something.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.330
But for yourself, sometimes
you think it's sort of--

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.720
you just have to get over
all of these things you know.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.070
So I just tell women that you
know I think they need to think

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.950
about finding that balance.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.770
And that it's important that
we do have more women involved.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.490
And I actually go-- I try to speak

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:43.070
to local high school
kids when I can.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:44.680
I have throughout my entire career.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.720
Because really if a woman
is going to be thinking

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.090
about a political career.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.290
You need to at least plant
the seed at that time

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:56.490
that politics can be an honorable
profession for them to think about.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.970
And that they should
consider such a thing.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.490
And that they might want to go out
and think about getting involved

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:05.670
in a campaign or-- do something
where they hopefully you know.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.610
If there's 40 in a room
then hopefully there's 1

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.230
that will catch the
political bug and think

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.250
about running for something.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.550
&gt;&gt;Rep. Janice Hahn: I know.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.400
And you know actually
you kind of touched

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.700 position:56%
on it earlier in something you said.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.020
But it is true still to this
day women do have an advantage

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.940
because of the-- trust issue.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.420
The-- if there's just a woman
and a man on the ballot.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.790
Your pollsters will tell you.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:33.690
Women get a couple of points just
because we're more believable.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:38.300
And when the negative
campaigning comes against us.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.530
Less and less voters believe that.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.300
They don't believe that about us.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.460
That all the things our
opponents are saying.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.590
So there is still an advantage.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.800
If I was giving a woman
any kind of advice,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.650
particularly if she
was coming to Congress.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:58.600
I would say have 2 complete
sets of wardrobes [laughter].

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.900
Have everything you need at home
and everything you need here.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.920
Don't be trying to remember
what shoes go with what outfit.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.750 position:56%
Because you know they're going to
be in the other location [laughter].

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:18.250
But I think seriously I would just
remind women to know their value.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:19.550
Know their value.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.400
I know Mika Brzezinski does this--

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.470
thing every year about
women knowing their value.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:31.090
And then mostly women still have
a hard time knowing their value

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.480
and knowing why they're important.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.930 position:56%
And knowing the role that they play.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.150 position:56%
Because when you're--
particularly in Congress when you're

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.210
in the minority you know.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.820
It's you know, it takes
a little more courage.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.840
It takes a little more
bravery to speak up.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.430
To think that your idea is
really worth you know pushing.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.020
That your legislation makes sense.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.350
That you know you really
are doing a good thing.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:40:00.920
Because I still think women tend
to sometimes not value themselves

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.080
in the way that our
male counterparts do.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.650
So it does take a little bravery I
think to be back here as a woman.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:12.040
And to speak up and to not be
you know in any way intimidated.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.680
About the questions that
you ask in committees,

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.190
legislation that you're
pushing forward.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:23.270
Because it can be an intimidating
place I think sometimes.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.290
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Any further questions?

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.190
Yes?

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.510
&gt;&gt; Hi, you both mentioned
that some of the friendships

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.730
that you have made in Congress
were particularly important to you.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.500
And I was wondering when
you were first starting out.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.990
If there was a particular person

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.740
or a particular moment
you can remember?

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.600
Where another woman in
Congress really helped you out

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.990
or showed you the ropes
or something like that?

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:52.300
&gt;&gt;Rep. Candice Miller: [Laughs]
I don't know if there was one--

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.920
again one particular moment.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.530
But I've had, you know, some good
friendships that have been there.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:01.050 position:56%
Some of the women that I came into
to Congress with are no longer here.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:04.740
You know even though people think
that we all stay here forever.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:08.430
Actually the truth is there's a lot
more turnover than you'd imagine.

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.870
And some of the women that I've--

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:14.700
that I was good friends
with have left on their own.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.760
Some got beat.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.060
Different things.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.990
But I do think women
have a tendency to again,

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.990
whether we're Democrats
or Republicans.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.880
To talk about our family,
the challenges

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.530
that we're facing at home.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.630
I mean you know we
have this woman's room,

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:34.590
the Lindy Boggs room
off the-- which really.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.000
It was Boehner who finally put

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.080
in the ladies room off
the-- off the house floor.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.820
Not that we need one, okay?

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.560
[laughter] Because--
you're sort of saying,

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.170
"Well where's the bathrooms
over here?

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.600
Well, the men's room is over here.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.770
I mean what-- is it
you're looking for?

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.690
Okay." But anyway [laughs]

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.040
but the Lindy Boggs room is
sort of where the women go.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.070
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: The only room
in the Capitol named for a woman.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.450
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:04.420
And-- gosh sometimes when we're
here at night voting late.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:10.100 position:56%
I can remember one member who was on
the phone obviously very distraught.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.810
And was saying you know-- I don't
know whatever was happening.

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.830
And she said, "You
know I'm so far away."

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.980
And just the anguish
and you know women--

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.370
you know you've got
children, grandchildren.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:23.820
You know your spouses,
your family, whatever.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.930
It is-- and so I think women have
a tendency that-- recognizing that.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:31.460
And want another in
challenges that-- and I'm not--

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.950
believe I'm not whining about it.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.700
I'm just saying that that
you know we do have that.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.820
So it's just a different situation.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.160
&gt;&gt;Rep. Janice Hahn: So when I came
here I really hardly knew anybody.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.090
I had really not spent that much
time coming to Washington DC even

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.480
for lobbying trips
with my City Council.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.180
I really did not spend
that much time here.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.840
So I really didn't know anybody.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.280
Well one of the first people
I wanted to say hello to

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.640
and introduce myself was

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.570
to my Republican colleague,
Ted Poe from Texas.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:04.230
Because Ted and I are
the only 2 alumnae

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.900
from Abilene Christian
University in Abilene, Texas,

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.290
that are members of Congress.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.500
So I you know went
and said hello to Ted.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.470
And we've-- we struck up,
obviously a conversation based

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:20.570
on our shared history
with the university.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.970
And then I asked him to co-chair--

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:27.690
one of the first things that I
did was created a port caucus.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.510
You know based on our
nation's sea ports.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.320
It really had never
been done before.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.620
And I represented the ports
of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:40.480 position:56%
And he of course represented a bunch
of ports in Texas, Houston area.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.010
And I said, "Would you co-chair
this port caucus with me?"

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.100
We now have about 100
members of Congress,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.850
both Republicans and Democrats.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.590
Some of them who don't
even have a port.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:52.890
But they're happy to be in a--

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:56.630
you know, sort of a
collegial bipartisan effort.

00:43:56.630 --> 00:44:02.440
And it was a big thrill 2 years ago
when the American Authority of--

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.340
Association of Port
Authorities named Ted

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.450
and I as joint port
people of the year.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.830
So that was really special.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:14.880
You know, speaking of
the Lindy Boogs room.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:22.280
So every Wednesday morning at
8:00 AM there is a group of women.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:29.890
Diane Black, Marsha Blackburn,
Virginia Fox, Christy [inaudible]

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:33.550
and Susan-- Senator
Susan Collins and myself.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.250
And sometimes my colleague
from California Lois Capps

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:40.890
and we actually have a bible
study in the Lindy Boggs room.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:45.970
And it's you know sometimes
we-- pray and read the bible.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:48.420
But mostly it's talking--

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.720
&gt;&gt;Rep. Candice Miller: Yeah.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.020
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn:
About our experience here.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.990
And having someone who understands
what we're going through.

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:58.890
And we can talk to them when
you can't really-- you know.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.700
Because your constituents don't
really want to hear you whine

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.060
about your experience, right?

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.360
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Right.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.090
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: And-- it's
not appropriate to complain

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.770
about your experience
with your constituents.

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:13.500
But it sure is nice to
have some girlfriends even

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.890
from across the aisle.

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:20.580
That you know we share the same
rhythm, the experience, the timing.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.940
We have the same votes.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:25.210
You know we have the
same schedules basically.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.380
And it helps to talk to them.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.940
So that's been a real
special time for me.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.970
Now when I tell my Democratic
colleagues who is in this.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.660
You know, they can't believe
that I'm you know hanging

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.640
out with the likes of those women.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.940
But I [laughter] really--

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.240
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Well wait

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.560
until they find out
what you did today.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.940
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I
know right [laughter] I got

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.240
to hang out with you.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.810
But I find it--

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.110
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
Don't tell anyone.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.410
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: I know.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:54.800
I find it's something
that I do for myself.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.190
And it helps me get
through my week here.

00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.490
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
You know what?

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.450
I just have to make a comment, an
observation talking about friends

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:02.750
on the other side of the aisle.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.720
Because I see my good friend
Debbie Dingell from Michigan,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.410
who is a freshman member.

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:08.410
But she and I go way back.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.700
She-- grew up actually
in my district.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:14.720
Now she lives further down--
stream, down the Detroit River.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.740
But her and I this week in honor
of Michigan's History month.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.330
Are going to bring in
Rosie the Riveters.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.560
And you know and South
East Michigan was known

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.980
as the arsenal of democracy.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.970 position:56%
And so many of-- during World War II

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.300
and these women literally
built the armaments

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.710
that led the entire world to peace.

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.070
Remarkable women and you hear

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.400
about all these honor flight
coming for World War II.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.700
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: Yeah.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.000
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
And she and I said,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.300
"We need to bring these Rosie's".

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.810
And so the Library of
Congress has been very,

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:48.900
very helpful in putting together--
well we have some great posters.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.500 position:56%
That we got out of the archives here

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.800
that we're going to
give the Rosie's.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:56.330
And you know they're in their late
80's, 90's remarkable stories.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:01.390
But again something that you can do
across the aisle to make an impact

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:05.400
in recognition of unbelievable
ta-- patriots certainly.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.990
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: I
see another question.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:12.690
&gt;&gt; Okay I don't really
have a question.

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:17.470
But I just want to tell you both
how much I admire all the women

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.230
in Congress and in the Senate.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.710
I can say just listening
to you today.

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:23.010
You both have children.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.310
You both have grandchildren.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:29.080
And I'm the wife of Rick Allen,
George XII so I can tell you now.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.790
I like my role as spouse.

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.090
I don't want to be you.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.980 position:56%
But I [laughter] and I say it a lot.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.880
I don't know how you deal with--
I have -- I guilt it on myself.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.520
But I heap that guilt here
with children back home.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.790
And a mother, 94 year old mother
and I don't even have to be here.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:51.880
You know I can go home
when I need to.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.100
But I just admire you all so much.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:58.390 position:56%
I think it's-- incredible and you
both seem to have it-- have it down.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.770 position:56%
So whatever you're doing, I want you

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:03.130
to tell me later how
you do it [laughter].

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.130
Maybe it's because I have
to keep up with my husband

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.430
up here, you think that's it?

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:07.730
That's the hard part?

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.030
&gt;&gt;Rep. Candice Miller:
He's a very busy guy.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:10.330
He's a very busy guy.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.630
&gt;&gt;Rep. Janice Hahn: And
you know that's nice

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:12.930
that you're here too with him.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.590
It's nice to have your
spouse or your family here.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:19.210
I think one of the things that is
particularly difficult for a lot

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.060
of members of congress is
when after a really long day.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.520
You go home and you shut
the door to your apartment.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.820
And you are alone.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.120
You are not with your family.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.420
They are somewhere else.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.930
And see those are the times
that you know your heart kind

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:32.300
of hurts a little bit.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.440 position:56%
That you're not surrounded by hearth
and home and a loving family member.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.300
So we-- it's nice that you--

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:42.580
I put both my spouse pen's in my
hope chest at home [laughter].

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.800
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: We have
time for one more question.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.660
&gt;&gt; About staff, it
feels that there are--

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.630 position:56%
I don't know the numbers but
anecdotally there a lot of women now

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.980
who seem to be in senior staff
positions in the Congress.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.280 position:56%
And I wonder if you could talk a bit

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.210
about what impact you
see that having?

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:03.490
And generally about--
women in staff positions?

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:06.070
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: You know
I don't really know what the

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.090
percentage is of women staff.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:12.570
But there certainly is a lot-- I'm
sure it's a much higher percentage

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.230
of staff than it is actual members.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.720 position:56%
I mean my Chief of Staff is a woman.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.050
My district director is a woman.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:20.350
&gt;&gt; Rep. Janice Hahn: Mine too.

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:21.650
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller:
But you know,

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:25.040
I have a mix gender
wise in both offices.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.790
So-- I mean I've always had--

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:30.790
again, I mean I really do look

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:32.850
at the qualifications
of the individuals.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:34.150
Because guess what?

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:35.450
If they're not doing a good job.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:38.080
You know, you're probably going
to be out of your own job.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.410
And so-- but there are certainly
many, many more women now I think

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:47.130
in particular senior levels.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:51.310
Chiefs of-- on the
committees, staff directors,

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:52.870
all of those kinds of things.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:54.970
And that's a very important
part of it.

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:59.160
I mean staff is the
most critical component

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.600
for any member of congress.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.100
&gt;&gt;Rep. Janice Hahn: Yeah so
my Chief of Staff is a woman.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.650
My scheduler is a woman.

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:08.600
My communications director
is a woman.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.130
My district director is a woman.

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:12.320
Actually at one point
I was very happy

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.700
because back here in
DC we were all women.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:18.360
We finally had an interloper a
guy that we-- [laughter] hired.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.950
And he's there.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:23.710
But I do think there's more
equality and opportunities

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.520
at the staff level on
the hill is my sense.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.320
That there really they're
all equals.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.700
And some of them have some
incredible institutional memory.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:40.890 position:56%
My chief of staff worked for Barbara
Boxer, worked for Jane Harman,

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:43.330 position:56%
did a lot of work in transportation.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:49.900
So she's a real source of
information and knowledge for me.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.750
Particularly coming from you know
Los Angeles and not really being

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:56.670
in Washington DC politics.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:51:01.330 position:56%
So there is a-- I think there's
more equality and more opportunities

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:03.920
at the staff level for women.

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.170
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Well this has
been a tremendous conversation.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:07.680
And would everybody please join me

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.000
in thanking Chairman Miller
and Representative Hahn.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.300
&gt;&gt; Rep. Candice Miller: Thank you.

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.600
Thank you.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you!

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.050
[ Applause ]

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:21.710
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
