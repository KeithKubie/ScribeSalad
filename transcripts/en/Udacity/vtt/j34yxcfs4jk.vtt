00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.870
Here, we have another equation, and it looks like a situation in which we might

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:07.665
want to start out by distributing on either side. However, there's something

00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:11.510
else that we can start out doing, that might actually make things easier for us

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:15.271
in the end. If I want you to start out by doing some operation to both sides of

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:19.113
the equation, what do you think the best choice for that would be? Just fill in

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.957
what step you think we should take first in these two boxes.
