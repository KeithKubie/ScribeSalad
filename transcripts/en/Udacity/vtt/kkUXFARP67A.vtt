As a final review problem for now, we're going to try transforming parabolas.

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:10.182
First, let's begin with our parent equation, y equals x squared. What happens if

we were to move the equation down like this? Now, what would the equation of the

00:00:15.377 --> 00:00:16.021
graph be?
