00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.970
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: I know
that from looking at

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.730
Numberphiles how many of the
viewer comment all the time

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.460
about the brown paper
that you use.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.590
So I thought it'd be appropriate
to introduce the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.880
Brown numbers.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.420
This is short but sweet.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.140
And I think it could be
a challenge for the

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.200
mathematically inclined
Numberphile viewers.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.190
It's really straightforward.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.800
Brown numbers are a pair of
numbers, a pair of integers--

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.950
let's call them m and n.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.110
But they have a very
special property.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080
Their property is
the following--

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.430
that n factorial plus 1
must equal m squared.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.880
Let me just remind you what
a n factorial is.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.360
For example, 5 factorial
is 1 times 2 times 3

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.430
times 4 times 5.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.520
So n factorial is just doing
that up to the integer n.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.820
OK, so that's it.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.620
That defines my Brown number.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.270
It's a pair of integers, m and
n, such that n factorial plus

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.430
1 is m squared.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.840
Let me just show you a couple.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.540
So 5 and 4.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.980
That's my m and n.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.410
Let's just check it.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.600
So 4 factorial--

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.110
n is 4--

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.640
plus 1.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.730
Well that's equal to
24 plus 1, which is

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.420
25, which is 5 squared.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.240
Another one is 11 and 5.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.610
Let me give you another one,
Brady, 'cause, you know.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.290
So 5 factorial plus 1 is equal
to-- what's 5 factorial?

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.890
Well, if is 4 factorial is 24,
5 factorial is 24 times 5,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.640
which is 120.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.470
Plus 1, that's 121.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.880
And that's 11 squared.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.220
OK?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.820
So m is 11, so that's
why that one works.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.630
So let's show you another one.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.500
Another pair is 71
and 7, all right?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.200
And you can go through
the same thing.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.300
If you work out 7 factorial plus
one, that turns out to be

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.930
71 squared.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.949
I've shown you three.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.250
Yeah.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.510
That's it.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.140
BRADY HARAN: That's
all there is?

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.520
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND:
That's all there are.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.980
That's it.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.420
In fact, one of the greatest
mathematicians of the 20th

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.770
century, Paul Erdos, has
actually conjectured that

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.930
there are only three, and that
we won't get any more.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.102
And so the challenge,
I thought, was I

00:02:38.102 --> 00:02:39.266
mean, it's so simple.

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:40.020
Right?

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.370
Just go and try and find some.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.630
BRADY HARAN: So if Paul Erdos
conjectures that there are no

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.820
more, what does that mean?

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.580
He's just said--

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.870
it's not proven?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.230
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: No.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.660
There's no proof of it,
Not that I'm aware of.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.540
He must have some very good
reason for conjecturing it.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.210
And I doubt that it was that
he's literally gone through

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.400
every single integer, although
he worked that hard.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.380
He could well have.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.850
There are great stories
about Erdos.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.160
Quite a character, who for
many, many years, he was

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.200
effectively homeless.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.310
He didn't have a home.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.880
And what he would do is he
would show up at his

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.420
collaborator's house with his
bag of clothes, knock on their

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.443
door, and when they answered it,
say, "is your mind open?"

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:23.400
And that was it.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.740
And they would collaborate with
him on mathematics, and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.600
he would stay with them.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.990
And then he'd move on
to the next person.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.170
BRADY HARAN: I mean, I could
just make a conjecture right

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.645
here and now, and it could be
called Brady Haran Conjecture.

00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:34.520
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: Yeah.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.890
BRADY HARAN: But that's
not really allowed.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.990
What credibility does a
conjecture have to have before

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.470
it's really a conjecture?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.450
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: I think
you have to probably

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.020
demonstrate that it's held in
lots and lots and lots of

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.530
situations where it
might fall down.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.610
And that it's survived all of
the possible obvious tests

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.740
that you can make.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.710
But of course, we can't--

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.250
we can't test this up to an
infinite number of numbers, so

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.730
it would actually need a formal
proof for it to work.
