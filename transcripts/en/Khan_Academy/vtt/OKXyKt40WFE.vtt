00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.800
All right.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.090
Where I left off in the last
presentation I was dropping a

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.990
penny from the top of a
building-- once again, you

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.850
should not do, because you
can kill somebody.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.380
Here's the building, and here's
the bad person who's

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.560
going to drop something.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.480
Let's say they just hold it
out, and the penny drops.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.420
The penny is going to accelerate
at the rate of

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.030
gravity, so it's going to
accelerate downwards at 10

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.070
meters per second squared.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.180
Let's start with an interesting
question.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.730
After after two seconds-- and
lets say they drop it right at

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:53.800
t equals 0-- so after two
seconds how fast is it going?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.435
Time is equal to two seconds--
we could even say this change

00:00:57.435 --> 00:00:59.450
in time, but we're assuming that
we're starting at time

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.970
equals 0, so and change in
time the same thing.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.193
If time is equal to two seconds,
how fast is it going

00:01:05.193 --> 00:01:10.030
to be going after two seconds?

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.240
Let's use that formula.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.610
Velocity is equal to
acceleration-- acceleration is

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.060
the acceleration of gravity,
and that's 10 meters per

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.910
second squared-- so velocity
will be 10 meters per second

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.940
squared times time, which
is times two seconds.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.310
We can multiply the numbers,
and you get 20.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.520
Just like the numbers, you can
treat the units almost like

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.230
variables-- the seconds is the
same thing as this s, so this

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.120
s is going to the numerator, and
then you have an s squared

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.120
in the denominator.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.190
This s will cancel out with one
of the two s's that are

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.600
multiplied down here, so we'll
end up-- actually, let me

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.520
write it down-- it'll be 10
meter seconds per second

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.900
squared, and that's the
same thing as 20.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.430
That cancels out, this makes
that 1, and so that equals 20

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.520
meters per second.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.610
Hopefully, you're starting to
get a little intuition of why

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.290
acceleration's units are meters
per second squared.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.820
After two seconds, we're going
20 meters per second.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.090
Let me ask you a slightly more
difficult problem that might

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.860
have not been obvious to you.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.540
After two seconds, how far
has the penny gone?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.700
This is interesting.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.250
We have this formula here:
distance is equal to velocity

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.410
times time, but the velocity is
changing the entire time.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.640
We know after two seconds that
the velocity is 20 meters per

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.530
second, so we could call this
the final velocity-- we'll

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.340
called v sub f.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.870
That's just a fancy way of
saying final velocity.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.880
Right when we start
at t equals 0,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.480
what was the velocity?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.870
Right when it started, the
initial velocity-- v sub i,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.230
for initial-- is equal to
0 meters per second.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.290
Can we use this formula?

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.390
You might think of a way
to already do it.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.990
Since the acceleration is
constant, and you can only do

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.130
this when the acceleration is
constant-- most of what you'll

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.152
encounter in a first year
physics course, the

00:03:32.152 --> 00:03:34.480
acceleration will be constant,
and especially when you're

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.160
dealing with gravity, the
acceleration will be

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.770
constant-- you can actually take
the average velocity to

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.270
figure out the distance.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.370
So what was the average velocity
over the two seconds?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.550
My final velocity was 20 meters
per second, and my

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.650
initial velocity was 0
meters per second.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.560
Obviously, I went continuously
over those two seconds from 0

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.940
to 20, so my average velocity--
actually, I've

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.620
never seen it done this way
before, but let's just call it

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.910
average velocity-- is equal to
the final velocity plus the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.300
initial velocity divided by 2.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.490
I just took the average of the
initial and the final, which

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:23.830
is 20 plus 0-- which is 20--
divided by 2, which is equal

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.820
to 10 meters per second.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.850
Right when I let go of the rock,
the ball, or the penny,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.780
whatever I'm dropping, the thing
is stationary, and so

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.400
it's 0 meters per second.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.110
After two seconds-- we used this
acceleration formula--

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.840
after two seconds,
it accelerated to

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.290
20 meters per second.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.780
Over the course of those two
seconds, its average velocity

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.340
was 10 meters per second.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.600
We can now use that average
velocity in this

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.680
formula right here.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.620
The average velocity, distance
equals average velocity times

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.530
time-- you can make a mental
footnote, so it's average

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.370
velocity times time when the
velocity is changing and

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.570
acceleration is constant, which
is most of what you'll

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.650
see in most projectile
motion problems.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.180
Now we could say distance is
equal to the average velocity

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:24.590
times time, which equals 10
meters per second times two

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.650
seconds-- once again,
the s's cancel out--

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.070
so we're at 20 meters.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.030
After two seconds, not only is
my velocity 20 meters per

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.110
second down-- once again, if I
said speed, it would just be

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:43.930
20 meters per second-- but my
distance is the ball, or the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.270
rock, assuming no
air resistance,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.900
has dropped 20 meters.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.020
Hopefully, that makes a little
bit of intuition for you.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.760
If you are taking physics--
which you don't have to view

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.110
these videos, that's the idea--
I wanted to show you

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.300
that this is actually exactly
like one of the formulas that

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.860
you'll see in your
physics class.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.605
It's kind of a shame, but people
tend to just memorize

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:15.040
it in physics without-- when
they're learning projectile

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.330
motion without really
appreciating that it just

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.900
comes from distance is equal
to velocity times time.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.900
Before, I said velocity
is equal to

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.340
acceleration times to time.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.440
Let me just expand that a little
bit, because I assume

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.420
that my initial velocity is 0.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.270
Let me just say that the final
velocity is equal to the

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.870
initial velocity, because you
could already be going 10

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.360
meters per second, and then
you're going to accelerate.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.150
Final velocity is equal to the
initial velocity-- this is an

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.110
i-- plus acceleration
times time.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.650
We said that the distance-- we
could rewrite this as the

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.360
distance is equal to the average
velocity times time.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.915
I just realized how funny
that character looks.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.840
So, the final velocity is equal
to the initial velocity

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.090
plus acceleration times time,
and the distance is equal to

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.910
the average velocity
times time.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.820
Let's see if we can use these
two formulas, which we

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.810
essentially just applied in
the previous example-- we

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.300
didn't do it exactly so
formally-- to come up with a

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.130
formula for distance, given
acceleration and time.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:37.230
We know that the average
velocity-- oh, I switched

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:43.210
colors-- the average velocity is
equal to the final velocity

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.180
plus the initial velocity
divided by 2.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.880
What is the final velocity?

00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.650
The final velocity is equal to
this: substitute, and so the

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:09.200
initial velocity plus
acceleration times time plus

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.470
the initial velocity-- my i's
are getting blurred, they're

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.590
not showing up-- these are all
i's for initial velocity.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.730
They look like a 2, but I
think you get the idea--

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.000
that's all initial velocity.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.300
All of that is over 2.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.910
The average velocity is equal
to the initial velocity plus

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.115
acceleration times time, plus
the initial velocity, all of

00:08:29.115 --> 00:08:30.710
that divided by 2.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:37.429
That just equals 2 times initial
velocity-- that looks

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:41.929
like an i now-- plus
acceleration times time

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.740
divided by 2, and that equals
the initial velocity plus

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.410
acceleration times time
divided by 2.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.720
This might be intuitive for you,
as well, that the average

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.590
velocity is equal to your
initial velocity plus-- this

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:04.240
is essentially the difference
between how much you're

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.430
accelerating over that time and
speed is going to be that

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.780
divided by 2, because we're
taking the average.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.570
If what I just said confused
you, don't worry about it; you

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.400
could just backtrack into
what we said before.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.940
Think about a lot of these
formulas yourself, and plug in

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.900
numbers, and I think it'll
start to make more sense.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.520
We figured out that the average
velocity is equal to

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.670
the initial velocity plus
acceleration times time.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.430
We can just substitute
that back into

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.280
this original equation.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.620
Once again, I realized I'm
running out of time, so I'll

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.420
see you shortly.
