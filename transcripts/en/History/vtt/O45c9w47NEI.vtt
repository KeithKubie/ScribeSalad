00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.170
NARRATOR: New York City, 1922.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.040
Two Columbia University
sociologists--

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.960
William Ogburn and
Dorothy Thomas--

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.380
publish a paper in the
"Academy of Political

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.580
Science Journal" entitled,
"Are Inventions Inevitable?"

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.920
In it, they cite 148 instances
of simultaneous inventions

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.000
where two or more individuals--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.170
each operating without
knowledge of the other's work--

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.250
came up with the same
groundbreaking innovation

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.420
or theory at the same time.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.380

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.250
JOHN BRANDENBURG: How is it that
people in different continents,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.040
different cultures can come up
with the same idea at almost

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.080
exactly the same time?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.420
And it's seen
throughout history.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.830
GRAHAM PHILLIPS:
Albert Einstein says

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.170
that he came up with
the idea for relativity

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.830
in a few moments.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.120
It suddenly came into his mind.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.460
JOHN BRANDENBURG: Einstein's
discovery of relativity was

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.710
preceded almost simultaneously
by a theoretical physicist,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080
a Frenchman named Poincar .

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.750
DAVID CHILDRESS: You
have the radio being

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.120
developed by both Nikola
Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120
at the same time.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.040
You have the
telephone also being

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.290
developed at the same time.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.250
There's many incidences
in history like this.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.750
[music playing]

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.040
NARRATOR: During World
War II, British engineer

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.170
Sir Frank Whittle, and
a German physicist--

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.290
Hans Von Ohain-- both
invented the first jet engine.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.000
The designs were
strikingly similar.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.620
And because they were serving
on different sides of the war,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.120
neither had any knowledge
of the other's work.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.790
There have been discoveries that
have shown up around the planet

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.290
at the exact same time.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.960
People that aren't
connected, people that have

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.670
no influence upon each other.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.420
And those are the things that
start to emerge simultaneously

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.750
around the planet.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.920
GRAY SCOTT: Here's
the interesting thing,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.670
this goes back to
the idea that we

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.750
find information
in the substrate

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.460
of the physical world.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.000
It may just be that
every single discovery

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.040
that we ever wanted to
discover is already in the room

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.380
right now.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.380
It isn't that the
information is not there.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.880
It's that our brains
are not evolved

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.330
yet to see the information.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.620
Now, not everybody is
on the same wavelength.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.880
Not everybody is evolved
at the same rate.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.710
That's also true.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.710
So there are people
throughout history that

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.380
could access that information.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.380
DAVID WILCOCK: This
effect has been documented

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.380
all the way back to the
time of the Renaissance

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.670
and the Reformation, things like
the discovery of the telescope,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.380
the identification of the
colors in the rainbow,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.380
the identification
of basic chemistry,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.380
the Theory of Evolution.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.210
Scientists try to explain.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.420
And they think people have a
certain level of technology

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.170
at a certain time, and they
have the tools in front of them

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.330
to be able to make
breakthroughs.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.250
That doesn't explain
why it happens

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.750
so precisely that in many cases,
it is literally simultaneous.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.040
We have to look
at the possibility

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.000
that extraterrestrials
could be introducing ideas

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.920
into this information field.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.250
Sort of as if something has
been uploaded into the cloud.
