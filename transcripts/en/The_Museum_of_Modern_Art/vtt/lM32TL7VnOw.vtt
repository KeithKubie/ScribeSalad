00:00:04.726 --> 00:00:06.225
- It's a work that is very much about

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.701
entering into an immersive environment.

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:14.399
We try to make each
installation very unique

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.974
to the actual space it's installed.

00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:19.174
In the mountain atrium, it's that

00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:21.920
you're able to work with the verticallity

00:00:22.827 --> 00:00:24.927
for the first time of the work.

00:00:24.927 --> 00:00:27.396
Using nine screens where you're able

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:30.055
to sort of move between screens,

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:32.495
or view them from different angles.

00:00:33.218 --> 00:00:35.392
We'll try to encapsulate
this idea of movement

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:38.100
within the work, but also
how you view the work.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.132
What inspiration for Ten Thousand Waves

00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:42.899
begins in more conveying.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.217
In 2004, when 23 chinese
cocal shell pickers

00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:50.402
from the Fujian province from China

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:53.796
died when they were trying
to pick for cocal shells

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:56.207
in the north of England, I felt very

00:00:56.207 --> 00:00:58.276
moved by the tragedy because they had come

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.979
from such a far distance to meet

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.929
this kind of horrid end, and I thought

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.206
it would be very interesting to try to

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.322
view this tragedy not from the current

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:07.835
European point of view,

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:10.263
but (mumbling) from a
Chinese point of view.

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:11.830
And it took us about three years

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.185
to discover the Mazu fables.

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:18.487
Mazu is the sea goddess
from the Fujian province

00:01:18.487 --> 00:01:21.690
where the Chinese cocal shell
pickers originated from.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.417
And one of the things that I thought

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.398
that would be very interesting,
so try to view this

00:01:25.398 --> 00:01:29.446
from Mazu's point of view, and in bringing

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:33.191
the lost souls back to China, so to speak,

00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:36.683
through Mazu's journey, which spans over,

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:39.903
I would say, 400 years of Chinese history,

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:44.105
begins in modern day, then
we go to 30s Shanghai,

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:46.571
and then we end up in the Ming period

00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:48.498
in 15th century China.

00:01:48.498 --> 00:01:51.952
We shot in the Guangji province in China.

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:54.292
Of course, having Maggie Cheung play Mazu

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:58.413
was sort of very important,
and one of the things,

00:01:58.413 --> 00:02:01.219
I think, in relationship
to making it work,

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.251
was the idea of trying to
use (mumbling) devices,

00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:07.266
ways of trying to alert the audience

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.931
that they're watching a film.

00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:11.280
For example, in the green screen section,

00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:14.501
when you foreground it, it
doesn't necessarily take away

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:18.344
let's say, the magic of those scenes,

00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:21.216
in the same way that there's labor into

00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:23.833
people picking cocal shells

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:26.271
or there's labor into making images,

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.395
and you can't make images
without that labor.

00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:35.420
One of the important collaborations

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.715
was working with different composers.

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:43.348
Jah Wobble has a band called
the Chinese Dub Orchestra,

00:02:43.994 --> 00:02:47.841
so that's this marriage between
east and west in his work.

00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:50.674
And then, of course, there's
the work that was done

00:02:50.674 --> 00:02:55.674
by the sound designer, Mukul
Patel, and also Adam Finch

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:01.573
who is the multiple screen
editor for my works.

00:03:02.188 --> 00:03:05.526
And then the 9.2 surround sound dubbing

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:08.036
that we made for the work was very unique.

00:03:08.036 --> 00:03:10.764
We're trying to make a
piece of work that would

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:13.821
have sound become more
sculptural in the space,

00:03:13.821 --> 00:03:17.606
also become foregrounded
as well as the image.

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:20.380
And, in a way, when you
make a multiple screen work,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.998
you're able to make
those kind of decisions

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:26.914
in a much more, sort of, creative manner.

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:29.398
There are all of these
sort of aesthetic quests

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:33.069
that we wanted to sort of
pursue and make in the work

00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:36.812
to make it a unique experience.
