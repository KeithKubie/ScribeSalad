 This episode is sponsored by hims 

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:05.760
 Your body is stunning, but have you ever wondered 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.500
 About its value? Let's start selling your body 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.375
 Piece with a piece. Sperm? You can get $ 35 

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.465
 To $ 135 for a single donation, there are banks that pay to donors 

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:17.515
 $ 1500 for a binding contract for a full year, 

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:20.295
 The criteria are to be healthy, long, young and educated. 

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.355
 The egg's price is much more expensive 

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.915
 Up to $ 10,000 is due 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.000
 It has an operation spanning 20 minutes 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.700
 For eggs, you may be at risk of infection or endometriosis. 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.660
 The protein-rich part of your blood 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 Known as "plasma" and is worth $ 50 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.740
 But some older rich people may pay 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.960
 $ 8,000 per session until they are injected with young blood. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.740
 Although the evidence is still under study 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.720
 With regard to "Fountain of Youth" or "Young Blood" 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.440
 From Stanford University research where older mice were injected 

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.335
 Plasma placenta of a newborn human placenta 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.220
 Human children have developed the performance of older mice 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.980
 In the tests of the memory, no wonder! 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.880
 The price of organ transplantation may be expensive 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.535
 With 116,000 Americans waiting 

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:09.295
 Agriculture Member. The cost of kidney transplant is more than $ 400,000 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.440
 While the price of the heart is $ 1.4 million. 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
 This is the price of organ transplants 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.540
 Not how much you will earn by selling your organs. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.920
 Although it is illegal in the United States and most countries 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.000
 The black market exists. According to reports from the World Health Organization 

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.775
 The total cost of college in India may be $ 20,000 

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:29.815
 Up in China to $ 40,000; 

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:32.985
 But in Israel you may get $ 160,000 

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:36.015
 Do not seem interesting to you? 

00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:38.715
 Try selling your hair! 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.645
 The price of a wig made from real hair ranges from $ 800 to $ 3,000. 

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:44.660
 It is clear that the price of some members is high 

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:47.200
 But some people have put a price on their members. 

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:49.705
 Sources say Rianna's leg was secured 

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:52.595
 Million dollars, but not comparable to the legs of Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.580
 Which was insured with 144 million dollars. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.600
 Then there are the functions offered by your body. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.000
 Now you breathe, you siphon 11,000 liters a day 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.820
 This means that you can blow up 275 tires. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.940
 Your thirst is 4.5 m / s 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.075
 Enough wind is needed to turn on small wind turbines. 

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:15.735
 Your power is more powerful with up to 22.4 m / s 

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:18.845
 Capable of operating the air grinder unit. 

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:21.885
 Your fart? If your diet is rich in legumes 

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:25.260
 You can produce 68 ml of carbon dioxide a day. 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.760
 If stored (we will not ask you why) 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.540
 But if you do, within 40 years 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.855
 You will have tons of carbon dioxide. 

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:36.975
 This is a huge gas quantity, but its price will be $ 220. 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.935
 At the same time, your brain can store 100 terabytes of information 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.105
 Hard disk space 

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:45.340
 Valued at $ 2,500. 

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.565
 There are components for you 

00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:51.605
 Although you often consist of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen 

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.705
 There is evidence that there are elements that contribute to your composition 

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:57.895
 Such as copper, gold and even uranium. 

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:00.935
 However, if you add all of these items, your items may be worth the value 

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:03.095
 Close to the dollar. 

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:06.475

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.580
 Such as sexual health, hair loss or acne. 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.620
 But 26% of men with erectile dysfunction 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.700
 They are under the age of forty. 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.960

 They have good price deals on great medical products 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.920
 Because they are relying on the generic product rather than the brand name. 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.720
 They use personal recommendations 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.560
