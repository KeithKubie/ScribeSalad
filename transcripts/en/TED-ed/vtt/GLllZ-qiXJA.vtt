00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:13.469
In 1845, Ireland's vast potato fields
were struck by an invasive fungal disease

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.278
that rapidly infested this staple crop.

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:19.261
The effect was devastating.

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.619
One million people died of famine,

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.830
and over a million more were forced
to leave Ireland.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.871
Nowadays, we avoid such agricultural
catastrophes with the help of pesticides.

00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.640
Those are a range of manmade chemicals
that control insects,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.219
unwanted weeds,

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:38.300
funguses,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.072
rodents,

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.200
and bacteria

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.270
that may threaten our food supply.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.749
They've become an essential part
of our food system.

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:49.090
As populations have grown,
monoculture, single crop farming,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.710
has helped us feed people efficiently.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.036
But it's also left our food
vulnerable to extensive attack by pests.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:00.671
In turn, we've become more dependent
on pesticides.

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:06.500
Today, we annually shower over 5 billion
pounds of pesticides across the Earth

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.195
to control these unwanted visitors.

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:12.071
The battle against pests,
especially insects,

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.031
has marked agriculture's long history.

00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:16.911
Records from thousands of years ago

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:21.354
suggest that humans actively burned
some of their crops after harvest

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:23.805
to rid them of pests.

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:29.122
There's even evidence from ancient times
that we recruited other insects to help.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:34.621
In 300 A.D., Chinese farmers specially
bred ferocious predatory ants

00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:39.296
in orange orchards
to protect the trees from other bugs.

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:41.172
Later, as large-scale farming spread,

00:01:41.172 --> 00:01:47.131
we began sprinkling arsenic, lead,
and copper treatments on crops.

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:51.010
But these were incredibly toxic
to humans as well.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.371
As our demand for more, 
safer produce increased,

00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:56.982
so did the need for effective chemicals

00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:00.223
that could control pests
on a grander scale.

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:04.633
This ushered in the era 
of chemical pesticides.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:08.902
In 1948, a Swiss chemist named
Paul Hermann MÃ¼ller

00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:12.001
was awarded a Nobel Prize 
for his discovery

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:18.442
of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,
also known as DDT.

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:23.262
This new molecule had unparalleled power
to control many insect species

00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:28.213
until the 1950s,
when insects became resistant to it.

00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:33.552
Worse, the chemical actually drove
dramatic declines in bird populations,

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:35.373
poisoned water sources,

00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:40.572
and was eventually found to cause
long-term health problems in humans.

00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:44.993
By 1972, DDT had been banned
in the United States,

00:02:44.993 --> 00:02:48.943
and yet traces still linger
in the environment today.

00:02:48.943 --> 00:02:52.453
Since then, chemists have been searching
for alternatives.

00:02:52.453 --> 00:02:56.494
With each new wave of inventions,
they've encountered the same obstacle -

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:58.744
rapid species evolution.

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:01.334
As pesticides destroy pest populations,

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:05.723
they leave behind 
only the most resistant individuals.

00:03:05.723 --> 00:03:08.824
They then pass on their 
pesticide-resisting genes

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:10.638
to the next generation.

00:03:10.638 --> 00:03:13.193
That's lead to the rise of super bugs,

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.614
such as the Colorado potato beetle,

00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:19.385
which is resistant to over 
50 different insecticides.

00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:23.834
Another downside is that other bugs
get caught in the crossfire.

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:29.454
Some of these are helpful predators
of plant pests or vital pollinators,

00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:34.304
so erasing them from agriculture
wipes out their benefits, too.

00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:36.345
Pesticides have improved over time

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.323
and are currently regulated by strict
safety standards,

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:42.905
but they still have the potential
to pollute soil and water,

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:44.314
impact wildlife,

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:46.185
and even harm us.

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:50.735
So considering all these risks,
why do we continue using pesticides?

00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:52.145
Although they're imperfect,

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:57.165
they currently may be our best bet
against major agricultural disasters,

00:03:57.165 --> 00:03:59.956
not to mention mosquito-born diseases.

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:04.836
Today, scientists are on a quest for
alternative pest control strategies

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:06.976
that balance the demands
of food production

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:09.395
with environmental concerns.

00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:12.835
Nature has become a major source
of inspiration,

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:17.125
from natural plant and fungal chemicals
that can repel or attract insects,

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.925
to recruiting other insects 
as crop bodyguards.

00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:24.876
We're also turning to high-tech solutions,
like drones.

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:26.926
Programmed to fly over crops,

00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:29.757
these machines can use 
their sensors and GPS

00:04:29.757 --> 00:04:32.446
to carry out more targeted sprays

00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:36.297
that limit a pesticide's wider 
environmental impact.

00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:38.826
With a combination 
of biological understanding,

00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:40.456
environmental awareness,

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:42.376
and improved technologies,

00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:46.627
we have a better chance of finding
a holistic solution to pests.

00:04:46.627 --> 00:04:50.617
Chemical pesticides may never shake
their controversial reputation,

00:04:50.617 --> 00:04:51.957
but with their help,

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:54.857
we can ensure that 
agricultural catastrophes

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:56.918
stay firmly in our past.
