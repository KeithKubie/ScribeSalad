00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
[Captions by Y Translator]
In today's video,
we're going to try to make a lid

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.800
for our vacuum chamber that
lets us use our arc welder in a vacuum.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.800
What will happen to the sparks?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.000
What will happen if we
melt something in the vacuum?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.440
[Music]

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.400
What's up, guys? Josh here.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
If you didn't already know,
we've got brand new merch for sale.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
We've got two different
long sleeve shirts,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a new short sleeve shirt,
and for the first time ever,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I think, a phone case.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
If you want to check out
this awesome stuff,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.280
click the link
in the description below,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.300
and while you're at it,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.300
comment below and tell me
what your favorite is,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.200
and what you'd like to see in the future,
and maybe we can make that happen.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.800
Guys, we've done
some cool experiments

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.500
using a vacuum chamber,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.700
and we have also done
some pretty cool experiments

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.900
using our arc furnace.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.600
That runs a ton of electricity
through these carbon rods,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.000
and lets us melt metal.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.200
Well today, we want to see

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.400
if we can combine those
by making a lid that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.000
will allow us to use
our carbon rods down

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.980
inside the vacuum chamber,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.000
and then we'll see what happens
if we try and melt something

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.100
in the vacuum chamber,
assuming we can get it to work.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.700
What's going to be
the difference

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.300
when there's no air
around our carbon rods?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.182
What's going to be
the difference between the arc?

00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:14.500
How are things going to react,
or melt differently when they're

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.260
in a low pressure environment?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.940
That's what we hope to find out.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.560
The idea is pretty simple.

00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:23.200
We'll make a new acrylic lid,
but we'll add two holes that

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.432
allow our carbon rods
to go inside.

00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:27.500
We'll seal those up
with some Proto putty,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500
and see what happens
if we make an art

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.162
inside our vacuum chamber.

00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:34.100
To get started,
we've got our vacuum chamber,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.800
and we've got
this same thick pieces

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.200
of acrylic that
our original vacuum chamber lid

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.600
was cut from.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.820
We're going to cut another one
about the same size,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.100
drill it the same way
we did for this valve,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.880
and then we're going
to add a couple more holes

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.800
that will let us put
our carbon rods down

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.802
through the lid
into the vacuum chamber.

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:53.200
We'll try and create
some Proto putty seals

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.000
that fill those holes,
but hold on to the carbon rod.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.200
So we keep the vacuum
as we use the arc furnace

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200
down inside.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.700
Hopefully, the Proto putty

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.300
will be flexible enough
that were also able to move

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.800
our rods where we want them,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360
and have a little bit of control
over what's happening.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:03:14.080
[Music]

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.600
We've got our whole cut and tapped,
so we should be able to thread

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600
right into it.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.500
We're not going to permanently
attach this yet.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.100
We're still going
to add some thread tape,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.962
and wait until we've drilled
the rest of our holes.

00:03:23.962 --> 00:03:56.520
[Music]

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.600
That is on there.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.500
We should now able to get
our carbon rods down

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.500
inside there.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.000
We're gonna use
Proto putty to sort

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.300
of plug up the two holes where
the rods are going down in.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.300
But Proto putty is
a flexible rubber,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.000
so I should still
have the ability

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.680
to move them a little bit.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.400
Hopefully, I'll be able
to keep the vacuum seal

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.442
while that happens.

00:04:14.442 --> 00:05:22.280
[Music]

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.800
All right, we've got
Proto putty all the way

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.100
around our carbon rods.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.500
Let's let that cure.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.940
[Music]

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.200
All right, at this point, we
should have everything set up.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.100
We're going to give
it a quick test

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.100
without pulling a vacuum first,
just to make sure that these

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.660
are arcing down inside our jar.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.600
Let's give this a shot.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.500
I'm going to say that works.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.962
We got our arc down
inside the jar.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.740
Let's try pulling out all the air,
and see what happens.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.800
[Music]

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.520
Good.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.080
We are getting a seal.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.440
What the fog?

00:06:07.022 --> 00:06:08.200
That will get pulled
out in a sec.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.800
Okay, now, I'm just going
to try turning it on

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.692
from a distance.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:26.640
[Music]

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.440
Oh.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.820
[Music]

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.420
I see smoke.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.940
I think that already began
burning the Proto putty,

00:06:33.942 --> 00:06:35.500
but you know what
was interesting is

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.240
the arc didn't really do much.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.000
Like I thought, in theory,

00:06:40.012 --> 00:06:43.800
the arc should be able to extend
a lot larger in this situation,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.920
but it didn't hold at all.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.900
Let that run
for a minute to pull more,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.042
more intense vacuum if it will.

00:06:50.042 --> 00:07:02.300
[Music]

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.180
That's a lot of smoking.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.300
The arc in a vacuum
didn't really do too much.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.800
So I decided I wanted
to try something else.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.500
I've poured some liquid nitrogen
into this soda bottle,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.460
and I've got a balloon
over the nozzle.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.900
So as the nitrogen expands
its just filling this balloon.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.500
So what I should have is
a balloon full of pretty

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.902
much pure nitrogen,

00:07:22.392 --> 00:07:23.600
and I'm going
to see what happens

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.000
if I take this balloon,
stretch it over the air intake,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.300
and then let it back in.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.872
That should fill our vacuum
chamber with pure nitrogen.

00:07:31.872 --> 00:07:34.400
I'm not going to let it go
all the way to empty,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.700
because I do still
want there to be

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.372
suction holding the lid on.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:45.420
[Music]

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.820
All right, almost
pure nitrogen atmosphere.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:08:04.640
[Music]

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.040
Oh, there's our smoke point.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:18.820
[Music]

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.320
Arc furnace in a vacuum chamber.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.200
It may need some tweaking
before we can really do

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.060
too much with it.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.100
The Proto putty does
a really good job of giving

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.600
us a little bit of flexibility.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.780
So we have control while
maintaining a vacuum inside.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.200
But it does tend
to burn pretty quickly.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.000
So we may look into
whether there are

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.100
any higher temperature rubber
gaskets we can sort of form

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.080
onto there,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.900
It's possible
that with something higher temp,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.952
we might be able to have
longer times where it runs,

00:08:46.242 --> 00:08:47.900
and maybe even melt
something down inside.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.000
At this point,
anything that would melt

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.100
would have to run so long
that it would start burning

00:08:52.112 --> 00:08:52.792
the proto putty.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.300
Proto putty does light on fire
if it gets hot enough.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.712
I don't want to just
burn the proto putty and

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.400
then catching the acrylic on fire,
and then the whole studio would burn up.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.180
No one wants that.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.100
It's also possible
that we would have

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.300
a different result
if we had a more perfect vacuum.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.800
This vacuum chamber
does not pull a perfect vacuum,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.000
and whatever is left inside,
maybe able to interfere

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.600
with how our Arc is forming.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.600
What do you think?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.400
Are there other ideas
you think we should try

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.600
with our arc furnace?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.200
Are there other tools you
think we should try and set up,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.300
so that they can be manipulated
while inside a vacuum?

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.500
I think that drilling
holes into the top

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.400
and making a rubber
or Proto putty seal

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.562
does work fairly well.

00:09:29.562 --> 00:09:31.200
It was still holding a vacuum,
and I was able

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.460
to move these around.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.600
So I might be able
to get some other tools

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.200
or something down inside
to be able to move stuff

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.800
while under low pressure.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.492
What would you
like to see us do?

00:09:42.002 --> 00:09:43.100
Guys, the fun doesn't end here.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.000
We've got more for you to see.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.400
The box at the top
will take you directly

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.200
to our last video.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200
You should go check that out.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.100
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.460
you should be watching next.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.400
And if you hit this bomb
in the middle,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.800
you will be subscribed
to our channel.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.200
That way,
you never miss out on a video.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.900
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.600
Talk to you then.
