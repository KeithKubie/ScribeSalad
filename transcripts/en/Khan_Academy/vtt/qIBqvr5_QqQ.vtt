00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.760
- [Instructor] In this video,
I will attempt to prove,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.310
or actually this and
the next several videos,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.570
attempt to prove a special
case version of Stokes' theorem

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.520
or essentially Stokes'
theorem for a special case.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.900
And I'm doing this because the proof

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.890
will be a little bit simpler,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.870
but at the same time
it's pretty convincing.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.920
And the special case we're
going to assume is that

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.690
the surface we're dealing
with is a function of x and y.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.400
So if you give me any particular x and y,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.500
it only determines one
point on that surface.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.440
So a surface like this would be the case.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.620
So it's kind of a mapping of
this region in the xy-plane

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.060
into three dimensions.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.430
So for any xy, we can
figure out the height.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.170
So essentially z is going
to be a function of x and y,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.450
and we can get a point on the surface.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.480
So this proof would not apply to a surface

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.850
that's like a sphere
or something like that,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.730
where any point on the xy-plane would,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.110
could actually determine
two points on our surface,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.540
but this is a pretty good start.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.680
The other thing that
we're going to assume,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.500
we're going to assume that z,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.100
which is essentially
a function of x and y,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.650
that this function of x and y is,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.960
has continuous second-order derivatives,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.040
so continuous,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.290
continuous second,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.900
second derivatives.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.040
And the reason why I'm
gonna make that assumption

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160
is it's going to help us
in our proof later on.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.220
It's going to allow us to say

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.440
that the partial of our surface

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.050
or the partial of z with respect to x,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.720
and then taking the derivative
of that with respect to y,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.100
is going to be the same

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.400
as the partial of z with respect to y

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.240
and then taking the derivative
of that with respect to x.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.120
And in order to be able
to make this statement,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.980
we have to assume that z or our,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.710
the z right over here, z
is a function of x and y,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.380
has continuous second-order derivatives.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.930
And over here, we've just
written our vector field F

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.100
that we're going to deal
with when we're trying to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.330
play with Stokes'
theorem, and we'll assume

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.610
that it has continuous
first-order derivatives.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.470
Now with that out of the way,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.790
let's think about what
Stokes' theorem tells us.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.070
And then we'll think about,
for this particular case,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.720
how we can write it out, and
then hopefully we will see

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.660
that the two things are equal.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.970
So let me write it out.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.163
So Stokes' theorem tells us that if,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.453
that F,

00:02:07.453 --> 00:02:09.030
F dot dr

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.070
over some path,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.480
and the path that we care about

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.330
is essentially this path right over here.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.630
I'll do it in blue.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.290
It's this path right over here.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.820
This is the boundary.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.570
This is the boundary of our surface.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.120
So this is c right over here.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.180
Stokes' theorem tells us that
this should be the same thing,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.030
this should be equivalent
to the surface integral

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.890
over our surface,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.430
over our surface of curl of F,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.150
curl of F

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.320
dot ds,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.230
dot, dotted with the surface itself.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.020
And so in this video, I wanna focus,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.420
or probably this and the next video,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.060
I wanna focus on the second half.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.130
I wanna focus this.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.760
I wanna see how we can express this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.250
given the assumptions we've made.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.980
And then after that, we're gonna see

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.000
how we can express this
given the same assumptions.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And then hopefully we'll
find that we get them

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.160
to be equal to each other.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.640
So let's just start figuring out

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.970
what the curl of F is equal to.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.890
So the curl of F,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.680
the curl of F

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.730
is equal to,

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.840
you could view it as the del operator

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.970
crossed with our vector
field F, which is equal to,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.790
can write our components.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.570
So i, I'll do 'em in
different colors, i, j,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.230
and k components,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.260
i, j, and k components,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.380
and then I need to write my del operator

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.780
or my partial operators I
guess I should call 'em.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.330
So the partial with respect to x,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.840
the partial with respect to y,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.940
partial with respect to z,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.955
and then I have to write
i, j, and k components

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:49.750
of my vector field F.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.490
And I will do that in green,
well, I'll do it in blue.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.610
And so we have P, which
is a function of x, y, z,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.890
Q, which is a function of x, y, and z,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.230
and then R, which is a
function of x, y, and z.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.900
And so this is going to evaluate as,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.320
it's going to be i,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.930
i times,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.140
so blank out that column, that row.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.310
It's gonna be the partial
of R with respect to y,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.560
partial of R with respect to y

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.520
minus the partial of Q with respect to z,

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.200
minus the partial of Q with respect to z.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.960
And then checkerboard pattern minus j,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.570
gonna make that hat a little bit better,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.570
minus j and then times the
partial of R with respect to x,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920
partial of R with respect to x

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.760
minus the partial of P with respect to z,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.480
minus the partial of P with respect to z.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.210
And then finally, plus k,

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.380
plus k, and that's going to be
times the partial of x with,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.210
or, sorry, the partial
of Q with respect to x,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.490
partial of Q with respect to x

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.910
minus the partial of P with respect to y,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.910
minus the partial of P with respect to y.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.270
So we figured out the curl of
F, and I'll leave you there.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.110
I'm trying to make shorter videos now.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.060
And so in the next video,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.240
we have to figure out how to express ds,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.150
and then we'll just evaluate
this, this entire operation.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.763
We'll take the dot product.
