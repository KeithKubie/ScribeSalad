00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.141
So now we've got the full spectrum here. We can create objects, move them, and

00:00:03.141 --> 00:00:05.601
see them sliding around in the world, which is great, because now, we can

00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:09.726
actually throw missiles from one robot at another. The final missing piece,

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:13.030
however, to our grand scheme of world domination, is what to do once the

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.103
missile hits the other robot. Now, in our current set up, we receive no

00:00:17.103 --> 00:00:20.396
information that a collision has occurred. But we only get back the positions

00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:24.430
of the objects that the physics engine has adjusted. But fret not my children,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.138
there is a solution. We're going to need to jump around between a few different

00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:31.082
files and concepts, but once we're done you'll be able to allow each entity to

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:36.186
respond to a collision independent of other entities. Now the start of this

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.956
nice aside is a Box 2D function that allows us to define an onCollison callback

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:44.880
that when called is given two physics bodies that are touching.
