00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.760
As a general rule
of thumb, JavaScript

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.849
is not allowed to access
the data of any other origin

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:06.639
than its own.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.849
An origin is made
up of three parts--

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.759
the data scheme, the
host name, and the port.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.000
For the page you're on right
now, the scheme is HTTPS,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.609
the host name is
www.udacity.com,

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.759
and the port is 443.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.950
If you change any
of these parts,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.309
you are on a different origin
and different rules will apply.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:27.989
Apart from the mixed
content problems

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.329
we talked about earlier,
this is another reason

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.509
to not mix HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:37.269
But what are these rules that
apply once you are working

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.190
across multiple origins?

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.530
First of all, you can't
make fetch requests

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.329
to other origins.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.759
Actually, under certain
criteria you can,

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.129
but then you can't
read the answer.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
Secondly, you cannot inspect
IFrames or windows with

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.600
JavaScript if they are
from another origin.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.149
These rules make a lot of
sense if you think about it.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.489
Let's assume I was allowed
to make fetch requests

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.960
to other origins.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.550
I could just set
up a website that

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:05.128
makes fetch requests to
facebook.com and steal

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.780
all your Facebook messages.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.659
Or even worse, I could make
fetch requests to udacity.com

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.259
and make you drop out of
all of your Udacity classes.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.030
No, we don't want that.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.400
This restriction, or rule, is
called the same-origin policy.
