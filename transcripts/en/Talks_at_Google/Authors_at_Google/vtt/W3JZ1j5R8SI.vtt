00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.180
MALE SPEAKER:
--introduce Bjorn Lomborg

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.670
now a long
conversation about how

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.920
to make the world
a better place.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.246
Most of you may know
Mr. Lomborg's work

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:13.120
through with the "Skeptical
Environmentalist"

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.650
book that he put out, 2001,
2002, so some years ago.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.900
Obviously quite
controversial at the time

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.590
and probably to date,
with a focus on climate

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.649
change and how best to address
the problems of climate change.

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.940
And arguing, to some degree,
that climate change per se

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.023
wasn't necessarily the
largest environmental issue

00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:32.870
that we faced.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.860
He's continued to work in the
spirit of using economic tools

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.190
to try and address questions,
both environmental change

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.909
and developmental challenges
that we face around the world.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.450
And is currently
working on a project

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.150
to figure out how
the world should best

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.040
spend the next $75
billion dollars that we

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.120
may be investing in the
cause of global development,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.810
working with the United Nations
and countries around the world.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.226
We were talking a little bit
around the margins about some

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.580
of the challenges in
getting into that process.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.100
But I'm delighted to
have him here for what

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.280
I'm sure will be a provocative
and informative discussion.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.705
So with that, Bjorn.

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:12.940
BJORN LOMBORG:
Thank you very much.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.644
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:15.500
Thank you.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.170
It's great to be here.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.580
And I would love to talk a
little bit about how we're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.490
going to think about
prioritizing big issues.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.410
So as you mentioned,
I've worked a lot

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.450
within the environmental area.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.950
But quite frankly, what we're
doing with the Copenhagen

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.770
Consensus is a broader thing.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.000
It's essentially to
talk about how do you

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.780
spend money to do the most good?

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.980
Where do you get the
biggest bang for your buck?

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.300
So we actually wrote
a book late last year,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.140
called "How to Spend $75 Billion
to Make the World a Better

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.700
Place."

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.075
If you want a copy, I'm sorry,
I just flew in from China.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.660
So I'm not carrying
a lot of copies.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.420
But if you want one,
send an email to Pam

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.150
and we'll send
you a PDF version.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.900
People said I should
have written the book

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.006
"How to make $75
Billion," but that's

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:02.380
a totally different
sort of book.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.460
But this is essentially the kind
of-- if you were Bill Gates.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.919
We actually do this with
high school students.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.260
We call it "Bill
Gates for a Day."

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.060
If you had $75 billion dollars,
how would you spend it?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.685
It turns out that
it's important to say

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.510
you can't spend it on yourself?

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.610
But the idea here is
then to say, where do you

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.080
get the biggest
bang for the buck?

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.260
And their sort of
initial response

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770
is I can fix all problems.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.014
They think $75 billion
is a lot of money.

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:31.430
And then, of course,
they realize,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.150
no, while it's a
lot of money, it's

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.380
actually not enough
to fix all problems.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.390
And then they really
want to find out

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.550
how do I spend it in
the best possible way?

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.700
And that's the conversation that
I want to get you involved in.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.960
We have about an hour.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.280
And I actually want you
to help me prioritize.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.510
So I brought some strips.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.420
I'll distribute them
in just a little bit.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.150
But to think about how do
we prioritize big issues?

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.440
So if you'll just allow
me-- just let's remember,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.890
there are lots and lots
of problems in this world.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.856
And if we talk
about some of them.

00:03:01.856 --> 00:03:03.230
And we probably
should be talking

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.271
about a lot more of them.

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.820
There's about a
billion people that

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.750
don't have clean drinking water.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.310
Pretty much everyone
in the world

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.980
would be better off if
we didn't have subsidies,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.540
especially for
agricultural products.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.580
One of the things
we rarely talk about

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.930
is every year, two new
civil wars, typically

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.120
in places you haven't
even heard of.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.900
And very often they
get very little

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.230
or no attention in
the global press.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.920
They cost about $60
billion per civil war.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.690
Not mostly, as you'd imagine,
because people get killed.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.900
Yes, they do get killed.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.920
But because it disrupts
their economies.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.480
And that essentially means that
people lose a lot of income.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.710
And that actually means
that they and their babies

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.620
get a lot less health care.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.530
And that's what really kills
most people in civil wars.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.060
It's not the actual conflict.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.440
But it's the fact of
the fallout of all

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.710
of the economic
downturn in these areas.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.590
Likewise, about
3.5 million people

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.260
die each year from
indoor air pollution.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.010
And the World Health
Organization actually

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.530
just upped that three weeks ago,
saying it's 4.3 million people.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.630
So about one in 12 people
that die on this planet,

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.130
die because of
indoor air pollution.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.470
Basically, lots of poor
people, about 3 billion people,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.150
cooking and keeping
warm with open fires.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.010
And 20% of all deaths
in developing countries

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.220
are due to easily curable
infectious diseases.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.980
The list goes on.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.990
My point here is
simply to say there

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.900
are lots and lots of problems.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.390
What should we do with
say the next $75 billion?

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.380
So we're not talking
about recasting

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.510
the entire universe of spending.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.082
That would be fun
to think about,

00:04:48.082 --> 00:04:49.290
but it's not going to happen.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.240
And also, our models would not
be very good at handling it,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.530
if we sort of wanted to
make a radical break.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.370
Instead, we're talking about
how would you marginally change

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.870
the world?

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.370
And $75 billion is
actually a marginal change

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.210
over four years.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.390
It's about 10% to 15%
of what the world spends

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.690
on overseas development aid.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.450
It's a lot less than
what the world spends

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.260
on climate policies.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.740
So essentially, we're
saying take a small chunk

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.850
or imagine a small
extra chunk and say

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.946
how would you spend that?

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:19.320
Where would you
do the most good?

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.180
So this is for corporate
social responsibility,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.580
for philanthropy, for
government spending.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.850
Right now, our focus
seems to be directed

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.660
by who has the
most cute animals,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.670
or who have the
most crying babies,

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.120
or who had the
greatest PR groups.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.940
And why that's very
understandable,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.420
it's probably not the best
way to deal with this issue.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.971
I would argue that a
lot of organizations

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:48.220
who have tried to garner
attention to all their worthy

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.840
subjects, tend to
focus on sort of panic.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.760
There's an issue here.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.810
We need to fix it.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.190
You need to give us money.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.880
And you sort of
ramp up the message.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.430
It makes for good PR.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.130
But it doesn't make
for very good policy.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.760
So I would argue
we can do better.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.940
And what we are trying
to do is essentially

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.150
say, well, what's the
most cost-effective way

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.510
to deal with a lot
of these issues?

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.270
That's, of course, a
little more boring.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.550
It's not as sexy.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.050
But it just happens
to do a lot more good.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.400
So really what we tried to
do is to set priorities.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.920
But setting priorities-- I mean
in principle, everybody agrees.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.550
Yes, we should do the things
that will do the most good.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.010
But in reality, of
course, that also

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.860
means when you say
this should come first,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.730
this should come
second, it also means

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.930
you have to say something
should come last.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.970
And, of course, that
always annoys people.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.490
So saying a prioritization
is important also

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.160
mean saying what
shouldn't come first.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.500
And that inevitably means
you end up annoying people.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.160
So the people that we typically
have at the top of our list

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.680
think our organization
is the greatest thing

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.930
since sliced bread and
think this is wonderful.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.800
And they constantly mention it.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.562
And, of course, the people
who advocate the things

00:06:59.562 --> 00:07:01.270
at the bottom will
just say we're stupid,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.180
and you shouldn't listen to
us, and all that kind of stuff.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.160
It's very obvious.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.970
But it also engenders
a lot of controversy.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.780
But at the end of the day, I
think we need to ask ourselves

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.030
where can we do the most good?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.600
And that's really what I want
to talk to you about and have

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.490
you try and help us with doing.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.914
So these are the 10 challenges
we looked at last year.

00:07:20.914 --> 00:07:22.080
We do this every four years.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.225
So we did the last one in 2012,
where we get about a hundred

00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:27.197
of the world's top
economists to look across

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.280
all these different areas.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.196
We have lots of teams.

00:07:29.196 --> 00:07:31.615
I'll talk a little bit
more about the process.

00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:33.240
But fundamentally,
these are the issues

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.230
that we looked at, armed
complex, biodiversity,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.670
chronic disease, climate
change, education, hunger

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.410
and malnutrition, infectious
diseases, natural disasters,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.780
population growth, and
water and sanitation.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.290
I think most people would accept
that, yes, this is definitely

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.984
a very comprehensive list
of the world's big problems.

00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:51.150
You can always imagination
there should be one more.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.330
We also got to prioritize.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.680
So we've sort of said we're
only going to look at 10.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.680
But these are
definitely big issues.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.400
A typical sort of
journalist question

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.820
is then to say, well, so,
of these big problems,

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.600
which problem is the biggest?

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.600
It's sort of a very
natural question?

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.590
It also turns out to be wrong.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.110
It's not a well-formed question.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.680
You can't ask what's the
biggest problem without knowing

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.680
that there's a solution.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.970
I mean arguably the biggest
problem in the world

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.706
is that we all die.

00:08:18.706 --> 00:08:20.455
But we don't have a
good solution to that.

00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:22.670
And economists would say we
have a severe undersupply

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.120
of immortality.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.400
But we don't quite
know how to fix that.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.720
So the issue here is not to
say what's the biggest problem?

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.409
We need to look at what
are the smartest solutions?

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.350
So if you look at armed
conflicts, for instance,

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.400
you could go in and say should
we do conflict prevention?

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.950
Should we have peacekeeping
forces for the UN?

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.236
What are the solutions?

00:08:42.236 --> 00:08:44.110
And then what we tried
to do is to say, well,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.720
how much with that
solution cost,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.800
and what's the likelihood
that it will work,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.977
and how much good would
that solution then do?

00:08:50.977 --> 00:08:53.060
So we're basically saying
how much money would you

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.910
spend, how much good
would you end up doing?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.720
Likewise for biodiversity, maybe
we should protect more areas.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.000
Right now, we have
protected about 12%

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.140
of the Earth's surface.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.390
Maybe we should protect more.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.720
How much will that cost?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.910
How much good will it do?

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.130
Obviously, it won't
mostly be measured

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.370
in lives saved because it's
not really about human lives.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.060
But it's about the
fact that we all

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.610
like the idea that there will
be more biodiversity preserved

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.170
for future generations.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.130
Likewise with chronic
disease, maybe we

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.720
should have a tobacco tax.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.580
One fun fact is that
in the 20th century,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.030
we estimated about 100 million
people died from tobacco.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.820
In the 21st century-- mostly
because China and India are

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.940
smoking like crazy--
we are actually

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.430
estimating on current
trends, we will

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.040
lose about a billion
people to tobacco.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.880
So maybe we should do
something about that.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.588
Maybe we should have
a heart attack pill.

00:09:45.588 --> 00:09:46.900
So these are very cheap.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.520
We know how to deal with
them in developed countries.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.720
As developing countries
are increasingly

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.066
avoiding infectious
diseases, maybe we

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:55.940
should start getting
more heart attack pills.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.800
A lot of people die from a heart
attack in the developing world.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.690
And on and on, there
are lots and lots

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.780
of solutions for
all of these areas.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.300
It makes it more complicated.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.850
But it also makes a lot more
interesting because we're not

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.406
talking about is a problem, a
big problem or a small problem?

00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:11.780
But we're talking
about are there

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.970
good solutions or bad solutions?

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.540
And typically, there are
both good and bad solutions

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.880
to pretty much all of these.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.510
So it's about finding
the good solutions

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.470
to the big problems
in the world.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.590
And that's really what I
want to get you involved in.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.120
So let me just talk a little
bit about how we do this.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.474
We team up with some of
the world's top economists.

00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:33.140
For instance, on the
infectious disease,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.130
we worked with Dean
Jamison, who has basically

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.210
written the manual for the
World Health Organization, about

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.190
305 diseases in
the world and what

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.880
their cost and benefits are.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.190
He has a team of
economists behind him.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.524
So he goes in and looks at a
lot of different solutions.

00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:50.190
I'm just going to
look at three of them.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.810
And again, I'm just going to
do them very, very quickly.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.910
He looks at tuberculosis,
HIV vaccine, and malaria.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.230
But he doesn't just
say, this is important.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.560
He says, for every dollar
you spend on tuberculosis

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.940
on the DOTS approach, which
is basically getting people

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.430
medicine, but making
sure they keep taking it.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.250
I don't know if
you've ever-- I mean

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.590
it's a problem in many places.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.320
But if you get medicine from
your doctor, once you get good,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.210
it's hard to remember to
keep taking the medicine far

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.580
out-- a long time after
you've gotten gone well again.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.022
And that's the problem
was with tuberculosis.

00:11:25.022 --> 00:11:26.730
You actually need to
take your medication

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.850
for a very long time.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.100
You also need to make sure
that you're actually cured.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.380
That it wasn't a variant
that was actually

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.150
resistant to the
medicine you got.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.100
So with all that, and with
the smartest approaches,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.270
they estimate that for every
dollar spent in tuberculosis,

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.890
you will do about
$15 worth of good.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.510
That's pretty fantastic.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.780
On HIV vaccine, they
estimate-- and this

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.910
was the first cost/benefit
for HIV vaccine ever done--

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.660
they estimate that for
every dollar spent,

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.750
you will do about
$11 worth of good.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.560
For malaria, $1 will
do $35 worth of good.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.690
Suddenly you get a
very different approach

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.860
to understanding these
are not just good things,

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.200
but some of them are
phenomenal things.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.850
Of course, we also need to
have a conversation about what

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.950
went into those numbers.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.440
Do we believe those numbers?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.200
When you ask an academic,
they'll come up with answers.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.520
But obviously, they're
not the true answer.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.520
So we actually asked two other
groups of academics, also

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.520
economists, to give
perspectives on this.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.990
And basically, he
tells you, yeah,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.490
but= their model
overestimates this,

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.220
the cost is underestimated
here, all these kinds of things.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.940
So we actually hear a broad
sort of range of conversations

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.870
on what will work
and what won't.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.200
Then we do this for all
the different panels.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.980
And then we have
an expert panel.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.110
Last time, we had
four Nobel laureates.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.850
We're listening to
all of these guys,

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.590
listening to all the arguments,
and then basically prioritizing

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.330
across all these
different areas.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.510
And that's essentially what I'd
like to have you do here today.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.950
I have physical strips
for you here in the room.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.070
The ones who are following
on the internet, I'm sorry,

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.350
you'll have to make
up your own strips.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.120
But basically, I want to give
you the exact same technology

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.100
that we have with the Nobels.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.270
Here, if you could
just distribute this.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.600
And these were actually
cut in Beijing.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.140
I just gave a talk at the
Peking University there.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.750
So essentially, I
just have these.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.460
And I was told that we only
have about 45 minutes because we

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.639
wanted to have
questions and answers.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.930
So I'm actually going to cut
out one of these solutions

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.810
because it takes a long
time to explain it.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.630
So we'll just be using
six of these solutions.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.960
And I basically just want you
to help prioritize these issues.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.990
So if we can just take
a look at some of these.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.750
Again, this was the list of the
solutions that I showed you.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.690
I'd love to go through
all of them with you.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.160
But again, we have
a very limited time.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.810
So I just want to give
you the gist of this idea

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.004
and just take a look at
three of the problems.

00:14:02.004 --> 00:14:03.420
So let's just take
a look at three

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.780
of the challenges,
climate change, education,

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.231
and hunger and malnutrition.

00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:09.730
I've taken them because I'm
sure this is some of things that

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.840
would interest you, and
that would be exciting,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.122
and that will also make for
sort of a good comparison.

00:14:14.122 --> 00:14:15.580
But obviously, we
could have looked

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.840
at lot of different things.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.390
And essentially, of course,
you should look at everything.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.140
If you really had $75 billion,
you probably wouldn't just

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.540
want this room to sit for an
hour and then we'll decide

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.680
were exactly to spend it.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.350
But it's the idea
that I'm hoping.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.040
So let me start off with
hunger and malnutrition.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.240
So if I could ask you
to take the first two

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.870
strips that you have up here.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.580
The first two
strips are basically

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.760
for hunger and malnutrition.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.860
So just simply tear
off the first two ones.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.720
And then tear each
one of them up.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.170
So you have these two strips.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.150
And basically what
I want you to do

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:54.840
is when we talk about these
first two solutions, decide

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.620
which of these two would you
first fund if you had money?

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.271
Would you fund this before
you fund this or the other way

00:15:01.271 --> 00:15:01.770
around?

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.940
So it's really
very, very simple.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.856
Of course, we're going
to put in more and more

00:15:04.856 --> 00:15:08.380
and eventually end up
with a ranking of all six.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.650
So hunger and malnutrition,
it's a big problem.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.560
There's about a billion people
that go to bed hungry each day.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.920
It's almost inconceivable.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.900
About one in seven
people on this planet

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.312
go to bed hungry each day.

00:15:22.312 --> 00:15:24.020
It's not because
there's not enough food.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.080
It's mostly because
they're poor.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.560
They can't afford to
actually buy the food.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.410
The number has remained
pretty constant

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.860
over the last 40 years.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.040
Because there's a lot
more people in the world,

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:41.750
the prevalence has dropped from
34% in 1970 to about 18% today.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.160
A large part of
this is, of course,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.810
because of two different things.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.080
We've had a lack of innovation
since the first Green

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.400
Revolution that we
have around 1970.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.810
How many have heard
of Norman Borlaug?

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.870
Norman Borlaug won the Nobel
Prize and the Peace Prize

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.910
in 1970 for essentially
instigating--

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.420
starting-- instigating--
the first Green Revolution,

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.900
basically providing much more
output for every plot of land.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.900
With dwarf varieties,
with higher inputs

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.890
especially of fertilizer,
we could dramatically

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.860
increase the yields
of most basic crops.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.860
And it's estimated
that he probably

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.465
saved somewhere between
1 and 2 billion people.

00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:28.370
Now, that's pretty
cool to put in your CV.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.240
But since then, we've
basically been complacent.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.550
So we haven't done very much.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.490
So we haven't been focusing
on keeping and getting

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.260
more and more out of
every plot of land.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.000
And of course, also, we're
now planting lots of crop

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.950
with biofuels.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.450
So essentially in the US,
you're using about 40%

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:53.350
of the corn yield in
the US to produce fuel.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.510
Which in some fundamental
sense is morally wrong, right?

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.980
I mean you're actually
using about 5%

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.000
of the world's calories
that we produce

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.010
to produce into fuel, instead
of helping feeding the world.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.579
Of course, it
doesn't directly go

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.030
to helping feeding the world.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.670
But it increases
the price, which

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.460
makes it harder for
poor people to buy.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.089
So these are some of the
problems that we have to face.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:21.230
But again, what we asked the
experts was then basically,

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.869
well, how do you fix that?

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.200
How do you go about doing that?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.069
They had lots of
different solutions.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.112
Again, I'm just going
to look at two of them.

00:17:28.112 --> 00:17:30.320
One is to research and
development and increase yield

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.637
enhancement to essentially get
a second Green Revolution going.

00:17:33.637 --> 00:17:35.720
And the other one is reduce
chronic undernutrition

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.890
in preschoolers.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.830
Sort of a more standard
kind of approach.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.960
Let's just make sure that kids,
especially very young kids,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.169
are fed well.

00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:45.210
But there are also lots
and lots of other things.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.543
And you can read all the papers.

00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:50.570
So either in the "How to Spend
$75 Billion" or on online.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.560
In copenhagenconsensus.com,
there's

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.480
all the papers available.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.950
They look, for instance, on
crop advisory text messages.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.000
The idea that you
send out to farmers

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.110
in third-world countries,
you should plant this

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.370
because this is actually
going to be good this year.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.360
You should plant it
now because we estimate

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.200
that this is going to be
the best time to plant it.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.158
You should harvest now.

00:18:10.158 --> 00:18:12.402
You should sell it
here because that's

00:18:12.402 --> 00:18:14.110
where you're going to
get the most money.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.650
I thought this was going
to be a phenomenal idea.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.224
It turns out it's
not all that great.

00:18:17.224 --> 00:18:19.640
It probably gives you a couple
dollars back on the dollar.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.770
So it's a nice thing, but
not all that terrific.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.930
But there are lots of
other opportunities.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.700
I'm just going to look at
two of these solutions.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:33.320
So let's talk about the
first one, increase yield

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.260
through R&amp;D. It's something
we know very well how to do.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.417
We are doing some
of this, mostly

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:39.500
for first-world countries.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.990
We're spending about
$5 billion per year

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.570
and probably likely to
keep doing that until 2050.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.276
So that's sort of the standard
model, if we don't do anything.

00:18:48.276 --> 00:18:49.650
And then what the
researchers did

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.250
was say, imagine if
we spend $8 billion

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.600
more on research and development
into agricultural yield

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.030
enhancement every year?

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.700
So we get up to $13 billion
per year, up till 2050?

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.311
Because we've done
this a lot, we

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.810
have a pretty good understanding
of what that would actually

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.710
mean.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.900
It would probably
increase growth rates

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.830
for crop yields of about 0.4
percentage points and livestock

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.960
yields by about 0.2
percentage points.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.070
So not very much.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.560
But because it's going to be
accumulated over almost half

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.800
a century, it's actually
going to have a huge impact.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.080
Not so much in GDP because
agriculture makes up

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.810
a smaller and
smaller part of GDP.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.220
So yes, it would increase
GDP a little bit.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.860
But it's not really
what matters.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.730
What would matter
a lot more is it

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.200
would lower food prices,
which of course is incredibly

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.880
important for poor people.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.140
And it would reduce
the number of hungry.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.929
Remember, it wouldn't
eradicate the number of hungry

00:19:45.929 --> 00:19:47.470
and that's one of
the crucial points.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.178
Of all of the things
we're talking about,

00:19:49.178 --> 00:19:50.590
we're not solving problems.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.640
We're making them smaller.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.570
We're reducing it.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.490
Because if you were
solving it, if you're

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.086
fixing the last guy who's
hungry-- don't go hungry.

00:19:58.086 --> 00:19:59.960
Of course, that would
be really, really nice.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.860
But that's probably going to
be phenomenally expensive.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.818
And you could do something
else with that money

00:20:03.818 --> 00:20:05.800
and do much more good elsewhere.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.050
So the idea is we're
reducing the problem,

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.740
but we're not solving it.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.560
And the cost again--
I'm just going

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.320
to do the very simple
cost and benefit.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.110
The process is just
basically the discounted cost

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.330
of $8 billion dollars over
the next half century.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.730
So it's about $184 billion.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.450
We actually use two
different discount rates.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.260
That will become
even more important

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.140
when we talk about education
and climate change.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.910
But basically, I'm
just going to give you

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.890
one number because
otherwise this just becomes

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.580
way, way too complicated.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.710
But essentially, you
can adjust in that.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.330
We also have a discussion,
when you ask the questions,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.700
about whether this should
be higher or lower?

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.960
So the cost is fairly simple.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.210
We've just been spending
$8 billion a year more.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.710
The benefits, if you
just look at what's

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.280
the benefit to consumers and
also to producers-- well,

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.400
producers actually lose because
the prices are going to drop.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.740
But because we're all consumers
and we'll gain a lot more,

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.460
the overall benefit is
significant to the world.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.740
The economists estimate it's
about $3 and 1/2 trillion.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.410
So on that very, very simple
basis, a little bit depending

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.489
on your discount
rate, it's simply

00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:15.280
dividing those two
numbers with each other.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.953
And you get a benefit/cost
ratio of somewhere between $16

00:21:17.953 --> 00:21:18.720
and $21.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.200
So basically for every dollar
you spend on extra research

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.780
and development, you do
somewhere between $16 and $21

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.120
of good in the world.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.230
Now, that's a very
simple assumption.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.660
But, of course, it's also
a very, very tiny part

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.420
of the benefits.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.920
There are a number
of other benefits

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.650
that we need to calculate
into this number.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.720
Yes, we get cheaper foods.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.760
That's great.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.907
But it also is
very, very important

00:21:44.907 --> 00:21:46.490
that through research
and development,

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.060
we can also make
variability lower.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.250
That's important because
variability is really

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.980
what kills most people.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.940
Remember, it's not the fact
that you can't afford food most

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.620
of the time.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.620
It's the fact that every once
in awhile there's a huge drought

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.190
and then prices spikes, and
then you can't afford it,

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.090
and then you die.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.720
And then, of course,
it's no real help

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.260
that help that prices
drop next year.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.100
So the idea here is if we could
have drought-resistant species,

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.599
if we could have
saline-resistant species, if we

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:18.890
could focus more on these
things-- which of course will

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.740
also help address, for
instance, climate change,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.520
or the impact of climate
change, we will actually

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.110
make sure a lot more
people will survive,

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.110
to also be able to
buy next year, when

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.340
the prices drop down again.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.370
The experts did this estimate.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.490
It's the first cost/benefit
for variability.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.040
They had very, very
large estimates.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.980
But the Nobels didn't
actually believe that.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:43.027
It would probably have some
benefit, but not nearly as much

00:22:43.027 --> 00:22:43.860
as what they'd like.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.820
They talked about
in the high $50s.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.510
It's more likely that the
benefit/cost ratio, including

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.880
the one I mentioned up above, is
somewhere between $20 and $25.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.650
So it makes it an even
better investment.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.590
But it's not, again, phenomenal.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.370
But there are two more
things we need to remember.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.940
If you spend more money on
research and development

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.380
so that you get
higher yields, it also

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.360
means we have to chop
down less forests.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.120
So that will help biodiversity.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.870
Basically as we get
more and more people,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.200
we can either grow more food
on the same amount of land

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.070
or we'll have to cut
down nature in order

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.820
to be able to feed more
people on more land.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.310
The more we can do it
through yield increases,

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.070
the less we have to
chop down extra land.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.360
So that actually means
we'll save forests.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.880
If we estimate how
much people are

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.580
willing to spend on
making sure that we get

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.390
more biodiversity-- so first
world is typically wanting

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.100
to do good for biodiversity--
we can actually

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.090
come out with about a
trillion or not or so more

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.247
in ecosystem benefits.

00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:44.080
You have a question?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.205
I've been told that you
should use a microphone.

00:23:47.205 --> 00:23:47.830
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.230
Thanks.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.730
Yeah.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.600
It seems to me that typically
the way we increase yields

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.930
is by channeling the crops into
more and more of a monoculture,

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.532
which reduces the
diversity in the crops.

00:23:58.532 --> 00:24:00.490
Which means that when a
new threat comes along,

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.480
the yield is more vulnerable
than it was before.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.690
So how does that fit with your
notion of reduced variability

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.700
in a situation where,
say, all of a sudden

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.412
we have a plague of a
new variety of locust?

00:24:12.412 --> 00:24:14.120
BJORN LOMBORG: It's
a very good question.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.030
It's not modeled.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.610
And I'm not sure how
exactly we would model it.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.460
We've certainly seen in
commercial agriculture

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.280
that we have been able to
handle the threats that

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.750
have been so far.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.970
But that, of course, is no
guarantee for the next risk.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.610
One of the ways that
we could do that--

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:31.984
and that's not
included in this--

00:24:31.984 --> 00:24:33.280
is having more of a gene bank.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.990
I mean we already do have that.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.520
And that turned out
to be incredibly

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.350
important for the wheat rust and
many of the other big threats

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.630
that we have to
agriculture in the past.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.650
But I don't know.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:51.110
So the answer is it's
probably not a good way

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.430
to try and go-- to have less
monoculture in that sense--

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.150
that you have even lower yields.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.280
That will probably end up
making you much, much more risky

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.010
every year.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.970
But you do need
some way of thinking

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.670
about how you're going to sort
of avoid these big challenges.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.770
And the way I see it,
again, a gene bank

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.230
is probably one
of the best ways.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.870
GMOs, so genetic
modification, may also

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.750
be one of the answers to that.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.590
But again, it's not included.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.400
And so your
decision, if you find

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.890
that that's a crucial
point to this,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.370
is actually then to say then,
I think this is less good.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.190
Because I don't actually
believe that this

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.720
is going to have
as many benefits.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.590
The benefits are overestimated
because it has not

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.310
taken into account that there's
a potential huge crash waiting

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.400
around the corner in 20 years.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.120
And it's, again, one
of those questions

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.629
that I'm just a poor
representative of the guys who

00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:44.920
have actually done the studies.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.264
You should ask one of them.

00:25:46.264 --> 00:25:47.930
And then, they may
have a better answer.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.500
But I don't know
the answer to that.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.090
Again, one of the points
we have to remember

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.680
is we're sort of pushing all
of the academics in pretty much

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.930
all of their areas here.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.670
And this is the best knowledge
I would argue that we have.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.020
But it doesn't mean by
any means this is perfect.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.860
I would love for everybody to
have good models of everything

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.170
and we don't.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.300
Climate change is actually,
curiously enough, one

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.990
of the places where we
have the best models

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.370
because we have also
spent a lot of money.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.110
And they've kind
of known that they

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.619
have to build models for
a lot of different things.

00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:21.910
But most of these-- for
instance, agricultural models--

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.840
have very, very few
variables in them.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.530
And so we push them to do more.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.950
But we haven't
put in everything.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:33.690
So it also helps
tackling global warming.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.000
If you don't cut
down forests, you

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.760
don't release the CO2
into the atmosphere.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.290
And they actually estimate
that keeping those trees

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:47.370
has another billion-- sorry,
another trillion in value,

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.800
or thereabouts.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.810
So the total
benefit/cost ratio is

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.050
estimated to be
around $30 to $40.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.670
So for every dollar spent, you
do $30 to $40 worth of good.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.809
That's a phenomenal impact.

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:01.350
But that's just one
of the proposals.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.016
So let me just show
you the other one.

00:27:03.016 --> 00:27:04.390
It's a much more
straightforward.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.090
Because remember,
this is basically

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.840
a promise in the future.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.760
The other one is a
very, very simple one.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.780
It's basically just get
more food to kids now.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.430
There's about 180 million
kids that are undernourished,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.040
preschoolers that
are undernourished.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.370
Let's try and help them.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.770
This is a list of all the
things that we can give them

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.970
and the price tags for each kid.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:29.420
So all in all, that
adds up to about $96

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.450
to basically make sure
that they don't get

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.310
malnourished in the
first two life years.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.846
So up till they're
two years old.

00:27:37.846 --> 00:27:38.952
It's very, very simple.

00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:39.910
We know how to do this.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.930
This is also including
the distribution cost.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.440
So it's a very simple thing.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.450
We've tried it a lot.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.970
We know this works.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.852
The question is
not really how much

00:27:49.852 --> 00:27:51.310
it would cost
because we know that.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.990
If we tried to save
about 31 million kids

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:58.360
each year in a cohort, it'll
cost us about $3 billion

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.120
a year.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.510
And the benefits are
going to be significant.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.890
I've actually argued
this for quite a while.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.930
But we got good data
about a year and a half

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:13.110
ago, that I just briefly want to
tell you about, from Guatemala.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.260
We've had good, sort of
theoretical arguments

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.500
for a very long time.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.720
But there was a study
done that started

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.330
in the late '60s in Guatemala.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.350
Where American researchers went
down, found two small villages

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:29.430
in Guatemala, and gave the
kids in those villages, who

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.790
were pretty malnourished,
gave them good food.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.570
Then they found
two other villages

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.400
close by that were
identical in all parameters

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.900
and didn't give them good food.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.520
They essentially gave
them sugar water instead.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.450
It was the '60s.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.689
You could get away with that.

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:46.230
But the fundamental
point, of course,

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.440
is this is a phenomenal study.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.870
They've now gone back and
refound almost of them.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.360
They found about 79%
of them, so 3,500 kids

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.590
that were both in the control
group and the actual study

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.320
group.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.300
And the impact was phenomenal.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.054
They had better marriages.

00:29:04.054 --> 00:29:04.970
They have better jobs.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.240
They had stayed
longer in school.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.130
They had learnt more.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:10.170
Basically, their brains and
their muscles had developed.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:11.810
They had better jobs.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:12.850
They had fewer kids.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.360
If they were women,
there had miscarriages.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.890
But crucially, if they
avoided being stunted,

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.840
they had three times the pay.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.006
So they were phenomenally
more productive.

00:29:23.006 --> 00:29:24.630
Because they had
learnt more in school,

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.370
they were more valuable.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.880
They started this virtual circle
of actually helping their kids

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.560
and becoming more productive.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.840
Now, we also have studies from
about four other countries.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.590
We have big studies,
but not quite as long.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.060
So two in Africa and Bangladesh.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.350
And the net impact
of this is estimated

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.960
that if you can
avoid stunting, which

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.210
is a good indicator
of malnutrition,

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.970
you will get about
three times the pay.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.080
We can avoid about a
third of all stunting

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.360
in these 31 million
kids per year.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.097
And so we actually estimate
that for every dollar spent,

00:30:01.097 --> 00:30:03.430
on average-- we're not going
to help all of these kids--

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.804
but on average,
we're going to be

00:30:04.804 --> 00:30:08.370
$59 worth of good, which
is a phenomenal impact.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.170
So again, the idea
here is simply

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.000
to say-- and again,
remember this only

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.700
mentions or investigates what's
the benefit from schooling

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.840
in the sense that you
have a higher income.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.096
That's a very, very
one-dimensional economic input/

00:30:22.096 --> 00:30:24.470
And one of things you could
certainly say is there's also

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.950
some intrinsic benefit
in not starving.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.950
So there's a lot of
different, other things

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.992
you could pile into this.

00:30:30.992 --> 00:30:32.950
But one of the problems
we have with economists

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.542
is that once they
have a big number,

00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:36.000
they feel like we
don't really need

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.250
to make it even bigger by
putting in other stuff.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.130
But, of course,
if you're actually

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:41.100
going to compare it to
all the other stuff,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.130
you actually do need to start
thinking about all this.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.170
So basically what I'd
like you to do now

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.720
is to say you have these
first two possibilities.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.600
If you were going
to spend your money,

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.930
how would you prioritize it?

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.010
Could I ask you to talk
to the person next to you

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.380
and basically try to
convince him or her

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.940
why he or she is wrong and
why they should prioritize it

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.930
the other way around?

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:04.763
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.350
BJORN LOMBORG: Again,
one of the things I hope

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.330
becomes kind of obvious
is that this suddenly

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.330
starts a conversation where you
can have a lot more discussions

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.640
about, well, I actually
think you get more input

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.050
or I think you could have less
input on this sort of thing

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.310
if we had more time.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.960
Our Nobels and about
a hundred experts

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.835
spent about two
years doing this.

00:31:33.835 --> 00:31:35.320
So in some sense,
it's ridiculous

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.750
that we're just doing an hour.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.660
So please don't take this
as sort of the full process.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.780
But it should be
sort of an input.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.890
So hopefully, you
now have something

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:48.530
where you feel somewhat
confident that one

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.249
of your proposals is
better than the other.

00:31:51.249 --> 00:31:52.790
So let's move on
and say, well, there

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.280
are other problems in the world.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.970
So if you take the
next three issues,

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.250
which are global
warming-- and I'm actually

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.970
going to leave out the
geoengineering simply

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.510
because it just
takes too much time.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.550
And we have a short
amount of time.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.602
So I'd love to talk,
if somebody wants

00:32:07.602 --> 00:32:08.810
to talk about it, afterwards.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:13.000
So we're just going to look at
the first two of these strips

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.220
and basically talk about, well,
how do we then prioritize this?

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.111
Because that's obviously
also a problem.

00:32:18.111 --> 00:32:20.110
And let's talk about what
are the solutions here

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.276
and how can we deal with it?

00:32:21.276 --> 00:32:22.925
Yes, CO2 heats up the planet.

00:32:22.925 --> 00:32:24.940
It's a significant
temperature increase.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.870
It risks millions
of people going

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.320
hungry, billions
with water stress,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.130
millions with coastal
flooding, more malaria.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.030
There's lots of these risks.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.570
There's two points that
we need to remember.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.550
If we look at it from
an economic angle,

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.580
global warming will probably
be beneficial for high latitude

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.000
countries, which are
typically rich countries.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.780
I come from Denmark,
a little warming

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.940
there might not be all that bad.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.120
But if you live in low latitude
countries, which are typically

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.630
poor countries, global
warming is already bad

00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:59.980
and will only get worse.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.620
So actually the net
impact is probably

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.430
going to be-- in
economic terms--

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.754
first around the
second half of century,

00:33:06.754 --> 00:33:08.170
it's going to turn
into a problem.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.200
So we're talking about
a long-term problem, not

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.720
a short-term problem.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.650
The second part
is no matter what

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.110
you do with global
warming, it's only

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.870
going to impact in the
second half of the century.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:20.990
So even if we cut
dramatically now,

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.900
because of the
lag in the system,

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.530
it's really only going to
happen in the second half

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:26.760
of this century.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.370
So this is not obviously
technically true.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.980
But it will have
very little impact

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.530
before the middle
of the century.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:37.130
So we're talking about
impacts now-- sorry,

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.830
changes now, that will
have long-term impacts

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.800
on the negative outcomes
towards the end of the century.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.410
So again, we had lots of
different people looking

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:45.980
at this.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.990
There's actually
six papers looking

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.790
at adaptation and a
lot of other things.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.990
I'm not going to
talk about these.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.730
I'm just going to
talk about two things.

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.040
The carbon tax will
reach the 2 degree limit,

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.980
which is presumably what
all political leaders have

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.580
signed up to.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.290
We are obviously not anywhere
near to actually doing

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.290
that in real policies.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.970
But we look at what
would that take.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.280
And then also the
other solution,

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.255
make green energy cheaper
through innovation.

00:34:11.255 --> 00:34:13.260
But as you can see,
there's lots and lots

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.389
of other opportunities,
geoengineering, adaptation,

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:19.040
carbon taxes, lots of other
things, deal with methane,

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.370
black soot, technology transfer,
forests, so on and so forth.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.400
So again, I'm just going to
look at two of these solutions

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.330
and get a sense of
what could we do?

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.650
If we did want to
get a 2-degree limit,

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:37.210
the researchers ran this on all
the major macroeconomic climate

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.090
energy models.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.790
They're all collated under
the Stanford Energy Modeling

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.170
Forum, which is considered to
be the gold standard of energy

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.800
modeling in the world.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.580
There are 11 models there.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.310
Actually, six of the models say
we can't do the 2-degree limit.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.750
We're just way too far ahead.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:57.339
There's no way you can plausibly
do this within the model.

00:34:57.339 --> 00:34:59.380
So the researchers just
looked at the five models

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.900
that say it can be done.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.770
So in some sense,
we're already looking

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.840
at the optimistic models.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.580
Remember, Obama, Merkel,
pretty much-- Cameron--

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.160
pretty much any
leader in the world

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.580
have at least in principle
signed up to these targets.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.220
But we're not doing anything
close to doing that.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.510
If we were to do
it, and if we're

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.440
going to do in the
most effective way,

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.767
we'd have to raise carbon
taxes significantly now,

00:35:22.767 --> 00:35:25.100
dramatically towards the end
of the century, essentially

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.140
outlawing fossil fuels or at
least the emissions of CO2

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.060
from fossil fuels.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:37.110
That is equivalent, just to
get a sense of proportion,

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:43.720
to have a $0.60 per gallon
of gasoline carbon tax now

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.850
and have about $25 per
gallon gasoline by the end

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:48.760
of the century.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.490
I think you sort of can see that
might be a hard political task

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.686
to do in the US.

00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:56.435
It's also, perhaps,
important to recognize

00:35:56.435 --> 00:35:58.990
that a lot of countries could
actually not afford to do this.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.100
We're assuming that
you'd switched taxation

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.920
towards carbon fuels and
away from other places.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.550
So you'd still have
the same taxation.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.133
But actually, there
are many countries

00:36:10.133 --> 00:36:12.990
that don't have enough taxation
to actually achieve that.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:16.160
So you'd have a net tax increase
in these countries, which

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.959
will probably also
be problematic.

00:36:17.959 --> 00:36:20.000
But even if you could
actually do it-- and again,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.540
remember this is the
economically most efficient

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.870
way to do it-- this would
reduce temperature increases

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:29.310
significantly from 3.5
to 2 degrees by design.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.600
And it would have a
very significant cost.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.190
This is also what the UN came
out and said about a month

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.180
and a half ago.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.407
The cost is in the
order of 13% of GDP

00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:41.490
by the end of the century.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.990
So about $40,000
billion per year,

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.870
mostly in lost GDP growth.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.830
So that's a significant cost.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:51.330
There would also be significant
benefits, but obviously

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.690
in a much lower scale.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:55.680
We estimate the benefits would
be in the order of $2 trillion

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.800
per year, so $2,000
billion per year.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.510
Also the benefit come
much later than the cost.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.600
The cost will occur
immediately and ramp up.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.650
Whereas the benefits will come
much later and also ramp up.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.550
So if you do the cost-- and
this is actually done out

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:15.050
for 300 years-- but it gets
pretty much the same outcome--

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.830
the benefit/cost
ratio is about $0.02.

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.310
So for every dollar
spent, you avoid

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.690
about $0.02 of climate damage
or you do $0.02 worth of good.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.340
That's one of the
reasons why I've

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.730
been arguing that dealing with
climate change in this way

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.450
is actually not
a very smart way.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.370
Of course, this
upsets some people.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.790
But I think at least there's
quite a bit of margin

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:41.120
to be wrong and still
sort of get the sign right

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.650
that this is probably
not a beneficial way

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.520
to tackle global warming.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.230
There is an other way.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.710
And that's the
fundamental way of looking

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.820
at making green energy cheaper.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.520
If we could make green
energy much cheaper

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.810
through innovation-- so
basically get breakthrough

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:58.890
technologies-- we
could potentially,

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.517
for much less money, get much
more reduction in the CO2.

00:38:02.517 --> 00:38:04.683
Essentially, of course, if
we could get green energy

00:38:04.683 --> 00:38:07.690
to be so cheap that it was
cheaper than fossil fuels,

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.290
everyone would switch and we'd
be done talking about this.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.700
People would just simply switch.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.770
And we wouldn't be needing
to talk about global warming

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.110
anymore.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.130
So this would tackle global
warming in the long run,

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.630
but obviously not
in the short run.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.500
The argument here is to say
that we should probably get up

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.127
on the order of a magnitude
of $100 billion per year,

00:38:27.127 --> 00:38:28.710
which is obviously
much more than what

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.809
we are talking about here.

00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:31.850
But they believe that this
is scalable, certainly

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.720
in the short and medium term.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.420
So we could decide to
spend a significant portion

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.310
of our $75 billion on this.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.820
And we'd probably get about
the same benefit/cost ratio.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.470
And so because we have estimates
from a lot of other investment

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.130
in research and
development, we're

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:47.520
talking about new technology.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.510
So obviously, we don't know
what is going to come out of it.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.130
But the estimate
is that this would

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.340
give a benefit/cost
ratio of about $11.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.664
So because we would
be spending money now

00:38:56.664 --> 00:38:58.580
to making sure that we
had better technologies

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.740
to reduce CO2 more
in the future,

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.620
we would actually see less
global warming in the long run

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.630
because people
would switch more.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.990
Remember, this is totally a
future dependent argument.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.132
It may not happen.

00:39:10.132 --> 00:39:12.090
But there's a good chance
that it would happen.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.006
And essentially if you
spend it, for instance,

00:39:14.006 --> 00:39:15.827
on a thousand
different technologies,

00:39:15.827 --> 00:39:17.660
you don't need all
thousand to come through.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.020
You'd basically just need
one of them to come through.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.220
And because research is so much
cheaper that actual production,

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.390
you can afford to spend
it on say a thousand

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.630
different technologies.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.250
And again, we just
need one of them

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.297
to come out, to
actually become cheaper.

00:39:33.297 --> 00:39:34.880
And that's the one
that will solve it.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.510
Just to give you
one example of this,

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.700
the US fracking,
which obviously is not

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.980
a green solution in the
sense that it has solved

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:47.210
global warming, but fracking
has made gas much cheaper

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.460
in the US.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.690
So the US has historically,
totally precedentedly,

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.820
shifted from producing
electricity with coal,

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.560
to producing
electricity with gas.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.990
You've switched about
seven percentage points.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:05.530
That has cost to cut carbon
emissions so much that we

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.435
estimate it's about 300
megatons per year in total.

00:40:09.435 --> 00:40:12.550
And obviously, there's also
been an economic recession

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.160
and you've also have more wind.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.580
But if you take that out, it's
probably about 300 megatons.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.780
If you look at what the total
cost reduction from all solar

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.830
and wind in the world,
that's estimated

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.280
to be about 275 megatons.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.770
So sort inadvertently,
the US has actually

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.040
reduced more CO2
emissions through fracking

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.090
than all of the
world's wind and solar.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:35.660
And, of course,
you make money off

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.770
of cutting CO2 with fracking.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.240
Basically because you save
about $100 billion per year

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.940
from fracking, whereas
solar panels probably cost

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.820
the world-- the International
Energy Agency estimate

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.410
it's about $60 billion
in subsidies per year.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:56.720
So the simple point is that
only happened because the DOE

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.370
and others subsidized the
innovation of fracking

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.920
in the '70s, '80s, and '90s,
when nobody could make money

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.670
off of it.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.770
And, of course, that
point was not to be green.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:06.740
It was not at all.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.310
And it's not either a green
solution in the long run.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.380
But it could be a bridge
solution in the sense

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.944
that it brings us to
lower carbon emissions.

00:41:13.944 --> 00:41:15.360
And then eventually,
of course, we

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.670
need to move to other
technologies that will actually

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:20.900
totally reduce carbon emissions.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.330
Remember, fossil fuels are
incredibly good for really,

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.550
really many-- we tend to
think of it as really evil.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.710
But imagine your
world without energy,

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.110
that's a terrible world.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.990
Matt Bridley has a
fun sort of story

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.070
about why is it fun
to be Louis XIV,

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.400
or why was it fun
to be Louis XIV?

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.950
He had 60 people just prepare
dinner for him every night.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:47.800
And he had a thousands
of the servants helping.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.340
That's really,
really cool if you're

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.220
Louis XIV, but not
very cool if you're

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.640
one of a thousand people.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.810
It's a very
unsustainable solution.

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:57.750
Most people can't be the
king and a lot of people

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:58.760
end up being servants.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.760
But what essentially fossil
fuels, or the availability

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.960
of cheap energy,
has allowed us is

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.620
that we all have lots
and lots of servants.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.530
Remember, Lebergott,
another American economist,

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.670
said the washing machine
in 1900 was essentially

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.610
the American housewife.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.679
But now she doesn't
do that anymore

00:42:18.679 --> 00:42:20.470
because we actually
have a washing machine.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.470
And you have a vacuum.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.460
And you have lots of
other technologies.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.010
So if you look at
it energy-wise,

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:31.120
the average European have
about 150 manpower, 24/7,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.370
at our disposal, through
our energy usage.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:37.440
So we have 150 servants,
the US has about 300,

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.470
and India has about 15.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:43.510
So it's a solution to
the very basic problem

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.415
that you have lots
of opportunity

00:42:45.415 --> 00:42:47.330
to do stuff that you
couldn't otherwise do.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:50.190
And that people are willing
to spend a lot of money on.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.940
So you really have to ramp up
the carbon tax very, very high

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.380
if you want people to
essentially shut it off.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.230
Now, of course, a low carbon
tax will shut off a little bit.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.810
You'll sort of
cut at the margin.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:03.050
But you won't do very much
of it because you actually

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.490
really like your fossil fuel.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.590
And so you have to
ramp it up really high.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:09.950
AUDIENCE: It just occurs
why you didn't start high?

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:11.150
BJORN LOMBORG: Oh, OK, yes.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.440
Sorry.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:11.790
Sorry.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:12.289
Sorry.

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:14.060
Why do we need to ramp it up?

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.660
Well, fundamentally, because
every economist would say,

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.650
you want to give
people time to not--

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.790
if you had a really, really
high carbon tax right now,

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.700
it would actually only
help a little bit more

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.560
because you'd cut
like 20 more years.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.560
But it would have huge
cost because you've just

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.430
build this power plant and
now you have to shut it down,

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:36.010
instead of letting it run for 20
years, and then when it's old,

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:36.910
shutting it down.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:40.130
So it's essentially an
efficiency argument,

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.600
that anything you do,
you want to ramp it

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.040
in so you also get the
innovation opportunity

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.270
and you get the replacement
opportunity in there.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:52.840
So if I could ask you how
would you prioritize these four

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.940
interventions and
saying you can only

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.660
spend a limited amount of money?

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.940
Do they go in between the
solutions you have already?

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.040
Do they go up on top
or down the bottom?

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.030
So if you just spend 30
seconds talking to the person

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:06.650
next to you again
on how you going

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.627
to rank these four
opportunities?

00:44:08.627 --> 00:44:10.460
Because you can't spend
your money on of it.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.028
So where would you
spend your money first?

00:44:14.028 --> 00:44:15.516
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:23.032 --> 00:44:24.990
BJORN LOMBORG: I'm sorry
for rushing you along.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.120
But let me just
take the last bit

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.290
and talk about one more
issue, namely education.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.610
So these are the
last two strips.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:36.880
So basically, I just want you
to tear up those two again

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.680
and see where do they fit into
the grand scheme of things.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.850
Where would you spend your money
if you only have $75 billion

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.290
and wanted to do the most good?

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.280
So if you look at education,
the fundamental good news

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.440
about education is we've
got most kids into school.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.010
In 1960, 41% of all
kids were not in school.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.210
And today, it's only about
10% that are in not school.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.960
And these are almost
all of failed states.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.320
So fundamentally, we've
got most kids into school.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.430
The problem is, of course, that
most of these schools suck,

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.720
and for a lot of
different reasons.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.840
A lot of this is
incentive structure.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.440
The problem really
is improving quality.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.380
And that's also the
conversation in the US.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.880
It's actually the
conversation everywhere.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.490
I don't know if you know the
PISA study from OECD, where

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.419
basically you see which
countries are best.

00:45:29.419 --> 00:45:31.210
Shanghai always come
out on top, but that's

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.170
because they self-select
these schools.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:36.240
So they're probably not
really representative.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.920
Surprisingly, it
typically turns out

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.212
that Finland is the best
schooling country in the world.

00:45:41.212 --> 00:45:42.170
And we have some ideas.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:46.010
But it's also a little hard to
understand exactly why is that?

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:50.370
And so the problem is we really
don't how to deal with quality.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.880
We don't know how to
make quality better.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.030
One of the obvious ways
would be to say, well, let's

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.920
pay teachers-- let's keep good
teachers and fire bad teachers.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.400
It turns out that that's
actually both very, very hard

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.750
to do, as you've
discovered in the US.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.610
But also that it's
very hard to show.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:10.360
There's typically
very little difference

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.390
on an objective scale between
good and bad teachers.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.461
One way you could do that,
of course, was to say,

00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:17.960
well, we're going to pay you
according to your test results.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.020
But we've tried that.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.010
And the typical outcome
is that then the teachers

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.950
teach to the test.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.880
Or even worse, they
cheat on the test.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.040
So it turns out to be
really, really hard to do.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.540
So there's one good
solution-- and that's actually

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:35.000
the best solution that
we have-- is nutrition.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.720
That was one we
looked at before.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.040
Surprisingly, nutrition
doesn't do anything

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.340
about schooling quality.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.920
But essentially,
because it improves

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.720
your brain and your
brain development,

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.680
you learn more, even if
you're in a sucky school.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.847
So in some sense, yes,
it's not an ideal solution.

00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:50.180
But it's a pretty good solution.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.570
It's a great way to get more
out of being bad schools.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.070
But I'm going to show you two.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.780
So nutrition is actually what
most education economists

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.990
come out and say is probably
the best investment in education

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:04.720
because we know it works
and it's sort of a way

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.980
around not trying to
deal with schools.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.720
But there are two other ways.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.410
One is conditional
cash transfers.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.580
That's the first
solution that you have.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.550
This is essentially
paying parents

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.100
to send their kids to school.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.380
It's something we know works.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.870
It's been very,
very well studied,

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.450
mostly in the Latin America.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:26.240
But even Bloomberg tried
it out in New York.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.250
It didn't work all
out all that well.

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.490
But fundamentally, it works.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.840
It's a very simple thing.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.260
We also know it increases
attendance significantly,

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:39.440
but not dramatically
by any means.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.360
A large part of the
benefit is actually

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.970
that it improves health.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:47.030
Because if you pay--
especially to poor parents,

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.700
especially if you pay
to women, so the mothers

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.480
and in the family,
they will spend

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.570
part of that money
on the kid's health.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.970
Now, that's not
really schooling.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:56.270
But it's still good.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.680
So it will actually end up,
over all, being a good thing.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.540
The total benefit/cost
ratio is 5.2.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.910
So it's a nice thing.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.150
But it's not a
phenomenal outcome.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:10.150
Mostly because this is
still just on quantity.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.470
We're not actually dealing
with the basic problem

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:14.540
of improving quality.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.120
We're just simply
improving quantity.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.210
We're getting more
kids into schools

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.190
that pretty much are still bad.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:24.290
And the reason why it's not
a better benefit/cost ratio

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:26.770
is because we have
to pay all parents.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.510
Most parents would still have
send their kids to school

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:30.830
even if we haven't paid them.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.900
So we're basically
paying every one

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.530
to get a little
increase in attendance.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.530
And yes, then we get the
better health outcomes.

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:40.520
Actually, about three of
the five comes from health.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.890
So this is mostly
actually a transfer

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:47.450
of money to poor families,
which is still good.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.237
But it's not got all that
much to do with education.

00:48:50.237 --> 00:48:51.820
But one of things
that it really shows

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.050
is we're don't know very
well what works in education.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:58.070
Which, of course, is one of the
reasons why the West is also

00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:59.360
having this huge discussion.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.575
You have a discussion
about how are

00:49:00.575 --> 00:49:01.940
we going to make schools better.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:02.860
We have it in Denmark.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.570
We have it in most
OECD countries.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.610
We don't quite know
how to do this.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:10.390
So again, mostly
quantity, not quality.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:12.780
The second solution
is what I think

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.550
is a phenomenally
interesting one.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:16.740
But it will have
another issue that I

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.070
think is rampant in many
of these conversations.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:22.430
We don't know enough about
the solution right now.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.570
So this is more sort of a
gambling solution for you.

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.320
It's essentially the idea
of an information campaign.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.280
Most kids that
live in rural areas

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.590
have no idea what's
the value of education.

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.470
Because the only
educated person they

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:41.860
see is the teacher
in this village.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:45.090
And he or she is typically
not very well paid.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:48.000
So the information
campaign is essentially

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.070
telling rural kids
how much more are

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:54.290
you going to make if you get
to the urban area, which you

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.710
probably will, when you grow
up, if you have a high school

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.010
education compared to if
you don't have a high school

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.820
education?

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.800
We're not telling them
any false information.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.070
We're really just telling them
what is the average pay-off

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:12.530
in your country if you go to
the city and if you have a high

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.640
school outcome
versus if you don't.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.090
So you teach both the
kids and their parents

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.070
about the payoffs.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:19.512
You show them the statistics.

00:50:19.512 --> 00:50:20.970
Basically show them
you're probably

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.980
going to make two or
three times as much pay

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.920
if you have your high
school education.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.810
It's very cheap, obviously.

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:29.900
Information campaigns
are very, very cheap.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.860
Although this is more
than just a pamphlet.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.349
It's actually several
times during the year,

00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:36.140
going out and explaining
it to the parents,

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.420
explaining it to the kids.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.120
Getting them to understand
and say, yes, I really

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.390
want to stay in
school and learn more.

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.710
But it actually really works.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:48.330
It gets kids to stay in school,
and learn more, and actually

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:50.240
graduate at much higher levels.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.820
The problem is we don't
have a lot of studies.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.360
We actually only
have two studies.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.535
And they get very,
very different results.

00:50:56.535 --> 00:50:58.035
And that's why I'm
showing you this.

00:50:58.035 --> 00:51:00.270
This is one of the problems
that we typically have.

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:01.180
We have a great idea.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.638
But we just don't
have enough data.

00:51:02.638 --> 00:51:04.740
So in some sense, this
will come down to also

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.592
what's your gut
instinct on this.

00:51:06.592 --> 00:51:08.550
From Madagascar-- these
are both peer-reviewed,

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.150
published studies--
from Madagascar,

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:14.240
we had a benefit/cost
ratio of about a thousand.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.930
The Nobels said we
don't believe this.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:17.840
But I think that's
really honestly

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.740
more sort of on a gut level.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.900
Clearly, they left out some
of the significant cost.

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:24.560
But they have been
peer reviewed.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.850
The other one is the
Dominican Republic,

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:29.810
which had a much more sort
of sensible benefit/cost

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.460
ratio of about $13, so
in between $8 and $19.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.550
So the real issue
here is to say we

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.940
don't know why these
are so different.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.280
You'd obviously have to do
a lot more of these tests.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.270
We will do that.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:45.060
We will know when in five
or 10 years much better

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.420
whether this is a good idea.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.209
But if you had to spend money
next year, in some sense

00:51:49.209 --> 00:51:50.750
you'd just have to
live with the fact

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.000
that we only have two studies.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.280
And you have to decide do
I want to sort of gamble

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.320
some of my money on this
or do I just play it safe

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.720
and say it's probably just $13.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.900
So at the end of the day,
these are not great outcomes.

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:06.050
One of things I also wanted
to show with using education

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:08.912
is essentially that some
solutions are really,

00:52:08.912 --> 00:52:10.120
really good and very obvious.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.869
And you probably haven't
heard about them.

00:52:11.869 --> 00:52:14.210
Other areas, like education,
we talk a lot about.

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.370
But unfortunately, we don't
have very many good solutions.

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:19.420
And our approach at the
Copenhagen Consensus

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.010
is to say let's
not try and solve

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.634
stuff we don't know how to solve
when there's so many things we

00:52:23.634 --> 00:52:26.010
do know how to solve that
could do so much more good.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.990
So in a sense, this is really
just showing you the dilemma

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:31.180
that we constantly end up in.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.832
So if I could ask
you-- and I know

00:52:32.832 --> 00:52:34.540
that you have to leave
in just a second--

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:38.270
if I could ask you then to
prioritize all of these six?

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.790
And then we're just going to
make a very quick vote on who's

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:43.250
going to think these are great.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.760
So just talk to the person
next to you for 30 seconds

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.640
and agree in how you're going
to prioritize all of these six.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.080
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:55.799 --> 00:52:57.590
BJORN LOMBORG: When we
do this with Nobels,

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.550
apart from having
lots of more time,

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.660
we also take all
of their rankings

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.160
and take the median
of this ranking.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.510
So essentially, if
you were this group,

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:08.956
you'd have to not just pull up
your thing you want high up.

00:53:08.956 --> 00:53:10.330
That's not going
to actually work

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:12.380
because you need to pull
the median of the room.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.360
So you'd have to come
up with good arguments

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.470
why you're preferred solution
isn't really much better

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:20.820
and get at least half the room
to move in that direction.

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.050
We don't have that time.

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:25.720
So I'm simply just going to
do a very, very quick thing.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.740
If I could ask you to vote
for your top two solutions?

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.150
And we're not going to count
votes in here because we don't

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.680
have $75 billion
anyway, or do we?

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.210
No.

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:38.060
Right.

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.910
So let's just get a sense
of what the room thinks.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.185
But if I could just ask you
who would vote-- so just

00:53:43.185 --> 00:53:44.750
vote for your two
top priorities.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:49.421
Who would vote for R&amp;D to
increase yield enhancements?

00:53:49.421 --> 00:53:50.630
All right.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.010
Pretty good outcome.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:56.130
Reduce chronic undernutrition
in preschoolers?

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:57.640
That's pretty much everyone.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.940
A high global carbon tax?

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.670
One-- very, very proud.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:07.140
Increase green R&amp;D?

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.190
All right.

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:11.080
Conditional cash transfers?

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:15.250
So schooling and information
campaign on schooling?

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:16.300
All right.

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.750
So it seems-- very,
very unofficial

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:24.840
counting-- that chronic
undernutrition and green energy

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.420
R&amp;D where the two main outcomes.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.580
And again, my point
here is not so

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:34.800
much to say we're not talking
about exactly how are we

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.900
going to spend $75
billion because we want

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.770
to go much more into detail
in the conversation about how

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:42.330
all these models generate
and how do we trust them.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:45.510
But the point is to say that
this is a phenomenal way

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:48.540
to get a lot of people from
very, very different angles

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:52.290
to talk in the same language
of cost effectiveness.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:56.170
I've done this with
young political leaders

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:58.390
from in many
different countries,

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.710
from the extreme left
to the extreme right.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.867
And the fun thing
is to say they think

00:55:02.867 --> 00:55:04.200
they're going to disagree a lot.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.390
But suddenly when
you get down to it,

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:07.916
most people really
want to do good.

00:55:07.916 --> 00:55:10.290
And then you want to start
finding out what really works.

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:12.290
And, of course, there
will still be differences.

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:14.260
But a lot of it
disappears when you

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.680
start talking about what's
actually cost effective.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.360
And so one of my
hopes is talking more

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.030
about rationality
and efficiency helps

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.120
us get past some of these
sort of ideological hang-ups

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.460
that we have where we
believe, no, no, I strongly

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.200
believe this or I strongly
to support that solution.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.890
But rather, that we start
talking about, no, no,

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:35.600
if we spend the money over
here, we'd do more good.

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.730
And that is a
phenomenal argument.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:40.590
And that's actually--
I'm going to the UN.

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:43.150
I just want to briefly tell you
about this, with just a half

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.770
a minute.

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:45.880
The UN is actually
doing their next set

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.820
of sort of goals for
the next 15 years.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:53.120
And this may actually end up
directing about $700 billion

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.120
to development aid.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.610
And right now, there's about
140 goals on the table.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:01.480
Of course, if you
have 140 priorities,

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.920
you don't really have any.

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.360
And so everybody knows that
you need to cut these down.

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.700
But it's very, very hard.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:11.370
And we're actually trying to
take this sort of methodology

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:14.080
to basically say where
do you get a lot of bang

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.140
for your goals and where do you
get little bang for your goals?

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.760
Again, there's going to be
lots of other ideological and

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.315
political controversies.

00:56:21.315 --> 00:56:23.440
And people are going to
have different views simply

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.850
because they come from
different places on the planet.

00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:27.340
If you don't have
any malaria, you

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:30.330
don't think malaria is probably
all that much important

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.520
compared to if you have lots of
malaria in your home country,

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.850
and on and on.

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:36.959
But if we can get that
conversation in there,

00:56:36.959 --> 00:56:38.500
even if we can only
do a little good.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.880
Imagine if we could switch
which out one bad goal for one

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.730
good goal?

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:45.270
Given that we are leveraging
about $700 billion,

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:47.440
that could be a lot
of billions of dollars

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.880
we could end up doing good.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.640
So the reality here
is really just--

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.280
I hope that's what
I can leave you

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.810
with is-- this sort
of process, if we use

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:58.880
both in the global issues,
but also in our everyday life,

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.380
ask-- calculate-- what's
the bang for the buck?

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.950
Where we got the most good?

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:04.920
We'll hopefully end
up doing more good.

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.660
And that I think would be
something that is worth

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:11.660
applauding, both from left to
right of the political spectrum

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.910
and something that we could
all get together on doing,

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:15.770
So thank you very much
for playing along.

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:17.880
It was great
talking to you guys.

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.030
