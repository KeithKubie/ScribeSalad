00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.070
Use the discriminant
to state the number

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.520
and type of solutions
for the equation

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.250
negative 3x squared plus
5x minus 4 is equal to 0.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.640
And so just as a
reminder, you're

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.560
probably wondering what
is the discriminant.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.360
And we can just
review it by looking

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.720
at the quadratic formula.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.940
So if I have a quadratic
equation in standard form,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.690
ax squared plus bx
plus c is equal to 0,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.910
we know that the quadratic
formula, which is really

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.730
just derived from completing
the square right over here,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.420
tells us that the roots
of this, or the solutions

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.920
of this quadratic
equation are going

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.530
to be x is equal to negative b
plus or minus the square root

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.210
of b squared minus 4ac,
all of that over 2a.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.020
Now, you might know
from experience applying

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.580
this little bit,
we're going to get

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.770
different types of
solutions depending

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.340
on what happens under the
radical sign over here.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.140
As you could imagine, if
what's under the radical sign

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.560
over here is
positive, then we're

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.140
going to get an
actual real number

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.515
as its principal square root.

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:07.890
And when we take the positive
and negative version of it,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.510
we're going to get
two real solutions.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.700
So if b squared minus
4ac-- and this is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.510
what the discriminant
really is, it's

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.450
just this expression
under the radical sign

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.990
of the quadratic formula.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.000
If this is greater
than 0, then we're

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.910
going to have two real
roots or two real solutions

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.630
to this equation right here.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.652
If b squared minus
4ac is equal to 0,

00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:41.860
then this whole thing is
just going to be equal to 0.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.276
It's going to be the plus or
minus square root of 0, which

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:44.950
is just 0.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.020
So it's plus or minus 0.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.310
Well, when you
add or subtract 0,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.930
that doesn't change
the solution.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.800
So the only solution is going
to be negative b over 2a.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.660
So you're only going to
have one real solution.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.670
So this is going to be 1-- I'll
just write the number 1-- 1

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.580
real solution.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.970
Or you could say you have
a repeated root here.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.630
You could say you're
having it twice.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.490
Or you could say one real
solution, or one real root.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.500
Now, if b squared minus
4ac were negative,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.100
you might already
imagine what will happen.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.170
If this expression right
over here is negative,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.270
we're taking the square
root of a negative number.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.900
So we would then get an
imaginary number right over

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.590
here.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.230
And so we would add or subtract
the same imaginary number.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.330
So we'll have two
complex solutions.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.490
And not only will we have
two complex solutions,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.750
but they will be the
conjugates of each other.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.520
So if you have one
complex solution

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.110
for a quadratic equation,
the other solution

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.800
will also be a complex solution.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.080
And it will be its
complex conjugate.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.120
So here we would have
two complex solutions.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.132
So numbers that have a real
part and an imaginary part.

00:02:55.132 --> 00:02:56.590
And not only are
they just complex,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.410
but they are the
conjugates of each other.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.900
The imaginary parts
have different signs.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.080
So let's look at b squared
minus 4ac over here.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.430
This is our a, this is
our b, and this is our c.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.869
Let me label them. a, b, c.

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:13.410
And I can do that, because we've
written it in standard form.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.700
Everything is on one side.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.550
Or in particular,
the left hand side.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.140
We have a 0 on the
right hand side.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.360
We've written it
in descending, I

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.080
guess, power form, or
the descending degree.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.890
Or we have our second
degree term first,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.469
then our first degree term,
then our constant term.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.135
And so we can evaluate
the discriminant.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.470
b is 5.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.270
So b squared is 5 squared, minus
4 times a, which is negative 3,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.220
times c, which is negative
4-- I have to be careful.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.650
c is this whole thing.
c is negative 4.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.990
And so I don't know if I said
4 earlier, but c is negative 4.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.010
We have to make sure we take
the sign into consideration.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.230
So times c, which is
negative 4 over here.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.970
And so this is 25.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.780
And then negative
3 times negative 4,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.760
that is positive 12.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.795
And then 4 times 12 is 48.

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:04.340
But we have a negative out here.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.340
So 25 minus 48.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.295
And 25 minus 48, we don't
even have to do the math.

00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:11.920
We can just say that
this is definitely

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.520
going to be less than 0.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.540
You can actually figure it out.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.482
This is equal to negative
13, if I did-- oh no,

00:04:20.482 --> 00:04:26.780
sorry, negative 23, which
is clearly less than 0.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.010
So our discriminant in this
situation is less than 0.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.210
So we are going to have
two complex roots here,

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.677
and they're going to be
each other's conjugates.
