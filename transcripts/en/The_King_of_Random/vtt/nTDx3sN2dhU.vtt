00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.870
I found this microwave in my neighbors garbage can. So I took it home, and turned into an

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.580
AC stick welder. In this project, we'll be
testing out this contraption to see if it

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.710
actually works. Because if it does, we'll
have the metal welding power to make a puzzle

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.090
for entertaining guests, or build improvised
weapons for a zombie apocalypse.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.989
I just modified these microwave oven transformers
to weld metal, and made a little container

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.149
for it all to fit into. This arc welder is
finished and ready for testing, so to do that

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.699
I got some pieces of scrap metal from a welding
shop down the road. I switched out the blade

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.639
on my chop-saw with this cutting wheel and
I'm cutting these bits of steel into smaller

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.720
pieces. The sparks are pretty hot and fly
everywhere, so it's important to wear protection

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.909
and keep them away from anything flammable.
Ok, our pieces are cut and resting on this

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.220
larger piece of metal. This is gonna act
as a base plate for the ground clip to connect

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.010
to. I've got a 6013 welding rod that gets
clipped into the stinger, and the amperage

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.660
is controlled with this device I call the
ScariAc. Look for how to build this in another

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.190
video. The amps are adjusted to work with
these 1/16" cellulose coated rods, and with

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.360
2 of our pieces butted up next to each other,
it's time to see if we can strike an arc.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.930
They say it's kind of like striking a match,
and there we go. These welding rods are consumable,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.740
meaning they get used up in the weld. You
can actually see where the end of the rod

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.700
turns to molten metal and pools into the joint.
To give this a little more strength,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.080
let's flip it over and do the same thing to
the top side. The UV radiation from stick

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.080
welding is enough to give you a pretty bad
sun burn, so if you try it, make sure you're

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.700
protected from head to toe. Alright, the weld
has cooled, so now we can knock off the layer

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.720
of slag that's formed on top, then clean it
up with a wire brush. Now it looks good to

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.660
me, but I've never really welded before so
I'm not sure how to tell if the weld is good

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.519
or not, so let's break it. The piece gets
clamped in a bench vise and these channel

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.620
lock pliers should give us the leverage we
need. I'm actually expecting this will snap

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.780
in the middle â€¦ but it didn't. I welded
another piece and tried bending it back and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.980
forth multiple times to snap the weld, but
the joint never broke. Just for fun and a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.670
bit more practice, let's weld all the scrap
pieces together. I've also got these framing

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.849
nails we can tack on in random places, and
a link of galvanized chain we can weld to

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.099
the end. Well, I think it's safe to say this
welder is working. And I've got my first piece

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.030
of metal art to prove it. It's a little rough,
and probably not the kind of decor I'd want

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.469
to put on display, but in a weird way I kind
of like it. Now I'm amazed that even with

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:01.459
all this welding, the transformer coils are
only slightly warm to the touch. I tried welding

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.269
some larger 3/32 rods and that was a different
story. They work alright, but the welder heats

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.449
up fast. To cool it down, I have a fan that
was salvaged from one of the microwaves, and

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.940
it slides right up to the vent hole on the
left. When it's turned on, air flows over

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.590
the transformer coils, and exhausts out the
other side. In the case of extreme overheating,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.480
the whole top lifts right off for maximum
ventilation. This welds metal pretty good

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.079
in my opinion, but I took it to another welder
to get his thoughts on how it worked. He tried

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.749
some welds on pieces of his own scrap steel,
and seemed pretty impressed with the results.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:40.749
He said the weld penetrated the metal completely,
and probably wouldn't break. So we tried some

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.909
more destructive testing to break the weld,
but even with good leverage and quite a bit

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.650
of force, the weld held strong and the metal
broke first. To finish this project up, let's

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.029
try making something a little more useful.
This time I've got a horseshoe and some chain,

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:59.529
and I'm welding the links in-line with the
tips of the shoe. This 2" steel ring goes

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:04.260
over both of the chains, and the remaining
links are welded onto another shoe. We can

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.919
clean up the welds in the usual way, and look
at that. We've got a horseshoe puzzle ready

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:14.230
for entertaining. The challenge is to get
the ring off, which seems impossible because

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.769
the ring is way too small. But it can be done,
and my wife just proved it. Why don't you

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.389
make your own and see if you can figure out
how it's done? Well there's a MOT stick welder

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.569
that works, and my first few experiences with
the world of welding. If you liked this project,

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.479
