EMILY FORTUNA: Joining us now
is Soniya Jobanputra, a product

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.088
manager at Google,
who is here to give us

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:11.100
the 411 on those
sleek new phones.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.790
Hi, Soniya.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.020
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: Hi, Emily.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.450
EMILY FORTUNA: So your team
has been amazingly busy

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.830
these past few months
getting out this new Pixel

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.270
to the lineup.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.975
What inspired you to
create this phone?

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:24.030
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: Yeah, well,
we set out to do Pixel in 2016.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.100
We really set out to
do something different,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.860
to really bring radically
helpful hardware

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.858
to our consumers.

00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:31.650
And we thought we could
do that by bringing

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.317
the power of hardware,
software, and AI together.

00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:35.400
And we still believe that.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.140
That's still our mission
with these devices.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.020
But with the benefit
of three years,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.840
we've been able to finally
bring a phone that's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.940
more affordable to more people.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.200
And what we've managed
to do is essentially

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.380
improve our capabilities from
a manufacturing standpoint,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.470
improve our capabilities from
a hardware design and software

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.600
standpoint, and
three, we've just

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.670
understood our users better
over the last three years.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.970
Starting with the third one,
understanding our users.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.090
By understanding our users,
we can pick which pillars

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.360
and which parts of the product
are most important to our users

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.790
and focus on those
areas to design

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.060
phones that give users what they
need in a really optimized way.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.640
On the second two,
we really have

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.700
year over year improved
our manufacturing.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.620
When we started out,
we had other people

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.940
building our phones for us.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.940
We are now a full-contract
manufacturer.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.220
We design and build
our own devices,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.340
which means we've
come a tremendous way

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.410
from a manufacturing standpoint.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.000
Finally, on the
engineering side,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.090
just last year we
ended up acquiring

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.310
a huge and talented engineering
team in Taiwan from HTC.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.100
That team has been the
lead on these devices.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.850
And they have brought years
and years of experience,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.640
in conjunction with our Chicago
design team and our Mountain

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.160
View design team,
to come together

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.090
to build this new Pixel 3a
device, the more affordable

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.555
Pixel device at $399.

00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:06.930
EMILY FORTUNA:
That's super cool.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.139
I am personally very excited
to see a new phone come out

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.210
with a headphone jack
and a great camera.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.840
What are your three favorite
features on this new phone?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.940
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA:
Yeah, well, let's talk

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.680
about that headphone jack.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.960
We debated on this
headphone jack.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.860
But we really felt that
consumers at this price point,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.630
in this price tier,
really needed flexibility.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.890
And that's what that
headphone jack gives you.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.520
We still support digital audio,
and it is the ultimate way

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.680
to consume your audio, right?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.770
You can either use our
USB-C adapter on the bottom

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.660
or you can use
Bluetooth headphones.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.070
And digital audio is incredible.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.423
But a lot of people
have headphones,

00:02:47.423 --> 00:02:49.840
and we didn't need to create
anymore e-waste in the world.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.490
So, we've decided to put a
3.5-millimeter headset jack

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.610
in so that people could use the
accessories that they already

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.540
had available to them.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.420
Now, my top three.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.220
Let's start with the
camera, because I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.610
think that's everybody's
top for Pixel, in general.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.950
And Pixel 3a is incredible.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.340
It shares the same
camera experiences

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.180
that you get on your Pixel
3 device, minus group selfie

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.390
mode.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.840
But, in general, you
get all the great stuff,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.240
starting with Night
Sight, which lets you take

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.550
incredible images in low light.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.410
My favorite is taking
pictures of my kids

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.577
when they're sleeping because
they sleep in the most

00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:30.387
awkward positions, but
you would be surprised

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:31.470
at the detail you can get.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.410
You can catch their bedspread,
their little stuffies,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.630
and that's without turning
any lights on in the room.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.090
It is truly incredible.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.503
On top of Night Sight, of
course you get Portrait Mode.

00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:43.170
So you can take those
incredible selfies

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.750
with that bouquet effect,
with that beautiful blurred

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.063
background.

00:03:47.063 --> 00:03:48.480
And we have a depth
editor, so you

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.310
can change and
adjust that just to

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.990
how you want to
see that picture.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.000
We also have Photobooth.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.120
Again, I'll say, savior
when you have kids.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.830
You just turn on the
Photobooth and it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.200
captures the picture when
they're both facing the camera

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.190
and smiling.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.620
That is a rare split-second
event anywhere.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.190
And Photobooth captures
it every single time.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.640
And that's also available
on the Pixel 3a.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.540
So, by far, the most
incredible thing on this device

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.380
is this camera.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.220
It's amazing.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.930
And finally, it has
unlimited storage,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.940
just like our Pixel 3 devices--

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.950
with high quality, though.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.850
My second favorite has
to be Google Assistant.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.410
Google Assistant is awesome.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.410
It saves time and
effort all day long.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.140
You just have to talk to
the phone to set reminders,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.250
get directions.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.850
It's super quick and easy.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.700
And when you're
on the go, that's

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.090
what you need, something that's
quick and easy and reliable.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.720
Finally, it also
has Call Screen.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.200
I don't know about you, but
I get a lot of spam calls.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.600
Call Screen is a savior.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.270
And with the power of Google
Assistant and Call Screen,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.590
I only pick up calls that
matter now, which is amazing.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.415
And the bonus?

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:02.743
You get to waste a little bit
of time of that spammer's time

00:05:02.743 --> 00:05:04.410
as they try to call
you and have to deal

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.868
with your little
automated message.

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:08.310
So I really appreciate
Call Screen.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.860
And then my final one
has to be battery life.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.530
We heard this loud and
clear from our research

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.350
that battery life is an issue.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.260
And we all feel this anxiety
of, like, oh no, I have 20%.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.690
Am I going to get
through the day?

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.160
We wanted to eliminate
battery anxiety,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.990
and I think we've done a
fabulous job on these devices.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.330
One, we beefed up the batteries,
so they're just bigger.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.060
On top of that, these both
support Adaptive Battery,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.420
which we introduced on our
Pixel devices earlier this year.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.730
And that just makes the
battery a little bit smarter

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.610
around how it's using the
power and extending it.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.710
And so these devices both get
up to 30 hours of battery life

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.420
on a full charge.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.390
On top of that, we put
a fast charger in box.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.070
That's an 18-watt
charger in the box.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.820
You can charge this
bad boy for 15 minutes

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.500
and get seven hours
of battery life,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.190
while you're, like, getting
ready to get out the door.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.590
Charge it and you have the
whole night available to you.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.860
It's pretty fantastic.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.030
So those would have
to be my top three.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.125
EMILY FORTUNA: That is
quite an impressive list.

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:11.970
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: Thanks.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.370
EMILY FORTUNA: I'd be curious
to learn a little bit more

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.840
about the camera itself.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.690
Can you tell me some
more of the specifics

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.040
on how it's able to create
all these cool effects?

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.540
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.320
So it starts with the hardware.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.720
The hardware that we've
picked for these cameras

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.640
is not mid-tier.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.080
It is premium hardware.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.260
In fact, the imager on the
rear is the exact same imager

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.570
that we use on our
premium devices.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.390
The front imager is also
the same normal field

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.310
of view imager that we use
for our premium devices.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.570
So we started with
really great raw images.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.990
From there, our magical
software team took over.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.310
They are phenomenal.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.720
And they really were put
to task on this phone

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.810
because, as you may
know, the phone has not

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.480
the same type of processing
power as our premium phones.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.725
It has the Snapdragon 670 in
it, versus the 800 series that

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:05.850
sits in our premium phones.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.330
So we've really condensed
their processing power,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.450
and they were still
able to deliver.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.280
They optimized every
last aspect of the camera

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.080
features to get them
to work on here.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.830
Each individual feature
was revisited by the team

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.060
to not only optimize
the algorithms,

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.900
but to optimize the
overall experience to work

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.030
on these particular devices.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.620
And they did it.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.370
They did a phenomenal job of
delivering those low software

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.272
features.

00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:37.980
EMILY FORTUNA: Thank
you so much, Soniya,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.550
for coming to talk to us
about the Pixel 3a and 3a XL.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.508
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: Thanks
for having me, Emily.

00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:44.430
It was really exciting
to talk about them.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.080
