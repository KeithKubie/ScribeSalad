00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:10.260
What is Amniotic Fluid Made Of?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.690
Essential for the development of a healthy
baby, amniotic fluid is a complex liquid that

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.680
nourishes, facilitates growth, cushions and
protects the growing fetus.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.550
Amniotic fluid begins to form almost as soon
as implantation of the egg occurs.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.640
Growing in volume at a rate faster than the
embryo at first, the initial water in the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.050
fluid comes from the mother’s blood plasma.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.010
As development progresses, so does the amount
of fluid: at 10 weeks, there should be approximately

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.340
25 ml of fluid, while at 20 weeks, there should
be about 400 ml (about 14 ounces).

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.970
Through the first five months, the amniotic
fluid’s composition will be similar to the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.820
fetus’ plasma, due in no small part to the
fact that the baby has yet to develop an outer

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.770
layer of skin filled with keratin (the protein
found in the outer skin layer that makes it

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.770
waterproof).

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.270
Keratinization (which begins at about 20 weeks
and is complete by 25 weeks) is a key moment

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.869
in the production of amniotic fluid, as after
it occurs, at 28 weeks, the amount of amniotic

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.180
fluid peaks and plateaus at about 800 ml.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.030
From this point, it will only decline until
it falls back down to about 400 ml at 42 weeks.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.500
Also after keratinization, the composition
of the fluid will be different, and will include

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.860
fetal urine, as well as secretions from its
mouth, nose and throat, lung fluid, etc.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.850
Throughout gestation, fluid moves in and out
of the baby and between the baby and the mother,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.360
allowing for changes in composition coinciding
with changes in development.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.960
During the latter half of a pregnancy, urea
and creatinine increase, while sodium and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.680
chloride will decrease.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.230
One of amniotic fluid’s primary purposes
is to nourish the fetus, and to do so, it

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.460
is filled with proteins, carbohydrates, lipids,
peptides, taurine, glutamine, lactate, pyruvate,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.390
electrolytes, hormones and enzymes, and these
circulate from the fluid into the fetus through

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.509
the skin, and later in development are swallowed
by the fetus and excreted by him or her.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.799
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming
growth factor alpha (TGF-a) and beta-1 (TGF-b1)

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.489
are also found in the fluid, as are insulin-like
growth factor I (IGF-I), erythropoietin (EPO)

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.209
and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF).

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.549
Of course, the fluid is also important in
cushioning and protecting the growing fetus,

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.239
and for the latter, it is filled with antimicrobial
peptides and enzymes to fight against potentially

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.230
invading viruses and bacteria.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.209
In addition, because the baby breathes in
the fluid, it is critical in helping the fetus’

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.209
lungs to develop.

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.849
Likewise, because the baby also swallows the
fluid, it is key to helping its digestive

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.370
system to mature.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.909
An average human fetus toward the end of a
full term can consume as much as 15 ounces

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.790
of fluid in a single day.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.709
The mechanical aspects of the fluid are also
important to the growth of bones and muscles,

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.079
as the fluid allows the baby to easily move
around, which helps it both develop and strengthen.

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.730
Furthermore, the simple act of lubricating
all parts of the baby helps keep the different

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.040
developing parts of the fetus from growing
together (think webbed toes).

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.049
From all this, you may not be surprised to
learn that having too little or too much amniotic

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.489
fluid can be a problem.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.699
Too little, called oligohydramnios, is usually
caused by a premature rupture of the membranes,

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:28.319
post-term pregnancy, poor fetal growth, certain
birth defects that affect the kidneys and

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.870
urinary tract and twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.409
It is discovered either via ultrasound or
when fluid is leaking from the sac, and treatments

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.260
are limited to an amnioinfusion or, simply,
delivering the baby.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.199
Oligohydramnios is the most worrisome if it
occurs during the first six months of pregnancy

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.549
and can cause birth defects, miscarriage,
stillbirth and premature birth.

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.090
If it happens during the last trimester, slow
fetal growth may occur, and a ceasarean birth

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.090
may be required.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.599
On the other hand, too much amniotic fluid,
called hydramnios, is caused by maternal diabetes,

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.260
gastrointestinal abnormalities in the fetus,
fetal swallowing problems, twin-to-twin transfusion

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.319
syndrome, a fetal infection and heart failure.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.150
The symptoms of hydramnios include a rapidly
growing uterus, maternal discomfort and even

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.489
contractions.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.359
Treatments include medications, amnioreduction
via amniocentesis and delivery.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.120
While mild hydramnios may cause no problems,
severe hydramnios can result in defects of

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:38.699
the brain and spinal column and blockages
of the digestive system.
