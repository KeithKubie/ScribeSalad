00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.770
As a startup it can be challenging
to set your marketing goals.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.520
You don't want to waste your time
on things that you'll do nothing

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.610
with later.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.420
This is why setting your goals is so
important.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.290
Consider this.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.940
&gt;&gt; Please tell me which
way to go from here.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.290
&gt;&gt; That depends a good deal
on where you want to go.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.670
&gt;&gt; I don't care much where.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.920
&gt;&gt; Then it doesn't much
matter which way to go.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.792
You're sure enough to get somewhere,
if only you walk long enough.

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:32.750
&gt;&gt; You need goals that are realistic and
attainable.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.310
It's fun to spend a few minutes
thinking about your vision and

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.990
high level goals, like to be the most
visible brand of the industry.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.480
Or, make sure every potential
user wants to talk about our app.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.750
But as a startup, you probably don't
have enough time to spend full weeks on

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.450
wording your high level goals.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.300
You'll want to jump into
your actionable objectives.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.758
I want you to take this opportunity to
quickly draft two actionable marketing

00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:55.043
goals for your own app idea.

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:59.400
There is no right or wrong answer here,
but we still encourage you to try it.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.330
If you don't have your own app,
help Lauren and

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.300
me by drafting two actionable
marketing goals for Embarkment.
