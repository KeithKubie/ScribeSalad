00:00:00.327 --> 00:00:02.086
- Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens,

00:00:02.086 --> 00:00:05.105
and I am a traveler, and a food lover.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.276
I am in Ho Chi Minh
City, Vietnam right now,

00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:08.969
which is also known as Saigon,

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.067
and this is just an
absolutely action-packed city

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:16.653
with so many things to
do, so many things to see,

00:00:16.653 --> 00:00:19.436
and so many delicious foods to eat.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.909
I'm going to be exploring
some of the best,

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.216
and most exciting, things to do

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:27.060
when you are in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.305
So, keep watching this video,
we are going to explore

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.128
this amazing city together,

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:33.438
and hopefully this video

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:35.320
will give you some great ideas

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.834
about some things that
you can do when you visit.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:41.084
(drumming)

00:00:47.992 --> 00:00:50.653
Right now, I'm at the Bình Tây Market.

00:00:50.653 --> 00:00:53.815
I think they have everything
here that you could want,

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:56.315
from clothes to food to snacks

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.908
and even like cookware,

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:02.293
this is a great place to buy cookware.

00:01:02.293 --> 00:01:03.754
But anyway, lots and lots of things

00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:04.977
available at this market

00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:06.619
and there's a beautiful
food court as well,

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.147
where you can stop to
eat breakfast or lunch.

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:10.698
It's kind of a square market,

00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:14.142
and then in the middle is a Chinese garden

00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:16.072
where you can come to relax.

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:19.096
This is a great market, I'm loving it.

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:21.846
(Oriental music)

00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:31.870
I'm at the Thiên Hâu Taoist Temple

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.097
in Saigon in Chinatown,

00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:36.697
and this is, I think this
is one of the biggest,

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:40.364
most well known and
important Taoist temples

00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:43.464
in this area of Saigon.

00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:49.224
Many people come here to
buy these coils of incense

00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:50.604
and then they hang them up.

00:01:50.604 --> 00:01:52.851
Whoa, a little piece of ash just,

00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:55.123
just fell down right beside me.

00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:56.448
As you can see a bunch of smoke

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:58.184
coming from the incense over there.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.934
(Oriental music)

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:08.346
I'm standing on the balcony now

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:10.555
of the Ho Chi Minh City Museum,

00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:12.501
which I think, I think
previously it was called

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:14.338
the Revolutionary Museum.

00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:17.622
But it's just 15,000 dong for entrance.

00:02:17.622 --> 00:02:19.085
Part of the beauty of the museum is just

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:21.295
the building that it's housed in,

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:23.241
which is a neoclassical building

00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:26.709
which I think was built in 1885.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.261
It's a beautiful building
and within the museum

00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:32.105
you can find all sorts of exhibitions

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:34.075
about the history of Ho Chi Minh City,

00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:37.891
as well as some Vietnamese cultural,

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.027
traditional exhibitions as well.

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:41.948
And it's a place that you can go to learn

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:45.421
about the history of Ho
Chi Minh City and Vietnam.

00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.171
(Oriental music)

00:02:51.446 --> 00:02:53.741
I'm at the Bitexco Financial Tower,

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.826
which is by far the
tallest building in Saigon

00:02:56.826 --> 00:02:58.288
making up the skyline.

00:02:58.288 --> 00:02:59.909
There are two options when you come here,

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.508
you can either go to the
sky, the Saigon Skydeck,

00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:05.914
which I think is on the 49th floor,

00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:08.855
or alternatively, you can go to a cafe

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.183
which is on the 50th floor.

00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:15.870
And you can buy a drink,
a drink or a snack there

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.356
and get the same great view.

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:20.562
So, I am on the 50th floor now

00:03:20.562 --> 00:03:25.506
and I just ordered up a little
cup of coffee, a ristretto.

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:27.199
Oh yeah, that is strong,

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.716
but the views from up
here are pretty amazing.

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:32.756
We're on the 50th story, of course so

00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:34.747
you've got a really nice view.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:38.107
Unfortunately this is
not the clearest of days

00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:39.881
I chose to come here.

00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:41.095
It's sort of raining, but

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:43.390
it's still a good view of the city.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.512
(Oriental music)

00:03:45.512 --> 00:03:47.888
I am at the Independence Palace,

00:03:47.888 --> 00:03:51.098
which is also known as
the Reunification Palace,

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:55.551
and this is right in the heart
of Saigon, Ho Chi Minh City.

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:59.173
One of the most important
attractions, landmarks.

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.762
But formerly it was
the main seat and house

00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:05.337
of the President of the
Republic of Vietnam.

00:04:05.337 --> 00:04:08.274
And now, they've turned
it more into a museum.

00:04:08.274 --> 00:04:09.989
Although they still, I think they still

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.489
use it for government meetings and events.

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:16.030
I think they're having actually a meeting

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.875
right now as we were inside.

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:21.213
But you can really go
to many different floors

00:04:21.213 --> 00:04:24.841
and the basement was probably the most,

00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:26.837
one of the most interesting parts.

00:04:26.837 --> 00:04:29.420
(Choral music)

00:04:34.376 --> 00:04:37.153
I am at the Notre Dame Cathedral,

00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:39.709
which is right in the
center of Ho Chi Minh City.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:42.581
And this is one of the
most important landmarks

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.896
and churches, Catholic cathedrals,

00:04:44.896 --> 00:04:47.660
built in the Neo-Romanesque style.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.341
The most noticeable features of the church

00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:53.424
are the 40 meter high towers, spires,

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.492
the duo of them on either side.

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:59.784
And this is a beautiful,
a beautiful cathedral

00:04:59.784 --> 00:05:02.930
and just a really great environment

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.431
here in Ho Chi Minh City,

00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:08.428
so this is a place you must
visit when you are here.

00:05:08.428 --> 00:05:11.011
(choral music)

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:19.424
Right now I am at the
Central Post Office in Saigon

00:05:19.424 --> 00:05:21.274
and it's actually right across the street

00:05:21.274 --> 00:05:23.624
from the Cathedral of Notre Dame.

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:25.109
One of the reasons it's very famous

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:28.374
is because the architect
was Gustave Eiffel,

00:05:28.374 --> 00:05:30.292
who also designed the Eiffel Tower,

00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:34.320
and actually you can buy a
post card to send it from here,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.448
but there's also some souvenirs.

00:05:36.448 --> 00:05:39.253
It's sort of turned into
a tourist attraction,

00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:42.780
but at the same time it's a
practical tourist attraction

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.818
and it's a really beautiful building.

00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:48.009
The wrought iron, green
wrought iron gates,

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.095
and what I also really like about inside

00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:52.678
is the beautifully tiled floor.

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:58.206
Right now I am at the War Remnants Museum,

00:05:58.206 --> 00:06:01.878
and it's actually very close
to the Independence Palace.

00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:05.711
This is not a fun, or
exciting place to visit,

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:10.603
but it is a place to come to pay respect

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:14.770
and to remember the brutal
history of the war in Vietnam.

00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:20.226
Outside are many displays of tanks

00:06:20.226 --> 00:06:23.642
and military weapons and vehicles.

00:06:23.642 --> 00:06:26.029
And then inside it's actually mostly

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.907
exhibitions of photography
showing the horrible events

00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:33.131
and the, just the terrible violence

00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:35.674
that was a result of the war.

00:06:35.674 --> 00:06:39.043
(somber music)

00:06:39.043 --> 00:06:42.291
I'm standing outside
the Saigon Opera House,

00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:44.085
which is one of the most recognizable

00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:47.114
landmark buildings in
all of Ho Chi Minh City,

00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:49.922
and it's a really beautiful building,

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:52.168
built in the French Colonial period.

00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:54.797
I think it was built in 1897,

00:06:54.797 --> 00:06:57.196
but they also still have a show here.

00:06:57.196 --> 00:06:59.228
So you can purchase
tickets to go to the show

00:06:59.228 --> 00:07:01.038
and then see the inside of it,

00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:02.973
or you can just see it from the outside

00:07:02.973 --> 00:07:05.402
and just admire the architecture

00:07:05.402 --> 00:07:07.519
and the French Colonial building.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:10.363
(French music)

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:13.032
Right now I am on Dong Khoi Street.

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:17.542
This is one of the most
famous streets in Saigon,

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:20.436
especially for its upscale shopping malls

00:07:20.436 --> 00:07:22.990
and boutiques and hotels.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.170
So if you're looking to
do some upscale shopping

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.765
and get some fresh designer wear,

00:07:27.765 --> 00:07:30.134
you definitely need to come and explore

00:07:30.134 --> 00:07:33.954
the Dong Khoi area in Ho Chi Minh City.

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:36.550
Alright I just came into the Saigon Zoo,

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.262
which is also on the same
property as the Botanic Gardens.

00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:44.833
So far it's just a really
beautiful, tree lined,

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:46.538
big huge trees.

00:07:46.538 --> 00:07:49.842
It's really lush and green and cool

00:07:49.842 --> 00:07:52.352
and quiet and peaceful in here compared to

00:07:52.352 --> 00:07:57.019
the loud, rowdy motor-scooter
filled roads outside.

00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:00.114
The zoo itself, the animal displays

00:08:00.114 --> 00:08:02.768
and cages are not fantastic.

00:08:02.768 --> 00:08:04.373
The animals don't look too happy,

00:08:04.373 --> 00:08:06.474
but definitely the grounds

00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:09.657
and the Botanic Gardens are beautiful.

00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:12.071
I think that's what's
worth coming here for

00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:13.717
is definitely the Botanic Gardens.

00:08:13.717 --> 00:08:16.071
Many people are like
relaxing on the grass,

00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:18.554
having picnics and taking naps.

00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:20.366
There are a few different
coffee shops around,

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.200
as well as places to eat ice cream,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.849
and even a full food court.

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:26.134
So I think this place is
definitely worth coming

00:08:26.134 --> 00:08:30.513
just to walk around the
really nice and lush gardens

00:08:30.513 --> 00:08:32.252
and to just take a break

00:08:32.252 --> 00:08:35.770
from the outside scooter, motor traffic.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.713
Alright, I am at the

00:08:36.713 --> 00:08:39.517
Museum of Traditional Vietnamese Medicine.

00:08:39.517 --> 00:08:42.261
I think she said it's
the first private museum

00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:44.259
in Saigon, or maybe even in Vietnam.

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:47.701
I mean it focuses on Vietnamese
traditional medicine,

00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:50.621
holistic medicine, lots of

00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:52.871
herbs and natural remedies.

00:08:53.747 --> 00:08:57.119
Vietnamese medicine is very
influenced by Chinese medicine,

00:08:57.119 --> 00:09:01.164
and yet at the same time
it pulls together medicine,

00:09:01.164 --> 00:09:04.182
Vietnamese medicine from the
north, as well as the south,

00:09:04.182 --> 00:09:07.013
and also throughout Vietnam.

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:11.514
This is just a very impressive,
peaceful and quiet museum.

00:09:11.514 --> 00:09:14.731
And I think this is a great place to visit

00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:16.228
when you're in Saigon.

00:09:16.228 --> 00:09:18.323
She said that I can try on

00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:22.490
some traditional Vietnamese
medicine man clothing.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.900
(drumming)

00:09:27.142 --> 00:09:30.035
I am a Vietnamese medicine man.

00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:32.678
Whoa, this thing is heavy.

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.576
You could lift weights with this thing.

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.826
(drumming)

00:09:39.802 --> 00:09:43.281
I am at the San Art Gallery in Saigon

00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:46.825
and this is one of the few independent,

00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:50.847
nonprofit art gallery,
creative spaces in the city.

00:09:50.847 --> 00:09:53.995
If you are a lover of art
when you come to Saigon,

00:09:53.995 --> 00:09:56.788
you should definitely check out one of,

00:09:56.788 --> 00:09:58.460
either the San Art Gallery

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.395
or there's another couple of art galleries

00:10:00.395 --> 00:10:03.641
as well in the city that
you should check out.

00:10:03.641 --> 00:10:06.224
(upbeat music)

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:10.317
We are at Turtle Lake, which is

00:10:10.317 --> 00:10:13.859
this roundabout right
in the heart of Saigon.

00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:17.256
And this is a very popular place for,

00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:19.319
especially young people to hang out.

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:23.156
It's so action packed,
but people are nice,

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:25.515
and people are just all
having a great time.

00:10:25.515 --> 00:10:27.984
I think that's, that's one of
the great things about Vietnam

00:10:27.984 --> 00:10:31.368
is that people, people
genuinely have a great time

00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:34.334
and enjoy socializing
and just hanging out,

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:36.937
and I think just enjoying life.

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:40.270
(upbeat Oriental music)

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.708
(traffic moving)

00:10:55.556 --> 00:10:57.772
Right now I am at Ben Thanh Market,

00:10:57.772 --> 00:11:01.226
which is right in the center of Saigon

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:04.430
and surrounded by a giant roundabout.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.522
This is one of the most
famous markets in the city.

00:11:07.522 --> 00:11:09.043
Basically everything you can imagine

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:13.553
is available to purchase
here, souvenirs, food.

00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:18.147
There are lots of like
dried fruit and snacks,

00:11:18.147 --> 00:11:20.798
and as well as there are
some food stalls as well.

00:11:20.798 --> 00:11:24.017
But this is a very central, Saigon market

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:27.855
that you should visit when you're in town.

00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:30.438
(upbeat music)

00:11:34.646 --> 00:11:38.687
I am in the Phu My Hung
area, or sort of a district.

00:11:38.687 --> 00:11:41.015
It's an upscale area of town,

00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:44.541
but it's also a newly
developed area of town.

00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:47.074
It's a really nice place to walk around.

00:11:47.074 --> 00:11:48.659
It has a totally different feel

00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:51.958
from the chaos of central Saigon.

00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.809
It's much more relaxed and

00:11:54.809 --> 00:11:57.620
not nearly as busy with traffic.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.656
One of the most famous things
is the Starlight Bridge,

00:12:00.656 --> 00:12:02.076
with a waterfall that lights up

00:12:02.076 --> 00:12:04.352
in a rainbow of different colors.

00:12:04.352 --> 00:12:06.173
That is supposed to be one of the

00:12:06.173 --> 00:12:08.707
most romantic places in Saigon.

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:10.921
So if you are looking for a great

00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:12.762
hang out, date spot,

00:12:12.762 --> 00:12:14.805
you might wanna check it out.

00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:17.388
(upbeat music)

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.928
I just bought my ticket to the Vietnamese

00:12:20.928 --> 00:12:22.932
traditional Water Puppet Show

00:12:22.932 --> 00:12:27.238
and I'm at the Golden
Dragon Water Puppet Theater.

00:12:27.238 --> 00:12:28.423
So now just waiting,

00:12:28.423 --> 00:12:31.317
my ticket is for the 6:30 pm performance

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:36.128
and I'm excited to see this
traditional art performance.

00:12:36.128 --> 00:12:38.878
(Oriental music)

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.645
I'm at the History Museum,
the Vietnamese History Museum.

00:13:08.645 --> 00:13:11.202
And it's actually right,
kind of in the same property

00:13:11.202 --> 00:13:14.040
as the Botanic Garden and the Saigon Zoo.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.257
The museum goes through
the history of Vietnam,

00:13:17.257 --> 00:13:21.698
starting from the Bronze
period, Bronze Age period.

00:13:21.698 --> 00:13:24.055
There are lots of pottery,

00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:26.305
lots of porcelain, weapons.

00:13:27.359 --> 00:13:30.733
Also inside the museum
there's a big collection of

00:13:30.733 --> 00:13:33.483
Angkor Wat sculptures and reliefs

00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:38.151
and stone, stone carvings.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:41.483
So I think that was probably
my favorite part of the museum.

00:13:41.483 --> 00:13:44.516
So if you are interested
in the history of Vietnam,

00:13:44.516 --> 00:13:47.731
as well as this whole
region of southeast Asia,

00:13:47.731 --> 00:13:49.033
this is a good museum

00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:51.050
for you to visit when you're in Saigon.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:52.720
(upbeat music)

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.293
I'm at Shri Restaurant and Lounge

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.026
and this is a beautiful rooftop restaurant

00:13:58.026 --> 00:14:00.859
and bar and lounge here in Saigon.

00:14:02.407 --> 00:14:04.552
I think we're on the 23rd floor

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.625
and there is just a wonderful
view of the skyline.

00:14:08.625 --> 00:14:10.850
But when you are in Saigon,

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.124
coming to a rooftop restaurant or bar

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:16.484
is a great thing to do.

00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:18.963
It's a relief to get away from the

00:14:18.963 --> 00:14:21.487
busy, congested streets of the city

00:14:21.487 --> 00:14:23.841
and to just hang out and relax.

00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:26.031
There are a couple of
different rooftop bars

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:28.659
and cafes that you can
visit when you're in Saigon.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:29.919
And it's a great way, yeah,

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:32.469
just to get away from
the chaos of the city

00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:36.798
and just to enjoy the
view and the relaxation.

00:14:36.798 --> 00:14:39.287
(upbeat music)

00:14:39.287 --> 00:14:42.419
I am at the Fine Arts
Museum of Ho Chi Minh City,

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:44.799
and actually I've been
walking around already

00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:47.015
and, actually I'm quite
impressed with the museum.

00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:48.501
It's very well done.

00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:52.723
There are lots of
exhibitions showcasing art,

00:14:52.723 --> 00:14:57.431
and especially paintings and
sculptures and lacquer work.

00:14:57.431 --> 00:14:59.973
From the ancient all the way

00:14:59.973 --> 00:15:03.059
to the modern, contemporary pieces.

00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:04.533
Part of the reason I'm so impressed

00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:06.685
is that it is housed in this

00:15:06.685 --> 00:15:10.852
wonderful, elegant and just a
beautiful Colonial building.

00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:15.682
So definitely, if you enjoy art,

00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:18.585
this is a museum you're
not gonna want to miss

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.423
when you're in Saigon.

00:15:20.423 --> 00:15:23.398
(Oriental music)

00:15:23.398 --> 00:15:27.458
I am at the Jade Emperor Pagoda in Saigon

00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:29.227
and this is one of the most important

00:15:29.227 --> 00:15:31.641
Taoist temples in the city.

00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:34.215
And you can walk around outside

00:15:34.215 --> 00:15:37.158
where there are some trees and pigeons

00:15:37.158 --> 00:15:39.635
and it almost has that
cave-like feel to it.

00:15:39.635 --> 00:15:43.409
It's kind of dark, incense fills the air.

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.516
And then you can also walk inside

00:15:45.516 --> 00:15:48.692
and walk around inside as well.

00:15:48.692 --> 00:15:51.359
(gongs chiming)

00:15:53.747 --> 00:15:56.914
(motorcycles buzzing)

00:15:59.074 --> 00:16:02.197
One of my favorite things to do in Saigon

00:16:02.197 --> 00:16:05.114
is to not only go to one of the big

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.375
famous markets like Ben Thanh, but I also,

00:16:09.375 --> 00:16:13.185
I think one of my favorite
things about Saigon and Vietnam

00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:16.640
are the amazing, local fresh markets

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.510
where you can just buy everything from

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.760
fish to vegetables to herbs to noodles.

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:26.981
Markets in Saigon are amazing.

00:16:26.981 --> 00:16:29.810
And you should definitely check
out a local, fresh market.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.609
Fresh Wet Market as well when you're here.

00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:36.276
(crowd talking)

00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:42.247
Easily my favorite thing
about being in Saigon,

00:16:42.247 --> 00:16:45.579
Ho Chi Minh City is just the absolute

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:48.648
sensational amount of food available.

00:16:48.648 --> 00:16:51.390
So you will find
Vietnamese food everywhere

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.373
from nice restaurants
to the side of the roads

00:16:54.373 --> 00:16:57.472
to some of my favorite
restaurants which are

00:16:57.472 --> 00:17:00.504
tucked away in quiet, peaceful alleys.

00:17:00.504 --> 00:17:02.829
Uh, friendly alleys.

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:07.105
And you'll just get
whiffs of delicious soup.

00:17:07.105 --> 00:17:10.938
You'll get bathed in
smoke from grilling meat.

00:17:13.163 --> 00:17:17.477
Basically every, every
sense you can imagine

00:17:17.477 --> 00:17:21.486
will be aroused by the
delicious food available here

00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:23.571
and it's just a never ending buffet

00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:27.619
of delicious things to try
and delicious things to eat.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.318
So when you are in Saigon,

00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:32.143
you just do not want to miss

00:17:32.143 --> 00:17:34.738
all of the delicious food available.

00:17:34.738 --> 00:17:36.988
(drumming)

00:17:45.422 --> 00:17:47.065
That brings us to the end of this video.
