1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,570
Okay. Today in the Times there was a
report of a clinical trial, which, uh,

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,860
event, that kind of thing
we talked about on Friday.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,570
This was of of a, of a stat in which
is like Lipitor, it's a different one,

4
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:19,650
it's crest door, but they just
reported that a study of 18,000 people.

5
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:23,680
So a very big clinical trial, uh,
seemed to show that this, that uh,

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,110
it help it reduce the risk
of heart attack by a half,

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,630
uh, for people who didn't have high
cholesterol but had another risk.

8
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,480
This c reactive protein CRP.

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,740
And it said in the story this morning,
like many clinical trials,

10
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:45,030
the Jupiter study was sponsored by a
pharmaceutical company. In this case,

11
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,080
Astrazeneca,

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,850
it makes the drug in the trial receive
a stat and which is sold as crest door.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,530
And then it says doctor Ridker
co-inventor have a CRP test,

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,000
said he first sought federal financing
for the study and was turned down.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,720
He and other scientists interviewed for
this article except for doctrine able,

16
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:04,441
Dr. Gardner,

17
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:09,441
Dr. Wolfe have consulted for or received
research money from staton makers.

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,040
I guess I should say that
I've occasionally gotten
money from Staten makers too,

19
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:18,060
but not for this kind of thing. Uh, okay.

20
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:20,790
So That's interesting and relevant
to what we're talking about.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,140
But specifically what we're
talking about now is nomenclature.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,250
And last time we talked about
constitutional nomenclature,

23
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:33,690
the rules people made up for naming
the nature and sequence of bonds.

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,600
But since arrangement in
space is also important,

25
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,750
you have to be able to have
names for Stereo Chemistry.

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,820
And right now we're
interested in configurational
stereochemistry, the kind that,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,110
uh, can only be changed
by breaking bonds, right?

28
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:54,090
Whereas as we'll see soon, conformational
changes don't require breaking bonds,

29
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,550
so typically are much easier to do.

30
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,280
So configurational isomers include the
tartaric acids that we've been speaking

31
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:06,870
about that have these physical properties.
Uh, one has a unique melting point,

32
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:07,950
the other two are the same,

33
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:12,951
but those two differ by the sign of the
optical rotation of polarized light.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,180
So the first one is, is, uh, Misa.
Now how do we name these things?

35
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,800
One way is just to name them according
to the phenomenon, to what you observe.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,050
So sometimes those,

37
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,170
those two tartaric acids that are
enantiomers mirror images of one another,

38
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:33,570
but not super imposable,
not super imposable,

39
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,010
sometimes they're referred
to as small D or small l,

40
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,780
which stands for Dextro or
Livo and means right or left.

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,410
And all it means is the direction they
rotate the plane of polarized light,

42
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:49,600
which you observe experimentally.
So there's nothing, uh,

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,140
more arcane about that.

44
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,320
Or you can say plus or minus,

45
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:58,980
meaning that they rotate light to the
right or rotate light to the left.

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,870
And those are absolutely the same thing,
right?

47
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,320
Dextro and plus Livo and minus.

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,830
Sometimes people use both names,
but they're redundant.

49
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,130
They both mean that rotates
light one way or the other.

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,110
So it just describes the phenomenon.

51
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,190
So there's nothing ambiguous about that.

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,810
It's a perfectly good name,

53
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,920
but it doesn't tell you what model you
should make to show it which mirror

54
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,740
images, which all you know is
which way it rotates light.

55
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,570
So that's phenomenal logical.

56
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,560
But there can be other names that have
to do with these Fisher projections.

57
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,350
We draw as to exactly which one is which.

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,830
So that one is clear enough that one has
a mirror image is its own mirror image.

59
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,850
There's a mirror that goes
through the middle of it.

60
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,720
So the top is the mirror image of the
bottom. It's mere image of itself.

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,490
And that one's clearly the Mezzo,
right? But how about the others?

62
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,550
One of them will look one
way and one the other,

63
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,850
but is there any fundamental thing that
we can understand that would tell us

64
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,420
which we'll rotate light to the right
and which will rotate light to the left.

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,600
And I'll tell you that I can say that.

66
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,210
And most people I know, in fact almost
everybody I know can't say that,

67
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,430
but there are a few people who think they
can say that and we'll hear about one

68
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:22,240
of them soon, now on Wednesday.
But anyhow, it's a question,

69
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,840
is it like should it be though those for
the right and the left handed the d and

70
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:30,400
the l or those, which one is which? Well,

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,510
uh,

72
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,800
Fisher decided that we'd just have to
have names for this and we have to be able

73
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:39,430
to draw pictures. So let's make
a guess as to which way it is.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,210
And he devised a new,
uh, system of naming,

75
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,310
which doesn't depend on the
phenomenon but depends on genealogy.

76
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,560
That is synthesis.

77
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,160
You take a compound
like Glycerin Aldehyde,

78
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,910
which is small d and plus,
what does that mean?

79
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,820
DDI and plus for this,

80
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,540
there's a particular bottle of Palliser
Aldehyde which has that constitution,

81
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,190
right? And we're going to label it
d plus. And what does that mean?

82
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,220
Zach
rotates light to the right,

83
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,420
but we don't know exactly
how we should draw it, right?

84
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,050
Which the structure or its mirror image.
So,

85
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,100
and D and plus here, remember
our redundant, they joke
both just being at low.

86
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:30,850
Tate rotates light to the right,
but Fisher went further.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He defined that particular
glyceride Aldehyde as capital d.

88
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,810
There's a difference between
capital d and Small D.

89
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,790
Capital d is the names he used.
And that big Douglas or Aldehyde,

90
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,730
he guessed the one that
rotates light to the right.

91
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,100
He guests had that structure,

92
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,550
which when drawn with a Fischer
projection is that structure.

93
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,510
So that's just a guess. So we, this
is now gives us a starting point.

94
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,060
This Melissa Aldehyde,

95
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,520
which I'm going to call capital D
and I'm guessing has that structure.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,760
I might be 100% wrong, right?
It might be the other one.

97
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,480
But let's just make this gas and then
we'll be able to talk about everything.

98
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,280
So what could you talk about?

99
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,690
You could do a multistep
synthesis in which the carbon,

100
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,310
the carbon is connected by the
arrows are the same carbon that is,

101
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,930
you redo the top half of the
molecule by doing chemical reactions.

102
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:29,060
The parts in Greek,
the part that's in green.

103
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,390
So Cho becomes that much
more complicated thing,

104
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,660
but you leave in tact
that carbon on the bottom.

105
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,840
So it's the same in tartaric acid
as it was in Douglas or Aldehyde,

106
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:42,860
whatever that was.

107
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,670
And we'll guess it's this one with the
Oah on the right is everybody with me,

108
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:47,930
with the guests he made.

109
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,810
So now if you could make that particular
tartaric acid isomer from d capital d

110
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,940
glycerin Aldehyde,
then you say that that's capital d

111
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,620
tartaric acid because you could
make it from Douglas or Aldehyde.

112
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,010
Any questions about that?

113
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,660
So it's just what you make for what if
you could make it from a d compound,

114
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,700
you call it a d compound, and the
mirror image would be the l compound,

115
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,120
Capitol Hill,
Claire

116
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,100
[inaudible],

117
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,740
just swapping policing the green squares,

118
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,723
the errors in them,

119
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,880
the swap,

120
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,000
the thing that's then the green square
on the bottom becomes the stuff in the

121
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,220
green square on the top.

122
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,160
Obviously you have to add another
carbon and you have to add a couple of

123
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:40,510
hydrogens and some more oxygens. So you
have to do some chemical transformations.

124
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,660
But the important thing is that the
thing of the top becomes the thing on the

125
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,350
top,

126
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,820
and the carbons connected by the
Arrow are precisely the same carbon.

127
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,460
Right. Okay. So that one, you know,

128
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:55,840
because you know where it came from
by genealogy, so that tartaric acid,

129
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,600
you'll call capital d according to Fisher,

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,760
but do you see a weakness
in this nomenclature scheme?

131
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,410
Yeah, sure. What is dependent
on your knowledge of this?

132
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,340
Well,
of course it could be 100% wrong.

133
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,060
Everything could be the mirror image
of what we thought it was right.

134
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:23,330
That's clearly a problem and that
was well recognized by Fisher,

135
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,860
but maybe I didn't understand your
question. Did I know that? That's okay.

136
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,750
Does anybody see another weakness?
Sam?

137
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,810
Capital d isn't very descriptive.

138
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,870
It's certainly not descriptive
of the structure accepted.

139
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,080
Unless you know what Douglas or
Aldehyde is, then it's descriptive,

140
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,040
but it's not descriptive alone.
It's only relative, right?

141
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,030
It's only relative to the Douglas or
Aldehyde and you have to know how that

142
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,350
relationship works.

143
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,290
Yeah.

144
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,190
For example,

145
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:54,660
someone else by go into lab and they want
to prepare tartaric acid from Douglas

146
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,330
or what might the other person do?

147
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,620
Lucas,
I can prepare it a different way.

148
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,300
So somebody else might put that carpet
into the one on the top and change the

149
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,200
brown ones.

150
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:11,631
Right.

151
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:14,840
There could be other transformations you
do that would change the carbon on the

152
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:18,770
bottom to the carbon on the bottom and
the carbon on the top is now the same as

153
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:23,460
the one on Glycerin Aldehyde, right?
In which case it would be exactly, uh,

154
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,520
that one on that one on the left would
be named capital d if you made it that

155
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:32,300
way. Everybody see the genealogy
would just be different.

156
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,620
Okay?

157
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,310
Okay.

158
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,810
So there's a fundamental problem here
that the capital d capital l designation

159
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,020
is ambiguous without having sub detailed
synthesis recipe or sub grievance that

160
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:49,560
people say, we'll always make things
this way rather than another way, right?

161
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,800
So it's not,
doesn't have meaning on its own.

162
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,740
You have to know exactly
how you [inaudible]

163
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,860
you made the transformation. So that's
a pretty cumbersome way to do names.

164
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:02,780
But that's what was done for 60
years, right? Those were the names,

165
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:07,580
capital d and capital l or sugars,
for example, for amino acids.

166
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,073
Okay?

167
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,750
And it's relative and it's
an it based on a guess.

168
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,000
But in 1950,

169
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:20,630
things changed because at 1950,

170
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:24,860
a man named by foot, uh, an x ray
crystallography for it. You tracked,

171
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,010
in fact working in the
van Hoff Laboratory,

172
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:33,011
the same building in which van Hoff did
the things in 1874 by foot determined

173
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,110
the crystal structure of
sodium rubidium salt. Remember,

174
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:41,780
they're two carboxylic
acids and tartaric acid.

175
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,310
So the sodium rubidium
assault of d small d,

176
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,520
capital l tartrate.
What does a small d mean,

177
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,293
Andrew?

178
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,760
It rotates the plane of polarized
light or twists it to the right.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,800
And what does the capital l mean?

180
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,390
Alison said previously,
we said it resonated.

181
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,940
I couldn't hear very well previously.
It was,

182
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,440
we assumed that it would read
through. No, that's not true.

183
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,000
All right.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,170
Maybe I didn't understand previously
what you love the model we you're just

185
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:20,260
talking about,
right?

186
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,630
It's what we've talked about with Fisher
that Pete was able to make this tar

187
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:28,631
tare Cason from l Glycerin Aldehyde from
the day where of what we talked about

188
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,710
before. So it was related
by that particular synthesis
to Elvis around Aldehyde.

189
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,510
So there's no conflict
between say, D and L, right?

190
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,820
It rotates light to the right.
That's the small one.

191
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,380
But it's geologically related
to El Glycerin Aldehyde. Okay.

192
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,960
But he was able to use a very special time

193
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,570
x-ray technique called
anomalous dispersion,

194
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,010
which we don't have time
to talk about right now,

195
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,030
but it was able to show exactly
which way the Adams were oriented.

196
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,410
And this is the picture he drew.
Right?

197
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,770
So clearly on the top is
seat seat two o's, right?

198
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,680
Carboxylate group on the
bottom of Carbox slate group.

199
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,210
The middle two carbons each have an
h and n o on them. The O is stippled,

200
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:16,420
so you'll see what it is and it's clear
the way he draws what's coming out,

201
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,570
why he drew at what's coming out
toward you and what's going back in.

202
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,670
Now here's a swat.

203
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,150
Fisher had guessed 60 years
before for El tartrate.

204
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,900
What he called El Tartrate was Fisher,
right or wrong.

205
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,620
How about the top carbon
that has o h on the H,

206
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,080
c o. H? Is it the same as
in, in the model that, uh,

207
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,120
that by foot published
is does it agree or not?

208
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,430
Yes, it agrees the Oah is coming
out towards you and to the right.

209
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,480
Same as in fishers. Picture of the
top carbon. Everybody got that?

210
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,850
How about the bottom of carbon?

211
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,060
The bottom carbon Fisher has go into
the left and by foot has it go into the

212
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,820
right. This one here, right?

213
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,390
That's going to the right from this
carbon Fisher's drawing it to the left.

214
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,490
Did they disagree?

215
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,283
Who said something?

216
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,850
Do they agree or disagree

217
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,420
that funny you say?
Uh,

218
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,750
what does Fisher means by this bond here?
The CH bond,

219
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,290
which isn't going out toward you.
The H or back in,

220
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,900
okay.

221
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,880
The official projection,
which is shown here.

222
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:48,860
It's got vertical bonds and horizontal
bonds. Which one is coming out for you?

223
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,694
From the carbon.

224
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,210
Okay. Somebody else? Uh, yeah. Hey,

225
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,650
which bonds?
Bonds?

226
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,320
The carbon carbon bonds are going into
the board. That's Fisher's convention.

227
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,193
Yeah,

228
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,510
because I trusted them and
so that everybody knows.

229
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,460
Yeah. So these two are coming out on the
board. How about in by floods? Picture

230
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,220
for the second car. The second
department. Here's the first one.

231
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:26,190
Here's the second one.
Aha.

232
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,320
So to make it like fish or you have to
rotate it so they're coming out of the

233
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:34,650
board. So in fact, they do
agree, right? It's just that, uh,

234
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,730
by foot is made realistically and,
and uh,

235
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,050
and fissures was made with these rubber
tubing bonds and you had the bend it to

236
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:46,760
get it that way. But it's the same
configuration. So Fisher was right.

237
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,463
So these structures

238
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,820
cheers that had been drawn for 60 years.
We're drawn. Right. They could have,

239
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:56,000
it was a 50 50 chance that it could
have been the other way around,

240
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,320
but thank God he was right so we don't
have to go back and correct everything

241
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,100
and then know whether things were
written before 1950 or after 1950

242
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,053
yeah.

243
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,460
You'll just the LSP,
that's like each bed.

244
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,190
Is John me out of the door?
Does that go back?

245
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,250
Okay. If you rotate this molecule by
180 degrees around the vertical axis,

246
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,020
then this carbon with respect to
the carbon we're interested in here,

247
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,220
this carbon will be going back
into the board and this carpenter,

248
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,920
we're going back into the board.
That's the way these are, right?

249
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,860
But in the process, that
rotation, this, Ooh,

250
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,960
that was back into the right after a 180
degree rotation about the vertical axis

251
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,150
will be out in front and to the left,

252
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,000
which is the way it's drawn
in the Fisher project.

253
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,730
It would be good that,

254
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,690
oh yeah, but you don't care. This is
just a show that couldn't configuration.

255
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:52,810
Right. When you do that rotation. Yeah,
these will, these will do the other.

256
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,190
But the point is that Fisher structure
was right with respect to each carbon

257
00:15:57,191 --> 00:16:01,840
about what's going, which way, which
tetrahedron it is. Okay. So that's fine.

258
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,470
And then by foot wrote are
in the same paper he wrote.

259
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,560
The question of nomenclature is
beyond the scope of our investigation.

260
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:15,240
He's just doing the x ray
to find out which way it is.

261
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,540
The problem of nomenclature now
concerns given confirmations.

262
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:25,881
Now you know which one it is you want
to show and requires a notation which

263
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:30,780
denotes these configurations in
an unambiguous and if possible,

264
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,180
self explanatory way.

265
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,150
So you don't need to know how
it was synthesized or anything.

266
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:38,670
Now you know how it really is,
right?

267
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,540
What name are you going to give to it
so people can know just from the name

268
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,890
which way it is.

269
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,580
Now this is related to the idea of naming
configurations involving double bonds.

270
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,090
So we're going to first
show you how you do that,

271
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,150
which actually came second and then
we'll go back to see how they named the

272
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:03,780
configuration at a tetrahedral
carbon. So malic acid from, from uh,

273
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,450
apples has that structure shown.
And if you heat it,

274
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,580
you lose water and get a double bond.

275
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:12,600
But you get two isomers
mallaig and few Merrick acids.

276
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,480
And you'll remember we showed that
before that Vantiff made those with his

277
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:19,314
models.

278
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,550
And one of them has the two coh is near
one another and one has the farther from

279
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:28,551
one another and we can draw them that
way as well near on the left and far on

280
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:32,670
the right.
And if you heat these molecules further,

281
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:39,170
the one on the left can lose water and
foreman and hydride but not the one on

282
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:41,880
the right.
Why not the one on the right?

283
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,850
It's pretty obvious, Russell,
they're too far apart.

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,990
So you know which one
they're close together

285
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,940
and which one they're far apart.
So that experiment proves which is switch,

286
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:57,720
it's not as hard as the case of the right
and left hand where you had to do this

287
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,490
very special ex-ray technique.

288
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,500
So it was known that maleic acid was
the one that can form an anhydrite and

289
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,580
therefore it had him on the same side.
And that was called sis,

290
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,440
meaning on this side of,
and the other one was called trans across.

291
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,840
So that was a perfectly good
nomenclature for these two isomers of the

292
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,850
dehydrated malic acid.

293
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:24,990
Maleic was sis and fumaric acid was trans.

294
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,050
So these names were used
for a very long time,

295
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,660
but they weren't really good names.

296
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,040
And the reason you can see by
looking at this molecule is this one,

297
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:39,960
would you call it CIS or trans?
Same side or opposite side.

298
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,340
Andrew, what do you say next day, Andrew?

299
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,990
This is our nomenclature problem.

300
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,270
Would you call it trans?
You say

301
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,063
this one here.

302
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,133
Why?

303
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,950
Because the ch three is are next
to one another. So you might,

304
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:20,060
Paul insist on the other end if you want
it to say how this ad is related to the

305
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:24,460
acid, you'd say it's trans,
right? So that means it's the,

306
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,630
as an absolute

307
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,750
naming nomenclature,

308
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:29,870
it's very hard to generalize this
because you have to know which one you're

309
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:32,240
picking to say it's CIS or trans.

310
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,510
It's fine to talk about the
relative configuration to
say the methyl on the left

311
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:42,710
is sis to the methyl on the right or to
say the methyl on the left is trans to

312
00:19:42,711 --> 00:19:44,960
the COO.
H that's fine.

313
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,910
But as a as to whether to say the
molecule itself is cis or trans,

314
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:53,030
you have to know which one you're
talking about on the right.

315
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,060
So that's another thing where you,

316
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,340
you're going to have to have
some convention or something.

317
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,190
And the way people
decided to do it was this,

318
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,540
you assign the groups at each end,
took one end,

319
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,110
and then the other end of the
double bond and assign priority.

320
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,580
So you say we're going to give higher
priority to one group or the other and

321
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,500
that's the one we're
going to use for the name.

322
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,490
So on what basis might you
assign a priority to a group?

323
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,450
Say which group has higher priority?
C h three or h,

324
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,250
which one do you think should have
higher priority? C H three. Okay.

325
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,000
How about on this n c h three or Coa,
which should have higher priority.

326
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,120
Why? It's heavier. Okay.

327
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,990
Now let's think about how that,
how that was gonna work out.

328
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,090
So we'll assign of by atomic
number or atomic weight.

329
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,950
If we have two that are different
isotopes of one another, right?

330
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,330
But we won't,

331
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,500
we won't sell up the atomic numbers of
all the groups that are in that. That is,

332
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:00,520
we want some up c and o
and o and h and c and d,

333
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,040
three H's.
Why not sum them all up and then

334
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,650
see which one has higher total atomic
number. What's wrong with that?

335
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,600
Perfectly well defined.
It's tedious.

336
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,850
It's cumbersome to have to add it all up.
So what you,

337
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:17,220
what rule are you going to do?

338
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,490
You'll go until you find a difference.
Go out until you find a difference.

339
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:28,230
Once you find a difference, you stop. So
you don't have to go everywhere. Okay?

340
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,390
So at the first difference,

341
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,730
the same as we said with numbering
last time, right? Okay. So on the left,

342
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,240
in each case you have a carbon compared
to a hydrogen is the thing that's

343
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,730
immediately attached.
Carbon has higher priority,

344
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,270
higher atomic number on the right.
It,

345
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,870
it begins with the Thai.
Incidentally,

346
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,070
we're going to have to deal with
double bonds, Coh and provato. Right?

347
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,730
The way you do it just by convention,
there's nothing,

348
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,980
God didn't write this on the tablets,
right?

349
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,750
It's you just pretend that there are two,
two of those atoms.

350
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:06,930
When there's a double
bond, just pretend. Okay,

351
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:11,490
so now we compare the top of the
bottle. If we go to the, the first step,

352
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,860
it's carbon versus carbon.
It's a tie.

353
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,660
So we're going to have to go further.
Why don't we go to the next level?

354
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,800
We see on the left it's
oxygen versus hydrogen, right?

355
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,830
And oxygen is higher.
We don't have to go any further.

356
00:22:24,831 --> 00:22:28,250
We found a difference so forget
the rest of it. Everybody with me?

357
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,380
Okay,

358
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,580
so we say we might say the one on the
left is trans and the one on the right is

359
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:36,650
sis.
However,

360
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,980
people for 60 years or longer in this
case have been used in the name CIS and

361
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,340
Trans to mean one thing or another
and sometimes will agree with them and

362
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:47,330
sometimes we don't,

363
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,100
which is going to cause great confusion
as to whether you're using a pre 1950

364
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:57,101
name or a post 1950 name and at least
half the compounds are going to be wrong.

365
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,310
Right.

366
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,900
So the names trans insists that have
been polluted by previous usage.

367
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:06,530
So we're going to have to have new
names. Yeah, Lucas [inaudible],

368
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,990
you've mural duplicate all those as well.
Okay.

369
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,650
Okay. So this one was used with a German
root cause. The guys from Switzerland,

370
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,680
we're doing this and Gagan which means
a posed and the one on the right,

371
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:31,050
so it's e when they're trans,
when they're opposite one another,

372
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,610
and when they're adjacent to one another,
it's called together Suzanne Z.

373
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,410
I've always thought this is a real pity
that it wasn't the other way around.

374
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:45,411
So I hope this doesn't confuse you because
these are on the same side and these

375
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:45,980
are on

376
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,150
opposite sides. Right. But
it's just backwards from that.

377
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:53,300
So just to remember that it's unfortunate.
Okay,

378
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,860
so z beads together and he means apart.
Okay,

379
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:02,390
that's the name we use for there. Okay.
Now notice that in assigning priority,

380
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:06,950
as we said, just to Belabor this a little
bit, you proceed one shell at a time,

381
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,000
so,

382
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
so we saw a tie when it was carbon versus
carbon and when it was three oxygens

383
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:16,040
versus three hydrogens,
it was obvious that the top wins,

384
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,180
but now let's go to this case.
Okay,

385
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:24,320
now carbon versus carbon,
that's a tie. We go out further.

386
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,760
Three oxygens beat a carbon
and two hydrogens, right?

387
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,260
But there's chlorine
is on the bottom right?

388
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,470
The chlorine is really high priority,
right?

389
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,820
But it's irrelevant because the
decision has already been made.

390
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,780
So you respect earlier decisions,
right?

391
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:48,020
You only go as far as you need
to go to see a difference. Okay.

392
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,310
I think we've said that enough.

393
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,650
Now these are the guys that invented
the scheme to name handedness, the,

394
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,740
it's called the CIP priority scheme and
the C is our s con and the eye is CK in

395
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,940
gold.
Both of them are from Britain.

396
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,590
And the P is a lot of mere
prayer log who's in Switzerland,

397
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:15,560
although he's a native of, uh, Yugoslavia.

398
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,520
Now, uh, these were many people,

399
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,900
particularly synthetic chemists would
consider Robert Robinson and RB Woodward,

400
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:31,580
the greatest Chem organic
chemists of the 20th century. Uh,

401
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,900
they both thought they were probably
the greatest individual one. Right.

402
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,170
So I love this picture taken by Jack
Roberts of them at a seminar at MIT around

403
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,820
this same time, uh, because they sort
of aren't looking at one another. Right?

404
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,460
What's Robinson looking at?

405
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,180
Robinson is looking at in gold who'd
be really despised and vice versa.

406
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,380
Right? There was no love lost
between in gold and, and Robinson.

407
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,903
Uh,

408
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,480
and this is illustrated by an account
that pray log gave in his autobiography,

409
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,890
he encountered, uh, Robinson
in the airport in Zurich.

410
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,730
Robinson was on his way to a
meeting in Israel. Robinson.

411
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:21,560
Hello Kucharski what are you
doing here in Zurich? Pray Log.

412
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:25,520
Excuse me, Sir Robert. I am
only pray log. I live here.

413
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,530
He got a Nobel prize to pray log.
I'm only pray log and I live here.

414
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,720
Robinson,
you know,

415
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:37,721
pray log your an in gold's
configurational notation is all wrong.

416
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,980
Pray Long, sir. Robert. It can't
be wrong. It's just the convention.

417
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,320
You either accept it or not.

418
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,980
Well then if it's not wrong, it's
absolutely unnecessary. Okay?

419
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,270
So anyhow, it's the point of this
slide is that it's a convention.

420
00:26:57,271 --> 00:27:01,090
There's not right and wrong about it.
It's that they proposed rules and that's,

421
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,180
those are the rules that
people have adopted.

422
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,310
And that's how you give a name to the
absolute configuration of a stereo Magenic

423
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:11,490
carbon.
And for fun for Wednesday,

424
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:15,150
you can try this exercise
going back to this, uh,

425
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,300
this medieval manuscript and using
the figures in it to devise your own

426
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,890
convention to describe Kira Allity.

427
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,700
So you can put yourself in the
position of con in gold and pray log.

428
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,650
Okay,
so here's the con in gold.

429
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:36,330
Pray Log s nomenclature scheme
for stereo genic centers.

430
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,330
First you have to decide
on each of these carbons,

431
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,000
which are mirror images you see of one
another, which Adams have which priority.

432
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,620
So let's start on the left.

433
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,510
What's the highest priority for a
substituent on the central carbon?

434
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,350
Therefore groups,
which has the highest priority?

435
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,450
Which one? Sorry. Oh,

436
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,850
h o o is the highest atomic number.
What's the lowest

437
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,890
h? Right? Uh, there's also a d there.

438
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,470
So same atomic number,
hydrogen and deuterium.

439
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,350
Which one should be higher? Deuterium?
Tyrians heavier. If it's isotopes,

440
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:27,240
you take the heavier one.
Okay. So here's one, four,

441
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,520
three, two, right?

442
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,900
That's the priorities and
analogously on the right.

443
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,970
And now we have to decide whether
there, which one to call, right?

444
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,720
And which one to call left.
And the way you do it,

445
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,580
one way of doing it is to take a,
a thing like this where I have uh,

446
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,470
these uh, red, yellow, green, blue,

447
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,940
red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, right? The order of the
spectrum, red, yellow, green,

448
00:28:56,941 --> 00:29:00,450
blue. And I make a spiral
that connects them like that.

449
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,860
And now is that conventionally what
you call a right handed or left hand in

450
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:09,270
spiral? You know, if you look
at it, if I turned it like this,

451
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,880
it would move this way,
right?

452
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,860
So screws are called right
handed and left handed screws.

453
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,940
And the reason is that the,
that the or the, you know,

454
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,670
toe bone connected to the
foot bone kind of thing,

455
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,640
the way your arm is put together
for right handed people,

456
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,520
it's easier to drive a screw like this,
right?

457
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,490
So that's conventionally called
her right hand and screw.

458
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,330
So this you would call right handed,
okay?

459
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,400
Now if you can't remember from how to
turn a screwdriver, uh, you can look at,

460
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:41,980
you can do

461
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,450
this trick with your hand.

462
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,900
You put your thumb along the direction
of the lowest priority hydrogen in this

463
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,320
case. So it's coming out of the board,
right? And you curl your fingers,

464
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,510
right? And you notice it goes
one, two, three, and then four.

465
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,190
So that one on the left, his left hand
that everybody, see how I did that?

466
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,440
Curl your fingers. They go
one, two, three, four. Okay,

467
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,090
so that's a lefthanded one. The one on
the right, if you, you do it this way,

468
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,060
you put that, so that's,
and you call it not left.

469
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,330
You call it ass for the Latin sinister.

470
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,940
So it's not going to get
confused with D and l.

471
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:25,000
And so on that have already been used.
It's a new way of doing it.

472
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,610
So that was s and the one on the right,
if I put my thumb,

473
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,260
so it goes back toward
the h and curl my fingers.

474
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,550
I go from one to two to three.
Okay,

475
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,620
so that one is called r
four rectus Latin for right.

476
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,610
Okay. Now there's another there.
There are lots of tricks to do this.

477
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:48,450
If you don't like you doing it that
way, you can do it this way. Uh,

478
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,670
pretend that this is a steering wheel
of a car and the h is going back in.

479
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,150
All right? So here on
this one, on the right,

480
00:30:58,151 --> 00:31:01,330
I'm sitting here driving the car like
this and the h is going away from me.

481
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:05,740
Everybody got that? And I noticed
that I go one, two, three,

482
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,680
right? That's going to turn the car
to the right. Everybody see that?

483
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,240
So this one will turn the car to the left.
If I,

484
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,960
if I turn the wheel to
go from oh to C to d,

485
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,300
okay? So that one's a left turn
and that one's a right turn.

486
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,120
So whatever works for you is fine.

487
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,230
And I can assure you that on some tests
I'm going to look out and see people

488
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:35,230
with their papers there and
so on. And they're going to
be going like this, right?

489
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,300
How's, that's a handy way
to do it. Handy. Okay, so,

490
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,420
so let's try it on tartaric acid here.

491
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,130
Let's do the top carbon of tartaric acid.
Okay?

492
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,140
So we've got to decide on the priority
of the groups here. Here's one group,

493
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,320
another group, another group, another
group, which is the highest priority.

494
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,370
Oh, H is the highest,
right? Oh, as the highest.

495
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:04,720
Now we've got two carbons that are tied.
Which one's gonna win top or bottom?

496
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,390
W pop. You sayK , five

497
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,360
times
three oxygens.

498
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,220
And only one oxygen. Right? So the one
on the top has ox, not, not more oxygens,

499
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,500
but it's got the oxygen's nearer.
Okay? So we don't have to go as far.

500
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,000
So this is going to be one,
two, three, four. Okay?

501
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:34,570
Now let me see your hands. Operating. Put,

502
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,460
put a farm along with the age,

503
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,190
the direction the h goes
and curl your hands.

504
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,360
One right top. Bottom one, two, three.

505
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,640
And tell me whether that's
right or left handed.

506
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,873
Okay.

507
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,110
How many big collapse?

508
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:05,090
How many think rice is a democracy? The
right have, but they're also correct.

509
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,710
Okay.

510
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,710
That was one or two or three
that it's right handed.

511
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,260
And the bottom ones also right handed her.
What is,

512
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:18,470
I have to take a lot of time to have
you do this. To do the bottom one.

513
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,430
Why does the bottom one follow
if you know the top one?

514
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,110
Because you can rotate the thing 180
degrees and it's the same and that will

515
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:29,810
change the top end of the bottom.
So whatever the top is,

516
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,160
the bottom is the same thing.

517
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,550
So the name of this is in parentheses
to our carbon two is our carbon three is

518
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:43,151
also are then dash two three dihydroxy
dihydroxy butane dial awake acid.

519
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,460
Okay. So now we have a steam that does
that and not as, this is the, uh, the,

520
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:55,970
the uh, gate into the new chemistry
building just up the prospect street.

521
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,570
And it's got things that,

522
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,130
that relate to the different
branches of chemistry on it.

523
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,230
And this one is those carbon tetra heater
with the spiral on it that says which

524
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,950
handedness it is. They're both
right and left handed once there.

525
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,760
Okay. Now, Ras advisor [inaudible].

526
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,170
If you start with a molecule,
which maybe you've gotten from [inaudible]

527
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,601
nature,

528
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:23,601
that's all one hand like lactic
acid from milk are lactic acid.

529
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:30,620
There are processes which converted
into a 50 50 mixture of our and Das.

530
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:36,360
For example. Suppose you had a base
and it could pull off a hydrogen.

531
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,410
What hydrogen would it pull
off from this molecule of base?

532
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,873
Any idea?

533
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,270
What is the most reactive group here

534
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,550
or another way of saying this is a high
homo. What's the low Lumo going to be?

535
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,910
Well, there's several low lumos.
There's the COO double bond. Pi Star.

536
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,230
That's a good one, right? However, it
won't get you any places you put it on,

537
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,910
come off again. Okay. Or there's
Sigma Star. Oh, age here,

538
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,670
but there's also a
sigma star. Oh, a chair.

539
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:18,300
But this one's better because it's next
to the, to the Pi Star, right, so this is,

540
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,570
that's why it's called an acid.

541
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:24,220
You already knew that and you could lose
the h plus and get down to this. Okay.

542
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:28,840
And that'll go on off, on,
off, on off, long time. That's
fine. Nothing special there.

543
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,280
But once in a long while,
that's easy to do.

544
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,610
Once in a long while you might
pull off the wrong hydrogen.

545
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,190
You might pull off this one.
All right.

546
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,740
So that's not nearly as easy.
But what had happens,

547
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,480
it's interesting for two reasons.

548
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,720
One is it's not as bad as you might've
thought because it's adjacent to this Pi

549
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,210
Star,

550
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,110
which means that the vacant orbital
here can stabilize those that high homo,

551
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,680
which means you can draw that resonance
structure with a double bond there.

552
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,630
So it's hard,

553
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,680
but it's not as hard as it might
be once in a while that'll happen.

554
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,080
And usually it'll go back again.

555
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,213
Right.

556
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,810
But what's especially interesting,
oh, well, just as a footnote,

557
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,930
it's possible to pull both of them off.

558
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,740
But that would be very
unusual to make a Diane ion,

559
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,380
which is high in energy because you're
putting so many electrons close to one

560
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:30,214
another.

561
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,403
Okay.

562
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:37,060
But what's relevant for our purposes
is it that molecule is plainer.

563
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,690
So it's not handed.
This one had a car apartment.

564
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,760
This one had a chiral carbon in it,

565
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,220
but this one doesn't have an asymmetric
carbon. Aye. Aye. Stereo genic carbon.

566
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,430
So this one is the one in the
middle is neither right nor left.

567
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,290
So if you go from right to
something that isn't right or left,

568
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,480
you can come back,
put the hydrogen ion,

569
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:00,490
the hydrogen comes from
the front of the screen,

570
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,460
goes on to where the minus charges
and you're back to the left.

571
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,510
But the hydrogen could have come from
the back of the screen at the same carbon

572
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,140
and that would give the one on the
right and would be s lactic acid.

573
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,620
So after a long time of heating with base,

574
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,800
you can take one that's all r
and have it become 50 50 rns.

575
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:24,870
And that process is called
Rassam. Ization. Why would
it be called Rassam? Ization.

576
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:25,704
Yeah,

577
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,080
cause it makes a receiving mixture of 50
50 mixture from something that was pure.

578
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,930
Okay. That's interesting. But what,

579
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,220
what may be more interesting is,
oh,

580
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:43,320
well this is just a footnote on that.
If you here to go from our,

581
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:47,230
our tartaric acid to Bizo tartaric acid,

582
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,720
you change just one such hydrogen.

583
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,960
The one here has been taken off and put
back on the other side to give that one.

584
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,520
So that's not rationalization.

585
00:37:57,521 --> 00:38:01,810
You're not going to a 50 50
mixture of the two hands, right?

586
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,590
So it has a different name.
It's called the Pim as Asian.

587
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,260
That's just for vocabulary.

588
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,980
But what's more interesting
than rationalization is
the reverse does start with

589
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:17,080
a 50 50 mixture and go to all one.

590
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,890
And that's the main subject for the rest
of what we're going to be talking about,

591
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:25,250
uh, before the exam. Okay. So,

592
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:30,450
so you start with Rs and you separate
it into R and s in separate vials.

593
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:36,190
So you have just the
one you want. Okay. One

594
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:41,190
way we've already seen him doing that
was pastor a conglomerate is a mixture of

595
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:48,271
crystals were each crystal is all one
hand or all the other hand when it's a 50

596
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:54,250
50 mixture of such crystals.
So there's no net handedness to it,

597
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,170
right? But then if you can, if
you have a situation like that,

598
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,760
notice you wouldn't have that.

599
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:04,780
If the crystals had a right
handed molecule and then
I'll lefthanded and that a

600
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:06,460
right handed and then a lefthanded,

601
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,300
you couldn't pick it apart because you
can't separate one molecule from another.

602
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,200
Right?

603
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,850
But if all the crystals are right handed
and some crystals are all lefthanded,

604
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,020
right,

605
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,130
then in principle you can pick them apart
and that's what precisely what posture

606
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,110
did when he noticed it.
Right?

607
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:28,350
So you can separate them and there are
tricks that can help you do it even

608
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:33,190
better or more easily.
When the crystals,

609
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,230
when the things crystallizes all right
handed or left all lefthanded one is to

610
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:43,231
start with molecules in solution and have
only one form crystallize and have the

611
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:49,180
other one stay in solution, then all
you have to do is filter it. Okay,

612
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,120
and how can you do that?
It's because,

613
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,100
and chiral resolve poison is another one
which will keep one form from growing

614
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,600
so that only one form crystallizes.
How do you do that? Here's a crystal,

615
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,500
which is in solution.
And suppose that's exactly at equilibrium.

616
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,920
So it neither dissolves nor nor a nor
crystallizes exactly at equilibrium.

617
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:13,270
It's saturated.
Okay.

618
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,650
Now the interior molecules and the
crystal are very stable because they have

619
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:19,360
exactly the right environment,

620
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,330
right there are more stable
than the ones in solution.

621
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,230
The ones on the surface are not so stable
cause they don't have the neighbors,

622
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:28,450
all the neighbors they need.
Right.

623
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,560
But the average molecule is
exactly the savers in solution.

624
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,760
So it just sits there.
It's at equilibrium with solution now.

625
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,360
So that's the situation we have.
That's the temperature and concentration.

626
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,570
So that this crystal is exactly
at Equilibria with solution.

627
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Now suppose that you
had a smaller crystal,

628
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,470
would it also be at
equilibrium with solution

629
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,320
if it were smaller or do
you see any difference?

630
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,880
The smaller one has a higher
fraction of molecules on the surface.

631
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,090
Okay.
What does that mean?

632
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,580
Yeah.

633
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,300
The molecules on the surface are
less stable than the ones in side.

634
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,210
If the average molecule here is precisely
the same as the ones in solution.

635
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,730
So it just sits there.
How about this one?

636
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,790
The average molecule is less
stable than the ones in solution.

637
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:32,750
So what will it do?

638
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,890
It'll dissolve. Okay, so
a small one dissolves.

639
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,750
This one just sits here. How
about, uh, so that'll go away.

640
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,700
How about, and so as time goes on, it gets
smaller and smaller. The phases move in.

641
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,010
How about this one?
What will it do?

642
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,650
It will grow because it's more
stable in solution, right?

643
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,800
Bingo.
So that one grows as small one said,

644
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,170
this one in the middle is
called the Ismeta stable.

645
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,730
We defined it as being stable
is just sitting there. Right?

646
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,830
But it's not a stable.
If it gets any smaller,

647
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:15,590
it'll shrink if it gets any
large rental grow. Right?

648
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:20,830
So you have to get a crystal that size
called the critical size before the

649
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:23,420
crystal will grow.
Right?

650
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,890
So this suggests a way of
getting only one form to grow.

651
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:32,210
You have a solution, it's
receiving 50 50. Right?

652
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
But there are no crystals in
there that are big enough to grow.

653
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,580
Can you see what you can do?

654
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,720
You add a little fairy dust,
right?

655
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,130
Powdered crystal of one of the two forms,

656
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,470
but have them be big enough to grow.

657
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,750
So only those will grow and then you can
filter it and you have just that one.

658
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:58,751
And that's done industrially as a way
of getting just one form to separate the

659
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:02,480
two forms of means of resolution.
Okay.

660
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:06,230
And the other way is to add a poison
that will absorb on one and keep it from

661
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:08,120
growing.
Okay?

662
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:12,350
So that's one way that's actually used
industrially as well as in the lab.

663
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,480
Another way is to form
temporary Daya Steria Mers.

664
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,380
Because remember the right and
the left are mirror images.

665
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:25,610
So almost all their properties in
the same like their solubility, okay.

666
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,680
But suppose you put something
else with it like uh,

667
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,760
here, uh, let's shake hands.

668
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,700
Josh care. Does that feel
normal? Feels weird, right?

669
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,860
That feels good. So write with right is
different from right with left, right?

670
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:48,320
It's a different property,
okay?

671
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,440
So if what I did was make dayas theoria
is by adding something else to these

672
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:57,830
molecules,
which itself is only one hand.

673
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,040
Like right now all have
things that reacted that are
right with right and things

674
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,940
that are reactive right with left.

675
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,640
And what's the relationship
between those new things?

676
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Are they enantiomers right with right,

677
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,400
right with left and now I'm comparing
rr with Rs. What's the relation?

678
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:20,060
Are they mirror images? No, they're
not married. They're just different,

679
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,350
different solubility, different boiling
point. Everything will be different.

680
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:29,360
Different reactivity. Right. So on the
basis of that, I can separate them,

681
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,160
but if I did it in such
a way that now I can

682
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,160
remove that thing I added now after the
separation I can go back and have the

683
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:39,900
original things separated.
Okay.

684
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,590
So temporary Daya steric there's
one way to do it as chromatography.

685
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,550
So the stuff that I put in the
chromatography column can be all one hand.

686
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,960
I've put the new stuff on,
I put that's the packing of the column.

687
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,790
I now run stuff through it.

688
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,300
One absorbs more strongly than
the other doesn't move as fast.

689
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,000
So one will come out the
bottom of the column faster.

690
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,980
That's one way of making temporary
dietary verse or making a compound with a

691
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:09,090
chiral resolved. Mate. Okay. For example,

692
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,060
this Alinia compound that we saw before,

693
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,000
that was that proved fan it off was right.

694
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,390
This is how it was actually resolved,
how it was separated.

695
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,610
So it says at the top they used alkaloids.
And alkaloid is an organic base,

696
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:27,210
isolated from plants and the
plants made only one hand of it.

697
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,700
And so you use it to make a Daya Steri,

698
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:34,540
Americ salt with the receiving mixture
of right and left handed acids.

699
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,840
So now you have two salts, right? Right,

700
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:40,770
salt and right left salt and they'll
have different solubilities and you can

701
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,230
crystallize. So here's what
happened. There's Bruce scene,

702
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,250
that's one of these alkaloids and
you'll see it has all those centers,

703
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,840
stereo genic centers. So it's Chiral just
one hand, cause she got it from nature.

704
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,500
And now you mix 4.7 grams
of the acid in five,

705
00:45:55,501 --> 00:46:00,060
two grams of Bruce scene, which means
that they're at about a one to one ratio.

706
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,930
So you have both salts there and
now you, uh, you crystallize,

707
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:07,650
you get a solid salt and
you weighed four grams,

708
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:10,560
which means you've got 42% yield,
right?

709
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:14,610
About half of the stuff out and
at that stuff, then you, uh,

710
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,980
had you recrystallize it
to make sure it's pure,

711
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:20,730
that salt you've got out melting point
didn't change. It was already pure.

712
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,860
Liberate the acid by shaking it
with hydrochloric acid and ether.

713
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Now you've got the acid and it melted 145
to 146 and it's rotation was plus 29.5

714
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,470
degrees and recrystallize
and didn't change it.

715
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:42,471
It was pure and it turns out that the
other one is melts one 44 to one 46

716
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:46,380
degrees and is so same
melting point essentially,

717
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,330
but exactly the opposite rotation.

718
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:53,331
So they manage the separation by making
salts that were Daya Steria Merrick,

719
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,850
so they had different solubility
and then take the salts apart again.

720
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,750
And pastor figured a way of doing this,
uh,

721
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,010
in this story,
which I suspect is not a true story.

722
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,690
Now I'm going to stop here,

723
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,900
but we're going to have mostly what's on
Wednesday's lecture is not going to be

724
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:13,020
on the exam,

725
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,860
but there's a little more here that I'm
probably going to make available for the

726
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:18,690
exam that I'll talk about on Wednesday,

727
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,540
and I'll have to think over just
how much more it's going to be.

728
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,860
Not Too much more probably. Okay,
so we'll see you on Wednesday.

729
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,350
Most of what's on Wednesday
won't be on the exam.
