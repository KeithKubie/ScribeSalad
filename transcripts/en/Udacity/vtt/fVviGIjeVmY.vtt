00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.290
So that ends the introduction
to tracking.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.030
Basically saying that what we're
going to do is use a model to make

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.930
predictions.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.720
Take some measurements,
and, integrate it.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.740
Like I said, it's not strictly computer
vision, because it involves state

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.530
estimation, which comes from all
sorts of parts of engineering and

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.870
robotics and things like that.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.100
But it's what's required in order
to make the tracking to work.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.740
So well, we'll sort of take a little
bit of a detour to talk about

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.120
state dynamics and estimation.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.320
Little bit of robot localization
using visual features and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.380
then we'll get back to fundamentals
of tracking using these methods.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.960
Cool.
