to be here I was last here at Carnegie

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890
to be here I was last here at Carnegie
 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.880
to be here I was last here at Carnegie
Mellon about ten years ago and just Fred

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
Mellon about ten years ago and just Fred
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.020

pointed out my life happened to turn a

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
pointed out my life happened to turn a
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.270
pointed out my life happened to turn a
corner then I learned enough about

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
corner then I learned enough about
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.310
corner then I learned enough about
viruses to decide that it was time i

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320
viruses to decide that it was time i
 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.900

chime the first experiment in my
 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.230
chime the first experiment in my
professional life and that I think

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240
professional life and that I think
 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.230
professional life and that I think
seriously about biology for the first

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240
seriously about biology for the first
 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.810
seriously about biology for the first
time I I I as a student was enamored of

mathematicians is a beautiful world I

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890
mathematicians is a beautiful world I

mathematicians is a beautiful world I
learned about growing up and I wanted to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950
learned about growing up and I wanted to
 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.540
learned about growing up and I wanted to
do something different so I became a

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550
do something different so I became a
 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.640
do something different so I became a
theoretical physical scientist but

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650
theoretical physical scientist but
 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.620
theoretical physical scientist but
indeed I was enamored of equations and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630
indeed I was enamored of equations and
 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.729
indeed I was enamored of equations and
in beautiful theories I still AM

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739
in beautiful theories I still AM
 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.310
in beautiful theories I still AM
but I didn't realize what I was missing

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320
but I didn't realize what I was missing
 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.710
but I didn't realize what I was missing
I was convinced that a physical theorist

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720
I was convinced that a physical theorist
 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.920
I was convinced that a physical theorist
couldn't contribute anything significant

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930
couldn't contribute anything significant
 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.470
couldn't contribute anything significant
to biology because biological systems

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480
to biology because biological systems
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.780
to biology because biological systems
were just too complicated there were no

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790
were just too complicated there were no
 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.650
were just too complicated there were no
general laws in biology I'm quoting my

so I managed in high school not to take
 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.070
so I managed in high school not to take
the obligatory course in biology same

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080
the obligatory course in biology same
 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.290
the obligatory course in biology same
thing in college so people think I'm

thing in college so people think I'm
 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.159
thing in college so people think I'm
being modest when I say that when I

being modest when I say that when I

being modest when I say that when I
started 10 years ago working on viruses

started 10 years ago working on viruses
 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.170
started 10 years ago working on viruses
I knew no biology I mean I knew no

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180
I knew no biology I mean I knew no
 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.210
I knew no biology I mean I knew no
biology possibly less because of the

biology possibly less because of the
 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.740
biology possibly less because of the
great effort I've made not to learn

great effort I've made not to learn
 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.440
great effort I've made not to learn
anything but when I learned what a virus

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450
anything but when I learned what a virus
 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.640
anything but when I learned what a virus
was and how simple it is as a physical

it's how I understand anything I'm

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120
it's how I understand anything I'm
 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.980
it's how I understand anything I'm
thinking about in science but the models

the theories are explicitly intended to
be tested by an experiment that we're

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710
be tested by an experiment that we're
 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.040
be tested by an experiment that we're
designing at the same time so in our

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050
designing at the same time so in our
 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.690
designing at the same time so in our
research group now we have six eight PhD

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700
research group now we have six eight PhD
 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.090

and postdoctoral students and generally

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100
and postdoctoral students and generally
 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.220

no more than one of them is working on a
 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.410
no more than one of them is working on a
theoretical problem the others are in

the lab working on a different virus why

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620
the lab working on a different virus why
 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.110
the lab working on a different virus why
on earth would we work on several

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120
on earth would we work on several
 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.350
on earth would we work on several
viruses when we start out knowing no

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360
viruses when we start out knowing no
 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.620
viruses when we start out knowing no
biology and biology we wanted to bring

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630
biology and biology we wanted to bring
 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.210
biology and biology we wanted to bring
to virology a different point of view as

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220
to virology a different point of view as
 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.890
to virology a different point of view as
a physical theorist

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900
a physical theorist
 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.770
a physical theorist
again it was natural to look for general

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780
again it was natural to look for general
 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.530
again it was natural to look for general
behavior so I wanted to know I still

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540
behavior so I wanted to know I still
 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.060
behavior so I wanted to know I still
wanted to know every year along the way

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070
wanted to know every year along the way
 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.420
wanted to know every year along the way
and today what do all viruses have in

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430
and today what do all viruses have in
 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.040
and today what do all viruses have in
common what is virus what qualifies

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050
common what is virus what qualifies
 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.040
common what is virus what qualifies
something to be called a virus so I'm

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050
something to be called a virus so I'm
 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.480
something to be called a virus so I'm
gonna go through a lot of history I

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490
gonna go through a lot of history I
 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.940
gonna go through a lot of history I
think half of my talk is the history of

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950
think half of my talk is the history of
 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.910
think half of my talk is the history of
virology but I hope you'll agree that

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920
virology but I hope you'll agree that
 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.650
virology but I hope you'll agree that
after we go through that history you

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660
after we go through that history you
 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.250
after we go through that history you
will have learned some things about

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260
will have learned some things about
 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.360
will have learned some things about
viruses it happens my wife is a

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370
viruses it happens my wife is a
 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.900
viruses it happens my wife is a
historian of science and early on I I

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910
historian of science and early on I I
 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.300
historian of science and early on I I
learned that studying history of science

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310
learned that studying history of science
 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.360
learned that studying history of science
tells you a lot about scientific ideas

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370
tells you a lot about scientific ideas
 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.610
tells you a lot about scientific ideas
and it's all the more true in the case

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620
and it's all the more true in the case
 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.970
and it's all the more true in the case
of virology because you have to ask

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980
of virology because you have to ask
 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.720
of virology because you have to ask
right away

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730
right away
 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.470
right away
why are viruses only something we know

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480
why are viruses only something we know
 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.960
why are viruses only something we know
about in the last century the concept of

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970
about in the last century the concept of
 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.180
about in the last century the concept of
virus was not clarified before 100 years

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190
virus was not clarified before 100 years
 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.480
virus was not clarified before 100 years
ago

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490
ago
 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.230
ago
so I want to talk about that phenomenon

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240
so I want to talk about that phenomenon
 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.930
so I want to talk about that phenomenon
and how much you learn about viruses by

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940
and how much you learn about viruses by
 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.330
and how much you learn about viruses by
going through the early history the

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340
going through the early history the
 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.380
going through the early history the
prehistory of viruses viruses from

prehistory of viruses viruses from
 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.290
prehistory of viruses viruses from
scratch yes one of our big efforts is to

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300
scratch yes one of our big efforts is to
 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.510
scratch yes one of our big efforts is to
make viruses from purified components

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520
make viruses from purified components
 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.250
make viruses from purified components
and

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260
and
 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.980
and
science to make them from scratch but I

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990
science to make them from scratch but I
 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.750
science to make them from scratch but I
also intended it with a another meaning

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760
also intended it with a another meaning
 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.520
also intended it with a another meaning
I'm starting from scratch

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530
I'm starting from scratch
 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.290
I'm starting from scratch
telling you about viruses assuming you

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300
telling you about viruses assuming you
 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.330
telling you about viruses assuming you
know nothing about them assuming you

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340
know nothing about them assuming you
 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.930
know nothing about them assuming you
knew you know as little as I knew when I

can talk about that after the lecture

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400

you three life cycles there's a life
cycle for every virus and there's a

viruses but why will I show you only
 

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.090

three life cycles because maybe that's

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100
three life cycles because maybe that's
 

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.370
three life cycles because maybe that's
already too many you see that they all

enough to enclose a few genes so let's
 

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.320
enough to enclose a few genes so let's
ask how big a gene is you saw the

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:58.330
ask how big a gene is you saw the
 

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.200
ask how big a gene is you saw the

1/2 nanometers the width of the four
 

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.330
1/2 nanometers the width of the four
diameters couple nanometers so you can

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:09.340
diameters couple nanometers so you can
 

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.230
diameters couple nanometers so you can
ask if you need say a thousand base

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.240
ask if you need say a thousand base
 

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.940
ask if you need say a thousand base
pairs and that's roughly what you need

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:14.950
pairs and that's roughly what you need
 

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.810
pairs and that's roughly what you need
to code for a small protein how much

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:18.820
to code for a small protein how much
 

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.960
to code for a small protein how much
volume do you need to accommodate that

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:21.970
volume do you need to accommodate that
 

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.950
volume do you need to accommodate that
amount of genetic information and then

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:25.960
amount of genetic information and then
 

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.100
amount of genetic information and then
ask well what about 10 genes because 10

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.110
ask well what about 10 genes because 10
 

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.670
ask well what about 10 genes because 10
genes is the typical genetic content of

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680
genes is the typical genetic content of
 

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.860
genes is the typical genetic content of
a virus and it turns out you need the

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:34.870
a virus and it turns out you need the
 

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.810
a virus and it turns out you need the
volume of tens of thousands of cubic

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:36.820
volume of tens of thousands of cubic
 

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.730
volume of tens of thousands of cubic
nanometers and you ask how big a sphere

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:38.740
nanometers and you ask how big a sphere
 

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.740
nanometers and you ask how big a sphere
would you need for that a sphere with a

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:40.750
would you need for that a sphere with a
 

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.350
would you need for that a sphere with a
diameter of tens and animators so it

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360
diameter of tens and animators so it
 

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.810
diameter of tens and animators so it
tells you a virus should be tens and

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:45.820
tells you a virus should be tens and
 

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.510
tells you a virus should be tens and
nano meters in size and the remarkable

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:48.520
nano meters in size and the remarkable
 

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.040
nano meters in size and the remarkable
fact is that all viruses are this size

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.050
fact is that all viruses are this size
 

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.290

such and they figured out that the
 

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.110

cubic point groups basically their idea
was that if a single kind of molecule

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740
was that if a single kind of molecule
 

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.610
was that if a single kind of molecule
makes up the shell then for the shell to

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:34.620
makes up the shell then for the shell to
 

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.560
makes up the shell then for the shell to
be stable there should be some optimum

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:36.570
