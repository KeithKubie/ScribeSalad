1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,550
Like a boss.

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,600
And I saw this thing called Ovarian
psychos and I was like, I want, I want,

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:14,900
I got it. Well, I gotta see what
this is about. It was about some, uh,

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,050
some women in east la, mainly Mexican,

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,550
who are sick of fucking being scared women
and they started their own group when

6
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:26,690
they ride around these
women's only, um, you know,

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,440
riding bicycles when there's like
a full moon or some shit, I dunno.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,720
Ovarian cycles is a young woman of color,

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,640
a bicycle brigade. It's
a refuge for the runaway,

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,900
for the away

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:43,810
[inaudible]

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,350
the majority of us, if not all of us
have some kind of trauma in our life.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,303
[inaudible]

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,090
I dunno.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,600
So I was watching this stuff and of
course typical guys look googled you

16
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,910
women's, all league like such as

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,980
the ovarian cycle, right. As the only
right. I'm aware of where they see, no,

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,000
you're a 15 year old boy, you have
the wrong set of genitals go away.

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,060
Well, the fire guys all only bud. Right.

20
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:23,050
I hate when people act like
it's a level playing field.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,540
You know what I mean?

22
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:26,970
Okay.

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,750
It's like they're having this thing
because it's not a level playing field.

24
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,400
One of the women in there was just like,

25
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,740
everything's kind of full
fucking men only. What's your,

26
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,570
it really is when you
really look at it. Okay,

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,900
I don't want him to fucking come off as
like a complete goddamn liberal here.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,240
People would buy like messages on Facebook
about why is it okay for women to do

29
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,770
this and not for men and

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,370
guys do is for men.

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,380
All right, but you know,
it really is. It's just

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,090
okay.

33
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,760
It's there for the taking for
you. When you're a guy, you know,

34
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,070
not saying you're going to get it.
Nine out of 10 people still fail.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,320
That's one thing that feminists
don't realize. You know,

36
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:06,810
when you listen to them talking about
what it's like to be a guy that had this

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,950
cartoonish idea of what it's like
to be a guy, you just show up. Oh,

38
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:15,810
and the classic one, the more you act
like a Dick, the more people respect you.

39
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:19,380
I love that one. If a woman of a woman
does it, she's considered a bitch.

40
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,450
If a guy does it, it's like,

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,310
have they ever done a survey?
Just ask the general public, Hey,

42
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:31,300
if you had your choice between working
for somebody nice or working for a

43
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,720
complete fucking asshole who treats
you like shit, which would you pick?

44
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,040
Um, anyway, so I'm watching
this documentary, check it out.

45
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,110
It's actually really a,

46
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,990
you only get bothered me
about the documentary is the
way they spelled psychos,

47
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,430
ovarian psychos. It's
like you're on cycles.

48
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,050
So why didn't you spell the first half?
Like cycle and the rest like psycho,

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,630
you know, little wordplay there.
Nothing. All right. Anyways,

50
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,650
so I watched it and it was interesting
and actually it's this one woman said in

51
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:06,400
it, you know, cause she'd been through
all this shit when she was, uh,

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,870
a little girl with their mother.

53
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,660
At first I thought I would try as
much as a kid could try. Right.

54
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:15,420
But I didn't have the words to say to say.

55
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,560
And so my mom was saying
that I was being silly.

56
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:22,370
That's my dad and that and that,

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,090
that I have to be, I have to,

58
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,970
I use my dad and how can
you not love your dad?

59
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:33,420
And so it was very confusing. And so,

60
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,680
and then she had a daughter, I believe
she was at least she had a kid,

61
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:42,790
she became a mom. And then
her mother said, well,

62
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,740
now do you at least understand me?
I bet you understand me a lot more.

63
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,660
And she said to her mother, no,

64
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:53,140
actually I've never understood you less.

65
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,940
That's my mom. And she comes into the
room and she's like, wow, you know,

66
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:01,180
now you know your mother now and now,

67
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,720
hopefully now you'll understand
me as a mom. Like she's up.

68
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,780
And I was like shocked because I
don't understand. And I just told her,

69
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:08,614
I was like,

70
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,210
I just went through 16 hours
of street pain like this labor.

71
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,660
And they phoned me up for this child
that I am now 100% responsible for her,

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,050
you know, or just like her,

73
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,370
her upbringing and for her to be
healthy and you don't say, and,

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,070
and I told her, I looked her in the eyes
and I told her, no, I mom, I friend,

75
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,510
I understand you even listen.

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,850
And I actually cringed when I, when I
saw that and I was just like, you know,

77
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,410
that's something if you feel
it, you don't say to your mom,

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,720
okay,

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,210
like what do you get out of
saying that to you mother?

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,230
All you're going to do is devastator
and make her feel like she completely

81
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:56,830
failed as a mom and it doesn't
get you any real estate.

82
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,940
That's something you say to your
friend. And now that I have a kid,

83
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:03,160
it's just like, I don't even understand
what the fuck my mother did to me.

84
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,520
Even more. [inaudible] you fucking clink
you wine coolers and then that's it.

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,440
You don't say it to your mom.

86
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,040
We're checking callers.

87
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,530
Do you know what? Can you please
go upstairs and get your brother?

88
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,880
Why do I always have to do it? Just
do it. Don't you give me that book,

89
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,660
man? That bitch got herself a nice
little dog. What did you just say?

90
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,640
You heard me? No. Say it
again. Ronnie say to my face,

91
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,370
which muddy? You Jealous
Young Daughters Ass, Huh?
