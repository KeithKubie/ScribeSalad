00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.470
We already have the
tools in our tool kit

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:09.107
to factor something like
x squared plus 4x minus 5.

00:00:09.107 --> 00:00:11.690
And the way that we've already
thought about it is we've said,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.500
hey, let's think of
two numbers that if we

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.309
were to take their product,
we'd get negative 5.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.530
And if we were to add the two
numbers, we'd get positive 4.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.322
And the fact that their
product is negative

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.863
tells you one of them is going
to be positive and one of them

00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:24.960
is going to be negative.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.710
And so there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.835
Well, you could say, well,
maybe one of the numbers

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:32.535
is negative 1 and then the
other one is positive 5.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:33.910
Actually, this
one seems to work.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.770
Negative 1 times
5 is negative 5.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.472
Negative 1 plus 5 is positive 4.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.930
So this one actually
seems to work.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.090
The other option would have
been-- since we're just

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.510
going to deal with the factors
of 5, and 5's a prime number,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.260
the other option would
have been something

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.520
like 1 and negative 5.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.210
There's only two factors for 5.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.250
So 1 and negative
5-- their product

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.390
would have been negative 5.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.820
But if you were to
add these two numbers,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.130
you would have gotten a
negative 4 right over here.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.640
So we're going to go with
this right over here.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.379
And so this tells
us that if we want

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.500
to factor this using the tools
that we already know about,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.540
we will get-- And let
me write these numbers

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.010
in a different color so
we can keep track of them.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.070
So negative 1 and 5.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710
We know that this
would factor out

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:25.880
to be x minus 1 times x plus 5.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.620
And you can verify
this for yourself

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.360
that if you were to
multiply this out,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.300
you will get x squared
plus 4x minus 5.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.470
You can even see this here.
x times x is x squared.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.300
Negative x plus 5x
is going to be 4x.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.250
And then negative 1
times 5 is negative 5.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.780
Fair enough.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.400
This is all review
for us at this point.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.660
Now I want to tackle something
a little bit more interesting.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.640
Let's say we wanted
to factor x squared

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.700
plus 4xy minus 5y squared.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.430
And at first, this
looks really daunting.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.509
All of a sudden, I've introduced
a y and a y squared here.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.560
I have two variables.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.990
How would I tackle it?

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.870
But the important thing is
to just take a deep breath

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.690
and realize that we're
not fundamentally

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.049
doing something different.

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.590
Now, the one little
tricky thing I've

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.940
done when I've written
it this way-- and I

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.106
encourage you to pause this
and try this on your own

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:24.580
before I explain any further.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.770
But the one tricky thing
I did right over here

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.151
is I wrote the x before the y.

00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:30.650
And that tends to
be the convention.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.801
You just write them kind
of in alphabetical order.

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.300
But if we wanted
it in a form that's

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.830
a little bit closer to
this and something that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.910
would fit this mold
a little bit more

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.922
is if we swapped these two.

00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:42.380
Because then we
could write it as x

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.870
squared plus 4yx
minus 5y squared.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.270
And now it becomes pretty
clear that this 4y term

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.180
right over here--
this right over here

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.350
is the coefficient on the
x term, the same way that 4

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.780
was the coefficient
on x right here.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.600
And this negative 5y
squared corresponds

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.750
to the negative 5
right over here.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.410
So we can do the exact
same thought process.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.740
Let's think of two--
now not just numbers.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.406
They're going to have
variables in them.

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:15.460
Let's think of two
terms or two expressions

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.270
that if I multiply them,
I get negative 5y squared.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.310
And then when I take
the sum, I get 4y.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.800
So let's think about
how we could do this.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.310
So one option would be positive.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.430
Let's say positive
y and negative 5y.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.720
So where would this take us?

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.490
Positive y times
negative 5y would indeed

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.000
be equal to negative 5y squared.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.100
But then if I add
y to negative 5y,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.650
I'm going to get negative 4y.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.680
So this doesn't work.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.390
But let's see if we
swap the two signs.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.580
So what about negative
y and positive 5y?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.330
Well, here, if I take the
product of negative y and 5y,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.090
it will be negative 5y squared.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.020
And if I take the sum negative y
and 5y, it will be positive 4y.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.879
So we know how to factor it now.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.920
So once again, let me put
this in the same color.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.050
So this I'm going to put in this
mauve color, this light purple.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.290
And this I'll put
in a darker purple.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.810
So now we know how
to factor this.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.740
And this is the same
exact mold that we did up

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.570
here, same exact idea.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.370
This is going to be x.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.267
Instead of just a minus 1
here, now we've factored-- here

00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:33.850
we factored into a
negative 1 and a 5.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.167
Here we factored into
a negative y and 5y.

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:37.750
So instead of a
negative 1, it's going

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.080
to be a negative y, x
minus y times x plus 5y.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.110
And we can verify that
when you multiply this out,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.970
it indeed does equal x
squared plus 4xy minus 5y.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.390
Let me do that here just
so we know for sure.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.020
So x times x is going
to be x squared.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.770
Let me do everything
in a different color.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.290
x times 5y is going
to be plus 5xy.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.650
Then negative y times
x is negative yx.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.800
And then finally-- and I'm
running out of colors--

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.586
if we take negative y times
5y, that's negative 5y squared.

00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:32.960
And now we just
have to simplify.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.640
We have to combine these middle
two terms right over here.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.770
And at first, it looks a
little bit-- this is xy.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.340
This is yx.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.289
It's not so obvious.

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.580
But we just have to rewrite it.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.310
This is the same
thing as 5yx minus yx.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.084
And so here, you're
saying, look, I have 5yx's.

00:05:50.084 --> 00:05:51.375
And I'm going to subtract yx's.

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:53.760
So I'm going to have 4yx's.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.220
So this is just
going to be 4yx's.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.640
I have 5yx's.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.660
Take out another yx.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.690
I'm going to have 4yx's.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.720
So this is going to be x squared
plus 4yx minus 5y squared.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.420
And it all works out.
