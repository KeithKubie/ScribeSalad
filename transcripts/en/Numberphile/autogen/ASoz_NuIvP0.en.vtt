I know you've made a discovery have you

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520
I know you've made a discovery have you
 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.880
I know you've made a discovery have you
memorized the three numbers I have it

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
memorized the three numbers I have it
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.909

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.640
you don't know I don't know I'm sorry I
didn't even notice I learned from

somebody else's posting that one of the
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.620
somebody else's posting that one of the
numbers is prime so notice that we found

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630
numbers is prime so notice that we found
 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.290

Bjorn Putin he pointed out that if you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
Bjorn Putin he pointed out that if you
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.840
Bjorn Putin he pointed out that if you
want to solve that problem for the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
want to solve that problem for the
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.960
want to solve that problem for the
number 29 it's really easy so 29 is 27

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
number 29 it's really easy so 29 is 27
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849
number 29 it's really easy so 29 is 27
plus 1 plus 1 if you move a bit up the

plus 1 plus 1 if you move a bit up the
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.339
plus 1 plus 1 if you move a bit up the
number line and and you ask about 30 we

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
number line and and you ask about 30 we
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.870

know a solution for that but the numbers

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
know a solution for that but the numbers
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.510
know a solution for that but the numbers
are in the billions and that was only

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
are in the billions and that was only
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.910
are in the billions and that was only
discovered in 1999 at Andrews I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
discovered in 1999 at Andrews I
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650
discovered in 1999 at Andrews I
understand there are some numbers that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
understand there are some numbers that
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.990
understand there are some numbers that
you will never find one for that's right

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
you will never find one for that's right
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.479
you will never find one for that's right
so if your number if you divide it by 9

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
so if your number if you divide it by 9
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.940
so if your number if you divide it by 9
and you get a remainder of 4 or 5 then

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950
and you get a remainder of 4 or 5 then
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470
and you get a remainder of 4 or 5 then
we know you can't do it so you made a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
we know you can't do it so you made a
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450
we know you can't do it so you made a

brilliant video with Tim browning on
this at the time it was an unsolved

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
this at the time it was an unsolved
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.110
this at the time it was an unsolved
problem there have been some attempts to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
problem there have been some attempts to
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.810
problem there have been some attempts to
prove that this number isn't on the list

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
prove that this number isn't on the list
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.900
prove that this number isn't on the list
but those attempts of failed and well

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
but those attempts of failed and well
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.209
but those attempts of failed and well
I've just sold it I first saw the video

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
I've just sold it I first saw the video
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.039
I've just sold it I first saw the video
you know around the time he came out and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
you know around the time he came out and
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660
you know around the time he came out and
I thought a bit about it but didn't get

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
I thought a bit about it but didn't get
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.080
I thought a bit about it but didn't get
very far

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
very far
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.000
very far
it was actually the follow up video on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
it was actually the follow up video on
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.710
it was actually the follow up video on
74 I think that was made a couple of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
74 I think that was made a couple of
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.179
74 I think that was made a couple of
years ago but I only saw it last month

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
years ago but I only saw it last month
 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.820
years ago but I only saw it last month
and that spurred me to think more about

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
and that spurred me to think more about
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.609
and that spurred me to think more about
it and I got hooked over this last

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619
it and I got hooked over this last
 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370
it and I got hooked over this last
number here 74 he's actually represented

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
number here 74 he's actually represented
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.050
number here 74 he's actually represented
as a sum of three cubes maybe I'll show

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
as a sum of three cubes maybe I'll show
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.330
as a sum of three cubes maybe I'll show
you something so about these numbers so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
you something so about these numbers so
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.310
you something so about these numbers so
I've got sad his paper here so if you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
I've got sad his paper here so if you
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.390
I've got sad his paper here so if you
look at the end of the paper he's put

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
look at the end of the paper he's put
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580
look at the end of the paper he's put
all of the numbers below a thousand for

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
all of the numbers below a thousand for
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350
all of the numbers below a thousand for
which we don't know the answer now

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
which we don't know the answer now
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.580
which we don't know the answer now
here's a test Brady do you notice

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
here's a test Brady do you notice
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.030
here's a test Brady do you notice
anything about these numbers peculiar

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040
 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.399
okay if you stare at it a while you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
okay if you stare at it a while you
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.510
okay if you stare at it a while you
might notice that they're all divisible

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520
might notice that they're all divisible
 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429
might notice that they're all divisible
by three okay and if we take this a step

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
by three okay and if we take this a step
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469
by three okay and if we take this a step
further and divide them by nine actually

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
further and divide them by nine actually
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240
further and divide them by nine actually
this is a good plug for you're casting

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
this is a good plug for you're casting
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.030
this is a good plug for you're casting
out nines video okay so this one has

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
out nines video okay so this one has
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710
out nines video okay so this one has
remainder six when you divide it by nine

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
remainder six when you divide it by nine
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.700
remainder six when you divide it by nine
this is another six another six starting

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
this is another six another six starting
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.870
this is another six another six starting
to see a pattern here

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
to see a pattern here
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.010
to see a pattern here
it breaks with this one this is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
it breaks with this one this is
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.219
it breaks with this one this is
remainder three okay this is remainder

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
remainder three okay this is remainder
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.280
remainder three okay this is remainder
three this is remainder three and so on

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
three this is remainder three and so on
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.569
three this is remainder three and so on
and so forth so it turns out they all

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
and so forth so it turns out they all
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.059
and so forth so it turns out they all
have remainder three or six when you

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
have remainder three or six when you
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.529
have remainder three or six when you
divide them by nine that's not an

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
divide them by nine that's not an
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.260
divide them by nine that's not an
accident so as tim explained in one of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
accident so as tim explained in one of
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.770
accident so as tim explained in one of
the follow-up videos

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
the follow-up videos
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.630
the follow-up videos
it matters what the remainder is we need

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
it matters what the remainder is we need
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.340
it matters what the remainder is we need
to buy nine we know that if you get

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350
to buy nine we know that if you get
 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.440
to buy nine we know that if you get
remainder four or five then actually

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450
remainder four or five then actually
 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.300
remainder four or five then actually
there's no solutions at all

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
there's no solutions at all
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.940
there's no solutions at all
so as the same kind of analysis shows

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950
so as the same kind of analysis shows
 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.130
so as the same kind of analysis shows
that if you get remainder three or six

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140
that if you get remainder three or six
 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.930
that if you get remainder three or six
it's possible but only just

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
it's possible but only just
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.670
it's possible but only just
it means the solutions for these numbers

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680
it means the solutions for these numbers
 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.550
it means the solutions for these numbers
are likely to be more sparse okay and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560
are likely to be more sparse okay and
 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.990
are likely to be more sparse okay and
that's what ends up making them hard to

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000
that's what ends up making them hard to
 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.790
that's what ends up making them hard to
find the modern conjectures every one of

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800
find the modern conjectures every one of
 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.290
find the modern conjectures every one of
these numbers they'll be infinitely many

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300
these numbers they'll be infinitely many
 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.199
these numbers they'll be infinitely many
solutions it's just they're extremely

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209
solutions it's just they're extremely
 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.630
solutions it's just they're extremely
sparse and so you know the first one can

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640
sparse and so you know the first one can
 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.760
sparse and so you know the first one can
be enormous as we've seen we want to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770
be enormous as we've seen we want to
 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.520
be enormous as we've seen we want to

the numbers are below some bounce okay
 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.449
the numbers are below some bounce okay
so say absolute value of X absolute

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459
so say absolute value of X absolute
 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.970
so say absolute value of X absolute
value of y and absolute value of Z are

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980
value of y and absolute value of Z are
 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.790
value of y and absolute value of Z are
all below some bounds say B okay so

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800
all below some bounds say B okay so
 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.040
all below some bounds say B okay so
imagine B is a million or something now

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050
imagine B is a million or something now

on the face of it this is a
 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.210
on the face of it this is a
three-dimensional problem okay we've got

and if you just went through all

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
and if you just went through all
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.630

pretty short list at this point so I

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460
pretty short list at this point so I
 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.710
pretty short list at this point so I
started to think well maybe there are

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720
started to think well maybe there are
 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.970
started to think well maybe there are
other approaches that we could look at

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980
other approaches that we could look at
 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.580
other approaches that we could look at
my approach uses more algebra so what

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590
my approach uses more algebra so what
 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.170
my approach uses more algebra so what
I'll do is I'll take this equation and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180
I'll do is I'll take this equation and
 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.730
I'll do is I'll take this equation and
then we'll move the Z cubed over to the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740
then we'll move the Z cubed over to the
 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.950
then we'll move the Z cubed over to the
other side okay so that gives us X cubed

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960
other side okay so that gives us X cubed
 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.550
other side okay so that gives us X cubed
plus y cubed equals 33 minus Z cubed

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560
plus y cubed equals 33 minus Z cubed
 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.720
plus y cubed equals 33 minus Z cubed
this is now X plus y x squared minus XY

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730
this is now X plus y x squared minus XY
 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.800
this is now X plus y x squared minus XY
plus y squared equals 33 minus Z cubed

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810
plus y squared equals 33 minus Z cubed
 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.320
plus y squared equals 33 minus Z cubed
okay now why have I done that well we

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330
okay now why have I done that well we
 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.390
okay now why have I done that well we

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650
right
 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.410
right
now one more step and I promise we're

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420
now one more step and I promise we're
 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.490
now one more step and I promise we're
getting at the end of the algebra let's

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500
getting at the end of the algebra let's
 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.550
getting at the end of the algebra let's
divide both sides by D okay so I'm gonna

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560
divide both sides by D okay so I'm gonna
 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.230
divide both sides by D okay so I'm gonna
have on the left side just x squared

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240
have on the left side just x squared
 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.050

now it probably looks like I've made

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690
now it probably looks like I've made
 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.270
now it probably looks like I've made
things a lot more complicated right

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280
things a lot more complicated right
 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.950

we started with three variables and now

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960
we started with three variables and now
 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.750
we started with three variables and now
we've got four but I want you to imagine

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760
we've got four but I want you to imagine
 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.450
we've got four but I want you to imagine
for a moment that we know the values of

for a moment that we know the values of
 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.110
for a moment that we know the values of

them well that means that everything on

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410
them well that means that everything on
 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.510

unknowns now as everybody knows if

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690

you've got two variables to solve for

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920
you've got two variables to solve for
 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.340
you've got two variables to solve for
you need two equations I've got one here

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350
you need two equations I've got one here
 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.900
you need two equations I've got one here
but there's another one that I used

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910
but there's another one that I used
 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.370
but there's another one that I used
implicit leave it didn't write down and

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380
implicit leave it didn't write down and
 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.070
implicit leave it didn't write down and
that's this one so X plus y is equal to

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080
that's this one so X plus y is equal to
 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.570
that's this one so X plus y is equal to
D all right so now I've got two

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580
D all right so now I've got two
 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.970
D all right so now I've got two

guess values for Z and D I can tell
 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.330
guess values for Z and D I can tell
pretty easily whether there are

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340
pretty easily whether there are
 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.850
pretty easily whether there are
corresponding integer values of x and y

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860
corresponding integer values of x and y
 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.920
corresponding integer values of x and y
okay and this is the idea we just go

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930
okay and this is the idea we just go
 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.840
okay and this is the idea we just go
through all possible values for Z and D

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850
through all possible values for Z and D
 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.370
through all possible values for Z and D
and see if there's any corresponding x

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380
and see if there's any corresponding x
 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.040
and see if there's any corresponding x
and y and now that again sounds like it

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050
and y and now that again sounds like it
 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.600
and y and now that again sounds like it
should be something like B squared right

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610
should be something like B squared right
 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.850
should be something like B squared right
because there's two variables but the

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860
because there's two variables but the
 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.680
because there's two variables but the
key is

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690
key is
 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.170
key is
once I've picked a value for Z the

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180
once I've picked a value for Z the
 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.820
once I've picked a value for Z the
values for 4d are actually quite

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830
values for 4d are actually quite
 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.830
values for 4d are actually quite
restricted because they have to be

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840
restricted because they have to be
 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.470
restricted because they have to be
divisors of this number 33 minus Z cubed

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480
divisors of this number 33 minus Z cubed
 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.540
divisors of this number 33 minus Z cubed
and there aren't many of those so once

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550
and there aren't many of those so once
 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.980
and there aren't many of those so once
you've worked out Z you can work out all

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990
you've worked out Z you can work out all
 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.230
you've worked out Z you can work out all
the possible values for D pretty easily

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240
the possible values for D pretty easily
 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.640
the possible values for D pretty easily
and then just try all of them I've

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650
and then just try all of them I've
 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.380
and then just try all of them I've
glossed over a few things here so in

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390
glossed over a few things here so in
 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.880
glossed over a few things here so in
actual practice you do it the other way

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890
actual practice you do it the other way
 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.500
actual practice you do it the other way
around you you go through values of D

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510
around you you go through values of D
 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.680
around you you go through values of D
and then you work out Z from there but

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690
and then you work out Z from there but
 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.980
and then you work out Z from there but
yeah this is the idea in a nutshell so I

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990
yeah this is the idea in a nutshell so I
 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.300
yeah this is the idea in a nutshell so I
use lots of computers actually there are

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310
use lots of computers actually there are
 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.360
use lots of computers actually there are
a few separate clusters and the the

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370
a few separate clusters and the the
 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.400
a few separate clusters and the the
computation that found the solution was

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410
computation that found the solution was
 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.110
computation that found the solution was
the big computer at the University of

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120
the big computer at the University of
 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.090
the big computer at the University of
Bristol blue crystal phase 3 this

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100
Bristol blue crystal phase 3 this
 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.410
Bristol blue crystal phase 3 this
happened way faster than I was expecting

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420
happened way faster than I was expecting
 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.530
happened way faster than I was expecting
so I started this I thought I was in for

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540
so I started this I thought I was in for
 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.100
so I started this I thought I was in for
man you know 6 months of computation my

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110
man you know 6 months of computation my
 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.870
man you know 6 months of computation my
initial fear was that nothing would turn

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880
initial fear was that nothing would turn
 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.340
initial fear was that nothing would turn
up and then I'd have to justify why I

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350
up and then I'd have to justify why I
 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.980
up and then I'd have to justify why I
was using so many CPU cycles ok as soon

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990
was using so many CPU cycles ok as soon
 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.300
was using so many CPU cycles ok as soon
as I started using a computer within a

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.310
as I started using a computer within a
 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.040
as I started using a computer within a
few days it found the solution the bound

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050
few days it found the solution the bound
 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.200
few days it found the solution the bound
I used was 10 to the 16 so that's 1

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210
I used was 10 to the 16 so that's 1
 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.600
I used was 10 to the 16 so that's 1
followed by 16 zeroes I had actually

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610
followed by 16 zeroes I had actually
 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.930
followed by 16 zeroes I had actually
planned to do 10 to the 17 ok but but

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940
planned to do 10 to the 17 ok but but

CPU cores and at the same time one of

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:56.700
CPU cores and at the same time one of
 

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.280

them went through one of these values of
 

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.140
them went through one of these values of
D actually this is the number D in the

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.150
D actually this is the number D in the
 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.520

middle here I don't know what that is

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.530
middle here I don't know what that is
 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.370
middle here I don't know what that is
887 trillions ok it turns out to be a

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380
887 trillions ok it turns out to be a
 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.800
887 trillions ok it turns out to be a
prime number from that it did all of

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:06.810
prime number from that it did all of
 

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.760
prime number from that it did all of
this algebra and I found the

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:07.770
this algebra and I found the
 

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.640
this algebra and I found the
corresponding values of XY and Z and

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:10.650
corresponding values of XY and Z and
 

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.080
corresponding values of XY and Z and
here they are the computer found the

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.090
here they are the computer found the
 

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.940
here they are the computer found the
solution at 9:05 which is just after I

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:13.950
solution at 9:05 which is just after I
 

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.860
solution at 9:05 which is just after I
dropped my kids off at school and as I

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:15.870
dropped my kids off at school and as I
 

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.990
dropped my kids off at school and as I
was walking to the University and I

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000
was walking to the University and I
 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.630
was walking to the University and I
noticed it around 9:30 when I got to my

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:20.640
noticed it around 9:30 when I got to my
 

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.910
noticed it around 9:30 when I got to my
office

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:21.920
office
 

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.230
office
no I didn't ring it to send me an email

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240
no I didn't ring it to send me an email
 

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.870
no I didn't ring it to send me an email
so I had to check it makes it more fun

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:26.880
so I had to check it makes it more fun
 

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.400
so I had to check it makes it more fun
because there's an element of you know

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:28.410
because there's an element of you know
 

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.830
because there's an element of you know
uncertainty and the thing how often were

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840
uncertainty and the thing how often were
 

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.340
uncertainty and the thing how often were
you checking

you checking
 

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.839
you checking
we each already checking like every hour

00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:32.849
we each already checking like every hour
 

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:34.940
we each already checking like every hour
or you check once a day or once a day or

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:34.950
or you check once a day or once a day or
 

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.560
or you check once a day or once a day or
something like that as soon as I saw the

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:36.570
something like that as soon as I saw the
 

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.000
something like that as soon as I saw the
file was there I knew that it had a

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.010
file was there I knew that it had a
 

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.370
file was there I knew that it had a
solution of course then I checked it you

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380
solution of course then I checked it you
 

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.020
solution of course then I checked it you
never a hundred percent sure that you

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.030
never a hundred percent sure that you
 

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.740
never a hundred percent sure that you
know you haven't made a mistake

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:42.750
know you haven't made a mistake
 

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.440
know you haven't made a mistake
somewhere so I put these numbers into

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:45.450
somewhere so I put these numbers into
 

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.910
somewhere so I put these numbers into
the computer and cube them and add in

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920
the computer and cube them and add in
 

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.250
the computer and cube them and add in
the

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:47.260
the
 

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.980
the
and about 33 what did that feel like I

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:49.990
and about 33 what did that feel like I
 

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.900
and about 33 what did that feel like I
did a jump for joy yeah yes yes you made

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:54.910
did a jump for joy yeah yes yes you made
 

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.450
did a jump for joy yeah yes yes you made
an excellent point in the first video on

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:57.460
an excellent point in the first video on
 

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.220
an excellent point in the first video on
this which is that we can't hope to

00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.230
this which is that we can't hope to
 

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.320
this which is that we can't hope to
solve this by just computing more okay

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.330
solve this by just computing more okay
 

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.390
solve this by just computing more okay
cuz there's always another number for us

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:03.400
cuz there's always another number for us
 

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.360
cuz there's always another number for us
the next one is 42 so 42 the new the new

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.370
the next one is 42 so 42 the new the new
 

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.570
the next one is 42 so 42 the new the new
white whale is 42 is the new 33 yeah

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:09.580
white whale is 42 is the new 33 yeah
 

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.830
white whale is 42 is the new 33 yeah
that's right

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:10.840
that's right
 

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.010
that's right
and so if we just look at the numbers up

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.020
and so if we just look at the numbers up
 

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.990
and so if we just look at the numbers up
to a hundred so let me say K less than

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000
to a hundred so let me say K less than
 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.050
to a hundred so let me say K less than
or equal to 100 there's 22 numbers in

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.060
or equal to 100 there's 22 numbers in
 

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.150
or equal to 100 there's 22 numbers in
that range that give a remainder of four

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160
that range that give a remainder of four
 

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.190
that range that give a remainder of four
or five when you divide by nine so

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200
or five when you divide by nine so
 

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.720
or five when you divide by nine so
they're possible so they're not possible

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:24.730
they're possible so they're not possible
 

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.210
they're possible so they're not possible
that's right we know the answer for

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.220
that's right we know the answer for
 

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.770
that's right we know the answer for
those and they're not possible

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:28.780
those and they're not possible
 

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.140
those and they're not possible
that leaves seventy-eight numbers to

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.150
that leaves seventy-eight numbers to
 

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.120
that leaves seventy-eight numbers to

investigation of this was done way back

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:35.260
investigation of this was done way back
 

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.470
investigation of this was done way back
in 1954 that's pretty early as these

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:37.480
in 1954 that's pretty early as these
 

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.070
in 1954 that's pretty early as these
things go

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080
things go
 

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.910
things go
and they found 69 solutions were 69 out

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920

of the 78 well of course that's not the
 

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.300
of the 78 well of course that's not the
end of the story so computer technology

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.310
end of the story so computer technology
 

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.120
end of the story so computer technology
advanced rapidly from there and within a

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.130
advanced rapidly from there and within a
 

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:48.510
advanced rapidly from there and within a
decade

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:48.520
decade
 

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.470

another group of mathematicians but they

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480
another group of mathematicians but they
 

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.700
another group of mathematicians but they
were disappointed because they found

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:53.710
were disappointed because they found
 

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.340
were disappointed because they found
only one more despite going about 20

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:56.350
only one more despite going about 20
 

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.930
only one more despite going about 20
times further in terms of the variables

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:57.940
times further in terms of the variables
 

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.490
times further in terms of the variables
but remember they were using a quadratic

00:09:59.490 --> 00:09:59.500
but remember they were using a quadratic
 

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.980
but remember they were using a quadratic
time algorithm so it's a about 400 times

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:01.990
time algorithm so it's a about 400 times
 

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.660
time algorithm so it's a about 400 times
as much work so it's impressive from an

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:03.670
as much work so it's impressive from an
 

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.460
as much work so it's impressive from an
engineering standpoint yeah they found

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:05.470
engineering standpoint yeah they found
 

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.230
engineering standpoint yeah they found
only one more solution so they took this

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240
only one more solution so they took this
 

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.730
only one more solution so they took this
as evidence that there probably aren't

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:08.740
as evidence that there probably aren't
 

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.270
as evidence that there probably aren't
any more

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.280
any more
 

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.530
any more
they hedge their bets a little bit they

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:10.540
they hedge their bets a little bit they
 

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.060
they hedge their bets a little bit they
didn't say no more solutions but they

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.070
didn't say no more solutions but they
 

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.980
didn't say no more solutions but they
said that not all of the remaining eight

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:13.990
said that not all of the remaining eight
 

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.530
said that not all of the remaining eight
candidates would have solutions that was

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:16.540
candidates would have solutions that was
 

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.660
candidates would have solutions that was
the prevailing wisdom for a while for

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:18.670
the prevailing wisdom for a while for
 

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.520
the prevailing wisdom for a while for
over twenty years now we think that

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:20.530
over twenty years now we think that
 

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.250
over twenty years now we think that
conjecture is wrong okay things have

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:23.260
conjecture is wrong okay things have
 

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.570
conjecture is wrong okay things have
kind of turned around but it wasn't

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:24.580
kind of turned around but it wasn't
 

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.430
kind of turned around but it wasn't
until the early 90s that Heath Brown

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440
until the early 90s that Heath Brown
 

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.170
until the early 90s that Heath Brown
said we'll hang on so if there are

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:28.180
said we'll hang on so if there are
 

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.730
said we'll hang on so if there are
solutions they're likely to be extremely

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:29.740
solutions they're likely to be extremely
 

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.250
solutions they're likely to be extremely
sparse in fact he does some calculations

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.260
sparse in fact he does some calculations
 

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.930
sparse in fact he does some calculations
and he shows that for some of these

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:33.940
and he shows that for some of these
 

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.900
and he shows that for some of these
small numbers you would expect the the

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:36.910
small numbers you would expect the the
 

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.970
small numbers you would expect the the
numbers from one solution to the next to

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:38.980
numbers from one solution to the next to
 

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.460
numbers from one solution to the next to
increase by a factor of millions okay so

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:41.470
increase by a factor of millions okay so
 

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.440
increase by a factor of millions okay so
that means you know each time you find

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:43.450
that means you know each time you find
 

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.910
that means you know each time you find
one you're gonna have to work a million

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920
one you're gonna have to work a million
 

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.150
one you're gonna have to work a million
times harder to find the next one so the

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160
times harder to find the next one so the
 

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.590
times harder to find the next one so the
fact that you've that you've expanded

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600
fact that you've that you've expanded
 

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.570
fact that you've that you've expanded
the search range by 20 and not found

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:51.580
the search range by 20 and not found
 

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.190
the search range by 20 and not found
anything is not by itself very good

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200
anything is not by itself very good
 

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.240
anything is not by itself very good
evidence that there's nothing what have

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.250
evidence that there's nothing what have
 

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.630
evidence that there's nothing what have
you found

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640
you found
 

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.040
you found
and so people looked again from 1991

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.050
and so people looked again from 1991
 

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.979
and so people looked again from 1991
to this year 19 we've found solutions

00:11:02.979 --> 00:11:02.989
to this year 19 we've found solutions
 

00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:05.319
to this year 19 we've found solutions
for seven out of the eight there's only

00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:05.329
for seven out of the eight there's only
 

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:07.119
for seven out of the eight there's only
one number left 42 is the only one left

00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:07.129
one number left 42 is the only one left
 

00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:09.449
one number left 42 is the only one left
below 100 so we have not completely

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:09.459
below 100 so we have not completely
 

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:12.790
below 100 so we have not completely
disproved their conjecture from 63 but

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800
disproved their conjecture from 63 but
 

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.259
disproved their conjecture from 63 but
it's looking pretty good for Heath

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:14.269
it's looking pretty good for Heath
 

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:16.600
it's looking pretty good for Heath
Browns yeah counter conjecture and

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:16.610
Browns yeah counter conjecture and
 

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.460
Browns yeah counter conjecture and
review got the computer looking for 42

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:18.470
review got the computer looking for 42
 

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.259
review got the computer looking for 42
no I already looked for 42 in the same

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:20.269
no I already looked for 42 in the same
 

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:23.289
no I already looked for 42 in the same
range and nothing turned up but yeah

00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:23.299
range and nothing turned up but yeah
 

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:27.699
range and nothing turned up but yeah
maybe we shouldn't stop there that's

00:11:27.699 --> 00:11:27.709
maybe we shouldn't stop there that's
 

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:28.660
maybe we shouldn't stop there that's
right yeah

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:28.670
right yeah
 

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.549
right yeah
there's a definite purpose here because

00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:30.559
there's a definite purpose here because
 

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:32.379
there's a definite purpose here because
this is a problem where we're not even

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:32.389
this is a problem where we're not even
 

00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:34.720
this is a problem where we're not even
sure or it's not even obvious what the

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:34.730
sure or it's not even obvious what the
 

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.850
sure or it's not even obvious what the
right conjecture should be okay and

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:36.860
right conjecture should be okay and
 

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.259
right conjecture should be okay and
that's evidenced by the fact that the

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:38.269
that's evidenced by the fact that the
 

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:40.299
that's evidenced by the fact that the
conjecture has changed in our lifetimes

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:40.309
conjecture has changed in our lifetimes
 

00:11:40.309 --> 00:11:42.129
conjecture has changed in our lifetimes
does that mean you know a mathematician

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:42.139
does that mean you know a mathematician
 

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:44.109
does that mean you know a mathematician
like you instead of just picking them

00:11:44.109 --> 00:11:44.119
like you instead of just picking them
 

00:11:44.119 --> 00:11:45.939
like you instead of just picking them
off one by one with the computer yeah

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:45.949
off one by one with the computer yeah
 

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:47.319
off one by one with the computer yeah
should you be sitting down and trying to

00:11:47.319 --> 00:11:47.329
should you be sitting down and trying to
 

00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:48.819
should you be sitting down and trying to
come up with a rigorous proof I mean

00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:48.829
come up with a rigorous proof I mean
 

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:50.049
come up with a rigorous proof I mean
what's the point of just picking these

00:11:50.049 --> 00:11:50.059
what's the point of just picking these
 

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:52.179
what's the point of just picking these
off one at a time yeah well so of course

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:52.189
off one at a time yeah well so of course
 

00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:53.619
off one at a time yeah well so of course
other people are working on that sort of

00:11:53.619 --> 00:11:53.629
other people are working on that sort of
 

00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:54.699
other people are working on that sort of
thing and we do have theoretical

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:54.709
thing and we do have theoretical
 

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:56.429
thing and we do have theoretical
evidence that supports the conjecture to

00:11:56.429 --> 00:11:56.439
evidence that supports the conjecture to
 

00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:58.449
evidence that supports the conjecture to
some people think though that this

00:11:58.449 --> 00:11:58.459
some people think though that this
 

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:00.759
some people think though that this
problem is actually undecidable so it

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:00.769
problem is actually undecidable so it
 

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:02.379
problem is actually undecidable so it
might be that we never have a proof and

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:02.389
might be that we never have a proof and
 

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.660
might be that we never have a proof and
this is as close as we can come okay so

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:04.670
this is as close as we can come okay so
 

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.009
this is as close as we can come okay so
but with each one of these sovereign

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:06.019
but with each one of these sovereign
 

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:08.499
but with each one of these sovereign
candidates that we finds that gives

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:08.509
candidates that we finds that gives
 

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:10.539
candidates that we finds that gives
another nail in the coffin of this idea

00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:10.549
another nail in the coffin of this idea
 

00:12:10.549 --> 00:12:12.759
another nail in the coffin of this idea
that there aren't any more solutions so

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:12.769
that there aren't any more solutions so
 

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:14.559
that there aren't any more solutions so
it's so in a way knocking off these

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:14.569
it's so in a way knocking off these
 

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:16.269
it's so in a way knocking off these
stubborn candidates I've never heard

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:16.279
stubborn candidates I've never heard
 

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:18.039
stubborn candidates I've never heard
that term before I can have knocking off

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:18.049
that term before I can have knocking off
 

00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:20.499
that term before I can have knocking off
these stubborn candidates is almost

00:12:20.499 --> 00:12:20.509
these stubborn candidates is almost
 

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:22.419
these stubborn candidates is almost
you're giving hope to the people who are

00:12:22.419 --> 00:12:22.429
you're giving hope to the people who are
 

00:12:22.429 --> 00:12:23.499
you're giving hope to the people who are
actually trying to come up with the

00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:23.509
actually trying to come up with the
 

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.809
actually trying to come up with the
rigorous proof yeah yeah so it's looking

00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:25.819
rigorous proof yeah yeah so it's looking
 

00:12:25.819 --> 00:12:27.220
rigorous proof yeah yeah so it's looking
pretty good for heath brown's conjecture

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.230
pretty good for heath brown's conjecture
 

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.160
pretty good for heath brown's conjecture
so probably this conjecture is true and

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.170
so probably this conjecture is true and
 

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.039
so probably this conjecture is true and
we can we can ask you know can we prove

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:33.049
we can we can ask you know can we prove
 

00:12:33.049 --> 00:12:33.369
we can we can ask you know can we prove
it

00:12:33.369 --> 00:12:33.379
it
 

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:34.780
it
what's that conjecture in a nutshell

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:34.790
what's that conjecture in a nutshell
 

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.669
what's that conjecture in a nutshell
what is the conjecture so every one of

00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:36.679
what is the conjecture so every one of
 

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:39.340
what is the conjecture so every one of
these numbers that doesn't have

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:39.350
these numbers that doesn't have
 

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.749
these numbers that doesn't have
remainder four or five when you divided

00:12:40.749 --> 00:12:40.759
remainder four or five when you divided
 

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.999
remainder four or five when you divided
by nine will have infinitely many

00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:43.009
by nine will have infinitely many
 

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:44.710
by nine will have infinitely many
solutions and infinitely many ways of

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720
solutions and infinitely many ways of
 

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.659
solutions and infinitely many ways of
writing it as a sum of three cubes did

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:46.669

yeah so I even told the children and
 

00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:58.659
yeah so I even told the children and
they were excited and I run a maths Club

00:12:58.659 --> 00:12:58.669
they were excited and I run a maths Club
 

00:12:58.669 --> 00:13:01.539
they were excited and I run a maths Club
in my kids primary school and we did a

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:01.549
in my kids primary school and we did a
 

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:04.359
in my kids primary school and we did a
unit on cubes and adding up cubes and

00:13:04.359 --> 00:13:04.369
unit on cubes and adding up cubes and
 

00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:04.920
unit on cubes and adding up cubes and
talk

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:04.930
talk
 

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.050

about this I showed your video you know
 

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.639
about this I showed your video you know
are you gonna do with this number you're

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:08.649
are you gonna do with this number you're
 

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:10.710
are you gonna do with this number you're
gonna get it tattooed on your alright no

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720
gonna get it tattooed on your alright no
 

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.450
gonna get it tattooed on your alright no
as you saw I don't even remember it

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:12.460
as you saw I don't even remember it
 

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.090
as you saw I don't even remember it
better you have to memorize that would

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.100
better you have to memorize that would
 

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.730
better you have to memorize that would
be a good party trick next time I come I

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:17.740
be a good party trick next time I come I
 

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:22.199
be a good party trick next time I come I
want you to have memorized it come back

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:22.209
want you to have memorized it come back
 

00:13:22.209 --> 00:13:25.230
want you to have memorized it come back
to these ones but the next eligible one

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240
to these ones but the next eligible one
 

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.930
to these ones but the next eligible one
is this number 33 and in fact we still

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:30.940
is this number 33 and in fact we still
 

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.360
is this number 33 and in fact we still
don't know an answer to that one so

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:33.370
don't know an answer to that one so
 

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.010
don't know an answer to that one so
we've not yet been able to find any

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.020
we've not yet been able to find any
 

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.889
we've not yet been able to find any
integers which when you sum their cubes

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:37.899
integers which when you sum their cubes
 

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:40.890
integers which when you sum their cubes
you get 33
