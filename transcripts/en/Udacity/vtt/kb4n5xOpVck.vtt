Two more elements I'd like to teach you--these are called "span" and "div".

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and are both normal elements.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They can both have content and the only difference between these two

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is is inline

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and is block.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We'll play around with these in the Editor a little bit,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but these are basically--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
these elements don't do anything other than just contain their content.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And there's a way to attach styles to them,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to adjust different behaviors of how they display.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That looks something like this.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So you can see, I've added two attributes--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or an attribute to each of these, called "class".

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And this is a CSS class,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and this is not something we're going to spend a whole lot of time on in this course.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll provide most of the CSS,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but it's a separate language for adding styles to your documents

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
or changing how different text looks.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And we'll be using and a lot

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
for controlling how text is laid out.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But the important thing to remember is that are inline

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and are block.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's play around with these in a browser a little bit--real quick--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so you can see what I'm talking about.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Okay. So we've got our text

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and our first line is wrapped in --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and it behaves as we would expect an inline element to behave.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now if I were to change this to a ,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
it behaves more like how the paragraph tag before behaved.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This actually creates a box around this piece of text.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And you can see--we actually did something interesting.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I added a little period after the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and the period up here is down on the second line here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What I'd like you to do is check all of the elements that are inline.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Some of these elements you haven't seen before,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so I would like you to try them out in your own browser

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.333
and figure it out for yourself.
