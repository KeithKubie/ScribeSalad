00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.040
[A video game that teaches you how to code]

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.909
What I

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.901
love and what I'm passionate about is
finding better ways of teaching programming —

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.780
especially to kids. I really love this
term "chocolate-covered broccoli"

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.530
and I think that's what educational
video games have been up until now —

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.660
I mean it really has been

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.320
"Oh look! It's a game — just kidding! You can
play for a second and now go solve this

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.260
math problem for 10 minutes." 
The big difference between

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.000
a "chocolate-covered broccoli" game and a real immersive educational video game

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.050
is that you shouldn't have to stop
playing to go to the learning

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.050
and then stop learning to go to the playing.
So the first level of CodeSpells that

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.790
we ever built

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.370
was literally just this dark forest with
one gnome,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.930
one crate and one spell. And we actually
tested it out.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.850
We had forty middle school girls and we
just kind of gave them tasks to do and said,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.930
"Try to get the crate to do this and try
to get it to do that."

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.110
So we started to understand how kids would interact with this. After that we decided

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.920
to add in a spellbook

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.270
and the spellbook really was our sneaky
way of putting in a textbook

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.650
into the game. The students have a problem in front of them — you have to figure out

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.820
how to collect all the bread.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.340
Now you got the spellbook as a resource,
why don't you go look into that I and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.810
see what you could use to be able to
collect all the bread.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.600
Using Scratch, Alice and CodeSpells

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.750
are really important because what they do
is they provide a visual context for the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.479
programming

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.330
The students make some change in the
program and immediately can see the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.380
effect of that change.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.570
Usually what I'll have the kids do

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.810
is some paperwork first and what I found
is that getting the kids to actually

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.860
write the spells down on paper — it's a
slower process and they actually think

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.840
about it more

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.130
and then when they go on the computer,
they actually can write the spells

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.799
very, very quickly. Pair programming is an
industry

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.170
standard practice. You have two people on one computer. And the driver is in charge

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.299
of the keyboard and mouse

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.850
and really focuses on the low-level
things — typing everything in and getting

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.720
everything to work.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.610
The Navigator is then able to focus on
kind of the high-level things.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.729
Not only

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.060
is it in industry standard practice that we
want them to start working on

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.590
but because they have to articulate what
it is that they want

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.110
they start to use the language of
computer science a lot more expert like.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.530
We have them switch every two minutes
just because it's all about building

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.690
something as a team.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.110
Collaboration. Communication. They're
not often related

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.099
with programming or computer scientists,
but they're absolutely critical

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.349
to software. Depending on the
school you go to, if there's an

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.400
instructor there who's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.780
really passionate about computer science, they might have a course

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.040
otherwise it's generally not within the
curriculum

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.910
and there's a lot of reasons for this.
One of them is that the people who are

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.400
teaching don't have that programming
expertise

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.099
and so one of the things I'd like to do
is come up with curriculum and

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.870
softwares

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.700
such that they can teach in a classroom of 30 kids

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.349
without having to be programming
experts. And we really like to engage

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.290
the kids

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.690
in what we like to call "STEAM" — science,
technology, engineering,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.530
art and math. Everything related to STEM,
you're going to have to have some

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.360
creativity

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.500
it's also really important to show that
especially computer science can be

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.260
expressive.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.329
Have the kids engaging in solving
problems, but not just contrived "here

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.060
build a calculator that we've had for

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.450
however many years" but instead let's build something you're interested in.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.310
Let's try to make a video game. Let's
make a comic strip but have each block

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.780
be moving around and when you click on
the cat it meows.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.660
Getting them to be self-motivated and
excited about what they're doing so that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.549
they want to go home and keep doing it

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.359
and it's not just something that they do
in the classroom. So what do you think?

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.760
Are there other ways we can use video
games in the classroom? Let us know in

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.639
the comments below

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.910
and if you want to learn more about the
ways that scientists use art,
