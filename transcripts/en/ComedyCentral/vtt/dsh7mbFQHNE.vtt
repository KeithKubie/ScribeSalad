00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.703
- Our next review is from
Joaquin Phoenix.

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:05.104
- Oh, you're kidding me!
- Oh, wow!

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:07.507 align:start position:0%
- Oh!
Oh.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.976
- Hi, I'm Joaquin in Phoenix.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.880
I have to apologize to everyone
at my church this Sunday.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.082
What's it like to speak
in public?

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:19.986
- Oh, well, I guess this is
exactly the moment to confess

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.156
that even though I'm a seasoned
and very highly well regarded

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.691 align:start position:0%
television presenter,
I occasionally feel

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:28.027 size:84% position:42%
the terror of stage fright.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.995
- Sometimes I can see
the sweat building

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.930
on your upper lip
from over here.

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:32.865
- No, no, for me it's more
of an internal thing.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:34.033
I don't think it's noticeable.

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.537
Okay, well, I am off
to speak publicly!

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.673
I have recently learned that my
ex-wife is getting married

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:43.342
to a man that I accidentally
introduced her to.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.645 line:0%
<i> Suzanne met this man
 during my review of catfishing</i>

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.381 line:0%
<i> when I used his annoyingly
 perfect face</i>

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.882 line:0%
<i> to communicate with her.</i>

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.185 line:0%
<i> When she wanted to meet me,
 I kept up the ruse,</i>

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.555
<i> and produced Joe Dale, Jr.,
 who, as it turns out,</i>

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:56.989
<i> is a wealthy
 professional athlete.</i>

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:58.724
- Hello.
-<i> Soon after,</i>

00:00:58.757 --> 00:00:59.926
<i> they started dating.</i>

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.895
So he is a fraud,
and she is a dupe.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:07.066
And not only that,
he cheats on her...all the time.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.968
So, if that doesn't have
the makings

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.338
of a memorable wedding speech,
I don't know what does.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.474
<i> I set to work writing a speech
 to deliver</i>

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.175
<i> at their rehearsal dinner,</i>

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:19.212
<i> one that would completely
 derail this wedding of lies.</i>

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.048
"Are marrying a stand-in

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:26.152
for the man you really
fell for."

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.488
The speech I have written
is a vicious, destructive act

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.023
of character assassination.

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:33.993
But that doesn't make it immune
from the number one rule

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:36.863
of public speaking:
I gotta open with a joke.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.532
Now, I remember that my late
father-in-law Jack

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:42.502
opened his toast at our wedding
with a real doozey.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:46.239
So I've been combing through
the home video of our wedding.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.808
I think I've got it.
Let's see that joke.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.711
<i> - Oh, but I think Forrest
 is a little nervous.</i>

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.746
<i> Today he asked me
 what the wedding night</i>

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.548
<i> was gonna be like, and I said,
 oh, don't worry,</i>

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:56.883
<i> it's like a candy bar...</i>

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:00.052
-<i> Oh, no, no, don't tell--
 - Dad! Dad!</i>

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.755
<i> - It's like a candy bar.
 Once you take the wrapper off,</i>

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.790
<i> the next two minutes
 will be heavenly.</i>

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:06.759
<i> [laughter]</i>

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:09.295
<i> Love that joke!
 Seriously though,</i>

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:14.500
<i> I love this guy.
 He's a little weird sometimes.</i>

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.969
<i> I don't always know what he's
 talking about, but darn it,</i>

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.106
<i>he--he makes my daughter happy,
 and that's all</i>

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.208
<i> a dad can ask for his kids.</i>

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.544
<i> So, Forrest, I want you to
 promise that you'll always</i>

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.878
<i> keep my little girl happy.</i>

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:29.048
<i> Can you promise me that?
 - Yes, I promise.</i>

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:32.585
<i> - Say it again.
 - I promise.</i>

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:37.390
<i> - One more time.
 - I promise.</i>

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:40.092
<i> - Thank you.
May you two have many children,</i>

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:44.297
<i> who will likely be the first
 generation to live in space.</i>

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.663
<i> So with that in mind,
 let's toast.</i>
