I live in in Berkeley and I've been

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149
I live in in Berkeley and I've been
 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.820
I live in in Berkeley and I've been
living there for thirty years and I know

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830
living there for thirty years and I know
 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.619
living there for thirty years and I know
all the streets of how to get to my home

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:09.629
all the streets of how to get to my home
 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.259
all the streets of how to get to my home
and my work but I still use Google Maps

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
and my work but I still use Google Maps

because at any point in time you don't

because at any point in time you don't
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.859
because at any point in time you don't
know the amount of traffic between where

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869
know the amount of traffic between where
 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.290
know the amount of traffic between where
you are and when you want to go and

you are and when you want to go and
 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.370
you are and when you want to go and
which one of the many routes available

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
which one of the many routes available
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.950
which one of the many routes available
to you has an accident or slow down or

value of exterior mapping is I think

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950
value of exterior mapping is I think

the by the public interiors you can
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.680
the by the public interiors you can
argue less about people getting lost and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
argue less about people getting lost and
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.319
argue less about people getting lost and
traffic and stuff like that but imagine

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
traffic and stuff like that but imagine
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.259

to deliver our packages through drones

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
to deliver our packages through drones
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.590

all the way to the exterior of our

mile of delivering those same things

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
mile of delivering those same things
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.059

into different offices or apartments
 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.219
into different offices or apartments
inside the building and that would also

an interior mapping be seamlessly
integrated with the exterior mapping so

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409
integrated with the exterior mapping so
 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.790

like that the first responders will have
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.000
like that the first responders will have
a lot easier time knowing where people

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010
a lot easier time knowing where people
 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.160
a lot easier time knowing where people
are and knowing how to rescue people

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
are and knowing how to rescue people
 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.050
are and knowing how to rescue people
that and just having more information

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
that and just having more information
 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.809
that and just having more information
it's always useful the other positive

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819
it's always useful the other positive
 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.330
it's always useful the other positive
thing in terms of knowing where you are

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340
thing in terms of knowing where you are
 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.509
thing in terms of knowing where you are
is that and how many people are aware

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519
is that and how many people are aware
 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.789
is that and how many people are aware
and knowing the maps is that is this

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799
and knowing the maps is that is this
 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.550
and knowing the maps is that is this
idea of smart buildings you can control

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560
idea of smart buildings you can control
 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.149
idea of smart buildings you can control
the many many sensors and actuators that

the many many sensors and actuators that
 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.009
the many many sensors and actuators that
are inside the building to your liking

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019
are inside the building to your liking
 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.679
are inside the building to your liking
so suppose that I like the temperature

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689
so suppose that I like the temperature
 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.229
so suppose that I like the temperature
in my office to be no no warmer than 64

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239
in my office to be no no warmer than 64

in my office to be no no warmer than 64
just just because there's a map and

just just because there's a map and
 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.300
just just because there's a map and
because then they know where I am when

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310
because then they know where I am when
 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.039
