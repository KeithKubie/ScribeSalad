00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.699
In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first person
to go into space, opening a new chapter in

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.130
human exploration, and inspiring hundreds
of people around the world to follow in his

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.650
footsteps, some of them quite literally.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.040
Legend goes, that Gagarin desperately had
to urinate before lift off, so he asked the

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.330
bus to stop and since they were in the middle
of a flat featureless landscape, he went against

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.110
the rear wheel.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.860
That act is now immortalised as a pre-launch
ritual by cosmonaut crew members who take

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.649
it in turns to pee on the rear wheel of their
bus before the get on board.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.520
We'd be right in calling ritualistic behaviour
irrational. After all, peeing on the rear

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.839
wheel of a bus ins't going to make space travel
any safer, so why do we do it? According to

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.920
psychologist Cristine Legare, it's a reflection
of the way the human brain works. And the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.530
human brain is inherently irrational.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.539
Our minds are always seeking out patterns,
even when they don't exist. Often seeking

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.350
out connections between cause and effect,
sometimes without any evidence of their truth.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.200
With this in mind, rituals provide us with
the same satisfaction as everyday tasks that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.750
have known positive effects like brushing
your teeth. And so in part rituals exist to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.869
give us the illusion of control over our otherwise
random lives.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.159
Gagarin plays a pivotal role in the traditions
carried out by modern cosmonauts. Since he

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.579
made his historic flight, all cosmonauts now
visit his office after their training to sign

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.490
his guestbook and ask his ghost permission
to go into space. But although this superstitious

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.460
behaviour seems irrational, scientists have
shown that there's evidence of real beneficial

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.369
effect.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.450
A study on basketball players found that athletes
who performed pre-event rituals tend to report

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.510
lower levels of anxiety, and greater levels
of confidence. Another suggests that participating

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.690
in superstitious behaviour can improve motor
dexterity and memory. Research suggests that

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.130
the nature of the ritual determines how effective
it will be: the more complex and detailed

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.949
it is, the more convincing it becomes.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:37.359
So for the Russians, the tradition of following
so firmly in the footsteps of Gagarin from

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.949
the training centre to the launch of the rocket
provides them with a powerful ritual that

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.889
prepares them for the lack of control they
feel over what might be the most dangerous

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.570
eight minutes of their lives.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.449
Religion is a recent addition to space ritual.
In 1994 cosmonaut Aleksandr Viktorenko requested

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:03.250
a blessing from an orthodox priest before
his mission. And this has since become a pre-launch

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.139
ritual. Even NASA and ESA astronauts launching
from Baikonur receive an orthodox blessing,

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.840
and that includes Tim Peake.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.910
Ritualistic behaviour brings people together,
providing social cohesion when there's little

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.290
or no intimacy to be had. And where could
that be more important than for a crew in

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.100
space? It cements the crew's relationship
with each other, it provides an all-important

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.440
link to Earth, and it provides them with a
sense of connection with their place in human

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.940
history.
