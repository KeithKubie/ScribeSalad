00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.780
Hi. I'm Geoff Donaker. I live here in the Bay

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.930
Area. California Bay Area and I have red green color blindness.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.795
&gt;&gt; OK, so red green color blindness. We, you know, just sort

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:10.910
of heard about that for the first time in the course, and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.730
we're learning a bit more about the inheritance patterns. What is red

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.230
green color blindness? What does it mean to be red green color blind?

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.820
&gt;&gt; Well, to me, what it means is that I often

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.795
mix up colors that have red in them. And so in particular,

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:29.620
I mix up reds and browns and sometimes browns and greens, because I'm

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.670
not seeing the red correctly in those. Sometimes it can even show up in

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.060
the form of blues and purples. I'm sort of seeing them all as about

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.600
the same, and in fact, you know, they may look different to other people.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.480
&gt;&gt; So, would be accurate in saying, just, they kind of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.600
look like darker colors or is it something about the shade maybe?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.790
&gt;&gt; I'm not really sure. I think that the way

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.200
to think about it, you know, for me is that,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.590
sometimes what you may be seeing is, is the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.530
red in a particular orange for instance. To me I'm

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.390
not seeing the red the same way you are,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.370
so I'm seeing it maybe like a dark yellow. and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.120
so I certainly see the world in a vibrant

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.570
colorful way, and it's not like black and white or

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.020
anything like that. I just see it differently than

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.920
everybody else who doesn't see it in red, green color.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.400
&gt;&gt; It's such a great like, literal and metaphorical statement. I think a lot

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.368
of people do go through life thinking that,

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:20.410
you know, the assumption, this is the color vision,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.630
this is the vision I have, but not

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.650
everybody literally sees the world in the same spectrum.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.580
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.560
&gt;&gt; When did you first know that you have red green color blindness?

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.200
&gt;&gt; You know, I don't really remember. It was when I was a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.440
really young child. my uncle had been red green color blind, and then actually

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.310
my mom's uncle as well. So I think I inherited it from her

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.620
side. And so when I was a little kid, she recognized that I might

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.900
be color blind, or had this perpensity. And so

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.450
she had me tested at, you know, one of the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.600
eye doctors with looking at the little bubble charts with

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.280
colors that you may remember having taken at some point.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.650
&gt;&gt; Sure and for anybody who may not be familiar with

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.670
those what can, can you describe that bubble chart a little more?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.290
&gt;&gt; Sure it's basically a lot of little

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.940
dots, and those dots typically show some sort of

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.630
a picture, character, letter that a red green color

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.770
blind person may not be able to pick out

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.810
the particular picture or letter that everybody else,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.240
you know, they, it pops out. So for

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.840
instance, back to my, yellow, orange analogy. you

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.390
know, you may have two different shades of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.590
orange in there that to you look really

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.920
obviously different, and to me look actually about

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.620
the same. So I'm not seeing that letter

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.780
that's popping out of the picture and you are.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.950
&gt;&gt; so as you've grown up, and even now as an

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.730
adult how does red green color blindness affect your daily life?

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.000
Do you have, what kind of special, if anything

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.040
sort of interactions you have to go through to accommodate?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.050
&gt;&gt; You know, not much. when I clothes shop I, you know, online certainly helps

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.680
these days because the colors are all labeled.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.890
you know when I go clothes shopping in

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.820
the store, I'll often ask the retail person just for sanity check. What color is

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.120
this? If it's blue, I'm generally pretty sure

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.650
I'm okay, or black or things like that.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.010
but if I'm getting something that's in the green spectrum,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.840
you know, I'll want a sanity check that it, it's

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.520
what I think it is, and it's not some version

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.770
of orange or something that people are going to comment on.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.191
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:11.290
&gt;&gt; so that's one way, you know, another way is just periodically things that

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.030
look camouflaged to me won't be camouflaged

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.640
to other people, so for instance, you

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.150
know, my kids the other day were playing with an orange ball in the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.930
yard. And to me when they dropped it in the grass, it was almost

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.010
camouflage in the grass. And you know they thought that was the funniest thing

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.680
in the world. Cause to them this orange was just totally popping off the lawn.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.020
&gt;&gt; Have you ever not been able to participate

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.490
in something or anything because of the color blindness

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.520
or anything like that? Or, or you've pretty much

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.360
always been able to find some work around if it

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.170
was an issue, you could, you know, it was

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.250
always doable? Yeah, I mean as a general statement

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.600
it's really never been a big deal. I certainly

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.170
remember a couple of times as a kid where I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.930
felt a little left out or picked on during art projects at school where,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.190
you know inevitably I picked the wrong color. Where you were supposed to be

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.400
something that was brown and I picked green, or something like that nature, and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.180
other kids would tease me and, I, yeah. I really remember maybe two or

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.040
three of these incidents, but you certainly

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.410
work around it, and somebody points you

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.150
to the right color, and you keep moving. so, never been a big deal

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.520
by any means, but, you know, there's certainly a little bit of that, like,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.540
you are a little bit different from the way everybody else is seeing it.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.020
&gt;&gt; if someone's watching this, and, you know, they're

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.880
like, oh, you know, I wonder if I'm color

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.680
blind, or maybe someone's recently found out they are,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.810
or someone they know is. What advice would you

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.030
give to somebody who may have recently found out

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.190
that, you know, they are red green color blind?

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.490
And of course there are other kinds of color

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.250
blindness too. what advice would you give to them?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.140
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I guess first point would simply

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.640
be it's not that big a deal. So, you know,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.930
roll with it and enjoy the fact that you're seeing the world

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.280
in a slightly different color hue than everybody else is. and then the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.240
other one would be, when you're picking clothes, ask a friend or the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.750
sales associate at the store just so that you know what you're buying.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.750
&gt;&gt;

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.970
[LAUGH]

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.300
sure
