JOANNA SMITH: I love developing
for Android, because of how

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.600
open and flexible platform is.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.227
Like there's nothing that I can
think of that I can't actually

00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:10.560
implement, which is pretty cool.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.120
I think that Android's
helping developers actually

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.685
do their job better by making
all of the tools so much easier

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:15.185
to use.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:17.594
Like Android Studio
2.0 is awesome,

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:20.010
and then there's like Espresso
and all these other testing

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.270
suites that are out now that
make it so much easier for me

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.353
to see where my users are.
