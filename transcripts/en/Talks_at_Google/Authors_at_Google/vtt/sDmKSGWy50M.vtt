00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:11.470
JAIME GREEN: All right,
thanks so much for coming in

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.640
to talk with us.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.640
So a couple of days
ago, Vogue magazine

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.450
published a beautiful
profile of you.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.470
I just want to, as
a way of starting,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.970
read what they wrote about the
book and your main character,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.980
because I think they
captured it pretty--

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.320
I'll let someone else
do a little bit of work.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.470
So they said, "when it comes
to fictional single women

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.960
in the city, there's a
few obvious touchstones.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.300
Andrea," who's the main
character of All Grown Up,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.330
"is Sex in the City's
Carrie Bradshaw,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.590
if Carrie drank bourbon
neat, hated herself

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.380
for not writing novels, and
was something of a nihilist.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.570
Andrea is Girls' Hannah
Horvath, if Hannah

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.720
had stuck with that one awful
copywriting job for a decade,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.240
and had become humble
and expansive and soulful

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.380
in the process.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.230
But if there's one character
Andrea most resembles,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.660
it's Phoebe
Waller-Bridge's Fleabag,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.460
not because, as
Attenberg sums it up,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.920
'single lady drinking and
screwing,'" which I think

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.970
we'll hear more
about in a minute.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.845
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:04.540
JAIME GREEN: OK.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.530
"But because in both cases,
recklessness and mordant

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.720
wit are the cover for
deeply entrenched,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.370
slowly revealed trauma--

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.240
pain that only gets more painful
the more we learn about it."

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.526
So that's one-- or a few
ways of describing Andrea.

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:19.650
How would you describe her?

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.220
JAMI ATTENBERG: I
think she's funny.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.880
I think that she's
self-deprecating.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.970
I think that she is
searching for happiness.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.060
She's somebody who
has had the same job--

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.460
given up her art
career for a really--

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.340
forever-- and has a
job in advertising,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.920
and sort of secretly
regrets giving it up,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.650
but just can't seem to
find her way back to it.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.520
She's somebody who is capable
of being a good friend,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.710
but also a bad friend.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.600
She's both good and
bad, that's the thing

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.270
that I really like about
her, in terms of a writer.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.770
It's just very
entertaining to write

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.634
somebody who fucks up some of
the time, or a lot of the time.

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:04.050
JAIME GREEN: So
it's entertaining.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.120
Is it ever hard to watch
her make a bad decision?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.840
When you're like, no, no, no!

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.139
I can see it go that way.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.330
JAMI ATTENBERG: No,
that's when it gets good,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.955
that's when it gets
really interesting.

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:11.920
Yeah.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.650
That's when you
make things happen

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.100
and you force these
characters to really reckon

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.160
with the reality.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.560
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.774
Before we dive more
into questions,

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.190
do you want to
read from the book?

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.065
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:24.915
Sure.

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:27.040
How about starting off with
something really dirty.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.240
Is that all right?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.810
JAIME GREEN: That is fine.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.309
JAMI ATTENBERG: We have a lot
of women in the audience here,

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:32.670
so I was like, I'm going for it.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.870
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.810
JAMI ATTENBERG: So this is
from a chapter called "Chloe."

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.360
and a lot of the
chapters in the book

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.549
are actually named after
women, and I just really wanted

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.840
that to-- even though on this
section I'm about to read

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.560
is about a man.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.470
But I really wanted to
make sure that there

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.740
was a really strong
female energy that

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.810
was running through this book.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.510
"We meet at a mutual friend's
barbecue, Barron and I.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.390
Our mutual friend's name is Deb,
and she had told me in advance

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.680
to look out for him.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.690
Newly single, she had texted.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.910
Like "newly" newly?

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.030
Fresh out of the womb?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.230
I texted back.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.840
Successful, creative,
smart, she texted.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.490
A catch!, I texted.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.470
In a year he'll be
a catch, she texted.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.600
Right now, he's a good time.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.070
Am I not good
enough for a catch?

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.030
I texted.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.480
She didn't text
back for six hours.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.130
Sorry, she texted.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.450
Work.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.490
There was another pause.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.490
Am I mistaken that you
want to have a good time?

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.110
she texted.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.720
I'd wanted to argue so
badly, but I couldn't.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.730
Barron and I have an
extremely long conversation

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.170
about potato salad
because Deb has

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.180
made two kinds of potato
salad, the creamy kind

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.470
and the vinegary kind.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.780
It is dumb, jokey conversation--
kind of worthless,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.150
actually-- but he looks at
me with obvious interest

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.020
and desire.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.820
I get a little hot in my pants.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.940
He has a shaved head, the early
male pattern baldness shave.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.950
He cleans his glasses a
lot and I point this out

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.870
and he shrugs and says, I
can't stand fingerprints.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.900
I take his glasses from
him, breathe on them,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.970
and wipe them on the
end of my silky shirt.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.070
Like new, I say,
and hand them back.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.504
You're helpful, he says.

00:04:01.504 --> 00:04:02.920
At some point in
the conversation,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.960
we realized we lived 10
blocks from each other.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.112
Convenient, I say, and grin.

00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:08.820
Deb lives in a garden
apartment and there

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.420
are children running in
and out of the garden

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.170
and the apartment.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.090
And one of them
screeches and I shudder.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.140
Children, ugh!

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.040
I say.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.830
I have a child, Barron says.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.579
Just because I don't
like children doesn't

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.250
mean I can't like you, I
say, and I touch his arm

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.310
and feel like both a failure
and a success at the same time,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.680
because even though I've
already fucked this up,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.469
I was probably
supposed to, anyway.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.510
Two normal people walk
away from each other right

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.289
then and there, but
instead, he gives me

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.830
a ride home and parks in front
of a fire hydrant on my street

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.840
and then we make out in
the front seat of his car

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.256
while I ignore the presence
of the child seat in the back.

00:04:40.256 --> 00:04:41.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.400
He's really aggressive.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.740
Tongue in the mouth, ear,
throat, squeezing my breasts

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.700
hard through my blouse.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.029
I'm both mortified and aroused.

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.820
I put my hand on his
dick through his pants

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.770
and he stops and says,
you're the first person

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.960
I've been with besides
my ex-wife in 12 years.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.100
I say, whoa, that's a
lot for a first date!

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.680
And he says, this wasn't a date.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.540
And I feel suddenly
hoarse and damaged.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.759
OK, I say, I'm done.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.050
I put my hand on the door,
but I give him a few seconds

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.561
to apologize, which he does.

00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:08.560
He says, I'm sorry, I
don't know what I'm doing.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.060
I don't know if I'm
coming or going.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.679
I'm having every
emotion at once.

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:12.970
He takes my hand and kisses it.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.320
You're beautiful, he says.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.840
You're beautiful and sexy and
you should let me take you out

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.190
and we'll do this right.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.190
Toxic, says my co-worker,
Nina, on Monday morning.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.260
Drop him immediately.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.957
He texts me on
Wednesday and asks me

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.040
if I want to have dinner
with him on Friday night.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.300
I say I have plans, because
I'm trying to play hard to get,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.860
which has absolutely
never worked

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.164
for me in my entire life.

00:05:33.164 --> 00:05:35.080
He says he can't see me
on Saturday because he

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.246
has his daughter that night.

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:37.360
I fold instantly.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.980
I'll move something
around, I say.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.260
We pick a restaurant
in the neighborhood,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.885
but as a pretense,
because we both know

00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:42.980
what is going to happen.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.290
We've been texting about
the things we're going

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.850
to do to each other for days.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.160
It's terrible and
it's all I want.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.960
On Friday, I take off
work early and get

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.820
groomed in various ways.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.840
Then I go to Dean and
Deluca and buy blueberries

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.530
and then I allow myself the
indulgence of a MoMA visit.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.870
I pay $25 and go
up to the top floor

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.592
and wend my way
through the museum.

00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:02.050
Eventually I found
myself lingering

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.820
around their
permanent collection.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.070
All that work those
people made for decades,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.590
and here's their greatest
hits, one or two pieces

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.930
plucked from storage.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.370
Better the one piece than
none at all, I guess.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.300
I miss painting.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.800
Even the fumes I miss.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.720
I spent the past 13
years looking for a smell

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.220
to replace it.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.640
Hours later, I'm smelling all
of him, his fumes, a cocktail

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.300
at the bar before
our reservation.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.330
I am 38 and he is 42.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.250
I'm just starting
over, he tells me.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.920
Sometimes I feel like
I'm done, I tell him.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.930
Dinner's fast, but I
still try to enjoy myself

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.010
because I love food.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.620
At the weirdest, darkest, most
stressful moments of my life,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.630
I always make sure
to have a nice meal.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.920
I order a steak.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.570
I want it rare, I
tell the waitress.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.650
Like, bloody red.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.970
Carnivore, he says.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.420
That's me, I say.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.520
We drink two glasses
of wine each and I say,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.936
you know what we
should have done?

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.367
And he says, gotten the bottle?

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.700
I never plan that right, I
say, and he says, me neither.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.090
And we smile at each other.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.400
Let's just get along, I think.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.150
All we have to do is get along.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.970
We walked to my apartment, not
his, which he claims is a mess.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.250
He's wearing a hat and a
chambray shirt and shorts

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.196
and loafers and he
has an easy stride.

00:07:04.196 --> 00:07:06.070
I'm wearing a black
dress, loose and summery,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.980
and I feel pretty and
intellectually engaged

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.420
after my day of art.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.705
Also, I feel drunk.

00:07:10.705 --> 00:07:12.330
At home there is
bourbon and I tell him

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.746
that while we walk
and he tells me

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:15.519
I'm a dream girl--
like he literally says,

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:18.060
I feel like you were sent to me
as a present from the heavens

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.559
above.

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:21.150
And I laugh so
hard, but I love it.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.790
When we get to my studio,
he surveys it and nods.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.170
The art, the stacks of books,
the pots and pans dangling

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.540
dramatically from a ceiling
rack, while I shakily,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.680
excitedly pour us
two bourbons, neat.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.830
We clink glasses and
then drink quickly.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.060
This is so exciting, he says.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.323
I'm so excited!

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:39.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.920
I boldly take off my dress.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.630
I'm just standing there
naked in front of him.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.921
I love all the curves, he says.

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:45.480
Hips, yes.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.470
He is nodding at
me, approving of me.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.830
I realize I am desperate for
his approval, this man who

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.425
was married, this father of one,
this someone else's, now mine.

00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:55.800
He takes off his hat and then
a shirt and then his pants.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.341
He is pale white
and nearly hairless,

00:07:57.341 --> 00:07:59.430
and I realize he has
trimmed his pubic hair.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.979
Did you-- I point to his crotch.

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:02.520
I thought I was
supposed to, he says.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.130
I read it in GQ.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.590
I really haven't seen
it before, I say.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.350
I think I went a little
too far, he says.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.670
I waxed my chest, too.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.180
It hurt.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:12.880
I waxed too.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.380
I say.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.160
Just here, though.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.210
I motion to my crotch.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.590
It looks nice on you, he says.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.149
Normal.

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:20.190
Our confessions done, we
kiss and then he's on me

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.840
and it's fast.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840
It's happening, it's on.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.600
He bends me over on my couch and
from behind begins to pound me.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.995
There's a mirror
nearby and I can

00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:28.620
see that he's watching himself,
watching his facial expression.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.565
This moment has so
little to do with me.

00:08:30.565 --> 00:08:32.190
After a while, we
try another position.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.120
And then another position.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.203
And then another position.

00:08:34.203 --> 00:08:35.159
And then another one.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:35.900
Can we go back?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.620
I say.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.500
What Huh?

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.669
He gasps, pushes his
glasses up, looks at me.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.185
I like what we're doing
before, like 10 minutes ago.

00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:44.310
Hold on, he says, and he
stops to clean his glasses

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.320
with my nearby underpants.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.320
Then we rearrange our
bodies to the old position

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.111
and we move very slowly
and it's fantastic,

00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:52.650
but then he starts to speed up.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.150
And he goes faster
and harder and it

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.310
feels like he's trying to
murder me with his dick.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.700
And I say, slow
down a little, baby!

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.940
And he says, I can't, I'm going
to come, don't make me stop!

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.981
So I don't, because this
is his first time having

00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:05.030
sex with another person other
than his wife in 12 years

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.100
and it's with me and I want
him to remember it as great.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.620
I let him pound me for another
minute and he orgasms loud--

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.994
certainly loud enough to be
heard from the street below--

00:09:12.994 --> 00:09:14.820
and he's just so
proud of himself.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.740
And almost immediately
I begin to hate him,

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.825
but I also desire
him even more, too."

00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:23.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.540
Thanks.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.574
So romantic.

00:09:25.574 --> 00:09:27.990
JAIME GREEN: There's something--
at the end of that scene,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.680
Andrea says--

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.680
about how it was wonderful
and she loved it,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.406
and she also hates
him a little bit.

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:37.780
I feel like that's
a reaction she

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.095
has often throughout the book.

00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:43.970
It's not that she just
hates a lot of people,

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.370
but something about--

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.510
is it strong feelings
or vulnerability

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.260
from other people?

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.930
She has this-- she gets
repulsed by something.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.990
JAMI ATTENBERG: She doesn't
want to deal with it.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.531
She doesn't want to
deal with things.

00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:58.050
She doesn't have a middle
ground a lot of the times.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.024
There's not a lot of--

00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:01.190
there is a lot of nuance
to this book, but in a way,

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.856
there's not a lot of
nuance to her life.

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:06.080
But she's also, on the
other hand, she's almost--

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.460
she's 38 in that and
she's basically almost 40

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.900
for most of the book in
the present tense timeline.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.520
And she kind of
knows what she wants.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.270
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.270
JAMI ATTENBERG: And that's cool
to actually know what you want.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.940
And she doesn't-- she's
not hard to deal with.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.700
She just, in her mind,
is like, well, I'm

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.200
not interested in
babies and I'm not

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.540
interested in getting
married or settling down

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.710
in any kind of way.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.210
But still, part of her
recognizes that she wants some

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.550
sort of, I don't know if
it's validation from society,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.580
but she wants to figure out
how to be more grown up,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.010
how to be an adult.
And she can't--

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.310
she's never fit into that
conventional timeline

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.200
or those conventional
milestones.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.270
So what is she going to--

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.770
she keeps seeking it, in a way.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.520
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.930
So she's not choosing the
markers on the old-fashioned

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.290
or just traditional path of
a career that you advance in

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.910
and a partner and marriage
and babies and a house and all

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.815
that.

00:11:02.815 --> 00:11:05.380
That's how we know
we're grown up.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.720
And she doesn't
want those things.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.860
And so then she--

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.530
she's a grown-up age,
she has a grown-up job,

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.180
she has an apartment.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.740
But she just doesn't know how
else to measure grownup-ness.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.600
JAMI ATTENBERG: And really, the
book is kind of about her, one,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.375
figuring out how to be happy.

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:25.250
Not just her, but every
character in the book

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.610
is sort of striving for that
grownup-ness and that maturity

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.810
and also the self-satisfaction
that comes with age.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.760
And then two,
well, I don't know,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.340
I think that's really
what the book is about.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.040
That she's really
seeking what's going

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.210
to be the next step for
her and how to be happy.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.110
JAIME GREEN: Because
you write about how

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.550
she feels like she's stuck.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.700
Her life hasn't changed
in 10 years or so.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.951
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:11:54.951 --> 00:11:57.450
JAIME GREEN: You said earlier
that she knows what she wants,

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.844
she knows what she doesn't want.

00:11:58.844 --> 00:12:00.510
But she also-- it
seems like she doesn't

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.285
know what she wants from her
life, in terms of that shape.

00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:05.910
One of the recurring
things in the book

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.517
is her conversations with her
therapist, or her thinking

00:12:08.517 --> 00:12:11.100
about her therapist, and how she
doesn't want to go to therapy

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.080
or does.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.490
But there's one section where
she's thinking that she just

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.260
doesn't know what she
wants, that she feels stuck,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.100
but she doesn't
know what she wants.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.130
And one of the ways
I've heard about writing

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.130
fiction or writing a plot
is that you figure out

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.500
what your character wants
and you put them on a path

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.420
and you put some
obstacles in the way.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.540
But since she struggles
to know what she wants,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.959
was it hard to propel
her through the story?

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.000
JAMI ATTENBERG: Well, I
think that one way that I

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.640
deal with that is
that I show all

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.620
of these flashback
chapters, where

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.220
you see who she was as a kid.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.860
There's scenes of her
when she's 13, chapters

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.380
when she's 13 and
chapters where she's

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.440
16 and chapters when she's in
her 20s and early 30s, as well.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.770
And so all of those,
I think those things

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.110
propel the story forward
because you get to see--

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.840
I wanted to have just a fully
realized character where

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.430
you knew everything about her.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.740
And I also wanted to be
the story of being a woman,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.320
as well.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.930
And the way that
different things

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.300
that have happened your life
can impact you as a woman.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.030
Although I do think that men
will also enjoy this book

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.770
and can read this book and
should read this book, in fact.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.270
JAIME GREEN: Yeah, there's a
lot, definitely a lot to learn.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.770
And also, she's just--

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.660
she's interesting
and she's human.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.480
And what a sad state
of the world that we

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.810
have to fight for
books about women

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.670
to be seen as
applying to everyone.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.620
But it's true.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.140
It's there.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.247
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:13:38.247 --> 00:13:40.580
JAIME GREEN: Let's talk a
little bit about the structure

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.070
because you've mentioned
it a couple of times.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.490
The chapters, which all have
different names, and the way

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:51.680
they jump around in time, it's
a really interesting structure.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.457
How would you describe it?

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:55.040
JAMI ATTENBERG: When
I was writing it,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.831
there were different
story cycles within it

00:13:56.831 --> 00:14:00.230
and there were
different topics that I

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.762
wanted to address that I felt
fit into certain categories.

00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:04.220
So there's a couple
of stories that

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.200
fall under the "where she
lives, apartment" category.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.780
And then she has
a best friend who

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.380
she watches get
married and have a baby

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.860
and have a more, quote
unquote, "adult life moments"

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.910
happen to her.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.932
And so there are all these
little cycles that I--

00:14:19.932 --> 00:14:21.890
I don't know if other
people would notice them,

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.181
but I know they're there and
I felt like they sort of--

00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:26.420
it's a very short novel,
and I think that they

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.850
make the novel feel bigger.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.640
But then beyond that, yeah,
it just switches time a lot

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.537
and part of it is
because when you

00:14:33.537 --> 00:14:35.870
think about the most important
things that ever happened

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.160
to you in your life, like
you made a top 10 list,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.200
it wouldn't be in
chronological order.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.590
You might say number
one is getting married,

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.965
but number two is getting into
a fistfight with your neighbor

00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:50.840
in the seventh grade.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.580
Number three is getting
your heart broken.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.730
And number four is
going to college.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.910
So you would be surprised
if you sat down and tried

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.040
to make that list.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.390
There's just not a
linear path to it.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.720
And so I didn't see a linear
path for her in this book,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.290
either.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.790
JAIME GREEN: Yeah,
and we also see--

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.870
there's one of those cycles-- or
three lines that's popping up--

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.130
is a little bit chronological.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.590
She goes from 38
to, I guess, 41?

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.180
40?

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.570
And the flashbacks and bits from
her past are informing that.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.014
She has this memory
about the dinner parties

00:15:22.014 --> 00:15:23.930
that her mother used to
throw when she was 17.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.100
And then as present day
Andrea is dealing with that,

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.560
we get the scene where we
get to see what happens,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.080
as she's remembering
it, and figuring out

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.730
how it fits into her life.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.510
And so even as all of those
bigger arcs are going through,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.152
each of the chapters has a sort
of self-contained feeling, too.

00:15:42.152 --> 00:15:43.610
JAMI ATTENBERG:
Like a short story.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.970
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.386
JAMI ATTENBERG:
They were all kind

00:15:45.386 --> 00:15:47.420
of originally short
stories and I wrote them

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.410
all as short stories.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.785
And then, at some
point, they had

00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:52.250
to get altered because it was
clear it was really a novel.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.360
And so they had to be--

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.210
I had to move things around
a little bit in service

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.890
of the bigger
picture of the novel.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.337
I couldn't keep
repeating things.

00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:03.170
But the other thing is,
I just really wanted

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.830
to make an interesting book.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.520
I wanted it to be interesting
to read, where people were like,

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.610
oh, it's not what I expected
at all, and this happens here

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.260
and this happens here.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.302
So literally every
chapter, you're just like,

00:16:14.302 --> 00:16:16.010
I don't know what's
going to happen next.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.020
I don't know where she
is in this exact moment.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.630
I wanted to have that
experience of it feeling really

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.040
surprising and fresh and new.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.030
And I was also thinking about
the way people read now.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.660
And I wasn't interested in
writing these long and lovely

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.820
sentences.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.291
I was sort of over
sentences, which

00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:36.290
is such a pretentious and
terrible thing to say.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.830
But this is kind of
my post-sentence book,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.080
which makes sense to me.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.120
But I really was thinking
about how everybody

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.010
wants all the
information right now,

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.420
and so I wanted
to just make sure

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.000
that it always felt like
you were finding out

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.090
exactly what's happening.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.200
And I wanted it to feel true,
so all those things, to me--

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.370
the subject matter and
the themes and the form

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.890
all integrate.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.780
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.550
So another thing about Andrea
is she sees herself as a failed

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.040
artist, or a former artist.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.150
She went to art school and
then, when she was about 20,

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.510
left and bailed and has, in
some ways, abandoned that art.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.910
Although, in the really
beautiful first chapter,

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.660
I think, we learn that,
in her Williamsburg

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.510
loft with her view of the
Empire State Building, every day

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.060
or multiple times a
day, she draws or paints

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.860
the Empire State Building.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.250
But it's this
secret, hidden thing

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.710
that feels very disconnected
from the rest of her life.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.420
And one of the
things she says when

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.600
she's talking about
going to galleries

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.476
is saying she can tell
when an artist is lying

00:17:50.476 --> 00:17:52.850
or an artist is telling the
truth, which is what you just

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:53.725
said about this book.

00:17:53.725 --> 00:17:57.530
You wanted it to be true.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.260
Is that a sixth sense
that you feel like you

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.620
have about other novels or art?

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.287
JAMI ATTENBERG: I say that,
but you could just as easily--

00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:08.870
what is true for me
is not necessarily

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:09.950
true for other people.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:14.080
And their art also--

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.440
somebody might feel that
way about this book.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.450
In a way, it kind
of doesn't matter,

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.700
because whatever you're going
to get out of this book,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.520
you're going to get out of
this book, or any piece of art.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.850
It's important to
me, but I don't

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.889
care if it's important
to anyone else.

00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:33.180
JAIME GREEN: That's fair, yeah.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.306
It had to feel true to you
as you were writing it.

00:18:35.306 --> 00:18:36.180
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.010
JAIME GREEN: True is also--

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.176
JAMI ATTENBERG: It's my art.

00:18:38.176 --> 00:18:40.060
JAIME GREEN: Yeah, totally.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:46.120
And true is an interesting sort
of goal in a work of fiction

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:46.620
also.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.110
Obviously, there's
emotional truth and things

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.030
that feel true.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.700
JAMI ATTENBERG: I think fiction
can somehow make something

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.440
feel more real than nonfiction.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.860
Because you have
access to things.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.600
You have access to her secrets.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.599
And you have access to
her interior thoughts.

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:09.890
And you know everything about--

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.098
you know what she was like
when she was a little kid.

00:19:12.098 --> 00:19:15.021
Whereas if you were
interviewing her, if she was--

00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:17.270
a newspaper profile or
something like that, you really

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:21.440
would only be able to know x
amount of things about her.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.850
JAIME GREEN: That's funny
because your last book, Saint

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.640
Mazie, was built, in part,
on imagined interviews.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.390
So that one, you had the
story of Mazie's life

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.080
and then a contemporary person
trying to piece it together

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.460
and doing interviews.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.410
I don't really have a question.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.700
It's an interesting--

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.980
JAMI ATTENBERG: It was a
theme also in that book

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.170
because it was based
on a real person

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.300
and there wasn't very
much information about her

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.900
in the real world.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.620
And so it was initially
quite frustrating to me

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.287
because I wanted to
know more about her.

00:19:56.287 --> 00:19:58.620
But then it was really freeing
because I realized that I

00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.914
can invent whatever I wanted.

00:19:59.914 --> 00:20:01.580
And it was a lesson
to me that we aren't

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.746
entitled to know everything.

00:20:02.746 --> 00:20:05.660
That we aren't actually entitled
to other people's truths.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.120
And there's very
few pictures of her.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.880
I ended up finding a picture
of that person after the fact.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.440
Really, there was
probably a handful

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.914
of pictures that were ever
taken because this person was--

00:20:18.914 --> 00:20:20.330
what she was based
on was-- helped

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.870
the homeless for decades.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.800
And she was a little
too busy saving lives

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.750
to worry about taking a selfie.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.510
I also think that our society is
a hugely confessional society.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.090
And yet, at the same time,
so much of that confession

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.172
is done on the internet.

00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:40.880
I think we both know
that everyone always

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.200
seems happier on the internet
than they actually are.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.366
JAIME GREEN: I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:20:45.366 --> 00:20:50.344
JAMI ATTENBERG: So yes, I was
thinking about all those things

00:20:50.344 --> 00:20:51.260
when I was writing it.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.811
What we're entitled
to or not entitled to

00:20:54.811 --> 00:20:56.810
JAIME GREEN: But then
with Andrea, in this book,

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.350
we end up being entitled
to sort of everything?

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.354
She doesn't have any
secrets from the reader.

00:21:02.354 --> 00:21:03.770
JAMI ATTENBERG:
Yeah, that's true.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.600
But it's fiction.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.990
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:10.270
And so circling back
to that idea of truth,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.360
something that you've
written about and talked

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.190
about in the past
is how frustrating

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.350
it can be when people
make assumptions

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.430
that your writing
is autobiographical.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.270
For two books ago,
for The Middlesteins,

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.430
which centers around a
character who's very obese,

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.130
you've said that when you
were on book tour for that,

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.670
people would meet you and be
surprised that you weren't also

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.342
obese, because they were--

00:21:31.342 --> 00:21:33.300
JAMI ATTENBERG: They were
like, you're not fat.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.980
And I'm like, thank you.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.230
JAIME GREEN: I invented things.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:42.540
Which can be-- the
whole point is that you

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.650
invent things and are creative.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.260
And that seems like it's
been really frustrating.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.593
JAMI ATTENBERG: But that's
how I've gotten to the place,

00:21:49.593 --> 00:21:54.509
for sure, where I'm
like, it's just my art.

00:21:54.509 --> 00:21:55.300
It's just my thing.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.590
And so I have to learn
how-- it is frustrating,

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.390
just on a personal
day-to-day level

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:05.530
of having people say
messed up things to you.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.430
But it also has helped me to
have a remove from my books,

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.280
or forced me to have
a remove from my books

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.029
and a specific kind
of way where I'm like,

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:16.500
it doesn't matter
what they think.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.000
I want people to
love my writing.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.190
I write it so that it's--

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.870
I write it for me
first, but I also

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.550
know that ultimately I want
an audience to read this.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.860
I want them to enjoy it
and love it or hate it

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.400
or just feel
something, feel deeply.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.330
But I also know that I can't
take it too personally when

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.579
people don't get it.

00:22:39.579 --> 00:22:40.120
I don't know.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.520
You just don't
know what people--

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.430
you don't know their stories.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.180
You don't know their lives.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.040
You don't know what
it meant to them

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.720
or how it triggered
something in them.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.470
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.650
And them thinking that it's
autobiographical in nature

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.617
doesn't necessarily mean that
it's less affecting to them.

00:22:53.617 --> 00:22:55.450
JAMI ATTENBERG: It's
how they're reading it.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.880
Again, because
everyone just assumes--

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.010
we're all just documenting
everything all the time,

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.051
so people are just like--

00:23:01.051 --> 00:23:03.760
I think it's easy for people
to want to make that leap.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.680
I just don't really enjoy
consuming art that way.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.170
And I don't want people to
consume my art that way.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:11.920
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.620
JAMI ATTENBERG: But
I can't control it.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.231
JAIME GREEN: Well, it also--

00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:18.730
if people consume
your art that way,

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.430
they start making assumptions
about you and about your life.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.730
And you're like, that's
not my experience.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.250
Because in some ways, on
the very surface of things,

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:32.320
you do share some aspects
of your life with Andrea.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.850
Living in Williamsburg--

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.260
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah, she
feels like a neighbor.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:35.650
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.720
JAMI ATTENBERG: Like
I knew the landscape.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.810
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:39.310
She--

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.268
JAMI ATTENBERG: The same
with The Middlesteins.

00:23:41.268 --> 00:23:44.100
I knew where it was set
and everything like that.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.450
But I feel like there's
five million books that

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.720
are set in New York.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.365
And authors live in New York.

00:23:50.365 --> 00:23:53.057
I don't know if everybody
gets that question.

00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:54.140
JAIME GREEN: I don't know.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.520
Yeah.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.060
I mean--

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.976
JAMI ATTENBERG: It is a
very popular question.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.280
JAIME GREEN: She is
sort of demographically

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.762
pretty similar to you in
a lot of ways, I think?

00:24:05.762 --> 00:24:06.970
JAMI ATTENBERG: I don't know.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.570
I look at her life and
I would never want it.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.528
JAIME GREEN: Well yeah.

00:24:09.528 --> 00:24:12.130
That's what I was
going to ask, but I

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.795
wonder if she's, in some ways,
a diverged parallel universe

00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:16.420
version of you.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.960
Because the big difference
is, she has given up her art

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.090
and feels sort of consumed
and troubled by that.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.525
And you, your life
is making your art.

00:24:26.525 --> 00:24:27.400
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.952
As I said, to me, it has always
felt like she was a neighbor.

00:24:31.952 --> 00:24:33.910
There was an apartment
building that I actually

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.560
went to go visit
because I was thinking

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.310
about moving out of
the apartment building

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.210
that I lived in.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.626
And it was five
blocks away and it

00:24:41.626 --> 00:24:44.500
had the same view as my view.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.212
And I always remember that.

00:24:47.212 --> 00:24:48.920
So I never think of
it as parallel lives.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.430
I really think of it as
five blocks away life.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.500
And I was like, this is where--

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.500
somebody is going to move into
this apartment that's not me.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.150
I remember thinking that.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.340
Who is the person that
moves into this apartment?

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.270
And that was probably
five or six years ago.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.800
And then when I was writing
this book and setting it,

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.400
I was imagining the person
who lived in that apartment.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.300
I know the terrain.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.919
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:14.460
It's helpful.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.012
I know that some
writers who will--

00:25:16.012 --> 00:25:17.970
if they write in a city
that they've never been

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.367
to, they'll--

00:25:19.367 --> 00:25:21.075
oh, now it sounds like
product placement,

00:25:21.075 --> 00:25:22.740
because I was going to
say they use Google Maps

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.191
and use Street View to see it.

00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:24.690
I'm sorry.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.640
But you're writing
it in a neighborhood

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.560
that you've lived
in and it feels--

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.610
you're not name dropping
cafes or anything,

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.646
but I feel like the
streets are real

00:25:37.646 --> 00:25:38.770
and the place is real, too.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.130
JAMI ATTENBERG: That's good.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.066
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:25:42.066 --> 00:25:43.440
JAIME GREEN: I
would love to talk

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.680
a little bit about Andrea's
relationship with art, though.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.810
Because I feel like
that's one of the most--

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.880
it's one of the big
sadnesses in her life

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.775
and she feels like it's
too late in a lot of ways.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.670
So first, did you decide
to make her an artist?

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.310
Or did she sort of
come that way to you?

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.330
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yes, she
showed up as an artist.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.070
I think the part
of it is that I've

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.440
had jobs where I worked
in corporate America

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.402
before as a freelancer.

00:26:17.402 --> 00:26:18.860
And I didn't even
realize that this

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.300
is why I was doing this
until-- but now you're

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:26.370
like my 20th interview, so
I've had to dig into my brain

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.950
and figure out why I was
doing what I was doing.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.750
Can't we just write
a book and let it be?

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:34.050
No, we must dissect it over
and over and over again.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.340
JAIME GREEN: Sorry.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.340
JAMI ATTENBERG: But no,
I have a recollection

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.620
of when I worked in
different offices

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.760
doing freelance work,
sometimes creative.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.430
I've done online
content development

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.430
and some copywriting
and things like that.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.230
But I was doing this
as I was writing books.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.854
Because a lot of my books--

00:26:56.854 --> 00:26:58.770
this is my sixth book
and like the first three

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:03.420
did not sell very well, so I was
always writing and freelancing.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.810
And then I would meet people
who were also creative people--

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.220
either artists or writers--

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.680
but they were all
in in the office.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.460
And they were like,
you're a real writer.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.620
And I was like,
who's that person?

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.990
Same as the person
living in that house.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.780
Who's that person who
says, oh, once I was this

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.250
and now I'm not anymore.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.260
That was interesting
to me as well.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.717
And how did it feel?

00:27:29.717 --> 00:27:30.300
How's it feel?

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.540
And also I was
really glad that I

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.330
made the choices that I made,
even though it was really hard

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.050
and an exceptional
financial struggle for me.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.840
And I was 40 years
old and I was still

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.240
couch surfing before my
fourth book came out.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.470
I was really broke.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.480
But I couldn't do
it any other way.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:57.130
I had to-- it was
really important to me

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.410
to keep pursuing it.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.706
In a way, I think it is--

00:28:01.706 --> 00:28:03.580
again, I don't think of
it as parallel lives,

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.575
but I have a friend who read
this book and he was like,

00:28:05.575 --> 00:28:07.033
oh, it's like your
worst nightmare.

00:28:07.033 --> 00:28:08.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.250
If that's helpful.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.440
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.320
But on the one hand, Andrea--

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.170
it's a huge sadness
and loss in her life.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:22.300
But she also realizes
that the life

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.030
of sacrifice and
rejection for art

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.920
isn't necessarily
what she wanted.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.012
I'm not sure she made
the wrong decision.

00:28:29.012 --> 00:28:30.220
JAMI ATTENBERG: Right, right.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.261
Well there's a character
in the book name Matthew

00:28:32.261 --> 00:28:35.110
who is an artist, and he's
all in on being an artist.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.570
And I honestly feel
like if there's anyone

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.600
that I identify with
in the book with,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.370
it's that person more
than anybody else.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.584
I get him more.

00:28:43.584 --> 00:28:45.250
I got him instantly,
where I didn't even

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.690
have to dive very
deep and I just

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.430
knew exactly where
he was coming from.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.590
Where you're kind of like, oh,
well, this is what I'm doing.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.195
I'm here.

00:28:51.195 --> 00:28:55.997
I'm never going to
really get there.

00:28:55.997 --> 00:28:58.080
Because I've been there,
I've for sure been there.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.060
I think my intention is
for her to somehow find

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.040
her way back to it.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.560
And when I think about the
outside universe for the book,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.570
I think, oh, yeah,
she'll figure out

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.360
some way to get back into
it a little bit more.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.820
As I said, this book is
about her finding happiness.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.060
And I wanted to
write a book that

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:25.250
was about a single
woman that was not

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.350
looking for the marriage or the
children or anything like that.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.070
And so once you wipe
that equation out,

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.270
it's like, what is it then?

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.603
What is the thing that's
really going to make her happy?

00:29:34.603 --> 00:29:38.390
And so I am hoping that
she finds her way to that.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.640
And also, a recognition
that your friends

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.700
your family can be
wonderful, and maybe you

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.970
have to be more
connected with them, too.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:47.720
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.380
That even if it's not a
romantic partner and children,

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.110
it's still about finding
the people around you

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.200
and building that.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.075
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:29:56.075 --> 00:29:58.017
There's all kinds of
partnerships to be had.

00:29:58.017 --> 00:29:59.600
JAIME GREEN: We're
going to open it up

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.860
for questions in a minute.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.501
We've got a microphone
over there if anyone--

00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:05.750
if you want to ask a question,
just go stand behind it

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:10.160
and then I'll know that
that's why you're there.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.410
I was rereading
the book this week

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.420
and I finished it
yesterday, which

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.000
was International
Women's Day, and--

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.110
yes.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:22.505
And it struck me, in
that context, how--

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.710
the book, in that context,
felt much more explicitly

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.580
political and feminist to me.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.620
That I saw so much of what
Andrea was fighting against.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.940
The sort of prescribed path
of women as wives and mothers

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.840
and that that's the goal.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.170
And that her personal struggle--

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:51.670
I saw the huge social leading
up to it and everything.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:57.210
And I see that she's
finding a lot of freedom

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.080
in resisting that
prescribed path,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.100
but also gets lost
in some ways, too.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.610
And this is not in
the neighborhood of

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.610
"can women have it all?"

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.734
JAMI ATTENBERG: I keep
getting asked that question.

00:31:11.734 --> 00:31:12.860
I'm like, I don't know!

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.610
JAIME GREEN: But she's
not even trying to.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:15.900
JAMI ATTENBERG:
That's right, yeah.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.441
JAIME GREEN:
Apparently, the original

00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:20.700
"can women have it all?" was
just a job and kids, and not

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.590
even all the other
awful assumptions.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.026
But she's sort of--

00:31:27.026 --> 00:31:28.650
things are harder
for her because she's

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.620
trying to figure out her own
path and her own way of being

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.270
grown up if that checklist
is being grown up.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:42.430
So I guess what I want
to ask is, what is--

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.900
sorry, it sounds
so cheesy, but I

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.149
think the answer will be good.

00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:48.310
What does being grown up
mean to you if it's not

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:52.667
that old-fashioned
path of adulthood?

00:31:52.667 --> 00:31:54.250
JAMI ATTENBERG: It's
different, right?

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.540
It's different.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.340
I've spent a lot
of time thinking

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.255
about it because I
had to have an answer.

00:32:00.255 --> 00:32:02.380
JAIME GREEN: If you're
going to call the book that.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.588
JAMI ATTENBERG: That's right.

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:05.860
I had to know how I
felt about it, even

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.850
though how she feels
about it is different.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.570
For me personally, it's
about taking responsibility

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:18.010
for the choices that I make
and knowing why I'm making them

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.930
and just really owning
my life decisions.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.140
And yeah, that's it.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.280
That's what it is
for me, to know

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.920
why I'm doing what I'm doing
and be able to stand behind it.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.670
JAIME GREEN: Cool.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:34.510
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.080
You can have that,
also, if you want.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.840
It could be your
definition, too.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.310
JAIME GREEN: I like that.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.710
JAMI ATTENBERG: It
could be everybody

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:39.827
in the room's definition.

00:32:39.827 --> 00:32:40.910
But see, that's the thing.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.570
It's a very subtle, nuanced
kind of thing, right?

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.240
But it's actually real because
you can have all those--

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.430
you could have a baby
and that does not

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.739
mean you're a grown up at all.

00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:51.280
You can buy a house
and that does not

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.820
mean you're a grown up at all.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.940
And I think it's really about
making the adult choices.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.570
JAIME GREEN: That's good.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.150
Got a question.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.050
AUDIENCE 1: Hi.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.100
Thank you, Jami.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.910
And also Jaime.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.400
This has been a
lovely conversation.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.320
So what seems really
interesting about a book

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.120
like this is that it keeps--

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.620
once you've written
it and finished,

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.360
it keeps on existing in the
world with different contexts.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.120
So yesterday,
International Women's Day,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.995
I feel actually much closer to
the characters and kind of love

00:33:18.995 --> 00:33:20.370
them a little bit
more, even when

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:23.550
I'm grossed out by their
decisions or I want to say,

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.270
please grow up.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.890
Or whatever that is.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.650
So I guess I wonder, for you,
what is the post-book writing

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:29.640
process for you?

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.034
Are you interested in keeping
to talk about it afterwards

00:33:34.034 --> 00:33:36.450
and how it relates to current
events and things like that?

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.712
Or are you just done with it?

00:33:38.712 --> 00:33:40.170
You said you've
done 20 interviews,

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.610
so I wonder how that is for you.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:42.420
JAMI ATTENBERG: I've
done 20 interviews,

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.730
but the book only just
came out two days ago.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.920
So I actually have a ways to go.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.214
I have two months of touring.

00:33:50.214 --> 00:33:51.630
It's always
interesting to see how

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.250
you feel about the book at
the beginning of the tour

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.530
versus how you feel about
it at the end of the tour,

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.230
and how I will feel about
it six months from now.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.160
It's going to be
a different thing.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.005
But I know that--

00:34:04.005 --> 00:34:06.960
it was a hesitation, on my
part, to write this book.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.010
Because I was like,
if I write this book,

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.820
then I have to freaking
talk about this stuff

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.130
for like-- if the
book does well,

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.199
then you talk about
it for a year or two.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:17.130
It just keeps going.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:20.280
And I've found, even now,
The Middlesteins came out

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.520
five years ago and I still get
asked about it in interviews.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.159
Which is great,
and it's wonderful

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.659
if you get to have
a book like that.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.960
But you have to just know that
it's a different kind of job,

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.330
but it becomes your job.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.320
But I'm happy to--

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.775
I wrote this during
the 2016 election.

00:34:38.775 --> 00:34:41.845
I started in 2015 and I
finished it in June of 2016.

00:34:41.845 --> 00:34:43.469
So there's a lot of
issues in this book

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:44.820
that I really wanted her--

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.219
I like her because she
can talk about anything,

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:48.989
because she's got--
she's seen it all.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:51.120
She's been there.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.659
And she's really
wide-eyed and she's smart.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.859
So I'm willing to go for
a ride for a little while,

00:34:56.859 --> 00:34:58.650
then I'm going to have
to do something new.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:01.650
But I haven't been able
to really shake her.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.370
I do think about her and
I'm ready to talk about her.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.230
But I have complicated
feelings about her

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.010
because sometimes she really
is terrible and screws up.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.630
And then sometimes
she's really great

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:16.071
and she's just a human being.

00:35:16.071 --> 00:35:17.820
Everybody is right and
wrong in this book.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.530
Everybody screws
up in this book.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.225
And the only way
through it is just--

00:35:21.225 --> 00:35:22.725
you have to just
keep going through.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.200
The hardest part
will be, for sure,

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.672
is preparing for
people to judge her.

00:35:31.672 --> 00:35:32.454
[SIGHS]

00:35:32.454 --> 00:35:33.120
Yeah, it's hard.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.338
But I think it's going to be OK.

00:35:37.338 --> 00:35:39.778
[LAUGHS]

00:35:40.755 --> 00:35:41.380
AUDIENCE 2: Hi.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:45.420
I have a question that's a
little bit about your own life.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.170
But I know that you did a lot
of your writing of your books

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.720
over the years in an
apartment in Brooklyn, right?

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.970
In a building with all these
other people and artists

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.010
and whatever.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.280
And now you live a lot
of the year in a house

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.600
in a place that is not New York
City with the air around you.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.170
So I was just wondering how that
changes your writing process

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.440
or your creative process or--

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.332
was any of this book
written not in New York?

00:36:12.332 --> 00:36:14.040
JAMI ATTENBERG: A lot
of it was written--

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:14.550
AUDIENCE 2: Oh, yeah?

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.716
JAMI ATTENBERG: A lot of it.

00:36:15.716 --> 00:36:18.655
The final third of it was
written in New Orleans.

00:36:18.655 --> 00:36:19.780
AUDIENCE: So did it change?

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.260
JAMI ATTENBERG: And a lot of
it was written on the road.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.070
Not a lot of it was
written in New York City.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.570
Three weeks of it were written
at a residency in upstate New

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.380
York.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.650
And then some of it was
written in the fall.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.440
But I was on tour, so it
was like my little present

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.230
to myself that I could
work on this book

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.840
while I was writing when I
didn't want to talk to anyone.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.310
It kept me company.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:47.700
And so the thing is that
I'm happier in New Orleans.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.870
So I don't know.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.049
I'm always going to write.

00:36:53.049 --> 00:36:54.590
That's the thing
I've learned, right?

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.673
I'm always going to write.

00:36:55.673 --> 00:36:58.580
But so I just wanted
to be happier.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.600
Now I'm happier.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.260
So how will that
impact my writing?

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:01.850
Who knows?

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.933
Maybe I'll write something
really sweet next time.

00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:05.480
But I don't think so.

00:37:10.145 --> 00:37:12.270
AUDIENCE 3: Jaime didn't
really ask you about this,

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.280
so I thought I would.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.150
So I really enjoyed reading
about the protagonist.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.490
But at the same time
there was this flip side

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.650
with her brother and
her sister-in-law

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:27.600
and this dying baby that
really pulled me in.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.286
And it was a very--

00:37:29.286 --> 00:37:31.590
it felt like a very
different plot.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:37.800
And I was wondering, do
you feel like those two

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.830
found a different way to grow
up or did they not manage it?

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.410
Because their
relationship is sort

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.290
of breaking apart by the end.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.304
I'm curious how you feel
about them growing up.

00:37:48.304 --> 00:37:50.595
JAMI ATTENBERG: Well, they
were sort of the model for--

00:37:55.470 --> 00:38:00.450
her brother and his
wife, they have a baby

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.130
who was born terminally ill.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.050
And they end up leaving New York
and moving to New Hampshire.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.800
This is covered very
early on in the book,

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.650
so I'm not giving anything away.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.100
And they leave and she feels
really disconnected from them

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.170
and distant from them.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:19.570
And it's really hard
for them to survive

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.710
and it takes an impact
on their relationship.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.180
I think that they're--

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.670
I don't know about him, but I
feel like the sister-in-law--

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.377
to me, she's the most grown up--

00:38:28.377 --> 00:38:30.460
the brother's wife, the
mother of this dying baby.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.880
She seems to be the one
who's really holding it

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.710
together and really trying to--

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.710
she's taking care of
the family financially

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.950
and she's just devoted
herself emotionally to it.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.740
If I had think about who I
liked the most in this book,

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.860
I like her.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.065
I like her a lot.

00:38:46.065 --> 00:38:46.980
I respect her.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.860
I would want her to be somebody
that I knew in my life.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.680
But I also love all
these characters

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.140
for different reasons.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.280
I think they're all kind of--

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.870
I don't know, I'm charmed by
all of them in their ways,

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.260
even when they're messed up.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:08.540
I did want to show somebody
who was really kind

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.910
of a role model-ish character.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.060
I liked her a lot.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.200
JAIME GREEN: And she's
also able to call

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.620
Andrea out more than
maybe almost anyone else

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.150
for her own--

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.500
the ways that Andrea
is avoiding life.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.200
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.680
There's a scene where
she calls Andrea out.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.240
And it was really interesting
because I had a friend--

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.580
I had some early
readers read it,

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.400
who are people who are creative
people, but they're not--

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.350
they write, but
they're not novelists.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.725
And so they just
read it and then

00:39:38.725 --> 00:39:41.180
they give me a very
visceral, emotional reaction.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.300
They don't give me notes.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:46.440
And so one of my friends read it
and she is married with a kid.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.320
And she really did
not like Andrea.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.960
She really had
problems with her.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.120
And then I was talking
to my editor about it

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.190
and she said, I think we need
Greta, the sister-in-law,

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:01.660
we need her to yell
at Andrea more.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.782
It's actually about a space
for the audience to yell.

00:40:08.782 --> 00:40:11.240
To be like, thank god that
she's yelling at her and saying,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.910
you are sucking right now.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:18.940
Can you please step up
and be a real human being?

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.860
So I went back and
rewrote it and made it

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.660
a harsher interaction.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.410
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.743
It also takes some of the
pressure off the reader, then,

00:40:25.743 --> 00:40:28.630
because we don't have to worry
that the whole book thinks

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.347
that what Andrea is doing is OK.

00:40:30.347 --> 00:40:31.180
We're like, it's OK.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.395
Jami sees it.

00:40:32.395 --> 00:40:33.550
She's got [? someone to. ?]

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.925
JAMI ATTENBERG:
Yeah, I guess so.

00:40:34.925 --> 00:40:40.150
But also, it's OK if the reader
feels frustrated with her

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.650
anyway.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.969
I don't know.

00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:44.760
I've had people read
this book and be like,

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.537
I totally get her and love her
and she's awesome and great.

00:40:47.537 --> 00:40:49.620
And then I have people
read this book and be like,

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.120
she is the worst, but
the book's really good.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.970
I get a lot of, I hate her,
but the book's really good.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.790
I don't know why we're supposed
to love our characters anyway.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:00.540
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.970
I feel like as long as we're
OK spending time with them.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.169
And she's fascinating
to spend time with.

00:41:05.169 --> 00:41:06.960
JAMI ATTENBERG: Yeah,
that's what you want,

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.670
who you're going
to spend time with.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.161
There was like some review of it
where they called her mildly--

00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:12.660
what was it?

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.980
Mildly annoying or
mildly something.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.700
And I was like, I would
actually hang out with somebody

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.160
who is kind of mildly annoying.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.580
If you think about all
your friends, you're like,

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.860
I got a couple friends
that are mildly annoying.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.829
But they have other cool things.

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:29.370
And also, sometimes
we like to go out

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.630
with people that
are mildly annoying

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.550
so then we can bitch
about them afterwards.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.110
JAIME GREEN: So just to wrap up.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:39.990
When you're in the process
of writing something new,

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:42.090
do you read at the
same time or do you

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:43.347
have to shut out other voices?

00:41:43.347 --> 00:41:45.180
JAMI ATTENBERG: Say it
one more time, sorry?

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.680
JAIME GREEN: When you're in the
process of writing something

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.120
new, do you read
a lot or do you--

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:49.320
JAMI ATTENBERG: Oh, no.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.380
I read a lot, yeah.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.110
But I have to be really choosy.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:57.210
And as I've written
more books, I've

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:00.560
gotten more particular
about it and not wanting--

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.060
sometimes you get some books
to blurb or something like that

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.290
and I'm like, I'm just
not going to do it.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.956
Because I only want
to read exactly what

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:07.570
I want to read at
this exact moment.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.520
Sometimes I go into bookstores
and say to the person there,

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.150
this is what I'm thinking about.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:15.242
A great book store
clerk will just be--

00:42:15.242 --> 00:42:17.700
a great bookseller will just
be like, right, you want this,

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.390
this--

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.540
here, I'm putting
this in your hand.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.460
This is the thing
that you want to read.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.720
And sometimes they're right
and sometimes they're wrong.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.490
But they're going to
expose you to ideas

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.770
that you haven't had before.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.835
Or I don't know.

00:42:26.835 --> 00:42:27.960
I have writer friends, too.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.310
And I just say, send me a list.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.310
This is what I'm thinking
about, send me a list.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:35.090
And then I just go
through and just read.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:38.730
But with this, it was
actually really tailored

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.320
because I was reading memoirs.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.080
Because I wanted this to
feel not like a memoir,

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.330
but memoiristic.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:48.930
And so I was reading
different memoirs

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.180
that had unconventional
structures or styles

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.630
and were really strong in voice.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:00.720
I read M Train by Patti Smith,
and I read The Argonauts

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.205
by Maggie Nelson, and I read
Chelsea Girls by Eileen Myles.

00:43:04.205 --> 00:43:05.580
Those were kind
of the three that

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.450
stand out in my
mind as influential

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.180
as I was writing this.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:11.930
JAIME GREEN: Cool.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.790
Well, I think that's
all the time we have,

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.730
so thank you so
much for coming in.

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.271
JAMI ATTENBERG:
Thanks for having me.

00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:22.080
[APPLAUSE]
