This brings us to a very important consequence of stereotypes, and that's

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:08.954
called stereotype threat. Which are situations in which people are aware they

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:13.715
belong to the minority, and this awareness negatively affects their performance

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:19.060
on a task. Let's look at this example of a research study done by Steele and

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.320
Aronson. The researchers have African-American and Caucasian students take a

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.250
test. Half of the students were asked to write their race at the top of the

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.570
test. Afterwards, they analyzed the results. Do you think they found a

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.495
difference between the group who wrote their race at the beginning of the test

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:41.321
as compared to those who did not? Yes or no? If you say yes, why? And if you

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:42.569
say no, why?
