00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.960
When it comes to what things look like,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.600
the Western world is obsessed by perfection, by symmetry, and ideal proportion.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.740
This is a taste for beauty shaped by reverence for universal laws,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.860
mathematics, and an appetite for the perfect and the eternal.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.540
Japanese aesthetics are, however, very different indeed,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.380
and the core of the difference is captured in a term for which Western languages have no direct equivalent:

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.220
a term known as Wabi-Sabi [pronounced: Wah-bi-sah-bi].

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.060
Wabi-Sabi refers to the beauty of the impermanent, the imperfect, the rustic, and the melancholy.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.320
It derives not from the love of invincibility, youth and flawlessness,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.460
but from a respect for what is passing, fragile, slightly broken and modest.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.800
Wabi-sabi believes the things are always more beautiful forbearing the marks of age and individuality;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.100
A trickle of glaze or a beautifully repaired crack on a piece of pottery are to be appreciated rather than made invisible.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:16.440
Wabi-sabi's history is intimately linked with Buddhism and its suggestion that wisdom comes from making peace without transitory, imperfect and unheroic natures

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.400
Kyushu, Japan. 1191.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.060
A monk known as Eisai returns to Japan from China,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.480
with plans to create Japan's first Zen Buddhist temple.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.860
Zen presents a challenge to Japan's indigenous religion; Shinto.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.080
Zen offers a complex philosophical system which presents nature with its constant cycles of life and imperfect patterns

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.400
as a focus of meditation and a lens through which to understand our own transients and emptiness.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.720
Zen will go on to be the philosophical bedrock of Wabi-sabi.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.020
14th Century, Japan.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.160
The meaning of two words: Wabi (侘 )and Sabi ( 寂)

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.220
begin to evolve and become more positive than they had been.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.360
Wabi had originally meant the misery and loneliness of living in nature,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.780
away from human consolation, but,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.900
its meaning now shifts to refer to an almost exquisite bitter sweet melancholy a being on ones' own.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.780
Sabi, meanwhile, which had originally meant chill, lean, or withered,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.500
started to denote the marks of aging and wear, which can enhance an object.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.980
It refers to a positive impermanence and the welcome and noble signs of time.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.580
The ancient pattern of a pot or a crack beautifully mended are now called Sabi.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.980
 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.800
Kyoto, 1488.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.360
Murata Shukō sits down to write a letter to his student, Furuichi Chōin.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.760
This document will come to be known as the Letter of the Heart (Kokoro no fumi)

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.680
And will define the ideal way  that one should drink tea - the tea ceremony -

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.900
and lays out the aesthetic of Wabi-Sabi.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.640
The tea ceremony had originated as a way for monks to stay awake in order to practice long periods of Zen meditation,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.920
but recently it's been overtaken by the ruling class of warlord,  or shoguns.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.540
They used it as a way of showing off expensive vessels and utensils imported from China.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.300
The tea ceremony has become flashy, often in elaborate and gaudy surroundings,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.760
and slipped a long way from its spiritual roots.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.100
Now, Shuko redesign the tea ceremony wth the ideals of Wabi-Sabi in mind.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.960
The fashion at the time was to enjoy tea on a balcony while looking at the full moon,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.800
but Shuko claims that he has no taste for the full moon.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.760
Instead, he urges his student to appreciate the more subtle interplay of shadows on half of the moon,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760
or the partially clouded moon.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.180
He also stresses that one should abandon the perfect and lustrous tea drinking cups  of the Chinese,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.180
which seem to evoke the flawlessness of the full moon,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.220
and instead to commission more rustic ware from Japanese artisans,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.800
who will make little errors in the glaze, and let these be a deliberate part of their work.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.160
Kyoto, 1582.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.760
Sen no Rikyu is someone to the service of Toyotomi Hideyoshi,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.440
a powerful warlord who unites the warring factions of Feudal Japan.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.380
He commissions Rikyu to create a tea ceremony,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.380
that can help to foster peace.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.800
Along with Shuko, Sen no Rikyu is revered in Japan as the father of the modern tea ceremony,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.060
and the most perfect practicioner of Wabi-Sabi -

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.160
a story that is most often used  to illustrate the spirit of Wabi-Sabi is taken from his life.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.580
One day, Rikyu asked a disciple to clean his tea house,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.020
and the young boy worked all day to scrub and sweep every inch of the house and garden.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.520
When Rikyu came to inspect it, he reached up and shook a maple tree overhanging the path.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.160
The sprinkling of leaves that fell brought Wabi-Sabi to the scene,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.820
thus the manmade and the natural, artifice and random chance

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.000
were united in a perfect expression of beauty and wisdom.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.780
Rikyu goes further than Shuko in undermining the high taste of the shoguns,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.680
and strips everything non-essential from his tea ceremony.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.920
The pots he uses are often directly taken from peasant environments,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.700
or are modeled after a particularily rustic roof tile that he spots while walking through a local village.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.140
Rikyu also codifies the movements of the tea ceremony,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.120
creating the perfectly economical and graceful notions of creating tea with a minimum fuss -

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.600
thereby adding Wabi-Sabi to the very core of the ritual.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.540
Unfortunately for Rikyu, his boss, the warlord Hideyoshi, comes from a peasant background,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.120
and begins to fear that the whole process is maybe an elaborate joke at his expense.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.160
This causes him to order Rikyu to commit harakiri.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.180
In an eerie parallel to Socrates' demise, Rikyu holds a final tea ceremony among his closest friends

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.620
before obediently stabbing himself through the stomach.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.000
Today, all the great schools of tea trace their lineage back to Rikyu,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.180
and all follow the motions and traditions that he set out.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.320
The maker of the humble tile that he so admired was known as Raku,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.440
and Raku pots are still made today, and appreciated as the greatest embodiment of Wabi-Sabi.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.920
If you take tea in the Silver Pavilion in Kyoto - the birthplace of the formal tea ceremony in Japan,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.540
you can drink from the same cup as the troublesome Hideyoshi once sipped from.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.000
Edo, 1684.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.560
Matsuo Basho, the father of the Haiku, and Japan's most revered poet,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.380
sets off on the first of his great pilgrimages.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.100
These aimless wanderings will take him to the heart of solitude and nature,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.400
and help him capture the spirit of Wabi-Sabi in words.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.960
A depressive with a great talent,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.820
Basho takes great joy in wandering the dangerous roads around Edo disguised as a beggar.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.780
Here he distills the fragile beauty of the sights around him

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.340
into poetry that tries to spot the eternal.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.980
Through the fleeting moment, we can hear the beautiful desolation in one of his most famous haiku,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.180
Solitary now - Standing Amidst the blossoms- Is a cypress tree.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.280
GInza district, Tokyo, 2013.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.620
An enormous new outlet of Louis Vuitton opens

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.660
built by the Japanese architect Jun Aoki.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.700
Fourty-five percent of all Japanese women are now estimated to own a bag

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.300
by the french luxury goods firm:  featuring Western ideals, shininess, perfection and symmetry.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.760
Wabi-Sabi is, like many traditional Japanese ideas,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.180
under enormous threat from the consumerist values of the west.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.420
Wabi-Sabi is, at one level, an idea that relates to pottery, drinking tea, and the history of Japan,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.480
but another, it's a lesson for all of us,  for all times,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:30.420
because the place we really have to come to terms with imperfection, melancholy and age, is in ourselves.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:37.800
Wabi-Sabi is a giant marketing effort which urges us to take a second look at what we might otherwise dismiss or treat with disdain.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.600
It recognises that our tastes are not fixed,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.980
and that if someone with talent and artistic grace urges us to look more sympathetically

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:51.160
at some moss, a slightly wonky teacup, or indeed, the wise, wrinkled face of a friend or relative,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.600
we will be able to find charm and beauty here too.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.420
Our notions of beauty and interests are relative and open to change and improvement.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.400
With the ideals of Wabi-Sabi in mind, we may learn to find greater satisfaction in the humbler moments;

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.380
In a walk down a slightly crooked path, or an overcast autumn day,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.840
or a less than blemish free house, face or soul.
