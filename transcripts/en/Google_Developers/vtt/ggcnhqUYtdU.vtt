00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:06.579
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Anthony Bontrager, I'm the President of a

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:07.630
company called 1Cast.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.309
With me is Travis McElfresh, he's our VP of technology.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.429
We founded 1Cast three years ago in an effort to bring

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.679
personalized news content to users across the web and into

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.389
the mobile space.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.200
Specifically we found that users wanted to have the ability

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.749
to find and search for the news that's personally relevant

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.399
to them to be able to watch it where and when they are and

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.769
that was the reason we founded the company.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.149
&gt;&gt; So, you chose to create this application on the...

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.389
[remainder of the question not audible]

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:41.679
&gt;&gt; Well, we chose the Android platform to develop the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.760
application on because it was a very easy system to use.

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:48.959
Android represents, in our opinion, you know, the leading,

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:51.969
you know, I guess, thought leader, if you will, in terms of

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:55.579
taking a mobile OS and distributing it across different

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.720
device types for us.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.500
So, for us, you know, as an ecosystem provider for video

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.129
content we wanted to be partnered with someone who shared

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.099
that same vision and can take OS into different device types

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.489
beyond just the mobile space.

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:09.489
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:14.009
Developers really like your... were there any types of

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.039
challenges and could you tell us about that?

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.059
&gt;&gt; Could you repeat the question?

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:26.569
&gt;&gt; Technical challenges that you've had to overcome.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:27.229
&gt;&gt; Technical challenges.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.519
Umm, you know, it's actually been quite easy to develop on

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:32.169
the Android App -- platform.

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:35.039
One of the things we particularly like is the ease of

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.429
deployment and that's one of the things that we've found in

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.239
other platforms to be kind of challenging is by the time you

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:45.309
create your build and you want that out there in front of

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:48.119
your users with the Android platform and marketplace you can

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.639
is have it right out there and just very easy.

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.799
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.859
What's your prospect of the Android development process?

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.239
&gt;&gt; Again, it's gotta be the release process.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.820
We -- we have a -- the ability to take our build, put it

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.239
right out there in front of our users, and you know, with

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.709
little to no headache and get some instant feedback.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.410
If we need to do updates we can do that quite easily.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:20.919
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.569
I think the feedback speed very important for us because the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.409
speed at which Android can be released out there and the

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.879
feedback that we get back, it allows us to respond very

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.879
quickly to our user base needs.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.969
And we've seen very positive feedback as a result of that.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:39.599
&gt;&gt; What are some of the features that you do on the Android

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.939
platform that you can't do [remainder of the question not

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:44.369
audible]

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.569
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it goes to my earlier point around the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.789
whole Android ecosystem, being able to take our application

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.059
off the mobile platform and in some of the new devices that

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.999
many of the hardware manufactures are going to start

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.669
releasing here based upon the Android platform.

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.789
So, for us, again, as an ecosystem provider and having that

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.379
as part of our mission statement, Android stands head and

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.639
shoulders above everybody else.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.860
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.339
And are there any advice that you'd give to someone who's

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:13.379
interested in developing in Android?

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.879
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absoluteally, two come to mind, around testing and

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:18.429
promotion.

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.769
Testing on the Android platform because you can get it out

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.909
there in the marketplace, it's very easy, you can make our

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.899
own builds, post it on your own site, and point to it, and

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.969
allow other people through, you know, some of the crowd

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:38.049
source testing or even your friends to just go ahead and

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:38.610
down load and test it.

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.189
That's not available on some of the other platforms. And

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.029
around promotion.

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.889
You know, figure out that little QR little chart thing.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:46.800
That's very cool.

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.039
You allow people to come by with a little scanner on the

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:56.069
Android phones and have an instant link off to your build to

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.709
download to try out.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.649
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.229
&gt;&gt; Excellent. Well, thank you very much and enjoy the rest

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.579
of the show.

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:02.169
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
