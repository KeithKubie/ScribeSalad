00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:01.810
PROFESSOR: The
idea of congruence

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.312
was introduced to
the world by Gauss

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:07.680
in the early 18th century.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.070
You've heard of him
before, I think.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.150
He's responsible for some
work on magnetism also.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.180
And it turns out that this
idea, after several centuries,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.210
remains an active field of
application and research.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.110
And in particular,
in computer science

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.530
it's used significantly
in crypto,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.680
which is what we're going to be
leading up to now in this unit.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.410
It's plays a role
in hashing, which

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.700
is a key method for
managing data in memory.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.910
But we are not going to
go into that application.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.500
Anyway, the definition of
congruence is real simple.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.210
Congruence is a relation
between two numbers, a and b.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.700
It's determined by
another parameter

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.070
n, where n is considered
to be greater than one.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.010
All of these, as
usual, are integers.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.690
And the definition
is simply that a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.220
is congruent to b mod n if n
divides a minus b or a minus

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.900
b is a multiple of n.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.147
So that's a key
definition to remember.

00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:13.480
There's other ways to define it.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.879
We'll see very shortly
an equivalent formulation

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.170
that could equally well have
been used as a definition.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.830
But this is a standard one.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.750
A is equivalent to b means that
a minus b is a multiple of n.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.420
Well let's just practice.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.320
30 is equivalent to 12 mod
9 because 30 minus 12 is 18,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.750
and 9 divides 18.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.500
OK.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.450
An immediate
application is that does

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.350
this number with a lot
of 6's is ending in a 3

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.410
is equivalent to
788253 modulo 10.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.412
Now why is that?

00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:51.870
Well, there's a
very simple reason.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.260
If you think about subtracting
the 6 number ending

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.870
in 3 from the 7 number ending
in 3, what you can immediately

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.370
see without doing much of
any of the subtraction--

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.440
just do the low order digits--
when you subtract these,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.100
you're going to get a
number that ends in 0.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.260
Which means that
it's divisible by 10.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.310
And therefore those two
numbers are congruent.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.550
It's very easy to tell when
two numbers are congruent

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.210
mod 10 because they just
have the same lower digit.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.830
OK.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.770
Another way to understand
congruency and what it's really

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.080
all about is the
so-called remainder lemma,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.470
which sets that a is
congruent to b mod n, if

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.680
and only if a and b have the
same remainder on division

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.870
by n.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.750
So let's work with
that definition.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.530
We can conclude using this
formulation, equivalent

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.560
formulation, that 30
is equivalent to 12

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.640
mod 9 because the remainder
of 30 divided by 9,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.490
well it's 3 times 9
is 27, remainder 3.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.330
And the remainder
of 12 by 9 is 3.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.010
So they do indeed have
the same remainder 3.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.060
And they're congruent.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.770
By the way, this equivalent sign
with the three horizontal bars

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.070
is read as both
equivalent and congruent.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.747
And I will be bouncing back
between the two pronunciations

00:03:13.747 --> 00:03:14.455
indiscriminately.

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.240
They are synonyms.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.820
OK, let's think about proving
this remainder lemma just

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.380
for practice.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.170
And in order to
fit on the slide,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.080
I'm going to have to abbreviate
this idea of the remainder of b

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.150
divided by n with a
shorter notation r sub b n.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.190
Just to fit.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.200
OK.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.290
So the if direction of
proving the remainder

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.290
limit that they're congruent
if and only if they

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.440
have the same remainder.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.080
The if direction here
in an if and only if

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.540
is from right to left.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.051
I've got to prove that if they
have the same remainder, then

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:48.800
they're congruent.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.690
So there are the two
numbers, a and b.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.270
By the division theorem,
or division algorithm,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.010
they can each be expressed as
a quotient of a divided by n

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.060
times the quotient sub a plus
the remainder of a divided

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.560
by n.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.780
And likewise, b can
be expressed in terms

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.750
of quotient and remainder.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.620
And what we're given here is
that the remainders are equal.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.660
But if the remainders
are equal, then clearly

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.950
when I subtract a minus b,
I get qa minus qb times n.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.510
Sure enough, a minus
b is a multiple of n.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.540
And that takes care of that one.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.560
The only if direction now
goes from left to right.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.060
So in the converse,
I'm going to assume

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.420
that n divides a minus b,
where a and b are expressed

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.570
in this form by the division
algorithm or division theorem.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.630
So if n divides a minus
b, looking at a minus b

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.510
in that form what we're
seeing is that n divides

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.590
this qa minus qb times
n, plus the difference

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.460
of the remainders.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.660
That's what I get just
by subtracting a and b.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.640
But if you look at this
n divides that term,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.110
the quotient times n.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.240
And it therefore has to
divide the other term as well.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.920
Because the only way
that n can divide

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.280
a sum, when it divides
one of the sum ands,

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.360
is if it divides
the other sum and.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.880
So n divides ra minus the
remainder of 8 divided by n

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.010
from b divided by n.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.840
But remember, these
are remainders.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.200
So that means that they're
both in the interval from 0

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.150
to n minus 1 inclusive.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.820
And the distance between them
has got to be less than 1.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.760
So if n divides a number
that's between 0 and n minus 1,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.272
that number has to be 0.

00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:40.480
Because it's the only number
that n divides in there.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.160
So in fact, the difference
of the remainders is 0.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.330
And therefore, the
remainders are equal.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.680
And we've knocked that one off.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.180
So there it is restated.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.090
The remainder lemma says
that they're congruent if

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.200
and only if they have
the same remainders.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.900
And that's worth
putting a box around

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.140
to highlight this
crucial fact, which

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.560
could equally well have used as
the definition of congruence.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.560
And then you'd prove
the division definition

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.560
that we began with.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.920
Now some immediate consequences
of this remainder lemma

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.770
are that a congruence inherits
a lot of properties of equality.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.520
Because it means
nothing more than that

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.970
the remainders are equal.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.650
So for example, we can say
the congruence is symmetric,

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.110
meaning that if a is congruent
to b, then b is congruent to a.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.870
And that's obvious
cause a congruent to b

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.940
means that a and b have
the same remainder.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.590
So b and a have
the same remainder.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.710
One that would actually
take a little bit of work

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.350
to prove from the
division definition--

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.340
not a lot, but a
little bit-- would

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.300
be that if a is congruent to b,
and b is congruent to c, then a

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.820
is congruent to c.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.339
But we can read it is saying
the first says that a and b have

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:53.130
the same remainder.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.338
The second says that b and
c have the same remainder.

00:06:55.338 --> 00:06:57.940
So obviously a and c
have the same remainder.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.010
And we've prove this
property that's known

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.420
as transitivity of congruence.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.890
Another simple consequence
of the remainder theorem

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.940
is a little technical
result that's

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.580
enormously useful called
remainder lemma, which

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.580
says simply that a number is
congruent to its own remainder,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.070
modulo n.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.150
The proof is easy.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.040
Let's prove it by showing
that a and the remainder of a

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.930
have the same remainder.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.780
Well, what if I take
remainders of both sides,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.830
the left hand side becomes the
remainder of a divided by n.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.870
The right hand side is the
remainder of the remainder.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.670
But the point is
that the remainder

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.760
is in the interval from 0 to n.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.510
And that means when you take its
remainder mod and its itself.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.830
And therefore the left
hand side is the remainder

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.580
of a divided by n, and
the right hand side

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.950
is also the remainder
of the a divided by n.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.550
And we have proved
this corollary

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.750
that's the basis of
remainder arithmetic.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.430
Which will basically
allow us whenever

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.880
we feel like it to replace
numbers by their remainders,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.420
and that way keep
the numbers small.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.230
And that also
merits a highlight.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.780
OK.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.450
Now, in addition to these
properties like equality

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.640
that congruence has, it
also interacts very well

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.770
the operations.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.570
Which is why it's
called a congruence.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.960
A congruence is an
equality-like relation

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.350
that respects the
operations that

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.929
are relevant to the discussion.

00:08:29.929 --> 00:08:32.470
In this case, we're going to be
talking about plus and times.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.929
And the first fact
about congruent

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.460
says that if a and
b are congruent,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.230
then a plus c and b
plus c are congruent.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.070
The proof of that follows
trivially from the definition.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.390
Because the a
congruent to b mod,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.360
n says that n divides a minus b.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.790
And if n divides a minus b,
obviously n divides a plus

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.170
c minus b plus c.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.870
Because a plus c minus b
plus c is equal to a minus b.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.760
That one is deceptively trivial.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.710
It's also the case that if a
is congruent to b, then a times

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.480
c is congruent to b times c.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.730
This one takes a one line proof.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.180
We're given that n
divides a minus b.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.030
That certainly
implies that n divides

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.910
any multiple of a minus b.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.700
So multiply it by c and
then apply distributivity,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.100
and you discover
that n divides ac

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:32.980
minus bc, which means ac is
congruent to bc modulo n.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.060
It's a small step
that I'm going to omit

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.830
to go from adding
the same constant

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.960
to both sides to adding
any two congruent

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.580
numbers to the same sides.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.200
So if a is congruent to b
and c is congruent to d, then

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.350
in fact, a plus c is
congruent to b plus d.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.050
So again, congruence is acting
a lot like ordinary equality.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.560
If you add equals to
equals, you get equals.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.940
And of course the same fact
applies to multiplication.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:04.270
If you multiply equals by
equals, you get equals.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:08.660
A corollary of this is that
if I have two numbers that

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.540
are congruent modulo n, then if
I have any kind of arithmetic

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.690
formula involving plus
and times and minus--

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.130
and what I want to know is what
it's equivalent to modulo n--

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.390
I can figure that out
freely substituting

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.490
a by a prime or a prime by a.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.650
I can replace any number by a
number that it's congruent to,

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.660
and the final congruence
result of the formula

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.130
is going to remain unchanged.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.950
So overall what this shows is
that arithmetic modulo n is

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.080
a lot like ordinary arithmetic.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.170
And the other
crucial point thought

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.780
that follows from this
fact about remainders

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:54.340
is that because a is congruent
to the remainder of a divided

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:59.040
by n, then when I'm doing
arithmetic on congruences,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.970
I can always keep the numbers
involved in the remainder

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:03.490
interval.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:07.590
That is, in the remainder
range from 0 to n minus 1.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:13.930
And we use this standard closed
open interval notation to mean

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.380
the interval from 0 to n.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.830
So it's sometimes
used in analysis

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.404
to mean the real
interval of reals.

00:11:20.404 --> 00:11:22.070
But we're always
talking about integers.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.500
So this means-- the
integers that square bracket

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.940
means 0 is included.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.710
And a round parenthesis
means that n is excluded.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.840
So that's exactly a description
of the integers that

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.920
are greater and equal
to 0 and less than n.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.950
Let's do an application of
this remainder arithmetic idea.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:48.530
Suppose I want to figure out
what's 287 to the ninth power

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.780
modulo 4?

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:56.430
Well, for a start but if I
take the remainder of 287

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.970
divided by 4, it's not very
hard to check that that's 3.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:06.849
And that means that 287 to the
ninth is congruent mod 4 to 3

00:12:06.849 --> 00:12:07.390
to the ninth.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.380
So already I got rid of
the three digit number,

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.550
the base of the
exponent, and replaced it

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.920
just by a one digit number, 3.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.310
That's progress.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.660
Well, we can make more
progress because 3 to the ninth

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.861
can be expressed as 3 squared,
squared, squared times 3,

00:12:21.861 --> 00:12:22.360
right?

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.870
Because when you
iterate taking powers,

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.490
it means that the
exponents multiply.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.280
So this is 3 to the 2 times
2 times 2, or 8, times 3--

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.580
which adds 1 to the
exponent-- or 9.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.630
So that's simple
exponent arithmetic.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:43.310
But notice that 3 squared is 9.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.090
And 9 is congruent to 1 mod 4.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.400
So that means I can
replace 3 squared by 1,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.510
and the outer 2 squared stays.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.740
It becomes 1 squared squared,
but that's 1 times 3.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.300
And the punchline is that 287 to
the ninth is congruent to 3 mod

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:09.880
4 by a really easy calculation
that did not involve taking

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.460
anything to the ninth power.
