Let's return to our chart and
make just a small change.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.250
Instead of logging in with the API,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.020
we can now actually use
the website to log in.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.840
The first step, getting the request
token, is still the same.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.970
So let's do that first and

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.380
then we'll cover logging in with
the website in more detail.
