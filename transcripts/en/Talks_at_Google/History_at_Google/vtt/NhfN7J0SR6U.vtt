[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.631
ED HUSAIN: Thank you,
Alice, for welcoming me here

00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:12.630
and for organizing this.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.000
Thank you to all of
you for making time

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.380
on a very warm, sunny
London lunchtime.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.520
I appreciate it.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.472
I'll speak for about
25, 30 minutes.

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:25.680
I'll steer towards the 25
rather than the 30 minutes.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.020
And I'm interested in
what you have to say,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.330
questions you have to
ask, and reflections,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.610
thoughts, criticisms.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.550
I wrote the book because,
since 9/11 up until now,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.670
almost every Muslim
conversation or conversation

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.740
with Islam and Muslims
in the public domain

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.140
seems to be dominated
by extremism, terrorism,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.880
fanaticism, fundamentalism,
radicalism, and it's negative.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.760
And while I understand,
and I think most of us

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.870
understand, why that happens,
the lived reality of Muslims

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.820
is something entirely different.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.960
And the lived history of a
civilization for the last 1,400

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.730
years is entirely different.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.880
And I have two
young daughters now,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.010
and my attitude
towards this issue

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.770
is, well, how is their
world being shaped?

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.410
And that's what concerns
me, the next generation

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.360
and the generation after that.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.750
And I fear that comments
from the current White House

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.240
or what we've seen play out
at the U.N. or the media drive

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.200
that we have focuses entirely on
the extremism and the violence,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.430
but misses a much deeper,
more colorful nuanced history

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430
of coexistence,
peace, compassion.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.320
And I try to bring
that out in the book.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.810
And I bring it out
not by theory and not

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.120
by what I think
ought to be told,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.280
but by drawing on
real life Muslims

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.010
who lived in the seventh
century, eighth century,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.860
ninth century, almost
every century down

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.031
to the last century.

00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.280
There's no one from this
century featured in the book.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.010
I mean, it's 19,
20, 18 years old.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.560
But Hassan al-Banna, the founder
of the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.470
a prominent name, probably
the most influential Arab,

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.690
he features in one
of the chapters.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.210
Now one of the most important
things about the book,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.860
in my view, is
that it highlights

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.030
two or three elements that
most Muslims think about, live,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.680
reflect on, and try to
act on on a daily basis,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.310
but doesn't have any
mainstream echoing.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.360
And the first focus is--

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.870
and what I'm saying
isn't made up.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.940
It's genuine.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.040
It's from someone who's
lived for 40 plus years now,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.250
is a Muslim born into a Muslim
household, lived in the Middle

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.730
East, Syria, and Saudi
Arabia, traveled extensively

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.710
across the Muslim
world, from Morocco

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.580
all the way to Indonesia and
down further on to Bahrain.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.660
And so what I'm saying is
based on both live reality

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.110
and what we find
in our scriptures.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.470
The overwhelming focus
in Muslim history,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.840
the overwhelming
emphasis in Muslim life,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.660
and what you'll see the
majority of the Muslim scholars

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.280
throughout history emphasize
is a huge focus on love.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.980
And when I say love,
I mean love for God,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.400
love for God's creation,
love for your spouse's, love

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.910
for architecture, love for
beauty, love for the divine.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.600
And the queue for
that comes right

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.100
from the beginning
of Muslim history

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.380
when the Quran was
revealed to the prophet

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.767
Muhammad There's a verse.

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.350
There are multiple
verses, but there's

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.570
one that comes to my
mind now, you know?

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.240
[NON-ENGLISH PHRASE] That if
you truly claim to love God,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.310
then follow me.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.530
So the prophet
Muhammad is trying

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.710
to guide people to a way in
which they can love the divine.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.400
And stemming from that love
is a 1,400 year old tradition

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.100
of trying to honor that love.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.550
And I go into that in
the book in great detail

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.490
to show how there's an
emphasis on loving the divine,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.750
and from that loving, the
creation of the divine,

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.210
and from that stems loving
for what is yet to come.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.100
So that, you know, the
Burkin analysis of we

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.700
are all inheritors of the
past, and we preserve it.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.029
And then we pass the baton
onto a younger generation.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.500
That's an inherent
Muslim concept

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.279
from the very beginning.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.390
Now maintaining that
tradition focused on love

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.590
has an implication.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.430
And that implication is the
third point I try to bring out,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.330
and that's emulation, emulation
of those who we claim to love.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.040
And often that's instinctive.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.720
Often that's taught.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.150
But most Muslims,
especially Muslim men,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.230
try to emulate the prophet
Muhammad And in that

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.670
comes the excess, in that
comes some of the extremism,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.470
and in that also comes some of
the balance and the antidote

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.970
to the extremism
and the terrorism

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.220
and the fanaticism that
tilts the conversation in one

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.430
direction.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.949
So the Taj Mahal, for example,
most people around the world

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.740
know it, but they don't
appreciate the fact

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.380
that this was a symbol of
love from a Muslim monarch

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.870
to his deceased wife
that was designed

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.540
to ensure that that tradition
was passed on to generations

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.830
until eternity.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.580
And the Taj Mahal isn't alone.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.660
In the tomb built
by a Muslim monarch

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.020
for his beloved similar
architectural achievements

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.470
you will find almost in every
Muslim town and city and indeed

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.080
even villages, the
Sufis in particular,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.700
and I'll come to
that in a moment.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.240
But, yes, there's
a good news story,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.251
but I don't want to ignore
the negative and the fringe

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:34.750
activity.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.208
And I just want to
quickly touch on

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:40.061
that before I turn to some of
the other themes in the book.

00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.060
One of the biggest struggles
that we've had here

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.476
in the West and
the Western press,

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.150
but also in our
governments, here

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.700
and also in the Muslim
East, is the inability

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.485
to articulate what
the problem is.

00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:52.350
So if you say it's
Islamist extremism,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.850
a whole group of
people get upset,

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.560
because the word
Islam is in there.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.840
If you say it's jihadism,
another group of people

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.340
get upset, because the
word jihad is in there.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.760
And so we're almost
paralyzed at a policy level

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.080
as to how we address this
difficult topic without naming

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.690
and shaming the enemy and
without, therefore, governments

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.570
being able to deal
with the problem.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.360
What I've tried to do is
explain what Islamism is.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.850
Essentially, it
is an outcome of--

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.160
you know, David Goodhart
reviewed the book on Saturday,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.760
and he picked up on this,
that the destruction

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:32.370
of the German empire, or
the Austro-Hungarian empire,

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.790
the Prussians led to
the creation of Nazism.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.200
The German feeling of defeat,
humiliation, loss, and the need

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.250
to reinstate what Plato calls
thumos, or self-recognition,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.910
self-worth, that led to Nazism.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.710
The destruction of
the Russian Empire

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.960
led to the formation
of communism,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.690
and the Soviet Union reemerging
as trying to reinstate some

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.850
of that old glory from Moscow.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.487
The destruction of
the Ottoman Empire,

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.320
the Muslim empire that
the Turks controlled,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.460
led to the birth of Islamism.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.580
And so it's almost trackable
that the destruction

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.590
of large empires
and their peoples

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.740
feeling loss,
humiliation, degradation,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.060
then emerges in this ugly
manifestation of extremism

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.590
in those various excesses.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.060
Now Islamism was a reaction
to that humiliating

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.770
loss of Muslim power.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.460
For 1,000 years, Muslims
were the global superpower

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.660
in various empires.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.720
For 1,000 years, Muslims
did not seek to convert.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.860
And this is documented
by John of Damascus

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.820
who saw the early Arab
armies coming into Damascus.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.800
And they don't seek to convert.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.370
And many of the Christians
in Damascus and Egypt

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.960
in the seventh and eighth
centuries wished to convert.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.230
But the Muslim elite
ruling class, the Arabs,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.730
generally say,
well, don't convert,

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.160
because we're not
here to convert you.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.370
We're quite happy you
paying an extra levy of tax,

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.650
and, you know, we benefit
from that taxation.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.970
And that goes into our
treasury or our coffer.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.090
So the initial impulse
was not to convert.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.500
And I'd say to
this day, the fact

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.319
that in large countries
such as India--

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.610
and there are others in Africa.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.950
Nigeria comes to mind-- where
we've had Muslim governments

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.295
and empires, but we
still have large numbers

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:20.545
of people who are not Muslims.

00:08:20.545 --> 00:08:22.410
So there was not
an attempt to force

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.280
and to convert by the sword.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.850
Peter Frankopan, who Alice
and I were just talking about,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.170
refers to this in his book,
how it wasn't an impulse

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.680
to convert by force.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.360
But the story of Islamism
is in the modern world

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.260
that loss of that political
power, that superpower

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.740
status around the world has led
to Muslims wanting to convert,

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:49.110
wanting to impose, wanting to
show power and recognition,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.920
and worse.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.950
And sometimes that is done
through the most extreme ways,

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.240
which is extremism, terrorism.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.390
But sometimes that's done
through innovative ways.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.860
And you may call it
emulative innovation,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.020
but the Emirates
are great at that.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.060
The fact that the Burj
tower is the tallest

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.390
tower in the world
in Dubai, the fact

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:12.640
that the most expensive
hotel is now in Dubai,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.430
the fact that the World Cup
is being hosted in Qatar,

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.190
there is an impulse there in
the Gulf to want to compete,

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.110
to want to be the best.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.180
You may criticize it on
a whole range of levels.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.550
But that impulse to be the best,
whether it's having the largest

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.050
sovereign wealth fund in the
world, the Abu Dhabi Investment

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.440
Fund, that impulse
still remains.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.410
And that impulse finds
extreme manifestation

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.644
through jihadists and others.

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:39.810
Now, I just want to deal
with the extremism problem,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.560
because it might be
festering in your head

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.640
on the definitional front, and
then move on to other issues.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.750
And I touch on all of
these issues in the book.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.720
But who is an Islamist?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.010
You know, we talk about
them often in the news,

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.940
but very few people
provide a definition.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.910
When you look at 1,300
years of Muslim history,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.910
I'll give an example
from the Ottomans.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.949
For 700 years, the Ottomans
were the superpower

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:09.240
in the bulk of the Middle East.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.910
They knocked on the
doors of Vienna twice.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.410
They maintained an
imperial presence

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.650
from Albania, the Balkans, all
the way down to parts of Yemen.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.030
They only had one incident
of stoning an adulterer.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:26.569
This Old Testament and Quranic
punishment of adultery,

00:10:26.569 --> 00:10:27.735
there was only one incident.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.770
What that proves to us
is that what the Ottoman

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.410
and Muslim empires
did not do is make

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.420
what was Haram,
what is religiously

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.060
forbidden for religiously
observant people.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.230
This is a key issue.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.440
They did not make halal and
Haram, what's religiously

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.660
forbidden, what's
religiously sanctioned,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.790
they did not make that
personal act state law.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.110
It did not become
legal or illegal.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.890
So if you drank alcohol for
most Muslims and most Muslim

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.260
scholars it's considered to
be forbidden to drink alcohol,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.110
but it's not illegal.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.300
So if you are caught
drinking alcohol,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.880
you're not a criminal who's
going to be thrown into prison,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.620
prosecuted, and punished.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.950
And that's a key distinction
that we have missed.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.960
And by the way, most
Muslims and most Muslim

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.572
communities have homosexuality.

00:11:18.572 --> 00:11:20.530
I'm not saying most
Muslims have homosexuality.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.930
I'm saying most Muslim
countries have homosexuality,

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.470
as it is in most countries.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.000
But it wasn't an issue.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.020
In 1857, the Ottomans,
1857, early on the Ottomans

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.920
decriminalized it.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.990
They made it an
individual choice.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.240
Pretty early on, I
think 100 years or so

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.980
before we did so in the west.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.050
The point I'm trying
to make is Islamists

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.090
want the halal and
the Haram, what's

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.100
religiously forbidden
for an individual,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.840
to become state law.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.450
In other words, the government
intervenes in your life.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.120
For 1,000 years, Muslims didn't
have that very government

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.390
driven, Marxist, control all
elements of your life fixation.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.830
It's a very modern obsession
that halal and Haram

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.230
must become legal and illegal.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.322
If you're are a sinner--

00:12:00.322 --> 00:12:02.530
and we're all sinners as
the Archbishop of Canterbury

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.655
is keen to point out.

00:12:03.655 --> 00:12:05.530
If you're a sinner,
you're not just a sinner.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.229
You're also a criminal.

00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:08.770
Now that distinction
is what we miss,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.526
and that distinction is what
Islamists want us to blur.

00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:13.900
So whether it's the Muslim
Brotherhood in the Middle East

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.030
or the Jamaat-e-Islami in
the Indian subcontinent,

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.070
they want to create
governments that

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.670
make individual acts of
religiously sanctioned or not

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.610
legal and illegal.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.830
That's Iran today.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.200
Hence the fixation with
wearing a headscarf.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.230
There are scriptural
encouragements for Muslims,

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.852
and I would argue, Jewish
women to cover their hair.

00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:34.060
You see Christian women when
they go to see the Pope,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.790
they cover their hair.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.676
Now that's a choice.

00:12:36.676 --> 00:12:38.300
If people want to do
it, good for them.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.210
They don't want to do
it, brilliant to them.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.290
But the Iranian government
wants to impose it.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.100
That's Islamism.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.810
Islamist movements
are a new development.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.610
They've been around since 1928.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.010
We didn't have those
in our history.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.000
So Islamism is about
creating an Islamic state,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.520
an Islamic government.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.120
Now some of them want
to compete in elections.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.250
They often lose.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.990
The problem becomes
is then when they

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.520
fail to achieve their
Islamist, stroke Marxist state,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.190
other than in Iran
currently, then what

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.620
happens is they take up force.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.430
So ISIS was all about
bringing that vision by force.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.250
Because the population
isn't Muslim enough,

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.370
we will take up arms and create
an Islamic state by force.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.240
So this is what we
call the jihadis,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.810
you know, the jihadist impulse.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.560
They use force to advance
the Islamist worldview.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.190
Now I want to give you one last
example of this kind of rot

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.470
and problem within Islam, and
then move on to other issues.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.220
And that is in early
Islam, we also had this.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:44.020
Now my contention is
that all great ideas,

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.330
in history or in
the modern world,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.830
also have an ugly side to it.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.580
There's an excess.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.000
So patriotism and
loving your own country

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.460
is, in and of
itself, a good thing.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.180
You know, it creates virtue
of dedication, of sacrifice,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.870
of protection, and a common
notion of citizenship.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.240
In and of itself,
patriotism is a good thing.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.250
But taken to its
extreme, whether it's

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.770
the UKIP version
or the EDL version

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.020
or the America First version,
or its other extreme,

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.620
you know the Nazism and
the fascism that manifests,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.210
it's a problem.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.200
So Islam as a body of ideas
and, as a Muslim I believe,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.710
a form of revelation from God,
also has this extreme problem.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.660
And that extreme
problem from very early

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.850
on was something called
a Khawarij movement.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.880
Now Khawarij comes from
the Arabic word that is

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.160
to [NON-ENGLISH] which means
[NON-ENGLISH] or to exit,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.100
to leave.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.690
And the movement
was called as such,

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.130
they were called a Khawarij
by early Muslims, companions

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.020
of the prophet,
cousins of the prophet.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.842
The fourth Caliph
encountered them.

00:14:42.842 --> 00:14:44.800
Now without going into
a huge amount of detail,

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.560
because all of that
appears in the book,

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.430
is that the Khawarij took
up arms against the majority

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.450
of Muslims.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.870
And their contention
was that most Muslims

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.290
who accepted arbitration
of men, human beings,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.790
were not pious believers.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.100
So they took up arms
and wanted to kill

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.710
the fourth Caliph, Imam Ali.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.280
And in that very early
battle what happens

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.130
is Imam Ali and others expel
them from within Islam.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.601
They say, you are not believers.

00:15:13.601 --> 00:15:15.100
And I bring the
evidence in the book

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.720
to prove why they
were not believers.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.220
It in other words,
they did not belong

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.386
to the community of Muslims.

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:21.130
That's why they were
called Khawarij.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.100
Now historically, whenever the
Khawarij movement appeared,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.660
either the Ottomans
or the Mughals

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.520
normally eradicated
them by force,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.650
because they were
called treasonous.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.060
They sowed dissension.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.680
They killed other--

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.450
They were made to disappear.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.890
The problem in the
modern world is

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.930
we can't do that, because we
have human rights concerns.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.180
We have torture concerns.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.120
And rightly, you wouldn't
want to go and kill

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.700
entire groups of people because
they believe in taking up

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.470
arms against governments.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.210
That said, the Egyptians
have done that.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.040
The Libyans have done that.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.390
With Iraq, they emerged
from around the region.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.480
The Khawarij emerged.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.970
And they venerate
the old Khawarij.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.680
They make the same claims.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.090
Their appearance is the same.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.000
Even Ibn Abbas, one of
the prophet's most close

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.402
companions, went to see
the group of Khawarij

00:16:05.402 --> 00:16:06.360
in the seventh century.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.693
And it's astounding that he
walks into their encampment.

00:16:08.693 --> 00:16:11.380
And he looks at 6,000 of
them, and he meets them all.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.840
Ibn Abbas, the prophet's, one
of his most dear companions.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.180
And Ibn Abbas was
very well-dressed.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.730
He was wearing perfume.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.480
They used to have long
hair in those days.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.020
His beard was trimmed.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.750
And he wore a Yemeni robe.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.200
He walked into the encampment
of the Khawarij who'd taken up

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.310
arms against the Caliph.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.410
And he said, I don't
see a single companion

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.090
of the prophet among you.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.250
And the Khawarij say,
because they're all mistaken.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.680
And then he asks them,
what is their mistake?

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.300
And they give a list of
three or four things.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.180
And one of the things
they say to him

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:48.585
is that your appearance
is a problem to us.

00:16:48.585 --> 00:16:51.060
And he looks at them, and he
wrote about this afterwards,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.460
and he thought their appearance
was a problem to him.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.090
It's all in the book.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.470
But what I want to very
quickly mention to you

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.430
is the similarities.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.710
In that, they were
very rough people.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.750
They had these
massive prayer marks.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.410
Prayer mark, I'm being polite.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.250
But they had these kind of--

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.490
what's the expression when
you have a health issue,

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.323
because you've been
prostrating for too long

00:17:10.323 --> 00:17:13.440
and rubbing your
forehead on the floor?

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.810
You see that in Egypt
a lot, by the way.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.460
So they had that mark.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.990
Their beards were
long and messy.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.460
Their clothes were rough.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.349
Their hands, and
they smelt badly.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.260
And he made this observation.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.660
And their observation to
him was the entire opposite.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.680
You're a profit
of the companion,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.950
why are you so well-dressed?

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.283
And why are you so well groomed?

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:33.810
And his response was, my
prophet encouraged us,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.990
Muhammad encouraged us
to wear the best clothes.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.884
Dress as the Yemenis.

00:17:36.884 --> 00:17:38.550
Those Yemenis were
the most well-dressed

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.140
and the Romans were the
well-dressed at that time,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.400
so he encouraged that.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.650
He had a Roman shirt,
an Italian shirt.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.109
Does that go down as
Armani these days?

00:17:46.109 --> 00:17:46.650
I don't know.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.189
But so he, Ibn Abbas
was acting on that.

00:17:50.189 --> 00:17:52.230
And they acting on something
completely opposite,

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.880
this rough and rugged way.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.580
Move among the ISIS people,
move among the extreme Muslims

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.830
today, whether the
Salifis in Brixton mosque

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.770
or whether you go down to
Hizb al-Nour in Alexandria

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.304
or whether you go down and see
them in [? Najd, ?] I mean,

00:18:05.304 --> 00:18:06.720
I've met them, and
I've seen them,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.260
and they have those same traits.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.290
You know, their appearance
is rough and ragged.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.760
They're misogynists.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.870
They're judgmental people.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.910
But above all, they
have violent tendencies,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.710
and they are extremely
firm in their convictions,

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.586
that they are on
capital T truth.

00:18:21.586 --> 00:18:23.210
And for that, they
are willing to kill.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.640
So Ibn Abbas confronts them.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.474
He has a whole debate with them.

00:18:26.474 --> 00:18:27.640
And that's also in the book.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.240
So the Khawarij, the
jihadists, and the Islamists

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.970
are the extreme element
of mainstream Muslims.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.560
So who are the mainstream
normal Muslims?

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.130
And that's what I really
try to bring out in the book

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:42.840
that there is this vast
belly of 1.8 billion Muslims

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.010
around the world.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.756
Most of whom wake
up in the morning--

00:18:46.756 --> 00:18:48.130
I mean, I don't
have the numbers.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.770
But most of whom
pray first thing

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.350
in the morning for
divine blessings.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.986
Most of whom recite Quran
or listen to the Quran.

00:18:54.986 --> 00:18:57.360
I know that because when I
was in the Middle East living,

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.162
before [INAUDIBLE] came on or
[? Tarkan's ?] music came on

00:19:00.162 --> 00:19:01.620
on midday, for
about the first hour

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.328
or so in the shops in
the malls, you have

00:19:03.328 --> 00:19:04.830
beautiful recitations of Quran.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.980
It used to be beautiful,
melodious, almost

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.617
opera like the
recitation of the Quran.

00:19:08.617 --> 00:19:10.200
The Ottomans and
others that mastered,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.820
you listen to the prayer
call in either Istanbul

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.950
or in other parts of
the Muslim world that

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.990
hasn't been influenced
by extremism,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.942
is very melodious
and intentionally so.

00:19:21.942 --> 00:19:23.400
And you go into
the mosque, you see

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.740
the architecture, the
calligraphy exceptionally

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.930
beautiful designed out of love,
love to venerate the divine.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.060
And then in their
daily pursuits,

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.400
most Muslims will say
inshallah to mean God willing,

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.660
mashallah as God wills,
and [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.710
or praise be to God.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.620
There's a connection
between our lived reality

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.970
and the divine realm.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.210
Now amid all of
that, Muslims also

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.820
engaged in trade and
secular engagement

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.100
and living their lives.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.020
But the vast majority
of things used

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.600
to be, and for the vast
majority of Muslims to this day

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.160
continues to be, halal.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.750
Everything is
permissible for us,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.374
except the few things that have
been forbidden, so whether it's

00:20:03.374 --> 00:20:06.590
pork or for most Muslim drinking
alcohol and other matters.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.340
But we've tilted
now to the other way

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.370
around where everything is
forbidden unless it's permitted

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.010
in the extremists world view.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.180
Now who are the Sufis?

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.850
I try to bring out great
examples of Muslim luminaries

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:21.860
of the past.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.680
Probably the best known among
Muslims is Mevlana Rumi,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.600
but also known in
the West as Rumi.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.700
But I give an
example of that love

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.200
from very early on in Islam.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:38.610
And Rabia al-Adawiyya, who used
to be a Muslim female teacher

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:43.317
in Basra, today's Basra in Iraq,
in the southern part of Iraq,

00:20:43.317 --> 00:20:45.150
there's a famous story
among Muslim scholars

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.030
that one day she
was caught walking

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.950
with a torch of fire in one
hand and a bucket of water

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:53.992
in the other.

00:20:53.992 --> 00:20:55.950
And others asked, what
is it that you're doing?

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:56.866
It's a symbolic story.

00:20:56.866 --> 00:20:58.552
It's a metaphor,
but it's powerful.

00:20:58.552 --> 00:20:59.760
And what are you looking for?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.830
She said, I'm looking to
burn heaven when I find it.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.120
I want to burn heaven.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.820
And I want to put out
the fires of hell,

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.810
so that people love
God for God's sake,

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.620
and not because they're fearful
of going and burning in heaven

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.400
or they want the
joys of paradise.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.710
And this is eight century.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.210
This is very early on
that being driven by love.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:29.220
And Rabia, she was very famous
for her mystical inclinations.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.960
And now her students
and the students

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.680
of others, Mevlana Rumi,
Hafez, ibn 'Arabi all

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.780
of those great Muslim
luminaries are there.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:42.302
But I will end very briefly
by talking about, I mean,

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:45.570
I'm just spot for choices
to who I refer to.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:50.700
I mean, whether it's Ibn 'Arabi,
Hafez, Omar Khayyam, Mevlana

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.320
Rumi, his teacher,
Shams Tabrizi.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.280
Elif Shafak's books
have done a great job

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.340
in reviving some of that.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.610
I mean, Rumi is the most famous.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.730
So I'll just give
a quick example

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.630
of why Mevlana Rumi was
drawn to his teacher,

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.382
and the book goes into
great detail about Rumi.

00:22:09.382 --> 00:22:11.340
But Rumi's important
because the Ottoman Empire

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.750
was built on his teachings.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.970
So for 700 years, you
had an entire empire

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.000
that was built on the teachings
of love and dedication

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.370
and compassion and
coexistence that was came out

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.400
of Mevlana Rumi's teachings.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.270
And to this day,
the Turks and those

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.930
in their sphere of influence
in Syria or in the Balkans

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.929
talk about Rumi as Mevlana.

00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:31.470
And he was called
Rumi because he was

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.360
a Roman, a Byzantine citizen.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.850
Came to Konya because
of Genghis Khan,

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:43.020
and his massacres in
Afghanistan and the Muslim East

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.660
at the time.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.850
Again, these are all Muslim
incidents of history.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.100
Some of them are metaphysical.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.120
Many of them metaphysical.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.328
In the modern age, it's hard
to believe some of them.

00:22:53.328 --> 00:22:56.010
But the act of
belief is just that.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:56.910
It's a belief.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.000
We don't have to bring
Newtonian physical evidence

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.810
to illustrate it.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.750
But it's a Muslim
belief that Mevlana Rumi

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:10.320
in the 1200s and his father were
both very prominent teachers

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.060
in Konya and professors of
Sharia as law and advisors

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.700
to the Celtic monarch who
was based out of Konya.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:24.360
So Rumi's entire life was based
on very hard Quranic evidence

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.190
based life that we
have to be pious.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.930
We have to worship God.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.114
We have to avoid punishment.

00:23:29.114 --> 00:23:30.780
And we have to be
kind and compassionate

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.850
because texts say so.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.960
So he was an
adherent of the text.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.350
And he applied it
to the context.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.141
And again, in and of
itself, not a problem.

00:23:39.141 --> 00:23:43.140
But he then, as he's
teaching one day in Konya,

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.620
he's sitting beside a
well, and his students

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.920
are asking him questions on
Quranic exoduses, commentary

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.300
on hadith.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.360
And a wandering
dervish from Persia

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.480
called Shams from
Tabriz, a city in Iran,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.810
comes along and pushes
his book into the well.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.357
And Rumi jumps, saying,
this is the only manuscript

00:24:03.357 --> 00:24:04.190
I have of this book.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.150
How dare you throw
it into the well.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:06.840
Who are you?

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.420
You have no idea
what it is I'm doing.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.470
I'm teaching the law of God.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.624
Wandering tramps are
too many in this city.

00:24:14.624 --> 00:24:15.290
Get rid of them.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.040
And as an advisor to the
monarch, what he said

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.940
was taken seriously.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.410
And his students were all there
in awe of this great teacher.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.450
At that point, the
wandering dervish

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:29.580
jumps, bends down into the
water, takes out the book,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.210
and passes it back to Rumi.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.710
And Rumi looks at
the book and says,

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.376
what's the point in
you giving it to me?

00:24:34.376 --> 00:24:37.300
Although I'm impressed how
you got the book out of water.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.960
But I'm sure the ink
is now wiped out.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.150
Shams says, open the book.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.760
Have a look.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.670
Rumi opens the book, and
the ink is still intact.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.300
And Rumi at that point asks
Shams, what is it that you know

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.430
and what is it that
you do that allows

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.099
you to work these miracles?

00:24:55.099 --> 00:24:56.640
And then Shams say,
this is something

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.320
that you will not understand.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.180
As you claim I don't
understand your law,

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.520
I am firmly convinced
you Rumi will not

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.710
understand what I've just done.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.900
So he begs Shams, take me.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.570
Teach me.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.960
Make me a mystic in your path.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.890
And then there's a long story,
and Rumi become the founder

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.247
of the whirling dervishes.

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.830
That most people in
the world at least

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.627
are familiar with the
dance that comes out

00:25:18.627 --> 00:25:19.710
of the whirling dervishes.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.840
He was the founder of
that Sufi tradition.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.480
That's been with us
now for 800 years.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.910
And most Muslims
are followers of one

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:30.810
of these great mystics, whether
it's Rumi of the Mevlana order,

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.290
whether it's the Qadirs,
Abdul Qadir Gilani of Baghdad,

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.440
whether it's the
Naqshbandis, Baha-ud-Din

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.630
Naqshband from Central
Asia, whether it's

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.810
the Chishtis from Moinuddin
Chishti in Delhi in India,

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.710
and whether it's
Imam [INAUDIBLE] that

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.080
came out of North Africa.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.160
The list is long.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.580
The list is a very, very long.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.260
But that's not
where our focus is.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.020
Because what bleeds, leads.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.430
The terrorists attack in France.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.720
Tomorrow's news headlines
all about terrorism.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.270
But the lived reality
of Muslim life

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.770
is something entirely different.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.451
So I've tried to bring some
of that out in the book.

00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:07.450
And I encourage you to
read it and recommend it.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.340
And I've used up my time.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.630
So with your permission,
we'll open to questions.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.270
SPEAKER: We've got
time for questions.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.420
So if you want to put your hands
up, and I will start us off.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.410
I think just the way you've
structured your book,

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:25.450
it's about answering
questions that people have

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.630
and sharing information,
trying to meet ignorance

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.870
with information.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.462
Aside from a book that
answers those questions,

00:26:34.462 --> 00:26:35.920
there must be more
that needs to be

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.670
done to get people across
the world to understand

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.250
what it is to be a Muslim.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.470
Do you have any answers
to how that's done?

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.172
How should that information
be put out there?

00:26:48.172 --> 00:26:49.630
ED HUSAIN: That's
a great question.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.310
I think for most people who
live with and among Muslims--

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.810
by the way, most
people in the world

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.670
probably don't, so you're
right to ask that question.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.070
Those who do know that the
lived reality of living side

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:03.782
by side with Muslims isn't
as dangerous as often

00:27:03.782 --> 00:27:04.740
portrayed in the media.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.364
And for those in the
world who don't, I

00:27:06.364 --> 00:27:10.507
think in a almost
self imposing way,

00:27:10.507 --> 00:27:12.090
I would say that the
responsibility is

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.060
upon us as those of us who are
Muslims and those of us who

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.590
have relations
with our government

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.900
and religious leaders
to do one thing,

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.680
and that one thing is the
Khawarij, the extremists,

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.010
the jihadists who are expelled
from within Islam in the past

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.910
and done so repeatedly all
the way down to the end

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.050
of the Ottoman Empire, that
they ought to be expelled again.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:38.550
So in the name of Islam and
God and protecting Muslims,

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.950
they don't take up arms
and kill innocent people

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.950
and destroy museums
and places of worship

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:49.620
and target Jewish people in
particular and Shia in Iraq.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.310
The carnage that you're seeing
around the world, almost all

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.640
of it is led by that Khawarij,
extremist, jihadist thought.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.230
The reaction of
Muslims today has

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.845
been to basically say, you
know, I'm not doing it.

00:28:01.845 --> 00:28:02.970
It's not really my problem.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:03.910
That's got to change.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.576
And I think the onus
is on us as Muslims

00:28:05.576 --> 00:28:07.532
to expel the Khawarij
from within us

00:28:07.532 --> 00:28:09.240
as they were expelled
throughout history.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.810
What that does then is I think,
the global media and others are

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.290
forced to respond to that,
and say that, there's

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.180
a global summit in
Mecca or elsewhere

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.805
where Muslim scholars, thousands
of them have to come together,

00:28:20.805 --> 00:28:22.440
and say, the Khawarij
are not Muslims.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.050
And they were expelled from
the house of Islam in the past,

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.610
and they're expelled again now.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:31.060
So that helps I think to
reset the relationship.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.925
And it also helps
young Muslims think,

00:28:32.925 --> 00:28:35.670
if those guys from
ISIS in Syria and Iraq

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.400
that I want to go and
join from Bethnal Green,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.740
if they're being expelled by
the global Muslim community

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:46.082
and its leadership
in Mecca, even if I

00:28:46.082 --> 00:28:48.290
do want to go and join them,
god forbid, what it does

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.240
is puts a degree of
doubt in your mind.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.940
And once you have doubt in
the minds of the extremists,

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.684
you can't do what it
is they want to do.

00:28:55.684 --> 00:28:56.850
And that's a wider argument.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:59.280
Because a suicide
bomber, by the way,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.010
has to have [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
is called complete religious

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.880
certainty that what he's doing
or she's doing is done for God

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.289
and is done to enter paradise.

00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:10.080
Unless you have that
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.810
you can't do that action.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.916
So just by doing
what I'm suggesting,

00:29:13.916 --> 00:29:15.540
I put that in the
book the kind of need

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.570
to expel extremists
from the fold of Islam,

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.380
you help the rest of
the world understand

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.540
the normative mainstream
peaceful message of Islam

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.956
but also you prevent extremists
from walking that pathway.

00:29:35.117 --> 00:29:35.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.300
That was a really
interesting talk.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.470
You described the Islamism as
the difference between things

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.020
that are forbidden and permitted
elevated to state levels.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.970
They're legal or illegal.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.865
To what extent is there
a social pressure or can

00:29:49.865 --> 00:29:54.140
a social pressure develop along
those lines which effectively

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.540
makes it law, law
for a community,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.290
because there is so
much social pressure?

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.840
And we can see it across
other religions, as well.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.680
We can use the phrase good
Christian or good Muslim

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.020
or good Hindu not
from the perspective

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.920
of what a person does in
their engagement with society,

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.140
but whether they follow
the requirements.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.500
Do I go to church on Sunday?

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.360
Do I cover my head as a female?

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.030
And the social pressure,
it seems sometimes

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:23.300
that it can be almost as
much as a state requirement,

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.670
because people then feel
compelled to follow it.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.230
How much of that do you see?

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:32.780
And do you see that
clean line between those

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.940
that feel it should be
state law and those that

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.730
don't necessarily say that,
but there is enough societal

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.310
pressure within a group that
effectively makes it something

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:43.654
that people within that
society feel they have to do?

00:30:43.654 --> 00:30:44.320
ED HUSAIN: Yeah.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.500
That's another great question.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.000
And as you were
asking the question,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.590
I was thinking
about East London,

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.250
but I was also thinking
about Egypt, the largest

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.360
Arab Muslim country.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.130
And the same applies in
Indonesia as a background

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.970
answer to your question.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.960
20, 25 years ago in almost
all of those countries,

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.904
and even here in London,
Birmingham, Bradford,

00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:09.570
the social pressure
element wasn't there

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.719
among Muslim communities.

00:31:10.719 --> 00:31:11.760
But that has now emerged.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.590
Clearly it's not
the law of the land

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.280
here to, you know, whether
it's enforcing the headscarf

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:22.200
or whether it's expecting
adherence to religious laws,

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.520
but that's now the norm.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.920
I mean, it's a great
source of sadness

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.400
that young girls in
schools in London aged 3,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.077
4, onwards, many Muslim girls
are now wearing headscarves.

00:31:33.077 --> 00:31:35.410
But there's nothing, as you
say, in law that expects it.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.340
But in Muslim countries,
the Islamist movements

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.710
want to do exactly
that, make it law.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.110
But you're absolutely right
that even without making

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.785
it law on university
campuses across Egypt,

00:31:46.785 --> 00:31:49.350
if anyone here is from
Egypt or has been in Egypt,

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.850
you'll notice that.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.970
20 years ago that
was not the norm.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.850
But now social
pressure is such that--

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.080
I'm not picking on women.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.160
I'm not picking on hijab.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.930
It's just a visible
manifestation

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.270
of that social
application of pressure

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:06.090
to adhere to an
interpretation, by the way, not

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.010
the interpretation,
an interpretation

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:14.460
of Quranic dress code that
goes back to biblical times.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.552
So you're right.

00:32:15.552 --> 00:32:17.010
Social pressure is
on the increase.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.460
And social pressure, almost
the shame element, the honor

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.250
element, the fact that
if you're not doing this,

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.350
you're somehow an outcast, that
you're somehow a moral pariah

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.676
can often lead to
people adhering to that.

00:32:30.676 --> 00:32:31.800
But there's also good news.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.590
And that good news sadly comes
in the form of hypocrisy.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.750
The more you enforce,
the more people rebel.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.480
There's a beautiful saying
in Arabic, [SPEAKING ARABIC]

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.620
that which is forbidden
becomes more desired.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.600
So the more whether it's
a social pressurizing

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.050
Islamists and the
law enforcing cousins

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.110
want to impose, people rebel.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.510
And you're seeing that
in Iran now where women

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.670
are making the removal
of their headscarf

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.940
a symbol of resistance.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.620
But here, you know, a couple
of my friends in Tower Hamlets

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.709
were counselors.

00:33:07.709 --> 00:33:09.875
And they said to me-- this
was about four years ago.

00:33:09.875 --> 00:33:12.930
I don't know the rates
now-- but that the highest

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:19.020
rates of abortion in all London
boroughs was in Tower Hamlets

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.670
among teenage pregnancy
and teenage abortions.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.260
The question is why is it that
young girls in Muslim majority

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.290
schools in Tower Hamlets
are having abortions?

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:32.285
Because they've been forced
to lead double lives.

00:33:32.285 --> 00:33:33.660
And that's the
beauty of freedom.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.932
You give people
freedom, they choose

00:33:35.932 --> 00:33:38.140
whatever it is, the form of
life they want to choose.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.723
You take away that
freedom, you impose

00:33:39.723 --> 00:33:43.710
with it social mores
based religiosity or legal

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.260
religiosity, you have extremism
and hypocrisy being bred.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.440
So in reaction to
your question, you're

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.880
absolutely on to something.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.120
Even without it being state
law, the desire to make it

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.430
state law by those
movements, the desire

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.247
to impose that as state
law has led to them having,

00:33:59.247 --> 00:34:01.080
the Muslim Brotherhood
in particular, having

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.170
so much influence on
the Arab public space

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:08.920
that it's almost a statement
that we don't have the law.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.179
But in the absence of the
law, we will uphold the law.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:17.690
So there might be
another element to that,

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.010
especially in Arab countries,
extreme secularism being

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:24.564
imposed, whether it was
in Tunisia also in Turkey.

00:34:24.564 --> 00:34:25.980
You just made me
think about that.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.139
I think that stands
up to scrutiny.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:34.080
One of the reasons why Egypt and
Turkey both became so Islamic

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.300
was that they were opposing
the government elite.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.008
And the government
elite were imposing on

00:34:38.008 --> 00:34:39.810
them French laicite.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.030
Ataturk was renowned
in Turkey in the 1920s

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.600
for imposing French
laicite on the people,

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.810
abolishing headscarves.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:48.006
If you wore a headscarf
in Turkey or in Egypt,

00:34:48.006 --> 00:34:49.380
you could not work
in government.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.710
You could not be a
television presenter.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.889
You could not go to
university in Turkey.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.710
And I've got tons of
friends who, you know,

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:59.100
could not go to university
in Turkey in the 1990s.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.330
So a reaction against that was
two fingers to the government.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.860
So it also becomes a form
of rebellious politics.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.230
Apply that to here
in the UK, we might

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.420
be seeing something
similar play out in France.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.980
Something similar play
out, you know, Jack Straw

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.980
says that women should
not be wearing their face

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.520
veil in 2002 or 2003.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.520
And then you suddenly see a
surge of women wearing that.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.990
A last reflection on
your great question

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.500
is in many ways many,
many Muslim women--

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.720
I'm not mansplaining, but it's
just an observation-- many,

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.230
many Muslim women feel and
think from conversations

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:36.970
I've had with them is that
it's a form of Islamic feminism

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:40.830
to be able to cover
completely, and say no man

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:45.960
can view any element of me
is a form of feminism now.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.636
You or I can disagree with
that or agree with it.

00:35:48.636 --> 00:35:50.010
But that's also
another component

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:52.800
to that that leads to what
you're observing rightly

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.140
as a social manifestation
of that rigidity.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.140
AUDIENCE: I've got a
follow up question actually

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.080
to what Manesh asked and
what you've been saying.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.850
One of those features of
these extremist groups,

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.850
whether they're the ones
that you've referenced,

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:11.280
or in any religion really, the
extremist group's are always

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.120
characterized by an adherence
to really strict rules.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.750
And it seems like
that is what attracts

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.680
younger men,
stereotypically, which

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.250
is someone who is attracted
to an extremist group

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.420
tends to be a younger man.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.211
And it's almost surprising
sort of contrary

00:36:26.211 --> 00:36:29.890
to what a lot of parents
would think a 17-year-old boy

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:33.577
would be attracted to is a very
strictly regulated society.

00:36:33.577 --> 00:36:35.160
Most 17 year old
boys you would expect

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.360
would be wanting to
run off and do whatever

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.790
they want without any rules.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.195
But it seems like there is
some appeal from that rigor.

00:36:41.195 --> 00:36:42.570
So have you thought
about there's

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.420
a way of harnessing that
and using it for good?

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.810
That there's something about
this rigidity that appeals?

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.402
And how do we counter that?

00:36:52.402 --> 00:36:53.860
ED HUSAIN: You're
absolutely right.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:58.550
And there are reasons why
that rigor of right, wrong,

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.110
do, don't, hell, heaven,
black, white, appeals.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.340
And in the Middle
East, in particular, I

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.590
have a very clear explanation.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.620
And it was borne out two years
ago by a report the British

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.240
Council brought out.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.550
Now in the 1950s and
1960s, Gamal Abdel Nasser,

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.740
the Egyptian
president at the time,

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.510
wanted to nationalize
his country.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.430
And he brought large
numbers of workers

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:28.540
from the Egyptian rural villages
and agricultural agrarian

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.220
workers into the city.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.940
Their children then decided
to want to move up the ladder,

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.210
and they all trained to
become doctors and engineers.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.370
When I say all, I'm
talking 85%, 90%

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:40.840
of young Egyptians
at universities

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.620
want to become either a doctor
or an engineer or lawyers

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.570
too, but generally
doctor and engineer.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.750
Now by the '80s
and '90s, what you

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.630
had is large numbers
of students who

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.870
were either medical doctors
or mechanical engineers.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.270
Those students were
exposed to these trade

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:01.840
unions that were dominated
by the Muslim Brotherhood.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.790
So they were given the
Quran to read as a manual.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:13.690
There was no nuance, poetry,
context, history, consequence.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.340
This is what you do,
and that's the result.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.550
You know, you do x, y,
and z, you go to heaven.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.770
You do a, b, c, you go to hell.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.570
You create an
entire society based

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.570
on that very rigid
application of that worldview.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.790
Now look at the British
Council's report,

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:28.630
it bears it out.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.300
Look at almost every
single terrorist leader,

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.650
Ayman al-Zawahiri, a doctor,
Osama bin Laden, an engineer,

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:41.320
[INAUDIBLE] leader [INAUDIBLE]
an engineer, [INAUDIBLE] leader

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.220
here in the UK, a doctor.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:50.530
You keep going, you know,
the previous Hamas leader,

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.460
a doctor, the previous leader
of the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.420
Mohammed Badie, a doctor,
a vet, but a doctor.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.740
It just keeps going.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.380
Now what that tells you
is that mindset of right,

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.324
wrong, do, don't, heaven, hell.

00:39:07.324 --> 00:39:09.240
So that I think is the--

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.260
now why does it happen
in other societies?

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.720
Why does it happen
here in the West?

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.120
Why are teenagers drawn to that?

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.680
Because, yes, there's
a rules based element,

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.620
but there is something
else at play here.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.750
It gives you the
global cool factor.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.000
Who wants to be a gang
member on the street corner

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.717
when you can be a
global terrorist?

00:39:28.717 --> 00:39:30.550
You know, you blow up
stuff, and then you're

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.660
in an evening news for
three days in a row.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.721
You're trending
all over Twitter.

00:39:35.721 --> 00:39:37.720
There is a cool factor
at play here, I'm afraid,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.380
and you see that in the
affiliation of young Muslims.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.410
Because if you're asking
them to join their parents

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.330
form of Islam, which
is very mystical,

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.830
love based, oriented towards
the divine, and very private,

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:55.060
and love for God, and
dedication to humanity,

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.810
that all sounds so
boring and moderate.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.660
And moderation by
definition isn't exciting

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.720
if you're a teenager.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.275
But, you know, if you're
anywhere near extremist groups,

00:40:06.275 --> 00:40:08.650
immediately you will have the
government's prevent agenda

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.980
on your door.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.456
You know, how cool is that the
local authority and the police,

00:40:13.456 --> 00:40:14.830
people are knocking
on your door,

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:15.830
but they can't arrest
you, because you

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.380
haven't said or done anything.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.840
So I think there is the
global cool factor associated

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.900
with extremism and terrorism.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.660
You know, but there is
also something else.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.050
And I'll put that on the
table, and you can decide.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.850
In Egypt I saw this
after the Arab Spring.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.040
I see it here in the UK.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.930
In addition to the kind of
black and white worldview

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:41.780
and the excitement and the cool
factor, especially in Salafi

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.870
circles, what you
immediately have access

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:50.690
to as a 17, 18, 19, 20, 24,
25-year-old young Salafi man,

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.300
or a woman, but
especially for Salafi men,

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.427
is access to the opposite
gender and sanctioned by faith.

00:40:57.427 --> 00:40:59.510
So if you're not a Salafi,
and if you have access,

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:04.430
if you're dating, or if you're
sleeping out of wedlock,

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.905
it's considered to be sinful.

00:41:05.905 --> 00:41:07.280
And therefore,
people have a kind

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.890
of moral compunction about it.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.470
But if you're Salafi,
all you do is, you know,

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.932
you're attracted to
sister so and so.

00:41:15.932 --> 00:41:17.390
It's weirdly
incestuous, but that's

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.646
what they call each
other, brother and sister.

00:41:19.646 --> 00:41:21.020
But then you just
go to the imam,

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.250
and you have two witnesses,
male witnesses, ordinarily

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:23.791
your friends.

00:41:23.791 --> 00:41:26.390
And then you do an [INAUDIBLE]
an exchange of vows,

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.870
and then you're basically
allowed to date and sleep.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.320
All these various
kind of marriages

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.970
are very popular in
Egypt, very popular,

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.740
increasingly in Turkey too.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.930
But if you move among the
younger population there,

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.714
and if you're a young
17-year-old Abdul in Cairo,

00:41:43.714 --> 00:41:45.130
your life has a
whole new meaning.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.520
It has global resonance.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.541
And there's the cool factor, but
you're also applying scripture.

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.040
And then, you know,
your sexual life

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.100
is healthier than the
average Egyptian who

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.790
has to wait until
he's 35, have a house,

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.990
have enough money saved up, buy
a car, and then get married.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.760
You know, it's hard
for most Egyptians

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.010
who are living on $3 a day.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.460
It's very hard.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.090
But if you're Salafi, almost
all of those needs are taken.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.590
Because it's a
different lifestyles.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.370
It's different.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.869
Anyway.

00:42:13.869 --> 00:42:15.710
So I hope that
answers your question.

00:42:29.909 --> 00:42:30.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:31.840
Thank you for that talk.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.170
I just wanted one
point when you said

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:39.990
that empires lead to creation
of this kind of totalitarian

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.770
ideology.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.320
We're in right now in the
capital of a big empire

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.640
that also dissolved, but
there was no rebuttal.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.471
And I think it's because
the empires it mentioned--

00:42:50.471 --> 00:42:50.970
Russia.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:52.570
I'm from Russia.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.160
A German, they were
very totalitarian.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.170
They didn't allow whatever
views were included

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:01.230
in the public discourse,
whereas British Empire was kind

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.260
of a democracy, so you
could have included everyone

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.030
and the process was functioning.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.370
And my question to
you was what ended

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.790
the Christian theological
totalitarianism was

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:18.180
enlightenment when there was
the great thinkers and education

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:21.060
and great progress in
science and so on and so on.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.600
Do you see that happening
in the Muslim world?

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.120
Did it happen before?

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.780
Will it happen sometime
soon that we'll

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:32.416
end the kind of totalitarianism
and these fringes of Islamism?

00:43:32.416 --> 00:43:33.540
ED HUSAIN: Repeat the last.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.248
A great question.

00:43:34.248 --> 00:43:38.136
The last part was is there
an enlightenment process

00:43:38.136 --> 00:43:39.010
in the Western world?

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:39.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.280
Do you think it's
already happened,

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.470
or is it coming, or
are we kind of we

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:47.100
in the process of enlightenment,
or is it still kind of needs

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.870
to be worked on?

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.040
ED HUSAIN: Yeah.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.230
There are various
answers to that.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.280
The first answer is that
early Muslims led the way

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.290
for the European Enlightenment.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.530
And while that's reassuring,
and you can find the evidence

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:03.580
for that, whether it's
Farabi or whether it's

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.720
Ibn Tufail and his
focus on empiricism,

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.500
whether it's the influence
on Thomas Aquinas,

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.347
or whether it's Ibn
[INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:14.347 --> 00:44:15.930
and their influence
on Latin scholars,

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:19.270
and the way in which the free
inquiry and the free thought

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:23.370
spread in Spain and then
to Paris and through Paris

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:27.000
on to thinkers at
Oxford and Cambridge,

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.370
or whether it's even John
Locke and his influence

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.110
through Muslim scholars
and his teacher

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:34.500
Edward Pocock at Cambridge
who was taught in Aleppo,

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.010
I mean, there's a lot there
that many Muslims point

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:40.200
to that early Arab
scholars, especially

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.720
in Spain and in Cordoba,

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:48.480
were the pioneers of empiricist
free mind free inquiry

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.210
based mind.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.690
And that can be proven
from Farabi down.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.810
The problem is that then
forces many Muslim thinkers

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.530
to rest on their laurels.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.700
They say, oh yeah, we
created the enlightenment.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.810
That's the intellectual
risk of the complacency.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.880
And I don't think
most people are even

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.240
familiar with that genealogy.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.037
John Gray and others
write about it.

00:45:11.037 --> 00:45:12.870
I mean, Leo Strauss is
a big advocate of it.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.680
But most are not familiar.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.700
But in the Muslim world,
there is this inherent,

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.530
arrogance is too strong
a word, but almost

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.500
a claim that we
were the first moves

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:25.040
in the European Enlightenment.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.090
So now that Europe saw
the enlightenment, I mean,

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:29.760
I honestly don't
see that coming.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.120
I'll tell you why.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.750
Because one of the
difficulties here

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:38.820
was for the early thinkers,
whether it was Voltaire or even

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.320
Spinoza, they were all outcasts.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.350
And they were all punished.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:49.230
Rousseau certainly, and John
Locke, I mean, lived in exile.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.600
Hobbes lived in exile.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.369
But now amid all of
that, what you had was,

00:45:54.369 --> 00:45:55.410
yes, they lived in exile.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.670
Yes, they were persecuted.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.370
But they left intellectual
legacies behind.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:02.654
They wrote big powerful books
and put ideas out there,

00:46:02.654 --> 00:46:04.320
that over the course
of 200 or 300 years

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.510
led to something like
the French Revolution.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:12.450
Now my worry is that the Arab
Spring was supposed to be that.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:15.000
But you alluded to the
answer in your question.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.340
When you don't have
societies in which there's

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.930
freedom to think, ask,
rebel, dissent, innovate,

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:25.080
it's hard for free
thinkers to emerge.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.329
And in many ways, some of the
more authoritarian governments

00:46:28.329 --> 00:46:30.120
in the Middle East have
learned the lessons

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.350
of what's happened here.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.800
And I was in a
conversation yesterday,

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.950
and there was a person from
the Middle East in government,

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:41.880
you know, we don't want
feminism intersectionality

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.750
in our countries.

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:46.260
We don't want the
vast godless atheism

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.282
that you have in Europe.

00:46:47.282 --> 00:46:48.990
You know, we don't
want to open the doors

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:53.640
to transsexual, pansexual,
identity complexity

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.970
that you have.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.880
Now to me, that's not
a healthy response.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.776
Because if that's the
individual's ultimate choice,

00:47:01.776 --> 00:47:03.150
and that's where
they want to go,

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:06.790
unleash the battle of ideas, and
let people choose and decide.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.544
So on the one hand,
there's complacency

00:47:08.544 --> 00:47:10.210
that we give birth
to the enlightenment.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.751
On the other hand,
there's a we don't

00:47:11.751 --> 00:47:13.750
want to go down that
route, because you

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:18.916
have the individual liberty
going to an extreme.

00:47:18.916 --> 00:47:20.290
In between what
we have is trying

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:21.860
to keep a lid on the status quo.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.950
So from my point
of view, I honestly

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.220
don't see any great
revolutionary upheaval

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.760
that unleashes the individual
as has happened here.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.310
But what I do see is a
much more Anglo Saon,

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:40.870
Burkeian slow burn going
forward towards reform

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:44.740
and restructuring and allowing
for societies to think freely.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.670
But in the
foreseeable future, we

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:52.720
will not see small
European style democracies

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:57.670
or even liberal societies emerge
in most of the Middle East.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.670
I think there will be
greater tumult. I think

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.430
there will be ever
more difficulty

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:06.520
and confrontation between
various denominations

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.200
and sects.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.070
The Iraqi difficulties
haven't played out yet.

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:13.570
Turkey's not heading in
a positive direction.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.800
Yemen on fire.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.450
Libya broken apart.

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.720
Egypt beyond bankrupt.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.057
Almost every Middle
Eastern country.

00:48:22.057 --> 00:48:23.890
You know, before we go
to the next question,

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.660
it's just I focus
on the Middle East

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.800
because the future of Islam
isn't defined by Indonesia

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.860
or the large 200 million
strong Muslim community

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.530
in India or Muslims in the west.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.600
The beating heart
of the Muslim world

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:43.090
is still Mecca, Medina,
the Gulf, Egypt, Damascus.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.100
And almost all of
those countries

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:52.007
are in deep identity crises
about their place in the world.

00:48:52.007 --> 00:48:53.590
So sorry not to be
able to provide you

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:55.298
with an optimistic
answer, because I just

00:48:55.298 --> 00:48:57.970
don't see it in the next
100 years, 150 years.

00:49:02.675 --> 00:49:05.050
AUDIENCE: Again, thank you
for a really interesting talk.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:07.645
I was struck by what you said
about love at the beginning

00:49:07.645 --> 00:49:10.690
and that being at
the center of Islam,

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:15.160
and also a desire to emulate
good and emulate Muhammad.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.650
And then we've gone on to talk
about various type of people

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.990
who want to follow Islam.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:24.890
But I feel that we've kind of
not touched on the God of Islam

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.730
and what His view is
and what His heart is.

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:29.860
And my thinking is
that that should inform

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.190
how these people are behaving.

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.910
So I was interested
to get your thoughts.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:35.090
And it's a huge question.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:39.660
But if you can explain how
you think God views people,

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.400
and that should go
to explaining why we

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.489
have people doing what they do.

00:49:45.489 --> 00:49:47.530
ED HUSAIN: You've got
great minds here at Google.

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.196
Every question's been
really impressive.

00:49:49.196 --> 00:49:52.180
Every question's
really impressive.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.910
I'm struck by how you phrased
the question, the God of Islam.

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:58.150
There was a gentleman
yesterday at an event who said,

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.370
the Muslim God.

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:05.350
Most Muslims, every
Muslim around the world

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:09.820
will say we have the same
God as Christians and Jews.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.910
And some Muslims would go
further in India and say,

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:17.410
you know, Hindus ultimately
worship a great god

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:18.670
and that great God is Allah.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:23.080
I mean, the Mughals
used that for 200 years,

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.430
Akbar onwards to justify a
Muslim presence in India.

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:34.070
So I mean, the god in our
world is the God creator.

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:36.284
I recognize many people
who are atheists do not

00:50:36.284 --> 00:50:38.200
believe in the God created
thesis, but believe

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.160
in some kind of divine force,
some kind of first mover,

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.660
some kind of beginner,
some kind of primal force

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.870
in the universe
that makes it spin.

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:54.170
Whichever version of God,
there's something beyond us.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:56.380
There's the physics, and
there's the metaphysics.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.410
It's that metaphysics that
most Muslims are interested in.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.675
Now in the seventh
century world of Arabia,

00:51:01.675 --> 00:51:02.800
that was referred to Allah.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.550
The Jews, Christians,
and pagans at the time

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:14.290
recognized that God as
being the same ultimate god.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.920
In Muslim theology, that
Allah was our creator,

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.480
and that Allah has
expectations of us.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.930
Of, you know, there's a
beautiful verse in the Quran.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:27.810
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] All of you
are tried to see which of you

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.600
is best in action.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.920
So there's a focus on
doing good and acting well,

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.430
and life is a trial,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] to see

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.760
which of you is best in action.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.090
So that's the Islamic
or the godly expect,

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.530
the God of Quran, the
God of the Old Testament,

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:49.300
the New Testament, I think
too, is behind our creation

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.960
and wants to see that our
conduct reflects goodness.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.780
And, yes, in the Quran
there are references

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.960
to goodness in this
world is rewarded

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.760
with heaven in the next world.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:06.460
Evil in this world is punished
with hell in the next world.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:11.060
Now both heaven, hell in the
Quran is eternal existences.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:15.730
Our next life is everlasting,
and this life is temporal.

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:18.739
I think that's the gist
of what God expects of us.

00:52:18.739 --> 00:52:20.530
Now one of the beauties
I find in the Quran

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.890
is that God has around
99 attributes or names.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:25.640
And I'd encourage you
to go look those up,

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.890
you know, the 99 names of God.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:29.870
Almost all of them are
deeply beautiful names.

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:32.860
You know, there's a great
saying of the prophet Muhammad

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.880
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] that surely
God is beautiful and loves

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.050
beauty.

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:43.390
And the Quran verses, surahs
they're called the chapters,

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:48.040
all of them but one,
113 of them start saying

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:51.490
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] in the
name of God, most compassionate,

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:53.190
most merciful.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:58.870
And that's the God of Islam
and the God of most Muslims.

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:02.170
And I think unlike
Jews and Christians,

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.690
Muslims recognize all
the Jewish prophets

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.580
and recognize Jesus
not as the Son of God,

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.410
but as a prophet of God.

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:10.330
But Christians and Jews,
and Muslims forever

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:13.180
have this complaint,
they don't recognize us,

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.240
because they don't recognize
Muhammad as a prophet of God.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.775
Because he was an Arabian
prophet, and he could not be.

00:53:18.775 --> 00:53:20.982
But those are intra and
interfaith based debates

00:53:20.982 --> 00:53:22.440
that I think will
continue forever.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:27.580
But ultimately, it's that
one God who is Allah,

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.046
and a focus on the one God.

00:53:29.046 --> 00:53:30.420
The extreme
manifestation of that

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.680
is that the extremists
take that one God

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.110
obsession to a whole new level.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:39.550
So that one God must have one
law applicable to all people,

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:42.370
and any other aberration
has got to be obliterated.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:46.330
That's the problem with
taking good ideas, noble ideas

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:48.280
to this excess.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.560
Hence, their focus with
applying their version

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.880
of the one law on
all people globally

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.696
and their reading of Sharia.

00:53:55.696 --> 00:53:57.558
Hope that answers your question.

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:03.080
SPEAKER: I think that's
all we've got time

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.070
for in terms of questions.

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:05.450
So thank you very
much for coming, Ed.

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:06.170
That was fascinating.

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:07.045
ED HUSAIN: Thank you.

00:54:07.045 --> 00:54:09.820
