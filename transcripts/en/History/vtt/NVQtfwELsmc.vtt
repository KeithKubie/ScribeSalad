00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:03.503
NARRATOR: The idea of
otherworldly agents

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:06.715
of good and evil
influencing humans

00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:10.802
exists in nearly every
culture throughout the world.

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.806
Philosophers, religious
scholars, and psychologists

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:18.935
have long debated not only
the existence of but also

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.730
the nature of these forces.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.690
Whether we think
of light and dark

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.400
forces in metaphysical terms--

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.820
that is, out there somewhere--
or psychological terms,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.365
there are light and dark
forces of some kind.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.868
And respecting
that is important.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.163
The majority of humans on
Earth and throughout history

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:41.624
believe that otherworldly
beings are actually agents.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.753
They're doing things
in this world,

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:49.883
either directly to us or
indirectly, and that they too

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.887
are experiencing a battle
or a struggle and using us,

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.348
as humans, as agents,
as proxies, if you will,

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:59.309
to fight this battle.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.479
I think when you look at
all the evidence of the UFO

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.314
and the ancient
astronaut evidence,

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:08.610
you're going to find behind this
the entities that were accused

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.987
of causing the
darkness, the war,

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.698
the suffering,
all of that, were,

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.825
by and large,
extraterrestrial entities.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:21.164
They called them the gods in
Mesopotamia, also in Egypt.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:28.379
And then that morphed into
angels and the forces of Satan.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.757
Today, we call them
extraterrestrials.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.427
But it's really the same thing.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.514
NARRATOR: Mount
Helicon, Central Greece.

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:42.769
At the base of this mountain,
6th century BC poet Hesiod

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.313
claimed to have made
contact with the nine

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:49.943
muses, immortal daughters
of the god Zeus,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.112
said to impart knowledge
and art to humans.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:57.534
Hesiod composed poems under
the guidance of these muses,

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.828
including what many
consider his most

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:03.832
important work, the "Theogeny"
and the infamous story

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.542
of Pandora's box.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.629
When the titan Prometheus
stole fire from the gods

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.507
and gave it to humans,
Zeus wasn't happy about it.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.092
Zeus wanted revenge.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.719
So what he did was
he commissioned

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.974
Hephaestus to create
Pandora, the first woman.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.894
So he gave Pandora a pithos,
a jar, that contained

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.980
all of the evils of the world.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.939
We call it a box.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.190
But in Greek, it's a jar.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.150
And she's told, don't open this.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.486
Then, of course,
she opens it up.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.531
And so all these evils are
released into the world.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.618
These evil forces are
sometimes embodied by demons.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.203
Sometimes those demons are gods.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:46.833
Sometimes they are hybrid
mix of monsters and gods.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:52.380
But they are the forces of
negative events in the world.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.133
Zeus wanted to counterbalance
the fact that they have

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:59.512
these good things that had been
unfairly, in Zeus's opinion,

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.306
given to humans.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:06.686
So it's an explanation that
lays the existence of evil

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.398
at the responsibility of
the deities, of the gods.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.984
NARRATOR: Might this
story of Pandora's box

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:16.738
be describing the release of
negative beings upon the Earth

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:21.868
by extraterrestrials, as ancient
astronaut theorists propose?

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.955
If we look into some
of the eastern legends,

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:32.045
we come across beings like the
jinn, who could, on occasion,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:36.591
provide goodness and help,
and on other occasions

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:39.510
were like demons
and could provide

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.847
all kinds of evil and
all kinds of temptation.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:47.518
The jinn are really of
some alternative world.

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:50.772
But they're able to
pass through gateways

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:54.567
and come into our
world to influence us.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.986
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that humans were not only

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.073
the creation of
extraterrestrial beings,

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.494
but also, one deliberately
fashioned to possess attributes

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.246
of both good and evil?

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:10.833
and if so, aren't the
forces of light and dark

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:15.046
in an epic struggle to
influence the path of mankind?

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:19.133
The gods fashioned the
body as a sort of result

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:22.095
that would trap
the divine sparks

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:26.432
or souls of the light
beings in a human form.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:30.395
One begins to wonder if this
dualistic or hybrid aspect

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:33.398
of humanity is
sort of like a game

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.775
to these extraterrestrial gods.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.652
Let's conflict these humans.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:38.861
Let's put them on this planet.

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.239
And let's see what happens.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:44.325
Humans are essentially
hybrid beings.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.910
We are conflicted beings.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.997
Part of us is
immaterial and light.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:52.166
The other part of us
is material and dark.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:56.587
And it's that constant conflict
between us that rules our lives

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:57.588
and defines our civilization.
