00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.060
We can think of concepts lying on a spectrum.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.440
On one extreme end are extremely formal concepts for

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.270
which we can define logical conditions that are necessary and

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.480
sufficient for that concept. We'll examine that in more detail in just a minute.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.680
On the other end of the spectrum are less formal concepts for which it's hard to

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.440
define necessary and sufficient conditions. Now here are three points on

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.550
the spectrum. Axiomatic concepts, prototype concepts, exemplar concepts.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.535
There can be other types of concepts as well. We're just going to

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:32.689
consider these three concepts because they are the three most common ones.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.030
And we'll look at each one of them in turn. In general, humans find it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.610
easier to communicate about axiomatic concepts because they are well defined.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.460
There is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that we all agree with.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.870
Examples are mathematical concepts. Humans find it harder to communicate about

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.700
prototype concepts, but most of the time we do quite well. It's even harder to

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.930
talk about exemplar concepts like, let's say, beauty or freedom. Similarly,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.290
it's easier to teach computers axiomatic concepts or program axiomatic concepts

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.940
into computers. It's much harder to program or teach prototype concepts.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.590
And much, much harder to teach a program exemplar type concepts.
