00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.150
Perform transformations on
the movable quadrilateral

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.170
until it matches
quadrilateral NEUT,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.040
quadrilateral NEWT
right over here.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.110
Are the two figures congruent?

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.530
So we have our
little tools here.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.571
But I'm actually going to
do it on my scratch pad

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:19.119
first to think about how we
might want to transform it.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.660
So the first thing-- it looks
like this point right over here

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.050
would correspond to point E
once we shift it over and then

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.530
maybe dilate it down and
then reflect it over.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.620
So let's try to do that.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.270
So the first thing, if
we were to translate,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.310
so how much are we
going to translate by?

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.100
So we're going to move
to the right by 1.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.790
So in the x direction, we're
going to increase by 1.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.285
And in the y
direction, we're going

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:50.010
to go up by-- we're going
to go from negative 4 to 1.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.200
So we're going to
translate by 1, 5.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.500
So that's going to put
our figure like this.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.800
So that point is going
to be right over here.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.610
Everything is going to go
in the x direction by 1,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.240
and then 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 in the y direction.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.100
So this line is going
to look like that.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.480
So 1, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is
going to go right over there.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.256
So that's going to
go right over there.

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:27.890
I'll try my best to draw it.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.080
And then 1 in the x
direction, and then

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in
the y direction.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.419
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:37.960
Or it's going to
look like this right

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.080
after that transformation.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.160
And now, what we
could do-- let's see,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.740
we could either
reflect first, or we

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.140
could try to scale
it down first.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.390
So let's try to scale it down.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.470
Let's try to dilate it.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.590
So let's dilate it.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.470
And let's make our center.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920
I don't want to change
this point right over here.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.420
I like it sitting
there because that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.960
seems to be the point
that it corresponds to.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.084
Let's put the center there.

00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:07.330
So let's put the center
at the point 5 comma 1.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.460
So the center is going
to be right over there.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.420
And we essentially want this
line, which has length 6,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.710
to be scaled down
to have a length 3.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.470
Or essentially, we
want this point right

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.830
over here, which is 6 to
the left of this point--

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.270
we want it to be 3 to
the left of this point.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.510
So we want it to
get half as far.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.894
So we want to scale by 1/2.

00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:33.560
So then that's going
to get the figure--

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.020
this point is going
to be over here.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.680
This point, which is in
the y direction, 2 away,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.080
is now going to only be 1 away.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:49.960
Let me make it clear.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.000
In the x direction, it sits
at negative 3 relative to 5.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.430
So it's 8 away.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.970
So now it's only going to be
4 away after a scale of 1/2.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.800
In the y direction, it's 2 away.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.660
So now, it's only
going to be 1 away.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.470
So that point is going
to go right over there.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.269
And then this
point-- or actually,

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.060
let me focus on this
point right over here.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.000
We're not looking
up there just yet.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.060
This point right over here,
in the x direction, is 4 away

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.050
and, in the y
direction, is 4 away.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.320
So at a scale of 1/2
in the x direction,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.531
it's now going to be 2 away.

00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:22.530
And in the y direction,
it's going to be 2 away.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.461
So it's going to look like
this after the scaling.

00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:27.710
And now it looks pretty clear.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.150
We just have to do a
reflection around this line.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.630
We just have to do a reflection
around the line y equals 1.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.590
Reflect around the
line y is equal to 1.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.650
So let's do all of that
on this actual tool now.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.890
So first, I did the translation.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.120
I'm going to translate
in the x direction

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.420
by 1 and the y direction by 5.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.500
That got me right over there.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.820
And then I wanted
to dilate it down.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.010
So let me scroll
down a little bit.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.540
So dilate it about
the point 5 comma 1.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.130
And then by a scale of 1/2.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.830
So that scaled me down.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.720
And now I'm going to
reflect over y equals 1.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.500
So I'm going to
reflect over the line.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.182
Well, the line y equals 1,
it goes from the point 0--

00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:22.640
I'm just picking
two points on it--

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.405
so it goes from the
point 0, 1 to 1, 1.

00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:28.280
And there we have it.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.390
We've gotten to that point.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.290
Now, we have to
answer their question.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.190
Are the figures congruent?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.720
Well, no.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.890
The first figure was much
bigger than this one.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.630
And the way that we got it to
be able to squeeze into this one

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.930
is that we dilated it down.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.600
These figures would
have been congruent

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.770
if all of my
transformations were just

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.910
translations, reflections,
and rotations.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.030
But I had to dilate it.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.150
I had to scale the figure.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.890
Because I had to
scale the figure,

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.730
these figures are not congruent.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.300
No, the figures
are not congruent.
