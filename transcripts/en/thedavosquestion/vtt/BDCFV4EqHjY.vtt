Hi, to YouTube fraternity, nice sitting and
chatting with you.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.059
And, I think the question really has a very
natural answer - businesses, governments,

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.220
political leaders - have to come together
to address their climate-change issues.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:26.380
Because we are trustees of the future; and
it's important that we, as trustees, hold

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.440
this planet for the next generation.
