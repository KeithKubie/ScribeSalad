TODD KERPELMAN: Hello,
game developers.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.120
And welcome back to another
exciting episode of "Game On."

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.810
I am your host, Todd Kerpelman,
on the Play Games

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.220
Developer Relations Team.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.740
And we're going to jump right
into this week's episode.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.800
So you know how last week we had
two presentations, and we

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.430
didn't really have any
news and updates?

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, this time around, we're
doing the reverse.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.825
We don't have any presentations,
but it's all

00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:32.790
news and updates.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.690
It's our exciting News
and Updates episode.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.110
And let's just get
right to it.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.040
So first, we're going to start
by talking about Game Services

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.320
statistics.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.230
We just started introducing some
basic game services stats

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.490
into the Google Play
Developer Console.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.750
You can see an example here.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.610
We're looking at a couple
of sample games

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.220
that we have available.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.640
On this front page here, you can
see the number of people

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.660
who have signed into your game
using Play Games Services.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.430
Don't get confused by the
column header players.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.319
That's a little misleading.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.030
This isn't people who are
playing your game, but players

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.620
who have signed into Game
Services with your game.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.850
The actual number of people
playing your game is probably

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.790
going to be larger than this.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
Also, if you go into your
Achievements screen within

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.710
Game Services, you
will now see a

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.520
Percentage Complete stat.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.340
These are the number of players
who have signed in who

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.110
have earned this achievement.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.480
So this is a really good way to
look and see if there are

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.750
any achievements that are
too difficult to get.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.280
So we're looking at Bruno's
sample game here-- "Firewall

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.570
Defense." And you can see that
there are a number of

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.120
achievements where the percent
complete is basically zero.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.180
And so he's probably made those
achievements too hard.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.510
This is a common trap for
all you game developers.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.170
You play your game
for weeks on end.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.630
You understand how it works
inside and out.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.080
And achievements that seem
really easy for you to get are

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.980
very difficult for your
average player.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.350
So this is a good way to go back
and just kind of sanity

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.040
check your assumptions and see
if those achievements really

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.140
are as easy or as difficult
as you thought they were.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.229
In addition, you will now be
able to see the number of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.570
unique players who have
submitted a score to each of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.200
your leader boards.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.070
And this is useful if, say,
you have different leader

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.450
boards for different levels.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.230
You suddenly have an idea of how
many people have completed

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.580
each one of your different
levels, because obviously, you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.440
can see the number of
score completions

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.810
for each one of those.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.880
So I know that by themselves,
these stats are interesting,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.240
but they might be data that
you already have if you're

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.160
using any kind of third-party
analytics tool already.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.760
But I think maybe the
interesting point here is that

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.430
we have all the plumbing now
attached so that we can get

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.220
data from the Play Games
Services down to the developer

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.570
console and up to you,
the game developer.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.570
So what we have here is
a pretty nice start.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.030
And more importantly, we have
a nice foundation for us to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.990
start showing you a lot more
interesting statistics

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.150
regarding Game Services.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.920
So now that we've got all of
the plumbing hooked up and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.200
we've got a few basic things in
there, expect to see some

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.190
more stats from us
in the future.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.310
So I don't know.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.480
I think this is kind of cool.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.420
Hopefully you do too.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.260
In addition, we've just launched
Game Insights on the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.320
developer console.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.950
We call it Game Insights because
"Mistakes That You're

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.540
Making" sounds kind
of negative.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.790
But that's kind of
what these are.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.570
These are our way of alerting
you to errors in your game

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.160
that you might not notice as a
developer, one of the most

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.730
important being that your game
has exceeded the rate limit.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.470
For some reason, you're calling
achievements.increment

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.870
too often, or there's some bug
in your program that's calling

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.520
some method on a loop that
it shouldn't be.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.860
In the past, these were very
hard for you to detect, right?

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.180
You have to kind of look for
status codes being returned

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.740
from your client and maybe log
those somewhere or something.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.090
If this is happening
in the wild.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.180
It's very hard for you as
a developer to know

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.220
what's going on.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.540
So now, if we notice that your
app is getting throttled, we

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.740
immediately give you an alert
in the developer console.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.430
So look for those.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.300
In addition, you
can look for--

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.550
I think probably our most
common error that we see

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.470
happening with game developers
is that you've published an

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.240
update your game, but you forgot
to hit Publish in the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.839
Game Services section.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.410
What that means is that you've
got games out there that are

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.520
trying to, for instance,
complete an achievement or

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.310
submit scores to a leader board,
and your Game Services

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.100
are not published.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.730
And the system says, oh wait,
I don't want to make these

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.170
available yet, and it
rejects those calls.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.240
What I think is actually
particularly tricky about this

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.860
particular error is that Game
Services will allow calls from

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.020
anybody who is on the tester
list, which probably includes

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.360
you, the game developer.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.250
So you might have people saying,
hey, I can't earn this

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.870
achievement.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.700
What's wrong?

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.630
And you try it out, and you
say, it looks fine to me.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.580
That's because you're
on the tester list.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.710
You're able to submit or
complete achievements to

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.110
non-published achievements in
leaderboards, and normal

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.300
players cannot.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.480
And so, this error does happen
a lot, and a lot of

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.500
developers miss this.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.010
And so now, we service this as
well on the developer console,

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.670
if this happens to you.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.270
And there's a third error.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.490
A little less common, but there
are times when your game

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.260
tries to unlock an achievement
or submit a score to a

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.670
leaderboard, and the
ID is incorrect.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.980
And again, that's probably
something where you would get

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.420
back an error in the client,
but it's a little hard for

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.050
that error to get sent to
you, the developer.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.170
At least it was in the past.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.200
Now when we notice this
is happening a lot,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.090
we will alert you.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.700
And you'll start to see, OK, my
application apparently is

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.600
trying to do unlock
this achievement

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.800
that doesn't exist.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.290
Maybe I did a copy and paste
error or something.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.720
You can start looking
into that.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.290
So be sure to go and visit
the developer console.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.380
Look for these alerts.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.540
They will come in very handy.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.550
In addition, we are now giving
you twice the cloud.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.020
So we have this service Cloud
Save, generally designed for

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.990
games, which is a very simple,
hey, just save my data to the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.420
cloud, load it somewhere else.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.280
It's great if you've got
developers or if you've got

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.410
players that are playing your
game on multiple devices.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.250
They can carry their progress
from one device to the next.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.710
And in the past, we had
four slots of 128k

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.820
available to you.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.020
And now, check out
these effects.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.670
Bam!

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.870
We are moving to four
slots of 256k each.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.350
So that's twice the cloud.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.740
That's the 1,024k total.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.160
Hopefully, that's enough for
you to save a pretty decent

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.280
save game file.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.220
So make use of that.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.630
And finally, there is a
new Google+ iOS SDK.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.730
This is not specifically related
to Game Services.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.360
This is related to anything
you'd want to do with Google+.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.460
So you non-game developers as
well, if you're looking to

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.620
share anything on Google+, this
is relevant to you, too.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.870
There are a number of
enhancements to this SDK.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.820
But the biggest thing
you'll notice is the

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.230
native share box.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.910
It used to be that if you wanted
to share something from

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.660
a game or an application to
Google+, you had to basically

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.060
switch out of your app or your
game and over into a browser,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.990
Mobile Safari, something like
that, so that you could share

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.030
on Google+.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.420
And it wasn't a great
experience.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.760
I mean, you left your app to go
into a browser so that you

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.630
could post this thing.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.090
So now the new experience--

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.730
ooh, got some more
effects there--

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.420
is much nicer.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.820
This is a native share box, so
it basically pops up within

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.360
your application.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.000
The user doesn't have
to leave it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.790
They don't have to swap out.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.870
And they can share directly
through Google+ from there.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.330
In addition, this native share
box has some features that let

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.280
you upload and share
a photo or a video.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.300
This is great for you
game developers.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.530
You can take a screenshot of
your game, and you can add

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.520
that in to the native share
box and share right there.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.530
So it makes for a much more
interesting post when someone

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.250
can share exactly the cool
thing that's happening in

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.630
their game when they
share this stuff.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.760
So we will update our
sample code to show

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.990
you how to do that.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.820
Make sure to view the Google+
documentation.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.610
It basically gives you all the
code snippets you'll need to

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.500
get that working.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.940
Also, watch out by the way.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.080
I think there are four new
frameworks that you're going

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.430
to have to add into your
application that you didn't

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.540
have to before.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.270
Again, all that is available on
the Google+ documentation

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.169
side of things.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.360
So if you want more
information, you

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.630
can check that out.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.030
And I believe that concludes
this week's episode of "Game

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.420
On." Go to your developer
console.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.730
Check out those stats.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.860
I think it's pretty
interesting.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.240
And we will see you
in a couple weeks.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.490
Thanks, game developers.
