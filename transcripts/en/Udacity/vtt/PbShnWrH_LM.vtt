Of course females could be affected by alleles of

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.650
the OPN1LW gene. But because this loss of function allele

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.860
is recessive, a female would need two copies of the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.930
allele to be mutated, whereas males would only need one.
