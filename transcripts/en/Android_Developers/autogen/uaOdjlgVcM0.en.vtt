00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
okay so you know how I said that this
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.690
okay so you know how I said that this
lesson was going to be the one where

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700
lesson was going to be the one where
 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.370
lesson was going to be the one where
we're going to add a sign-in button well

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
we're going to add a sign-in button well
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.919
we're going to add a sign-in button well
it turns out I lied this lesson is where

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
it turns out I lied this lesson is where
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.900
it turns out I lied this lesson is where
we add in all the frameworks and all the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
we add in all the frameworks and all the
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.939
we add in all the frameworks and all the
linker flags and do all the random setup

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
linker flags and do all the random setup
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.920
linker flags and do all the random setup
stuff we have to do before we add the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
stuff we have to do before we add the
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.260
stuff we have to do before we add the
sign-in button but I promise after this

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
sign-in button but I promise after this
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.759
sign-in button but I promise after this
we'll be adding a button it'll be really

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
we'll be adding a button it'll be really
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.490
we'll be adding a button it'll be really
exciting so let's get into adding our

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
exciting so let's get into adding our
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.470
exciting so let's get into adding our
frameworks now the first thing we're

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
frameworks now the first thing we're
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.720
frameworks now the first thing we're
going to want to do is download the play

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
going to want to do is download the play
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.260
going to want to do is download the play
games SDK and the Google+ SDK we're

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
games SDK and the Google+ SDK we're
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030
games SDK and the Google+ SDK we're
going to make use of both of these

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
going to make use of both of these
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.180
going to make use of both of these
libraries in our application so first

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
libraries in our application so first
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.119
libraries in our application so first
thing we're going to do is go to

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129
thing we're going to do is go to
 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.610
thing we're going to do is go to
developers.google.com/jobs and once that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
developers.google.com/jobs and once that
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.950

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.570
see a link for the Google+ iOS SDK and
we can download this zip file as well

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580
we can download this zip file as well
 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.490
we can download this zip file as well
once that's done you'll have a downloads

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
once that's done you'll have a downloads
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.080
once that's done you'll have a downloads
folder that looks a little something

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
folder that looks a little something
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.260
folder that looks a little something
like this we've got our Google+ SDK and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
like this we've got our Google+ SDK and
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.530
like this we've got our Google+ SDK and
our play game services SDK and so first

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540
our play game services SDK and so first
 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.490
our play game services SDK and so first
thing you're going to want to do is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
thing you're going to want to do is
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.800
thing you're going to want to do is
unzip each of these and then I suppose

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
unzip each of these and then I suppose
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.710
unzip each of these and then I suppose
we can Trash the zip files just to clean

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
we can Trash the zip files just to clean
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.510
we can Trash the zip files just to clean
up a little space great and now we have

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
up a little space great and now we have
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.800
up a little space great and now we have
some frameworks we can add to our

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
some frameworks we can add to our
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.690
some frameworks we can add to our
project now we're going to leave this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
project now we're going to leave this
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.280
project now we're going to leave this
play game service ole own for a little

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
play game service ole own for a little
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.980
play game service ole own for a little
while but let's explore what's in our

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
while but let's explore what's in our
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.429
while but let's explore what's in our
Google+ iOS SDK you'll see in here we've

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
Google+ iOS SDK you'll see in here we've
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709
Google+ iOS SDK you'll see in here we've
got a couple of frameworks along with a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
got a couple of frameworks along with a
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.840
got a couple of frameworks along with a
bundle file and this open source

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
bundle file and this open source
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.789
bundle file and this open source
directory along with the changelog

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
directory along with the changelog
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.580
directory along with the changelog
readme file and some sample code for the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
readme file and some sample code for the
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.619
readme file and some sample code for the
purposes of our application we're going

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
purposes of our application we're going
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.960
purposes of our application we're going
to want to add the two frameworks into

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
to want to add the two frameworks into
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.510
to want to add the two frameworks into
our Xcode project

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
our Xcode project
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.940
our Xcode project
so the easiest way to do that is let's

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950
so the easiest way to do that is let's
 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.970
so the easiest way to do that is let's
go to Xcode and we can simply drag these

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
go to Xcode and we can simply drag these
 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.400
go to Xcode and we can simply drag these
two framework folders into our Xcode

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410
two framework folders into our Xcode
 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.080
two framework folders into our Xcode
project so i'm going to copy over the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090
project so i'm going to copy over the
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.920
project so i'm going to copy over the
google open source framework folder and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930
google open source framework folder and
 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.240
google open source framework folder and
depending on your setup you may want to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250
depending on your setup you may want to
 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.430
depending on your setup you may want to
copy these into your destination folder

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440
copy these into your destination folder
 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.990
copy these into your destination folder
or you might want to leave this

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000
or you might want to leave this
 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.480
or you might want to leave this
unchecked if for instance you have a

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490
unchecked if for instance you have a
 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.370
unchecked if for instance you have a
centralized location where all of your

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380
centralized location where all of your
 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.200
centralized location where all of your
libraries are going to be then you can

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210
libraries are going to be then you can
 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.000
libraries are going to be then you can
have multiple applications all referring

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010
have multiple applications all referring
 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.220
have multiple applications all referring
to the same directory and at some point

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230
to the same directory and at some point
 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.570
to the same directory and at some point
in the future when you need to update

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580
in the future when you need to update
 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.790
in the future when you need to update
this directory this framework you'll

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800
this directory this framework you'll
 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.530
this directory this framework you'll
only need to update it in one place on

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
only need to update it in one place on
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.240
only need to update it in one place on
the other hand if you need to put

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250
the other hand if you need to put
 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.310
the other hand if you need to put
everything into a nice standalone folder

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320
everything into a nice standalone folder
 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.690
everything into a nice standalone folder
that you can zip up and send around

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700
that you can zip up and send around
 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.910
that you can zip up and send around
maybe it's worth copying this into your

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920
maybe it's worth copying this into your
 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.280
maybe it's worth copying this into your
destination folder in my case I'm going

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290
destination folder in my case I'm going
 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.780
destination folder in my case I'm going
to leave this check and copy everything

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790
to leave this check and copy everything
 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.420
to leave this check and copy everything
over and then I'm going to do the same

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430
over and then I'm going to do the same
 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.440
over and then I'm going to do the same
thing for the Google+ framework and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450
thing for the Google+ framework and
 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.330
thing for the Google+ framework and
again I'll leave this checked make sure

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340
again I'll leave this checked make sure
 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.220
again I'll leave this checked make sure
that the guest my number target is

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230
that the guest my number target is
 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.580
that the guest my number target is
checked as well and look at that we've

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590
checked as well and look at that we've
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.080
checked as well and look at that we've
got two new frameworks added to our

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090
got two new frameworks added to our
 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.520
got two new frameworks added to our
project I'm just going to move these

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530
project I'm just going to move these
 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.560
project I'm just going to move these
into the frameworks holder and we can

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570
into the frameworks holder and we can
 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.540
into the frameworks holder and we can
take a minute to talk about the few

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550
take a minute to talk about the few
 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.460
take a minute to talk about the few
things that we're not adding you'll

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470
things that we're not adding you'll
 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.380
things that we're not adding you'll
notice we have a Google+ bundle file

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390
notice we have a Google+ bundle file
 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.270
notice we have a Google+ bundle file
that we're not going to copy over this

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280
that we're not going to copy over this
 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.040
that we're not going to copy over this
contains all the resources needed to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050
contains all the resources needed to
 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.350
contains all the resources needed to
generate an in-game Google+ sign-in

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360
generate an in-game Google+ sign-in
 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.690
generate an in-game Google+ sign-in
button and for reasons that I'll explain

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700
button and for reasons that I'll explain
 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.970
button and for reasons that I'll explain
in a future lesson we're actually not

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980
in a future lesson we're actually not
 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.800
in a future lesson we're actually not
going to take advantage of this we're

going to take advantage of this we're
 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.510
going to take advantage of this we're
going to generate our own but if you
