00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.510
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.810
Good morning.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.110
Thanks for coming out
on this disgusting,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.760
rainy day to spend
some time with us.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.740
Thank you to the co-chairman of
the festival, David Rubenstein,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.260
and all the sponsors who
make this event possible.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.870
If I can just ask everyone
to make sure

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.890
that your phones are
silenced or turned off.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.810
And though I'm sure you all have
questions, just please hold them

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.220
to the end of the conversation.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.950
We'll have a little time
for you guys to step up.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.630
Also, some of you have
been in here before.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.790
You probably know the drill,
but this is being recorded

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.670
for posterity so, you know make
sure your questions are good ones.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.420
[laughter] I'm going
to try to anyways.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.720
[laughing]

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.020
&gt;&gt; No pressure.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.320
&gt;&gt; No. No pressure.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.270
[laughing] I'm really excited to be
here this morning with Hari Kunzru

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.770
and Katie Kitamura to talk --

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.680
about life and marriage
in a two writer household,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.900
not the least because I'm an
old bachelor with three cats.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.860
So this is going to be
really educational for me,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.910
probably more so than for you guys.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.890
Katie Kitamura's latest
book is "A Separation."

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.700
It's an unnerving story about a
woman -- we never learn her name.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.230
She goes to Greece to search

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.010
for her estranged husband
who's disappeared there.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.710
I read it and I was kind of
creeped out for days afterwards.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.120
[laughing] And I also realized
as I read it that I will never,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.330
ever examine my life
as deeply or as --

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.630
with such precision

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.950
and thoughtfulness [laughing]
as your narrator does.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.790
So it was like sort
of a goal situation.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.520
[laughter] Hari Kunzru's
latest book is "White Tears."

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.930
That's another one that's going to
stick with you for days afterward.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.530
It's the story of two college kids,
one rich, one poor, both white,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.640
both obsessed with black
music and authenticity.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.190
And their lives are
kind of turned inside

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.630
out after they discover this old --

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.410
what may or may not be a lost
blues record from the 30s that may

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.050
or may not be something
more than just a record.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.890
So both of those are really
great reads that will stick

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.190
with you for a long time.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.370
Thank you guys so much
for being here today.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.280
&gt;&gt; Hari Kunzru: Thank
you for inviting us.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.580
&gt;&gt; My pleasure.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.100
So I guess we're just going
to start with the basics.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.120 position:56%
What is life like with two writers
and two small children in the house?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.340
I mean what's an average
day for you?

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.960
&gt;&gt; Well it involves a lot
of coffee early in the game.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.670
&gt;&gt; I saw that quote in the Guardian
about espresso drinks being all

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.260
that stand between you
and creative disaster.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.560
&gt;&gt; And I wasn't kidding.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.100
It really is true.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.570
I mean we get woken up
earlier than we would like

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.300
and in a less dignified
fashion than we would like.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.400
And yeah -- and the first few
hours of the normal business

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.250
of the preschool run and
getting everybody settled

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.620
and then finally we both
have a coffee in our hands

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.770
and the ability to
escape to our desks.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.070
It means that --

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.370
&gt;&gt; Katie Kitamura: We stagger up
to our desks and sit down and --

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.670
&gt;&gt; [laughing] I know I'm
an editor, not a writer,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.500
but I also rely intensely on
coffee to get through the morning.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.700
What did you not expect about
being a two writer household?

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.710
What came as a complete
surprise to you?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.660
&gt;&gt; I mean I think -- I mean
often we're asked about,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.190
you know whether it's competitive
being in the two writer kind of --

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.630
especially because our books
came out within three weeks

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.420
of each other earlier this year.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.260
And I just don't -- I mean
I don't know about you --

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.770
I just don't feel that
[laughing] at all.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.180
I mean I think we're
very different writers.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.780
I mean I don't know.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.080
I feel like we're both trying

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.380
to move the project
forward in some way.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.060
So that's absolutely not an
element of the relationship at all.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.670
I mean I think there's --

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.490
&gt;&gt; I mean when we first got
together we used to live

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.630 position:56%
in a little studio apartment and,
you know there was a room with a bed

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.690
and two desks facing
in opposite directions

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.330
and we both wrote novels in there.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.830
And I think we discovered
that if we could do that

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.930
and essentially be together
more or less 24 hours a day

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.470
and were still happy to
be in each other's company

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.060
that was an indication

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.480
that we should probably
get married and reproduce.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.780
[laughter] So --

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.080
&gt;&gt; I mean I think it's --

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.270
&gt;&gt; We went ahead and did that
and then added more obstacles

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.410
in the shape of, you
know little people.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.710
[laughter]

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.320
&gt;&gt; But I think it's also
the fact that the practice

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.700
of writing is actually much more
flexible than you think it is.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.310
I think -- you know I
don't know about you,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.280
but when I started writing
I would have my rituals

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.360
and I thought I needed to write
first thing in the morning kind

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.710
of between seven and 11 when
I was fresh and all that goes

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.280
out the window certainly
once you have children,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.510
but even before then I think, you
know when you're living together

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.810
and you're trying to
make work together.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.450
And I think the kind of
capaciousness of a relationship

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.910 position:56%
and of a fiction writing practice
is -- took me by surprise certainly.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; That is something actually -- you
anticipated a question I was going

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.640
to ask because I mean there
have been whole books dedicated

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.940
to writers' routines.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.520
I mean people are almost
religious about it.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.940
You know I get up, I
have a cup of hot water,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.560
I have to write 5,000 words
before two p.m. and then --

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.770
you know I'm pulling that
off the top of my head,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.070
but it seems like that's kind

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.130
of incompatible [laughing]
with a family life.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.430
&gt;&gt; It really is.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.790
I mean I used to be -- I mean I
call it throat clearing really.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.100
I mean it used to take
me kind of hours of --

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.450
the sort of equivalent
of aligning up my pencils

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.150
on the desk before I could actually
feel psychologically capable

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.120
of sitting down, but now I know

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.630
that I have really a relatively
short time and I have to be able

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:21.770
to kind of access the zone
very quickly and efficiently.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.360
I mean I have little
techniques to get myself

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.070
into my headspace kind of quickly.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.870
I mean I -- you don't like to
write with music on but I do.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.940
So I wear noise cancelling
headphones and make my own sort

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.200
of space in -- amidst the
chaos of the household

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.070
and I now am quite good at sort of
stripping away the outside world

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.040
within 10 minutes or
so and getting into it.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.180
&gt;&gt; It's almost like deadline
pressure except you have no idea

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.120
when the deadline is
actually going to be.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.420
[laughing]

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.720
&gt;&gt; It's an existential deadline.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.020
[laughter]

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.320
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.620
&gt;&gt; I mean it's --

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.920
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Oh God!

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.220
I mean that actually sounds

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.520
like it might be productive
for a writing practice.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.820
[laughing]

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.120
&gt;&gt; I mean it was very good for me
in a way to have some constraints

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.530
when I was single and
affectively could spend all day --

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.270
I mean pretending that I
was in touch with the muse.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.990
You know I could waste
huge amounts of time

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.990
and I find these days I do
much more in much less time

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.290
because of that pressure.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I mean I think it was taking me
maybe two years or a little bit more

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.600
to write a book before we had
children and then after my --

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.730
our son was born I
think I wrote my --

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.660
this book, "A Separation"
in about nine months.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.790
It's just -- there was some
element that you just really had

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.060
to sit down and get to it.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.540
And I mean it's -- I mean

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.350
when you're promoting a book
you're often asked to kind

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.720
of describe your working space

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.920
and our working space is
complete chaos for both of us.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not the sort
of aesthetic situation

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.040
where the magazine is going to
do the sort of lifestyle spread.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.340
[laughter]

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.640
&gt;&gt; No.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.940
&gt;&gt; About it.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.240 position:56%
Unless there's a magazine that wants
kind of, you know kid underwear

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.090
and half eaten sandwiches.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's -- but you
kind of write out of that chaos

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.380
and that has started to
feel quite good in some way.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.890
&gt;&gt; [laughing] How does living
together as writers kind of --

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.420
do you play off each other?

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.740
Do you edit each other?

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.630
Are you bouncing ideas
of each other?

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.570 position:56%
Or is it very like, "I have my lane.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.870
You have your lane."

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.280
&gt;&gt; Stay out of my lane.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.580
[laughing] No.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.610
&gt;&gt; We've found what's
really -- I mean because --

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:28.250
Katie's my best reader and
my first reader and I --

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.350
in a way you don't want
to waste that read.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.510
You don't want to be kind of
tugging on the sleeve every day

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.810
and saying, "Is it good?"

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.410
&gt;&gt; "Am I good?"

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.710
&gt;&gt; Mom! Mom!

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.010
&gt;&gt; And you won't -- and that
I think would definitely --

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.490
you know if we were both
requiring a certain sort

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.340
of emotional reassurance
from each other

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.460
that might get things
too tangled up.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.630
So what we do is we don't
really speak about our projects

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.400
for a very long period of time.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.850
I mean you go off to your room.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.150
I go off to my room.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.450
And we do our thing.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.750
We meet for lunch.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.050
We talk about other things.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.800
We -- you know we -- maybe in
general terms about our work

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.570
but I haven't read a word of the
novel that you've been working

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:16.540
on for the last year
and a half and same.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:22.880
So I mean we'll get to the point
of full drafts and hand it over

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.910
and actually then -- I mean I
think people get very tangled

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.990
up with what they need from their
partner and what I need from Katie

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.290
when I give her a draft

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:40.080
of my writing is an extremely
hard edged, professional read.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.030
I don't need her to
tell me I'm okay.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.330
[laughter]

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.210
&gt;&gt; I mean I think it's also
kind of an exciting moment

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.470
because we do live and
work in the same space

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.540
and I mean we do spend
24 hours a day together.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.840
&gt;&gt; A lot of time together.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.520
&gt;&gt; We spend a lot of time together
and so it's quite exciting in a way

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.150
to kind of appreciate your partner

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.740
for this incredible book
they've written rather than --

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's their
privacy to be reminded

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.220
that there is this thing going on
that you had no idea about at all.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.060
&gt;&gt; You still feel like; I
don't actually know everything

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.320
that is inside his brain and
it's nice to see your partner not

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.360
in the register of "I love him
because he changes the diapers

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.660
and he unloaded the dishwasher,"

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.800
but it's like this
incredible imagination

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.180
and this is what has been going on.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.090
So it's actually -- it's
nice we're together.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.520
&gt;&gt; It's kind of romantic.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.910
&gt;&gt; [laughing] It's even romantic.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.410
&gt;&gt; You know but we spend
all this time together

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.960
but there is still
some kind of amount

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.080
of privacy between us I think.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.680
&gt;&gt; It's interesting that you say
that because one of the things --

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.810
I think we talked about it a little
over email and I definitely noticed

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.510
when reading your books
-- is that there are --

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.570
there's a little bit of overlap
I think in some of the themes.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.650 position:56%
They're both very haunted books that
-- you mentioned that and I thought

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.950
when you said it I
thought, "Of course.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.860
Yes. These are both books that
are very concerned with -- ."

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.200
[thumping sound] Oh, sorry.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.770
I just -- I gestured [laughing] so
excitedly I banged my microphone.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.280
These are both books
that are concerned

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.640
with various kinds of haunting.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.630
Was that like a -- was that
something you thought about

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.890
or noticed or did it just bleed
back and forth between you?

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:13.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think we -- yeah, I mean we
have meshed into a kind of shared --

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.050
&gt;&gt; Set of concerns?

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:20.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's true and
our tastes in what we like to read

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.830
and what we're thinking about
kind of overlap considerably.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I mean I would -- I think I would
have said our books were completely

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.010
different, but then as they've
been out in the world --

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.010
I mean I think we did
a reading together once

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.690
and we both read things
that were about --

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.470
specifically about local
performance and specifically

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.950
about something uncanny in this
book, performance, [agreeing noise]

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.400
and specifically even
about grief in some level.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.680
And so then you realize
that actually we are sitting

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.530
around thinking about the same
things, but they have come

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.450
out in totally different ways

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.480
because no two people will write
even the exact same story the

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.780
same way.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.420
&gt;&gt; I mean stylistically
we're very different writers.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.020
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.320
When I was reading the books
that was sort of the first thing

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.660
that came to me was that
just stylistically they were

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.960
so different.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.230
Their approach to sort of -- to
dialogue and to character was

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.090
so different, but then as I kind of
dug deeper there were these like --

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.390
there were these little parallels.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.840
And you mentioned the performance,
the music, the vocal music.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.160
I mean there's -- both books
sort of turn a little bit

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.750
on an almost supernatural
vocal performance.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.430
[pondering noise] The
other thing that I --

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.850
I guess actually we just --

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.140
I've just been talking about
how your voices are different,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.490
but I wonder, you know with me,
with my friends that I've known

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.400
for 30 years, we all start
talking alike eventually.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.580
[laughing] I mean there are shared
intonations, shared speech rhythms,

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.520
shared in-jokes that just become
embedded so deeply into the way

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.700
that you talk that you don't
even know that you're doing it.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.070
Is that something that you
have to watch out for now

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.950
that you're living in
such close quarters?

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.580
&gt;&gt; I mean there's an issue because
you're English and I'm American,

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.360
but now we both each
spent about a decade

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.660
in the other person's country.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have a terrible
vocabulary problem going on

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.060
and neither of us is now secure

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.760
on what is English usage
and what is US usage.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.060
And --

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.150
&gt;&gt; Like we can't trust each
other to catch it, you know?

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.030
&gt;&gt; And we both -- we're both the
children of immigrants as well.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.250
I mean my -- yeah, I mean --

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:17.530
so there's a kind of
deracinated English that's going

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.050
on in our household and
also we're reading --

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:25.470 position:56%
increasingly we're reading more and
more fiction in translation as well.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.760
So there's that going on also.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.020
I mean I like that and
I'm interested in that

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.380
because that seems to be something
that's happening to English anyway.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.710
I mean English is a world
language and I saw some statistic

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.700
that somehow -- that
something like 60 percent

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.880 position:56%
of English conversations are
between two non-native speakers now,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.090
which is -- I mean
what does that mean

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.110 position:56%
for the way that language functions?

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.220
So I mean that -- I'd like to think
that our kind of head scratching

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.880
about whether the word -- what
was the one I had the other day?

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.010
I wanted somebody to be hit over
the head and I used the word cosh,

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.890
which turns out should
be a super British.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.500
And I thought that was --
[laughter] and yeah but that --

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.150
maybe it is productive that
that sort of thing is going on.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.610
&gt;&gt; I mean one thing that's
interesting is it does --

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.580
you have to stop and
wonder about your usage.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.560
You become aware of it and that
is surely useful for a writer.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.910
It's never like just language
that falls into your head.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.230
That's -- you have
to stop and think,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.340
"Does that even make
sense for this character?"

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.570
And so maybe that small degree of
separation is useful for your --

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.930
&gt;&gt; [musing sound] I mean you once
told me that you sort of aspired

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.350
to write as if it had been
translated rather than not.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's true, that
slight level of remove is useful.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.640
But I mean it's something
that I've always thought

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.690
about in certainly kind
of intellectual terms.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.490
And then you realize it comes
back to biography and it is

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.620
because I am the children
of two Japanese immigrants.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.980
English was a second
language in my household

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.710
and then whenever my parents
spoke English it was very much a

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.010
second language.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.310
So there was always
this slight question

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.380
about the correctness of usage.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.870
&gt;&gt; When -- that's interesting
because the main character

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.200
in "A Separation" is a translator.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.820
&gt;&gt; Was that something you were
consciously thinking about

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.100
or did it just kind
of arise naturally?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:18.580
&gt;&gt; I think it -- I think that
idea of being not entirely at home

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.930
in your language was something that
I was definitely thinking about.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.290 position:56%
I mean I was -- we often -- you know
the phrase, "lost in translation" is

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.780
so familiar to us, but I
was actually more interested

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.340
in this question of what
is added in translation

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.740
because it is effectively like
another person is now writing

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.130
or voicing a book with you.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.900
So you know when a
book is translated

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.990
into another language you have
the author and the translator

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.510
and they kind of make that book
together in the second language.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.400
And I think for this book in
particular, which is so much

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.220
about being haunted by another
presence, that felt useful to me.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.630
&gt;&gt; I -- there was a quote I think
I saw in an interview with you

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.900
where you talked about a
translator saying, "I look forward

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.550
to writing your book
in French," was it?

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.850
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that was great.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughing]

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.750
&gt;&gt; The idea of creating the
book again in another language.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:06.380
I wonder if sort of -- and
this just occurred to me --

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.660
that writing is a way of
making a home in language,

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.710
if you were feeling kind of
between several cultures.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.010
&gt;&gt; I think absolutely.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.110
&gt;&gt; I mean both of us have such
a sort of deep love for books

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:23.730
and we do make our world out of
those books no matter where we are.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:29.350
I mean we have as a couple moved
around to various places and --

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.870
&gt;&gt; I mean I think you --
because one of the things I love

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.600
about Hari's work and his brain
in general is that he does --

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.410
he can seize hold of
a situation very,

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.900
very quickly and write about it.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.260
And so I think you actually,
from living in America,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.520
from living in Berlin,
you've used those experiences

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.790
and you've actually written in the
voices of people who would be --

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.450
who are native to those
places in a way.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.850
And I don't know if that's
part of a -- like finding --

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.450
&gt;&gt; It's foolish really isn't it?

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.870
[laughter] It's like
kind of -- but I --

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:05.340
no I do stumble into the middle of
things and it's too irresistible

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.720
to not -- it's irresistible to
write about them and so I do end

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.220
up writing in voices that
are very distant from my own

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.630
and about experiences that
are quite distant from my own.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.780
I mean I also like
research more than you do.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.250
I'm much more of a kind
of, you know internet --

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.700
you know drift kind of did.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.270
&gt;&gt; Yes. No, I mean when you -- for
instance the kind of nuts and bolts

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.500
of his -- I often farm
out research to Hari.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.890
So I'll say, [laughter]
"I need -- ."

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, she can kind of drop
it casually at the lunch table.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.300 position:56%
"I wonder what that would be about."

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.710
And I will then be,
"Oh, yeah, yeah."

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.550
[laughter] And so I'll end up kind
of doing an hour and coming back.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.850
[laughing]

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.150
&gt;&gt; It's amazing.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.450
I'm kind of upstairs
working on my book

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.750
and then an hour later I get an
email with links to everything.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.250
[laughter] So it's
really, really useful.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.210
&gt;&gt; She knows how to
manipulate my compulsions.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.510
[laughter]

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.240
&gt;&gt; That's a strong
marriage right there.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.560
And actually use -- that
distaste for research pops

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.520
up in Christopher who's
the missing husband

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.270
because his wife is
pretty salty about the fact

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.330
that he's disappeared
to Greece researching.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.700
&gt;&gt; Yes. I mean because I
think books are so funny

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.380
because for me they operate
much more like kind of dreams

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.560
in that it's not that x is y,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.760
it's more that the author
is all the characters.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.630
And so that element of Christopher
is definitely my self-loathing

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.060
about my -- you know I can be
researching a book and not --

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.150
never go to the library
for years I would say.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.020
[laughter] So yeah.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.320
&gt;&gt; Research is so fun.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.620
That's the most fun part.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.920
[laughter] Then like when you --

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.220
&gt;&gt; I'll be sending you emails

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.850
with my questions [laughing]
you have to watch out.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.190
&gt;&gt; No. I don't want
to step on your turf.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.690
[laughing] But no, once
you've done research again --

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.990
&gt;&gt; Enough to go around.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.290
[laughter]

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.590
&gt;&gt; And you're sitting there.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.890
You've done research and you're
sitting there with the blank page

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.630
and then that's the
terrifying part for me.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.590
Like I -- [scared noises]

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.710
&gt;&gt; I just find things kind
of pop up out of research.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.760
Just -- it's always --

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.450
if you actually look at
something it's always stranger

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.900
than the version that you
imagined if you kind of try

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.010
and make it up out of whole cloth.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.860
You go for the easiest
version of it.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:08.750
And the world is always more
peculiar than we dream of.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:13.550
And I have it -- I mean what I get
out of research isn't so much kind

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:18.390
of lists of facts and dates,
but tone and odd details

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:23.830
that to me are then
really useful as a sort

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.780
of prosthetic for m imagination.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.240 position:56%
I mean I can be very at sea if I
haven't got something to hold on to,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.190
but even if it's a quite weird
little inconsequential thing I can

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.120
then spin something out of that.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.510
&gt;&gt; There were a lot of times
when I was reading "White Tears,"

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.130
especially in the earlier passages
talking about Carter and Seth,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.620 position:56%
the two college kids at their school
in upstate New York, when I thought,

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.600
"I probably knew those guys."

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.020
[laughing] They rang so
true to me even though,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.880
you know I was a little bit
before them and in Western Mass

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.640
but not upstate New York, but
that's an -- they were archetypal.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.940
Like I thought that --

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they turn up in
British versions too believe me.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.870
[laughing]

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.830
&gt;&gt; I actually -- I feel like --
I mean I had this written down

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.260
and I was sort of wondering whether
or not it was a corny question,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.480
but we've kind of gotten
there already,

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.260 position:56%
you know the old [laughter] trope of
writing what you know and how much

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.080
of the author is in the books,
especially with "A Separation,"

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.920
which is [laughing]
about a troubled marriage

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.450
and a woman who's very distant from
her emotions and from her marriage

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.210
and from her husband
who's now missing.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.240
&gt;&gt; The cattish English husband.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.540
[laughter]

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.920
&gt;&gt; He does seem kind
of -- [laughter]

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.220
&gt;&gt; Non-fiction writer.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.520
[laughter]

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.820
&gt;&gt; I would call him a prat.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.830
&gt;&gt; All right, that's
the fig leaf is it?

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.130
[laughing]

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughing] So how much

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.170
of your own marriage leaches
through into your work?

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.470
I mean --

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:51.510
&gt;&gt; I think I'm going to
give that one to you there.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.810
[laughter]

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.110
&gt;&gt; I mean --

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.410
&gt;&gt; Misses missing husband.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.710
[laughing]

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.010
&gt;&gt; My German editor when I had --
when I saw him he said that he --

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.540
he kind of said, you know whatever
about your book and then he said,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.290
"Yeah, you know it really is the
dream of every person that you wake

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.140
up and your partner
has disappeared."

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.930
And I thought, [laughter] that's
a very German thing to say.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.230
I mean I think --

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.500
&gt;&gt; That's a little more revealing
than he intended I think.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.800
[laughter]

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.100
&gt;&gt; I mean I think it goes back
to what I was saying earlier is

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.850
that I mean Hari is a
brilliant writer of writing

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.680
with the present moment and I think
I'm a writer who takes much longer

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.070
to process what is
happening to me and around me.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:27.620
And I mean it's --
I wrote the book --

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.540
I don't know what I
thought it was about.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.100
Maybe I thought it
was about marriage.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.830
And then I realized after I'd
written it that it was a book

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.120
about grief and that it was a book
about my father in a lot of ways

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.110
who died now eight years ago.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.970 position:56%
And some part of me is still kind of
worrying over that and I mean then

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.070
when I started thinking about it I
realized the germ of the book was

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.250
in a visit I made to Euro De Menos,
[phonetic] which is a village

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.230
in the book in Greece in
the Southern Peloponnese.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:59.130
And I went there after my dad --
my dad had been sick with cancer

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.830
for quite a long time and
it was there that I accepted

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.740
that he was going to
die and quite soon.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.480
And so that tone of grief colored
everything about that landscape

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.970
and the book came out
of that landscape.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.040 position:56%
So when you look at the book there's
actually not that much I don't think

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.840
about marriage, but there
is a great deal about grief

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.240
and about not being
able to process grief.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.530
So I think the distance
that the narrator has

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:28.460
from her emotions is really a
kind of trauma and a kind of --

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.720
you know it's like what --
because we have children,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.160
if they fall over you're not
worried if they're crying

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.490
because you know they're
kind of okay.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.390
It's really that kind of moment
when they're completely still

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.640
and no emotion is there that you
worry about if they're okay or not.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.170
And so in a way the quandary for my
narrator is that she can never get

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.820
to the point of actually
expressing her grief.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.120
So --

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's -- I'm used to
reading things that resolve neatly

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.570 position:56%
at the end so it was very [laughing]
interesting for me to get to the end

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.250
of "A Separation" and go, [thinking
noise] "This is closer to real life

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.550
than I'm comfortable with."

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.850
[laughter]

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:05.730
&gt;&gt; I mean that's the kind of thing
that is so funny about a novel is

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.780 position:56%
that you know we pretend that these
narratives have a beginning, middle,

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.180
and end and they don't
and they're ongoing.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.810
And I mean even in my experience of
writing it, it was that something

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.650
that had happened to me almost a
decade ago continues to operate

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.610
on my psyche in some way
and it keeps coming back

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.910
and it keeps coming back.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.640
And I think that was something I
wanted to try to get in the book,

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.660
which is that these
narratives are open-ended.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.960
They do carry on.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.260
They return in unexpected ways.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.640 position:56%
I mean that's also a kind of theme
in your -- in "White Tears" as well.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.440
&gt;&gt; A kind of open-endedness of --

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the whole [inaudible]
in these things we try

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.240
to pretend they've been
resolved and this is all done,

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.110
but they don't resolve like that.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.410
They come back.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.710
[musing noise]

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.490
&gt;&gt; I mean ghost stories -- I
mean the book -- the last --

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.780
this book is kind of a -- it's a
ghost story among other things.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.040
And they are always about
something that has been --

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.380 position:56%
people have attempted to prematurely
bury, prematurely suppress,

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:06.410
and it has come back up unbidden
to haunt the present day.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:12.490
And I mean that for me was a way
that I could speak about race

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:18.280 position:56%
and history and the kind of troubled
history of that, especially here.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.510
It seemed like a useful
frame for that.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.370
&gt;&gt; That one -- my expertise
is kind of in genre fiction

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.930
and I always sort of -- the
thing that I came up with is

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.230
that people read genre fiction

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.960
because real life doesn't
have narrative.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.110
[laughing] You know genre fiction
tends to have a story arc, a quest,

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:38.000
it may not have a happy ending
but it generally has an ending.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.680
And so it was very interesting
for me to sort of break away

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.960
from that [laughing] and be in
a much more uncertain space.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.380
&gt;&gt; Well I like -- I mean
I'm interested in that --

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.510
the structures, that genre fiction
does give to our experiences.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.740 position:56%
You say there's something comforting
about a story that resolves,

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.520
there's something comforting
about things

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.700
that will proceed along
a familiar path.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.650
And I suppose the -- you know
what interests me is the way

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:10.030 position:56%
that we sometimes try and frame our
lives like that and that they are --

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.130
and that genre does offer
kind of clues to things

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.600
that are quite profound about
human experience, but there's --

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.040
there is never that neat resolution

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.650
and things bleed away
from those structures.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.580
And so I mean I'm quite interested
in the point where genre sort

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.380
of breaks down and I think you can
still have the fun and the pleasure

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.420
of things that are shaped like
stories, but not necessarily need

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.840
to tie them up in neat little bows.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.790
&gt;&gt; I want to sort of go back
to the idea of both books

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.360
to a certain extent being
about grief and haunting

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.490
and these sort of similar ideas.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.180 position:56%
Do you ever come up with an idea
while you're writing and think, "Oh,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.480
my husband could do this better"?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.780
Or, "My wife could do this better."

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.440
[laughing] Is there kind of --
do you know each other's -- ?

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean we know -- we also --

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.800
we do collaborate on
doing some screen writing

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.980
and so that's the space
in which we can actually,

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.970
you know full-bloodedly kind
of share our proclivities.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.570
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Proclivities;
that's such a good word.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.240
&gt;&gt;And I mean -- I'm trying
to think of there was --

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.200
I mean if I could give a
straight answer to that question.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.080
I mean there must be
situations that --

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.170
I mean I know there's material
that I think of as yours and a tone

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.470
that I think of as yours.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I mean I feel like the novels are
so personal that it -- I don't --

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.830
I mean maybe in the future, but --

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.280
&gt;&gt; But I mean you can
only write like yourself.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.730
It's like I mean because I admire
Katie's work I have inevitably been

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:46.190
influenced to try to steer some
of my tone towards something

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:51.750
that feels more like hers and
it comes out sounding like me.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.720
And -- [laughter] which
is -- maybe that's good.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.020
[laughter]

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.430
&gt;&gt; Now that I think about that it
was a really editorial question

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.190
because half of my job is
thinking, "Okay, I have this writer

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.470
and this book would be a great
book for them to review."

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:05.770
[laughing] You know?

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.330
&gt;&gt; I mean it was -- I was --

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:12.460
we wrote something together for a
publication called "Triple Canopy"

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.390
and it was an idea that I'd had
and I kept trying to get Hari

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.890
to write it because it felt like
something he would do really well

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.370 position:56%
and it was a kind of -- I mean I
guess it's a kind of satirical piece

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.480
about the privatization of
language and the future.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.010
And that -- I think I ended
up writing the bulk of it

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.630
because I was commissioned
to do it the performance,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.570
but then we collaborated on it.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.120
&gt;&gt; Well then Katie doesn't
like to -- I mean I --

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.710
Yeah, you didn't want to perform
your piece so I stood on a stage

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.350
and performed her piece and then
took questions in the character

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.620
and I inevitably sort of
added material and then

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.580
that was transcribed
and we wrote that up.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.060
And so by the end of
it there was a --

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.520
&gt;&gt; It was very mixed together.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.760
&gt;&gt; It was very hard to say -- yeah.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.840
&gt;&gt; That sounds almost like that
experience itself could be fodder

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.440
for some kind of collaborative
[laughing] writing.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.760
&gt;&gt; It was quite a good
form actually I thought.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.060
It was --

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.360
&gt;&gt; It was.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was useful.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.390
&gt;&gt; One thing that I always
wonder about with writers

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.140
who have children is --

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.940
and sometimes I feel bad
for writers' kids honestly,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.240
[laughing] naming no names.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.940
But they sometimes end up in their
parents' fiction, whether they want

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.380
to be there or not and I know
that you have two small children.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.140
How are you thinking about that?

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.120
&gt;&gt; It hasn't really
come up at the moment.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.030
I mean my main experience is that
there are things that I wrote

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.140
about before I was a father
that I wouldn't write about now.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.250
I mean I wrote a book about a
family whose little boy disappears

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.630
and I could not do that now.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.930
I just couldn't live inside that.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.230
&gt;&gt; That was "Gods Without Men"?

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.380
&gt;&gt; Yes. And I wouldn't be
able to write that book now

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.440
because I think I would find it
just too troubling to have to be

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.320
in that space all the time.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.840
I mean there's actually
a lot of TV shows

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.370
about missing children
that I can't watch now.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.600
But in terms of sort of violating
their privacy in the future;

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.260
I won't do it intentionally.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.880
[laughter] I pledge that.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.180
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Intentionally.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.480
You're on tape now.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.780
I'm just saying.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah I know.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.590
I'm prepared to [laughing]
sign my name to that.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.570
But I'm always slightly
suspicious of writers

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.660
who assert their writerly
privilege in order

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.200
to trash their families' lives.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:32.320
You know I think it takes a great
amount of ego about the value

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.710
of your own work to do that
in an unselfconscious way.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:45.670
And I mean the situation hasn't
arisen, but I mean I feel

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.820
that I would want to
respect their rights I mean

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:54.810 position:56%
to not be anatomized before they're
able to make their own personalities

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.670
and their own lives and their
own ways of defining themselves.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:58.970
I don't know.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.830
Would you write about the kids.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.260
Is that what thinking?

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.560
&gt;&gt; [laughing] No, because I mean --

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.760
like I said, because I had
this incredible delay and I end

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.780
up writing about things
10 years later.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.550
I just can't even imagine
writing about them at all.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.750
I mean I don't think I've written
a character who has children.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.050
Is that right?

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.760
[laughter] I don't know
why I'm asking you.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.060
Sorry! [laughing]

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.500
&gt;&gt; Well, you should ask me
because I've been cramming

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.210
in your books all week but
I can't -- I don't think so.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.510
[laughing]

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.250
&gt;&gt; I don't think I have.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.010
So I don't know what
that would look like.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.920
I don't know what that
would look like.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean we're far from that.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.650
I mean we haven't even invaded
each other's privacy properly yet.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:39.950
[laughter]

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.250
&gt;&gt; I think we should --
we'll exhaust each other.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.550
&gt;&gt; Work on that?

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.850
Right. I just -- maybe I'm
projecting because I feel

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:45.910
like if I was a writer I would
not be able to resist a well

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.150
of material living in
my own house, you know?

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.450
[laughing]

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.750
&gt;&gt; But I think --

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.050
&gt;&gt; It's funny.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.350
It doesn't feel like
material does it?

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.650
&gt;&gt; It doesn't.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:55.950
&gt;&gt; It just doesn't and I would --
I mean I think -- and it's also --

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:00.160
I think it's interesting how
material ends up in your work.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.110
I mean I think one -- there's
a kind of element in my book

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.940
where the central character doesn't
really know what her role is.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.570 position:56%
She's separated from her husband
but they're not officially separated

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.280
so she's neither wife nor ex-wife.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.500
And I think part of that came out
because I had just become a mother

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.000
and I was trying to figure out
what that meant and what that meant

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.960
for my own identity, but that's
how it turns up in the book.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.270
It's not a kind of mother
who is stressed out about --

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.070
you know it comes out
for me in lots of --

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.110
&gt;&gt; It's that sort of
transposition that's the thing.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.540
I mean I think if --
you know if you --

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.530 position:56%
I mean we're obviously always
taking from our real lives and it --

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.160
all the time but you transpose --

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.740
you don't use the furniture
in a way.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.360
You use something about the tone.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.170
You use something -- some
sort of emotional structure

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.500 position:56%
that you're in or you've discovered.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.930
And it -- and that way you can
completely mine all your friends

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.760
and family and acquaintances
[laughter] all the time

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.300
without actually doing the
thing that people find troubling

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.730
and offensive, which
is being sort of penned

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.860
to the board like specimens.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.530
&gt;&gt; Although we did have
-- a friend of ours has --

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.630
her father is a remarkable
character and both

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.940
of us have always felt he
would be a remarkable character

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.710
and we've both been tempted
but have not done it.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:15.000
And then we found out that
another writer is doing --

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.750
[laughter] is currently --

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.030
&gt;&gt; Is shadowing him and -- yeah.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.310
It's extraordinary.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.300
&gt;&gt; I always think like I would
be sort of honored if one

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.280
of my writer friends put me
in a book, but that's just

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.200
because a friend of mine got
written into a "Doctor Who" novel

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.580
as a villain and I've always
been really jealous about that.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.880
[laughing]

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.180
&gt;&gt; That is something
to be jealous of.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.480
&gt;&gt; Speaking of British culture.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.170 position:56%
So I wanted to ask just one more
sort of general question about being

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.700
in a -- you described -- there's
a line in a "Jezebel" interview

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.570
where you described marriage as
"an insane, deranged, wager."

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.870
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.170
&gt;&gt; Is that [laughing]
marriage in general?

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:52.470
Marriage as two writers?

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.770
I mean what -- ?

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.070
Elaborate on that.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:57.670
I mean I think it's
-- I think it is --

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.340
I mean it's partially in
reference to something

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.210
that Alan Badire [phonetic]
wrote, this French philosopher.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.240
He'd written this book about
how increasingly love is

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.540
being metricated.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.890
So you have online dating, matching
profiles, and all the risk is kind

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:12.330
of being drained away from love.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.630
&gt;&gt; It's turned into shopping.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:14.930
&gt;&gt; And it's turned into shopping.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.600
And in fact love should feel
like a tremendous leap of faith

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.810
and there's no reason
to go into a marriage

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.400
if you think you're just going
to coast along to the end.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.870
And I think that's true.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:27.270
And I think I'm a romantic
in that sense that there has

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.030 position:56%
to be the sense that you're doing --

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.260
&gt;&gt; That's the meaning
of marriage isn't it?

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.510 position:56%
You stand up and you take this risk.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.410
You say, "I'm going to
try and love you forever."

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.350
And that's -- how can you say that?

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:41.330 position:56%
You can't say that but the very fact
that you're going to try is this --

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.870
yeah, is this leap of -- a
leap of faith and that sort

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.580
of gives it meaning and that's
what gives it value as a ritual,

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:54.390
as a pledge, and it makes it
different from this kind of --

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.790
yeah, quasi shopping
like dating culture.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:01.130
The -- we all have participated in.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think that was what
I probably meant when I said that.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.660
&gt;&gt; [laughing] So risk -- it's
almost like writing a book

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.960
and launching it into the world.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.260
[laughter] We -- I think if --

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.600
I'm being informed that we
have about 10 minutes left.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.840
So it might be time to have some
questions from the audience.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.580
I can't see you out there
because the lights are so bright,

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.950
but we have two microphones
here on either side.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:26.800
So if anybody has questions
and they want to step up here.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.100
Don't be afraid.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.400
We don't bite.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.940
[laughter] I mean, I
don't know, I don't.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.240
[laughter]

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.540
&gt;&gt; They're just leaving.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.840
[laughter]

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.140
&gt;&gt; Oh, hi Meadowlake.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.440
[phonetic] [laughing]

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.460
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Petra.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.680
I'm interested, since Petra
brought up your children,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.030
you are both from immigrant
families.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.740
You're -- Hari I know
you're British/Asian,

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.390
now you live in America
-- Japanese American.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.510
What is the culture that you --

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.580
how do you bring up your
children in that milieu?

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:03.550
And how does that affect the
language that they'll use?

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.090
I particularly think of
British-English because I'm

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.960
from there too and my children
still give me a hard time

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.390
about some of the words that I use.

00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:14.640
But it's a very interesting
mix and I think as writers,

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.240
obviously you think
about words all the time.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:21.330
I'm curious as to how you think
about the words your children --

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.980
with such an interesting
background from both of you.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.630
&gt;&gt; We are -- I mean we've -- both
of us have had to kind of break

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.700
from our parents' first language.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.600
I mean I wasn't brought
up speaking Hindi.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.760 position:56%
My mom's English and my dad's Indian

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.480
and they took the decision
not to speak Hindi to me.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.440
Or my father's decision not to
speak Hindi to me and my brother

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.980
in the home in order not to
sort of alienate my mother.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.960
And that means that
I don't have that --

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:59.510 position:56%
I mean when I go to see my family in
India and they would naturally speak

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:04.410
in a kind of -- in a flowing in
and out of Hindi and English.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.510
They just skew towards English
when I need to be included

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.170
and then skew away again.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.370
[laughter] And you -- I
mean your brother is fluent

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.670
in Japanese, your older brother.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.210
But you were born over here and --

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.520
&gt;&gt; My brother's fluent in Japanese.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.820
He was born in Japan.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.570
I was brought up in California
and it was a bilingual household

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.280
until I was five and then
I went to kindergarten

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.440
and my English was behind.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.910
And so my parents were advised

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.600
to stop speaking Japanese
to me in the home.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.880
Which is now -- you would
never say that to a family.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.820
So my Japanese is poor at best.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.680
And it's something I think
I really, deeply regret.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.770
And when I look at our
children, who should maybe --

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.070
&gt;&gt; Be trilingual.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.370
&gt;&gt; Should be [laughing]
trilingual but will be,

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:49.040
you know very monolingual
unless we do something about it.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.610
So I think now as they're
getting older I do kind of think.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.630
&gt;&gt; I mean what they do
have is a sense of culture

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.770
as something multiple and something
that's constructed within a family.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.820
I mean I think that's something.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.840
I mean they have this --
the grandparents in London

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.400 position:56%
and there's a family in North India,
there's the family in California.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.630
There's family in Japan.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.840 position:56%
And so they know that -- in a way --

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.780
that we've taken this
decision to be together

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.870 position:56%
and to make our little family, which
is not shaped like other families.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.850
So I think they understand
that each -- in that way --

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.070
that each family does do that work.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.860
Because even if you're all from
the same place and you don't move

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.780
around you are still making
a culture as a family unit.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.780
So I mean how that will
play out we don't know,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.620 position:56%
but I mean we have these
conversations about how to keep them

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.960
in touch with aspects of
our cultures that we want

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.570
to keep hold of, much the same
as all immigrants do have.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm interested in
ultimately how it's going

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.800
to affect the English that --

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.100
&gt;&gt; You mean it's --

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.400
&gt;&gt; English?

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.700
Yeah, I mean they have some --

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.750
&gt;&gt; Our son's definitely got a
funny little English accent going

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.520
on in there in the middle of his --

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Which I can't --

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the influence
of school is so strong

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.110
that once they're really school
age I think it tends to fall away.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:10.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean that's what we will
see that once he's got a peer group

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.790
in grade school then that
will presumably be his primary

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.060
cultural influence.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.660
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:20.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.260
We have time for one more question

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.040
if anybody wants to
step up to the mic.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.420
Anybody out there?

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.720
[laughter] Gosh, you
guys are so quiet.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.020
Here comes somebody.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.320
Thank you.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.620
[laughing]

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.920
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.220
That was really helpful.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.070
I was wondering, you said that
there was a set of shared concerns

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.140
that you have even though obviously
your work is really different

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.670
aesthetically and tonally,
stylistically.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:53.260
And maybe you could talk about what
those set of shared concerns are.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.560
&gt;&gt; [laughter] What a question!

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.860
&gt;&gt; Or not.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.160
&gt;&gt; What do we share?

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.320
&gt;&gt; What else could you do
with this five minutes?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I mean I think both of us have --

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.050
for biographical reasons
that we've outlined here --

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.410
we've got a sense of
not being in the center

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.940
of the worlds that we occupy.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.040
I mean I have habitually
written narrators and characters

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.840
who are somehow at an
angle to the situation

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.580
that they find themselves in.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:26.860 position:56%
And that perspective I think we both
share because we have moved around

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:32.160
and we have had similar sets
of experiences in some way,

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.520
even though -- I mean our --

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.410
the actual places we grew up
in have been more different.

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.710
&gt;&gt; I mean I feel --

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.010
&gt;&gt; And so that -- yeah, go on.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think maybe there's
an interest in trying to work

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.940
out how to play with narrative.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.890
So I mean I think as we
mentioned a little bit,

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:55.550
my book kind of avoids this strong
finish I guess you might say.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:59.010
And then Hari -- I mean this
book is -- it almost is very,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.290
very propulsive and it's
almost the opposite direction,

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:05.120 position:56%
but I think it's the same concern
in a funny way about narrative drive

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.110
and how you subvert
a narrative drive

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.550
or you exploit a narrative drive.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.480
And certainly in "Gods without
Men" you were interested

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.310
in doing something, which was --
which is a book that is really told

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:17.520
in shards and it has many, many
narratives about how you play

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.540
around with this idea of a linear
-- of a kind of more conventional,

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.440
linear narrative and you do
something different with it.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.840
So I think we also have --
they kind of express themselves

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.800
in very different ways
but I think we both,

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.670
for example would have an interest
in form and narrative maybe.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:35.040 position:56%
Do we have any -- we must have more.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.690
[laughter] We must have more.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.090
&gt;&gt; List of shared stuff.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:44.890
&gt;&gt; Well I just have one
more quick question for --

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:46.190
we have like two minutes left.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.950
Do you have any advice?

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.910
Any pearls of wisdom for
people trying to make a go

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.940
of a two writer household?

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.490
&gt;&gt; I would say don't mistake
the bedroom for the desk.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.790
[laughter]

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:01.200
&gt;&gt; Sage advice.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:06.700
&gt;&gt; The -- [laughing] and by that I
sort of mean you know you want love

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:12.150
and support and you want to be
absolutely secure with your partner

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.370
and you want a reader and a
critic to tell you the truth

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:19.890
about your work and those are two
very separate sorts of things.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:24.650
And don't -- you know don't
mistake somebody saying,

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.340
"That's not working"
for "I don't love you."

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.930
[laughing]

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:36.170
&gt;&gt; I think it's really important
to be willing to continue

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.100
to give your partner the space
to step away from the family

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.620
to do the work, which sometimes
they do need to be able to do.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.830
And I think you have to
respect that and it's hard.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:50.990 position:56%
It's hard to kind of say, "Yes, take
those two weeks to go away and work

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:53.190
on your book and I'll be here
[laughing] with the kids," but --

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.780
and we've both done
that for each other.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.360
But it's really important
and it's important --

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.500
I mean you know what it takes to
write a book and you know when some

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.130
of it -- and you also have
to be sensitive sometimes --

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.930 position:56%
you know one or the other of us will
need that time more than the other

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:09.750
and then you need to give
it to that person and trust

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.290
that it'll come full circle
and when you're in that place

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.870
and you're writing that you
will also be given that time.

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:19.310
I mean I think it's dangerous to
fall into a kind of score keeping

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.990
of hours, of who has
more time to work.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.500
But just to kind of -- you
know we're all trying to get

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.260
to the same place, which
is to finish our books.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.560
So --

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.860
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you
both very, very much.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.460
[applause]

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.260
&gt;&gt; And thank you!

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.680
[ Applause ]

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.490
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
