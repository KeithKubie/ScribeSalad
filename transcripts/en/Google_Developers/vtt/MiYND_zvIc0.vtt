&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back
Vic Gundotra.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.259
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Well, good morning.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.119
Welcome, everybody.
It's great to see this room jam-packed so

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.349
early in the morning. I hope you guys had
a great time yesterday and a good time at

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.689
the party last night.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.690
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know, it wasn't just us
that had a great time yesterday. We had over

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.690
60,000 simultaneous viewers watch our show.
That's pretty staggering. Because it is a

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.680
global audience, throughout the day, that
number increased, and total viewers yesterday

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.090
was just topping out over 600,000 people.
[ Applause ]

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.250
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And so --
[ Applause ]

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.900
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: -- we can't thank you all
enough for the global enthusiasm that you've

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.350
expressed for the hard work that we're doing.
It's very, very gratifying.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.610
I hope all of you also enjoyed your Samsung
tablets.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.160
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Are these great or what?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.180
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: One thing you might have missed

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.690
was that, in addition to getting this tablet,
you also received this voucher. This voucher

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.690
we will actually deliver on today at 3:30.
And what you'll get is one of these. This

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.610
is just absolutely amazing. It's a Verizon
Wi-Fi hot spot, provided through our partnership

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.330
with Verizon and Samsung. On typical 4G areas,
you'll get up to 20 megabits per second down,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.409
ten megabits per second up. Typical areas
do not include this room.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.220
But I got about seven megabits down a few
moments ago in the room. But like we said,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.630
please turn off your Wi-Fi hot spots for the
sake of the presentation.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.869
But I hope you enjoy this as well. This is
really, really great. Thank you to Verizon

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.869
and Samsung for that.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.660
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let's turn our attention to
the keynote this morning.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.660
You know, from its very inception, this show
has always been about the most important platform

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.099
of our era. It's a platform that's controlled
by none of us, so it's the only platform that

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.420
truly belongs to all of us. And that is the
open Web. And the Chrome team has set the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.730
pace of moving the Web forward along the dimensions
of speed, along the dimensions of security,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.480
and along the dimensions of capability.
To hear what's next in the incredibly exciting

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.920
story of Chrome, I'd like to introduce my
friend and senior vice president of Chrome,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.920
Sundar Pichai.
[ Applause ]

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.580
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thank you. It's very exciting
to be here.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.550
Welcome to the Chrome keynote.
We have a lot to cover. We are here to talk

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.550
about the open Web, the amazing platform it
is, the pace at which it's making progress.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.290
Chrome is the way we manifest the Web to our
users. So we want to give you an update on

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.290
Chrome, Chrome Web Store, and finally Chrome
OS. Lots to cover. Let's get started.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.730
Exactly a year ago, at Google I/O, we were
here on this stage. We were incredibly excited

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.849
at the momentum behind Chrome. We announced
that over 70 million active users were using

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.690
Chrome as their main browser. So it's been
a year since then. And we are back at I/O.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.690
So let's take a look at where we are now.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.440
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: So we have more than doubled
in the last year. And we couldn't be more

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.470
pleased.
Many of you in this audience were some of

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.409
the earliest adopters of Chrome and helped
get the word around. So thank you.

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.190
If -- let's take a look at what's happened
since last I/O to now, within the last year.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.190
So let's zoom in between the 70 to 160 million.
If you take a look, it's actually a bit tough

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.130
to remember, but last year, we were at Chrome
4. So we had just launched the stable version

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.740
of Chrome 4. And if you remember, it was available
only for Windows. We didn't have Mac and Linux

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.940
versions. In fact, that's what most of the
team was working on, getting Chrome to be

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.020
an equal citizen on the two other great platforms.
It was a lot of work. It consumed a lot of

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.020
resources. And with Chrome 6, we brought Chrome
to the Mac and Linux stable channel.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.990
At that point, we made an important decision
as a team. We decided to switch to six-week

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.440
release cycles. We wanted to make sure version
numbers shouldn't matter, that we continually

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.590
push features out, both to users, and more
importantly, to developers, as and when HTML5

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.770
APIs became ready.
So let's take a look.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.940
As you can see, in the last 12 months, we've
been releasing every six weeks. And this week,

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.070
we just launched Chrome 12 in beta. So we've
had our eight versions of Chrome just in the

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.560
last year alone. The pace at which we are
pushing the Web platform forward is amazing.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.320
There are a whole slough of APIs here. We'll
talk about them in more detail.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.440
But we have focused on many other things as
well. Speed is something near and dear to

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.000
our heart. We have had over 20X speed and
JavaScript improvement last year alone. We

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.639
have pushed security really hard. Chrome has
a great sandbox. In addition, last year for

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.509
the first time, we have sandbox plug-ins.
PDF is fully sandboxed, and Flash is partially

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.520
sandboxed, and we are working on completing
the sandbox. So the progress has been great.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.870
The good news is, we are not the only ones
pushing the platform forward. All browser

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.870
vendors, modern browsers, are investing in
HTML5. So if you take a look at 2008, this

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.949
was just under way. Chrome had launched. People
were beginning to add HTML5 APIs. We spoke

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:36.949
about it in I/O. And if you forward to now,
the progress is amazing. All modern browsers

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.949
have these APIs implemented, so that you as
developers can rely on these APIs when you

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.550
write applications and make sure you can deliver
a consistent experience.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.360
So let's take a look at some of the upcoming
APIs which we are excited about in Chrome.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:58.360
To do that, I want to invite Ian Ellison-Taylor,
who's the director of the Web Platform team

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.539
in Chrome.
[ Applause ]

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:07.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: It's a long way up.
Thanks, everybody.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.650
What Sundar showed on an earlier slide, there's
been an amazing number of new features added

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:20.000
to the Web platform just over the last year
alone. And I think taken together, they add

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.430
up to an amazing new set of capabilities for
Web applications running in modern browsers.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.470
I think it's amazing the kinds of things that
you can build today.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:36.050
Now, of course, we're not resting on our laurels
at Google, and with hundreds, literally hundreds,

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:42.220
of other collaborators, new features are being
added all the time. It's a genuine community

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.560
effort on everyone's part.
So I wanted to take a minute or two today

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.599
and just run you through some of those features.
And I'm going to start with I think one of

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:55.669
my favorite features, one of the new and cool
features, and that's speech.

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:01.639
So let me run through that here. I can give
you a quick demo.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:07.020
So for the purposes of the demo, I'm going
to use this application that's a fantastic

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.870
application from the Web Store. It's called
Clicker. It lets you discover and view some

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:17.870
of the best online Web video. So imagine for
a second I'm an engineer at Clicker, and I

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.410
want to add speech to this.
So here's the little search panel inside Clicker.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.110
And I want to add some speech support.
So there's lots of ways to do it. One of the

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.729
easiest ways just to try things out is to
use the developer tools that are built into

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:38.639
Chrome.
So I'm going to right-click on inspect element.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:42.539
And then this brings up the developer tools
that you can see in the bottom panel.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:47.819
Now, the developer tools in Chrome have come
a really long way in the last year or so.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:51.800
I think many of these features, I think, are
state of the art. So I very much encourage

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.819
you to check out the developer tools session
a little bit later.

00:08:54.819 --> 00:09:01.699
I'm just going to focus on a couple of quick
features here. So I'm just going to right-click

00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:08.699
and add attribute. And I'm going to add the
X-Webkit -- oops -- how about if I type properly

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.689
-- speech attribute. And I can close the dev
tools.

00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:21.439
And so sort of as if by magic, there's -- a
little microphone appeared. Now, I haven't

00:09:21.439 --> 00:09:25.429
done anything else. I haven't added any event
handlers or written any code. I just added

00:09:25.429 --> 00:09:31.019
that one attribute to this application. It
wasn't originally designed with speech in

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:38.019
mind. That's adding the attribute.
Let's give it a try and see if this works.

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:42.929
Now, I should caveat that one of the first
rules of keynotes is never, ever do live speech

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:49.660
demos. The acoustics in the room make it really
hard. But we're going to try anyway. And I

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.300
figure if it goes absolutely horribly wrong,
it will at least be entertaining. So let's

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.220
see what happens.
So one of my favorite shows right now is called

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.769
bandwagon. It stars Emma Caufield from Buffy
and a host of other movies. I'm going to search

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:09.769
for that and see what happens. Let's try this.
Emma Caufield.

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:13.359
Oh, it works. My gosh. That's -- you have
no idea --

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:18.189
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: -- how -- I am genuinely

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:22.279
surprised.
I'm genuinely surprised that works. And here's

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:27.399
Bandwagon, the show. And I can click through
and watch it very quickly.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:33.230
Let's close that.
So that's fantastic, it did well with my bizarre

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:38.959
English, slash, American accent.
So as you can imagine, at Google, we're adding

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:42.819
speech support to a lot of our applications
as well. What I want to show you quickly and

00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:46.929
one of my favorites is translate. This is
something -- I like showing this because I

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:51.879
genuinely need this. I am terrible at foreign
languages. And so this is a great -- it's

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:55.149
a great way to do quick translation. And you
can try this out.

00:10:55.149 --> 00:11:01.449
I'm going to do -- I'm going to do a translation
from English into Chinese. I think Chinese

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:07.040
is the language I am least likely to learn
in the future. So this is a good test.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.019
Like I said, this has already been modified,
so it has the little microphone icon down

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:14.239
here.
Welcome to San Francisco.

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:21.239
It works. Amazing.
All right. So it's -- it's taken the speech,

00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:27.329
translated to Chinese. We can listen to this
now. (Chinese).

00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:32.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: One more time. (Chinese).
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: So I don't actually

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:38.179
speak Chinese. So I have no idea if that was
actually correct. Does anyone -- people are

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:40.089
nodding. Yes, all right.
[ Applause ]

00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:45.370
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: I was afraid there for
a second I was going to insult someone's mother.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.889
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: But I think we did okay.

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:54.889
All right. So that's, just quickly, speech.
New features are fantastic, of course. But

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.999
performance is a feature, too.
And making things fast has been one of the

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:04.600
sort of fundamental founding criteria of Chrome
since the very early days.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.129
So you can see behind me, this is a little
chart of JavaScript performance. And back

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:15.309
in -- this is back in 2008 -- and this is
the best of. This isn't just Chrome. This

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:19.559
is what was the state of the art of JavaScript
back in the day. And if you look at what's

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:26.559
happened since then up to Chrome 11, the progress
on JavaScript has been truly phenomenal. It's

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:32.600
fundamentally changed the kinds of applications
you can build on the Web.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.999
And, you know, in some respects, I'm kind
of hoping I never share this chart again.

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:42.720
We're going to continue to work on JavaScript
performance, of course. But the good news

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.239
here is, really, it's no longer the bottleneck
that it used to be. And so we're beginning

00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:52.899
to focus more of our attention on some of
the areas -- other areas of the Web platform,

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:56.939
where there are more opportunities to make
performance improvements.

00:12:56.939 --> 00:13:02.480
Now, one of those areas, one of the key areas
is, of course, graphics. And, specifically,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.179
GPU acceleration, using the GPU to hardware-accelerate
graphics and get the best out of the performance

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:14.179
of your modern laptop as well as improve battery
life.

00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:18.629
One of the easiest ways to do that is using
CSS transforms. I know many of you will have

00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:23.929
been using CSS for a while now. It's super
easy to do. And it's in beta right now in

00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:29.100
Chrome, where those are now GPU-accelerated.
So you don't have to do anything to your applications.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.119
Just keep using CSS and things will just get
magically faster.

00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:38.670
CSS is great.
Now, a level up in terms of capability is

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:45.519
Canvas 2D. Canvas 2D is particularly important,
because it's used for a lot of games. And

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:51.239
in games, one of the most common operations
that you want to do and have be fast is sprite

00:13:51.239 --> 00:13:56.379
animation, moving lots of little images or
animated characters zipping around.

00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:59.779
So that's one of the areas that we've been
focusing on heavily in the latest releases

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:03.509
of Chrome.
So I'm going to give you a quick demo of what

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:08.529
that looks like in Chrome.
So for the purposes of the demo, I'm going

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:15.529
to use the famous, some would say infamous,
fishy demo, courtesy of Microsoft.

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:23.049
So this is Chrome, running in software. It
does pretty well with 20 fish. But if you

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:29.579
go up to, say, like, 100 or let's go to 500,
you can see there the frame rate's dropping.

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:36.579
We're under ten frames a second.
So here is a new version of Chrome with GPU

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:43.689
acceleration turned on for the canvas. You
can see here at 100 frames a second, 100 fish,

00:14:43.689 --> 00:14:50.689
still doing 60 frames a second.
Go up to 250. Keep going. 500.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.410
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Thank you, thank you.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.199
You can applause.
It's not until we get to 1,000 fish where

00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:08.199
you start to see it going below 60 frames
per second. So that's basically a 10x improvement

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:12.579
over where we were. So I think that's phenomenal.
And again, you didn't have to do anything.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:18.739
Things just got faster. So definitely try
out Canvas 2D. I think that's phenomenal.

00:15:18.739 --> 00:15:22.790
But wait, there's more!
So doing this kind of sprite animation is

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.350
actually something that WebGL is extremely
good at doing.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:34.350
So our friends at Mozilla actually took the
fishy demo and ported it over to use WebGL.

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:39.939
So let's look at a thousand fish straight
away. Let's just jump to that.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.639
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: So that's too easy.

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:47.499
2,000. Still too easy.
10,000. All right.

00:15:47.499 --> 00:15:53.339
So now we are up to 10,000 or so Sprites and
still doing around 30 frames per second.

00:15:53.339 --> 00:16:00.339
So this is another 10x performance improvement,
and it's very easy to move that kind of sprite

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:04.879
animation over to WebGL.
It's a fantastic way to take advantage of

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:11.879
the performance of a modern laptop. I think
this is pretty phenomenal.

00:16:12.059 --> 00:16:16.109
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Yes, authentication.

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:20.879
Applause, applause.
So do definitely give that a try.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:25.359
Now, WebGL can be used for lots of things.
It's not just good for sprite animation. It

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:31.160
is full 3D. So just briefly, I wanted to show
an example of sort of a more traditional 3D

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.040
application.
So this is Tinkercad that lets you do a little

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:42.040
bit of design on a surface here, and I am
just going to quickly draw some shapes. And

00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:48.509
I have to apologize for not being a designer,
and, you know, not having any artistic ability

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:51.379
whatsoever. But I can build a little model
surface and I can quickly punch holes in the

00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:58.379
surface. Let's do that. So I can do some solid
geometry modeling. This is running in the

00:16:59.989 --> 00:17:03.579
browser, and I am zoom in and out. And the
performance of this is absolutely fantastic.

00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:07.689
I didn't have to install any plug-ins. This
is just using the inherent 3D support that's

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:12.689
in the browser now.
So I think this is pretty cool. And Tinkercad

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:18.189
in particular I think is fantastic. You should
try this out because it lets you export these

00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:23.149
3D models and send them to a 3D printer. So
you can actually build the things that you

00:17:23.149 --> 00:17:30.149
design, which I think is absolutely phenomenal.
So that's it for WebGL and some features.

00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:37.580
So those are great features, and of course
there's going to be lots more to come. There's

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:43.480
hundreds of features coming in a build near
you. So stay tuned for upcoming releases.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.470
And with that, I thank you.
[ Applause ]

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:55.470
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thank you, Ian.
Speed is the fundamental underpinning behind

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.899
Chrome, and I think these GP acceleration
improvements is going to make Chrome much

00:18:00.899 --> 00:18:04.409
faster.
In fact, for example, if you were writing

00:18:04.409 --> 00:18:08.970
a game about six months ago and you were writing
it in canvas and software, and if you can

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:14.360
now write it in WebGL, GP accelerated, it's
going to be about 100 times faster. So that's

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.080
the pace at which the Web is evolving.
Of course writing these applications only

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:26.080
matter if you can reach users, which is why
about three months ago in the stable channel

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:32.610
of the U.S. we launched the Chrome Web Store.
The goal behind the Web Store was to help

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.690
developers reach users and monetize their
applications.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:42.399
In the first three months since we have launched,
we have had amazing early traction. We have

00:18:42.399 --> 00:18:48.970
had over 17 million applications installed,
and more importantly, developers have informed

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:54.000
us that people spend a lot more time in their
application when they install it from the

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.269
Chrome Web Store.
To give you some examples, roughly we see

00:18:58.269 --> 00:19:03.649
about a 2x increase in the amount of time
spent per app when installed from the Web

00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:08.029
Store. Springpad, which is a productivity
application, has noticed this increase, and

00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:14.500
so have many others. And games. Games have
seen about two and a half times increase in

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.919
transactions when users have installed a game
in the Web Store.

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:26.919
So we are taking the Web Store and as of today
we are making it available in 41 languages

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.809
to all 160 million users of Chrome.
[ Applause ]

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:37.809
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: We are very excited that
you as developers can write an application

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.509
and reach the entire install base of Chrome.
When you write these applications there are

00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:49.100
two aspects of it. The first is reach, so
we want to make sure you can reach all users

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.980
of Chrome, but more importantly we want to
make sure you can monetize your applications.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:20:00.240
This is why when we launched Chrome Web Store
we offered the ability for you to charge for

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.279
your applications. But we want to constantly
explore more options by which developers can

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:11.750
monetize. One of the problems on the Web today,
it's very tough to charge users in context

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.750
within your application without breaking the
flow. So we want to create a seamless payment

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:22.429
experience for developers and users alike.
To talk about that, let me invite Vikas Gupta,

00:20:22.429 --> 00:20:28.220
product manager on the Google Payments Team.
[ Applause ]

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:35.220
&gt;&gt;Vikas Gupta: Thank you, Sundar. Hello, everyone.
I am tremendously excited to be here today

00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:45.480
to talk about in-app payments. In some ways,
it's the culmination of a vision that our

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.529
team has been working on for the past few
years. It started with the basic idea that

00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:56.429
we can make purchases within applications
extremely frictionless, extremely seamless

00:20:56.429 --> 00:21:03.029
so users who are engaged in your applications
can stay engaged while they make a purchase.

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:07.269
It should be really easy for developers to
implement it, and should be just as secure

00:21:07.269 --> 00:21:09.899
and reliable as every online purchase should
be.

00:21:09.899 --> 00:21:14.970
What's even more exciting for us today is
that we're delivering that vision at Google

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.500
scale. That means you can take this and take
it to users everywhere on the Web.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:26.500
Let me show you a little bit of how it works.
This is an application built by Graphic.ly.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:35.059
It's available in the Web Store. It let's
you discover, browse, read and enjoy comic

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:40.100
books and graphic novels on the Web. It's
a great, fun experience, and I highly encourage

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.429
all of to you to go check it out.
One of the things that Graphic.ly wanted do

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:50.529
is let users start reading the comic book
before they made a purchase. And once a sure

00:21:50.529 --> 00:21:54.940
starts enjoying it, starts getting hooked,
that's when you give them the option to actually

00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:01.940
make a purchase within there.
It's now possible with our API. And it's really

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:07.899
simple. With a single click, the user can
initiate the purchase, and with another click,

00:22:07.899 --> 00:22:12.080
complete and go back to reading the comic
book they were originally enjoying.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.259
That's it. That's all it takes for a user
to make a purchase within the application.

00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:22.169
Let me show you how it works.
Just like we wanted to make it really easy

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:27.250
for users to make knows purchases, we also
wanted to make it stunningly simple for developers

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:31.750
to implement it.
All it takes for you to implement this is

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:37.000
a single line of code. There's one line of
code that integrates it and lets initiate

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.379
the purchase flow where the users can go make
a purchase. And once the purchase is complete,

00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:45.370
you get a call back that you can take a new
application and deliver the goods with a single

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.289
line of code.
That's all it is.

00:22:49.289 --> 00:22:52.350
And the session later today we will talk about
this platform and API in a lot more detail

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.200
and I highly encourage you to go and check
that out.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.909
There's one more thing. We wanted to make
it simple for users, we wanted to make it

00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:05.570
simple for developers to implement it, but
we also wanted to figure out, how do we price

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.669
it so that all of you can build amazing businesses
on this platform.

00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:16.309
When we looked around, we found that applications
tend to pay very complicated set of fees.

00:23:16.309 --> 00:23:21.179
There are setup fees, there are minimum fees,
there are monthly fees, there are fixed fees.

00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:27.360
We wanted to keep it simple.
We also found out that online applications

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.090
and social games are starting to pay to the
tune of 30% for payment fees. 30%.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:39.090
We at Google felt we could do a little better,
so I am glad to announce today that this platform

00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:46.059
that you can integrate into your applications
with a single line of code can deliver users

00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:51.039
this amazingly stunningly simple purchase
experience and take it to everywhere on the

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:58.039
Web is priced at a flat fee of 5%.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:06.100
&gt;&gt;Vikas Gupta: I'm sure you have done the
math but let me do the simple math for you.

00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:15.070
Of all the money that people are spending
on applications, 95% stays with you.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:22.070
We believe that's a great thing for developers
and a great thing for the Web.

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:30.169
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vikas Gupta: Thank you.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.190
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Wow! For 5%, it almost wants
me to go out and write a Web application and

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:38.429
implement in-app payments right now.
Stow we are very excited about this feature.

00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:43.549
We hope all of you take advantage of it, and
the ability to offer payments in context without

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:48.090
breaking the experience for users can be a
game changer on the Web. So we are very excited

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:55.090
about it.
Next we want to showcase a game for you. This

00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.460
game couldn't have been on the Web a year
ago. It's available on many platforms. It's

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:06.080
one of the leading games in the world, but
to do that on the Web was difficult. But thanks

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.519
to the recent improvements, the great GPU
capabilities that you just saw, they have

00:25:10.519 --> 00:25:14.870
been able for the first time to bring their
game onto the Web.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.419
To talk about this game let me invite the
one and the only Mighty Eagle, also known

00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:26.419
as Peter Vesterbacka from Rovio.
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: Yeah, so are we ready

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:43.210
for some fun and games?
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:49.350
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: Yeah. So thanks, Sundar.
It's really great to be here, and we wanted

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:54.509
to bring Angry Birds to the Web for a long,
long time, but you know Angry Birds, it's

00:25:54.509 --> 00:26:00.249
a great experience on all the platforms, all
the devices that we support. So we didn't

00:26:00.249 --> 00:26:07.110
want to compromise on the performance.
Okay, we're not making, like, fish in a bowl

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:11.669
or anything like that, but it's all about
Angry Birds and some really, really angry,

00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:16.440
really angry birds.
And of course one of the reasons we have been

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:22.269
angry is because we haven't been able to bring
this to the Web. So it really hasn't been

00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:28.110
possible until today.
And today, the reason I'm here is actually

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:35.110
because we are bringing Angry Birds to the
biggest platform out there: The Web.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:42.330
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: And it's really a great

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.999
version of Angry Birds. I mean, it's one of
the best that we built to date.

00:26:46.999 --> 00:26:53.999
And it really is as fun, as engaging as any
of the versions that we have out there right

00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:58.730
now.
But again, you know, don't take my word for

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:04.960
it. We actually have the real thing here,
so why don't we play some Angry Birds. Kan,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.210
go ahead, take it away.
[ Music ]

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:13.940
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: And, Kan, if you pop
some of those pigs, clear some of those levels,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:19.419
maybe we will get you one of these cool hoodies
afterwards.

00:27:19.419 --> 00:27:25.840
[ Angry Bird sounds ]
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: So as you can see, this

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:32.840
is the Angry Birds that I'm sure you have
played for a few hours.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.289
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: And it really plays really,

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:44.289
really well. And, you know, on most modern
PCs, we get 60 frames per second easily. So

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:50.980
it really, really is a very, very smooth,
very, very nice Angry Birds experience.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.139
And again, of course at Rovio we wouldn't
settle for anything less, so it has to be

00:27:55.139 --> 00:27:59.369
great.
And we think that we built a really great

00:27:59.369 --> 00:28:06.369
version here for Chrome.
And we built this using WebGL, so it really

00:28:07.629 --> 00:28:13.950
rocks, as you can see. But if you're browser
for some reason doesn't support WebGL, we

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:20.950
also support canvas, so that works as well.
And if your browser supports hardware acceleration,

00:28:21.629 --> 00:28:28.629
then you get the HD experience that you just
saw. So it looks and plays really, really

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.970
well.
But again, if you don't have hardware acceleration,

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:38.860
we have a fallback so you can still play the
game. It's not the perfect experience, but

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.360
it's still, like, really, really good. So
it's all there.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.850
Another, like, really cool thing, okay, it's
browser based and all of that, so what if

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:53.570
you're offline?
What we have done is we use local storage.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:29:00.570
And again, because we are in the Chrome Web
Store, we can get some extra up cache, extra

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:07.470
storage. So you can play the complete game
offline line.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:14.470
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: So again, really, really

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:21.210
cool. So, you know, now we'll make those flights
more bearable, so when you run out of battery

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:27.159
in your Android device, you can continue on
your, like, Chrome netbook and it goes on

00:29:27.159 --> 00:29:32.799
and on.
So it works offline, and it's really fantastic.

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:39.799
But again, and as you probably figured by
now, so we think Chrome is a great environment

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:45.340
for Angry Birds, so we didn't want to stop
there.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:51.139
We wanted to offer a special treat only for
the users of Chrome. And I guess we have a

00:29:51.139 --> 00:29:56.350
few of you here in this room, I guess. Just
guessing.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.960
Anyway, so we built something very special
for Chrome.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:07.710
So we built some special exclusive levels
that are only available in Chrome.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.190
So let's enter the Chrome dimension.
[ Laughter ]

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:18.110
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: So you see some familiar
things in there. So we have, you know, some

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:24.720
of these Chrome buttons as rocks. There's,
you know, some Chrome flowers, some Chrome

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.529
clouds. It's a very, like, Chrome experience.
[ Laughter ]

00:30:28.529 --> 00:30:35.529
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: And we even have something
really cool. We have the Chrome bombs. So,

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:42.809
I mean, how cool is that?
And, yeah, I can see that Kan is -- you need

00:30:42.809 --> 00:30:46.999
to play some more. It's clear.
But it's a new level, so I'm sure Kan would

00:30:46.999 --> 00:30:52.200
clear the original ones easily.
It happens that you fail a level and sometimes

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:59.080
you can be stuck on a level for hours, even
days, weeks, I've heard. So we have a solution

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:06.080
for that. And really, really happy to hear
about the 5%. You know, we really love that

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.609
kind of model, you know, as a developer, you
know, that's -- that's fair.

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:17.450
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: So we're -- we're all

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:22.909
for lower taxes. And 5%, fair.
So, anyway, what we decided to do when we

00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:29.909
heard about the 5%, we're actually going to
bring the Mighty Eagle that we actually have

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.809
been offering only on one platform so far,
we're going to bring that to Chrome.

00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:39.879
So as soon as the in-app payments are live,
we'll be there with the Mighty Eagle that

00:31:39.879 --> 00:31:46.119
you can buy right from your browser. And you
can use the Mighty Eagle to clear the levels.

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:49.529
So that will be available very, very soon
on Chrome.

00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:56.529
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: And the game, it's there.

00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:06.149
So, again, you probably are interested in
how we also deliver this.

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:11.489
So we use some other Google Tools. We use
the Web toolkit. So all of what you see here

00:32:11.489 --> 00:32:17.470
was done in Java, using the Web toolkit. Actually,
it didn't take us that long to get the game

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.779
over. So it was a very smooth experience as
well.

00:32:20.779 --> 00:32:27.779
Then we're hosting everything on App Engine.
And I've been told that it should basically

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:33.679
be able to cope with all of you going and
getting the game right after a keynote. So

00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:38.269
don't worry about that. You know, feel free,
go get the game. It's available right after

00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:40.989
this.
So really encourage you to do that.

00:32:40.989 --> 00:32:46.580
But, yeah, I don't think that there's much
more to say. I mean, we could be here playing

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:52.169
Angry Birds for, like, all day. And, you know,
that's a good thing to do, and it's okay to

00:32:52.169 --> 00:32:56.649
play, you know, like, out there. That's not
a problem at all. We actually encourage you

00:32:56.649 --> 00:32:59.029
to play Angry Birds whenever you can.
[ Laughter ]

00:32:59.029 --> 00:33:01.869
&gt;&gt;Peter Vesterbacka: But -- so, you know,
it happens.

00:33:01.869 --> 00:33:07.539
You know, just look like you're browsing some
important files or something.

00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:14.389
But, anyway, really happy with finally being
able to bring Angry Birds to the Web.

00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:21.070
So after this, go get it. You know, let's
pop some pigs and play Angry Birds.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:26.350
Thank you.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:33.350
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thank you, Peter.
It's been a long journey building Chrome for

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.710
over four and a half years. And I have to
say, this is the culmination point, seeing

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:43.440
Angry Birds finally work in Chrome. More importantly,
I think my kids will think finally I'm doing

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.409
something useful.
[ Laughter ]

00:33:44.409 --> 00:33:48.899
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: I'm going to be buying a
lot of Mighty Eagles.

00:33:48.899 --> 00:33:53.210
So it's great to see a game like Angry Birds,
which couldn't have been on the Web a year

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:59.779
ago, running fast in full HD and very, very
smooth. That shows the pace at which the platform

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:03.389
is evolving.
This is what we can do on the Web today. But

00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:08.060
there is a whole lot more you can do. The
Web is what you make of it.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.990
To give a glimpse into the future, what the
future of the Web can be, let me invite Aaron

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:19.990
Koblin, from the Google Creative Lab team.
[ Applause ]

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:27.559
&gt;&gt;Aaron Koblin: Thanks a lot, Sundar.
Some of you may remember the HTML5 music project

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.720
we launched last years called The Wilderness
Downtown with the band Arcade Fire. Well,

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.690
this year, I'm really excited to give you
a sneak preview of a new interactive music

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.659
project we're working on called 3 Dreams of
Black.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:42.409
So 3 Dreams of Black is an interactive music
experience which really showcases the power

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:47.859
of JavaScript, HTML5, and especially WebGL
to make an immersive, interactive, multimedia

00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:51.710
3D experience for the Web.
So we worked with some amazing people. Since

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:57.149
this is a music experience, we teamed up with
Chris Milk, who wrote and directs the script.

00:34:57.149 --> 00:35:01.280
It's based off some music off of Danger Mouse
and Daniel Luppe's new album called ROME,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.890
featuring Jack White from the White Stripes
and Nora Jones.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:10.890
So, basically, the experience is moving you
through a variety of dream worlds. It's involving

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.780
composited video, animation, and 3D graphics
all into one space. So I'm going to give you

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:22.780
a little demo of what that looks like.
So the experience starts off with some 2D

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.140
animation. It's all going with the music.
And it allows to you actually look around

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:35.859
and see various paralax and panorama views.
You can apply real-time shaders like I am

00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:40.950
right here. As it goes through the story line,
it's driving through this car and it's going

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:47.950
to dump us there some amazing 3D interactive
worlds. I am just going to let this play through.

00:36:01.709 --> 00:36:08.709
[ Music ]
&gt;&gt;Aaron Koblin: As you can see, I'm literally

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.490
painting with geometry. I'm skip ahead through
a separate section. This is going through

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:20.480
a prairie sequence. I'm doing collision detection,
spawning animals and separate animated elements

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.020
and interacting with the environment in realtime,
all being rendered live. You can explore these

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:30.869
various dream realities and kind of progress
through the story line.

00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:34.390
Another really cool thing is, you can actually
contribute to the story line yourself. So

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.890
I'm going to skip ahead to the UGC tool. And
here you can choose what type of element you're

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.609
going to contribute to the experience. There's
a basic voxel building tool. You can begin

00:36:41.609 --> 00:36:43.450
to build your own models right into the experiences
itself.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:50.170
So we're really excited about the types of
things people are going to create with this.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:53.940
I think equally exciting to the project is
actually the process behind it. So the entire

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.619
thing is open source. We released a bunch
of demos that show exactly how we put it together.

00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:02.869
So on this tech page, you'll see some demos,
like this GLSL shader demo of hatching glow

00:37:02.869 --> 00:37:07.000
shader. There's (inaudible) wrapping showing
how we did some of the video compositing,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.710
depth of field. There's some really cool demos
on here, and they're all open source and you

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.369
can view the code directly within the site.
So, hopefully, you'll get a chance to take

00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:17.640
a look at some of those.
We also built this model viewer, which allows

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.740
you to take a look at some of the assets that
are part of the project. And you can toggle

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:25.829
things like texture, you can do wire framing,
see how the models were built.

00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:30.210
I'm just going to show you a couple of my
favorite models. This is a bear that morphs

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:34.869
into a horse.
We -- this is really my favorite. This is

00:37:34.869 --> 00:37:41.869
a buffalo that goes into a tarantula. The
tarantalo.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:46.290
You can do fun stuff like controlling the
morphing speed yourself with JavaScript and

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:49.109
some really cool things.
And a lot of this was built with a library

00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:52.720
that I wanted to give a shoutout to called
three.JS. Some of you may know the developer,

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.420
Mr. Doob. And he's worked with us to build
this. Definitely recommend you check it out.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.420
So at the bottom of the page, there's a link
to that. We're also going to put up a link

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.890
to processing.JS, which is a great starting
point for people who are interested in learning

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:10.849
how to use WebGL. We're going to be launching
the project really soon. You can keep your

00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:17.220
eyes out at RO.ME is the URL.
If you're interested in checking out other

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.260
WebGL other demos, we also have a section
on Chrome experiments. So if you go to ChromeExperiments.com/WebGL,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:28.260
you can see a number of these demos as well.
Thanks a lot, and talk to you soon.

00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:34.059
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thank you, Aaron.

00:38:34.059 --> 00:38:39.109
So that's an inspiring look at how the future
of Web sites could look like. In fact, was

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:44.200
it a Web site? A video? A game? You get to
decide.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.000
So we've spent the last 30 minutes talking
about the power of the Web. The pace at which

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.819
the platform is evolving and the momentum
behind Chrome.

00:38:53.819 --> 00:38:59.690
It turns out this is what people do almost
entirely on their computers now, spend all

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:06.690
their time on the Web within a browser, which
is why we set out to do Chrome OS.

00:39:07.089 --> 00:39:11.770
Let's take a brief look at what computers
look like today.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:17.049
Just to spend your time on the Web within
a browser, you have to deal with all the legacy

00:39:17.049 --> 00:39:22.339
decisions which have been made in the last
20 to 30 years in operating systems. Every

00:39:22.339 --> 00:39:26.839
time you boot up the computer, some computers
even check to see whether there's a floppy

00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:32.410
drive. It takes a long time to boot into your
computer. Once you're inside, you have to

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:38.200
make sure you manage your applications. Every
one of your applications need to be up to

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:43.250
date. You have to run antivirus software.
You have to back up your data. If you move

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:47.819
across machines or if you try to upgrade your
PC, good luck with that. It takes an entire

00:39:47.819 --> 00:39:51.819
weekend to do so.
The experience is really, really complicated.

00:39:51.819 --> 00:39:58.819
So we wanted to rethink the entire experience
and distill it down to nothing but the Web.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:04.599
And that's what Chrome OS is.
Chrome OS can be applied to a variety of form

00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:09.970
factors. It is just an end-to-end computing
experience, a software experience. It can

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:15.089
be applied to a variety of form factors. We
have chosen to focus initially on notebooks,

00:40:15.089 --> 00:40:19.170
because that's where most of the Web usage
is there today. That's where people use the

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:24.380
Web the most. So we wanted to bring the Chrome
OS experience to notebooks.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:29.119
When you do that, when you run Chrome OS on
notebooks, you end up with a very different,

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:36.119
unique experience. We call those Chromebooks.
So what makes Chromebooks different from other

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:43.109
notebooks? Here are a few attributes. Every
Chromebook is instant to turn on. In fact,

00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:48.339
when you first get your device, when you unwrap
the box, you will be up and running within

00:40:48.339 --> 00:40:51.789
three minutes.
If you're one of the 160 million active users

00:40:51.789 --> 00:40:58.299
of Chrome, all your stuff is automatically
there with Chrome sync. Every time you boot

00:40:58.299 --> 00:41:05.190
up, you are up and running within eight seconds.
And each time you open the lid, before you

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:10.520
can move your fingers and type on the keyboard,
you're connected within the Web.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:16.609
We have provided built-in connectivity options,
so wherever you use them, with connectivity

00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:23.500
options, you have data services which are
pay as you go, no contracts, no commitments.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.630
You get free monthly usage per month, and
you can buy day passes, et cetera. So you

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:33.369
can be always connected.
They have all-day battery life. So I think

00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:37.079
this is really game-changing in terms of how
you think about your notebooks. I never carry

00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:42.430
power chargers around when I'm using a Chromebook.
It lasts all day, as long as you can charge

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:47.319
it at home or at the hotel at the night, you're
all set. These are some of the attributes

00:41:47.319 --> 00:41:52.280
which make phones and tablets great as well.
But for the first time, we are bringing those

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.490
wonderful attributes of mobile computing to
the world of notebooks.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:03.200
The software experience is very unique as
well. Because it is nothing but the Web, you

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.369
can access your stuff anytime, anywhere. You
can ask multiple Chromebooks, you can share

00:42:09.369 --> 00:42:13.619
Chromebooks with people. Each time when you
open them, you get the latest and the greatest

00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:16.480
version of the Web application which you're
using.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:21.839
It gets better over time. I think this is
a concept people aren't used to on their computers.

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:28.000
When you buy a PC, it's great on the first
day. But as you install applications, it slowly

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.740
starts degrading over time. Because we update
Chromebooks automatically, we'll update them

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.549
every few weeks, we actually think we can
make it better over time.

00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:42.119
To give you an example, as we have made all
the JavaScript speed improvements, your Chromebooks

00:42:42.119 --> 00:42:46.829
will get faster. With all the GPU acceleration
improvements we talked about, you will notice

00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:52.260
in a few months your Chromebooks are even
faster. And finally, security is built in

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.319
from the ground up.
Every piece of user data on Chromebooks, by

00:42:56.319 --> 00:43:01.109
default, is encrypted.
Every time you boot up your computer, we take

00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:04.990
you through a verified boot sequence to make
sure you're secure.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:10.980
And, finally, you're within the Chrome sandbox.
Chrome sandbox, which is built into sandbox

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.140
Web pages and plug-ins. We think it's a pretty
unique experience.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:22.140
We started testing our Chromebooks through
the Cr-48 pilot program a few months ago.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:28.400
After announcing it, within the first few
weeks, we had over a million applicants. People

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.730
had to fill out long forms and submit it.
We were humbled by the interest in the program.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:40.020
We have literally shipped thousands of devices
to people all over the U.S. and even internationally.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.480
The feedback has been great. I mean, it's
open forum on the Web, so you can take a look.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.109
People have had meetups, they've printed tee
shirts, they have been very vocal, they have

00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:53.059
written us hundreds of e-mails.
The good news is, we've been working on many

00:43:53.059 --> 00:43:59.680
of the same features over the last month.
We have fixed some issues we had with Cr-48.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:05.609
We have completely revamped the track pad
into a much better track pad. We worked closely

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:11.430
with Adobe, our partner, to have a seamless
Flash experience on Chromebooks.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:16.430
Intel, who powers these devices, has worked
with us to upgrade to a dual-core processor

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:21.530
so that Chromebooks can be much faster.
There were missing gaps when we announced

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:27.369
Cr-48 about six months ago. As we showed in
the event, if you plugged in a camera, nothing

00:44:27.369 --> 00:44:31.780
happened. But it turns out now if you plug
in a camera, something interesting happens.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.490
To show you what it is, we'll invite Kan Liu,
who is a product manager on Chrome OS.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:43.490
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Kan Liu: Thanks, Sundar. Hopefully, I'll

00:44:44.049 --> 00:44:49.240
do better with this than I did with Angry
Birds.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:53.140
I am very excited to show you guys some of
the new file features and functionality that

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.150
we've been building directly into Chrome OS.
We think it's going to make our users' lives

00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:00.920
a lot easier. Let's start with a very common
scenario that a lot of users have. Someone

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.900
e-mails you a file and you want to be able
to save it for later viewing or use. In this

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:10.220
particular case, my friend has e-mailed me
an HTML5 (inaudible) cheat sheet so I will

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:17.220
stop nagging him with my annoying questions.
And I'm going to go ahead and download this.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.950
As you can see, it downloads immediately.
And now I can close it. And if I ever wanted

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:26.200
to get back to it, I have to open up the new
file manager that we built into Chrome OS,

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.380
which I have already got open in another tab.
And I can just drill into the folder, and

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:37.380
there's the file, double click. Opens instantly.
So it's very simple, very easy to use.

00:45:37.469 --> 00:45:42.559
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Kan Liu: Now, of course, we realize people

00:45:42.559 --> 00:45:48.420
have a lot of other important data types.
For example, a lot of users have music, media,

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.799
movies and so forth that they want to be able
to play on this device as well.

00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:54.799
So let's see how that works.
I am going to go back to the file manager,

00:45:54.799 --> 00:45:57.920
and here I have got a USB drive full of some
of my favorite music and movies.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:04.470
I am going to go into the music folder, and
let's just try to open one of these and see

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:09.380
what happens.
It opens immediately in the new media player

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.900
we have added as well.
It's very simple, very easy to use. You can

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:19.859
do basic things. Skip, pause, and you can
even create new play lists and so forth, but

00:46:19.859 --> 00:46:24.520
now let's try a video.
So let's go back. And I've got here a bunch

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.270
of movie trailers of some of my favorite movies,
but I have also got a Chrome versus potato

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:34.160
gun video which I am very, very excited about
because, let's face it, who doesn't like potato

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.859
guns; right?
So let's watch this.

00:46:38.859 --> 00:46:44.099
Now, again, it opens immediately in the media
player in the panel form factor, so I can

00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:48.200
now go back to checking my e-mail or reading
news or whatever while I continue to watch.

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:53.030
Of course, if I wanted to focus purely on
the video I can easily full-screen it as well.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:47:00.030
So let's watch this a second.
So as you can see, as awesome as potato guns

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:10.589
are, they are clearly no match for Chrome.
One of the trends we are seeing is more and

00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:15.890
more users are starting to move to online
media consumption. So they are streaming their

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:21.000
content directly from Web services. For example,
yesterday we launched two great services,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.690
movie rentals and Google music beta, which
all work seamlessly on this device as well,

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:33.359
because again, it's just the Web.
Now, of course all of your other favorite

00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:39.289
online services like Hulu or Amazon or even
Netflix, which we have been working closely

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:44.410
with, will also just work out of the box.
And same with your music, your MOG, your Pandora

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:49.559
and so forth.
[ Applause ]

00:47:49.559 --> 00:47:56.559
&gt;&gt;Kan Liu: Now, another important media type
that a lot of users have today is photos.

00:47:58.599 --> 00:48:04.779
In very common-use cases, you are at an event,
maybe I/O, maybe a birthday, maybe a party

00:48:04.779 --> 00:48:08.890
of some sort and you take a whole bunch of
photos that you want to be able to share with

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:11.529
your friends. So how does that work on Chrome
OS?

00:48:11.529 --> 00:48:15.049
I have got here an SD card full of photos
I took at my daughter's recent birth that

00:48:15.049 --> 00:48:19.859
I am very excited to share it with friends.
So I am just going to go ahead and plug it

00:48:19.859 --> 00:48:25.180
in.
And now because Chromebooks are cloud devices,

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.789
we wanted to make it really easy, really seamless
for users to get their files, their important

00:48:29.789 --> 00:48:35.950
data directly into the cloud so they can have
it accessible to them from anywhere as well

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:40.779
as easily share those with other people.
So as you can see, it's automatically opened

00:48:40.779 --> 00:48:46.700
up as a new file manager directly in the SD
card. So I can start clicking through all

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:51.420
my photos. I can preview them, select a bunch,
and play a slide show if I wanted to. But

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.950
most importantly for me, I just want to get
these in the cloud as soon as possible so

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:58.460
I can share it with some of my friends who
came over to visit.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:04.730
Now, because I'm a Picasa user, I have gone
ahead and installed the Picasa Web app from

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:10.299
the Chrome Web Store. And by doing so, the
app has actually registered itself as a local

00:49:10.299 --> 00:49:14.349
file handler for image file types on this
device.

00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:21.349
So now when I select three photos, a new contextual
button pops up that sent to Picasa directly

00:49:23.049 --> 00:49:29.420
in line with file manager. So I am going to
go ahead and click this and I can create an

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:36.420
album. Say baby and friends. Let's make this
private, and upload.

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.569
And immediately it starts uploading the background,
so I can now go back, continue checking my

00:49:41.569 --> 00:49:44.700
e-mail, browsing around the Web. And when
it's done it will tell me and give me a link

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:51.680
to view it online.
And there it is. Very fast, very easy and

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:58.680
now I am ready to share with the world.
[ Applause ]

00:50:00.059 --> 00:50:05.819
&gt;&gt;Kan Liu: Now, of course, this works with
other data types as well. For example, your

00:50:05.819 --> 00:50:10.930
documents, your presentations, your spreadsheets
and so forth. So let's go back, and here I

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:16.920
have a doc that I have been working on for
Google I/O that I want to share with my friends.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.500
And again, because I am a Google docs user,
I have already installed the Google docs app,

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.730
and it's registered itself as a file handler
for doc types.

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:28.490
So I am going to go ahead and click open with
google docs, upload, and I am done.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:34.430
It's already in the cloud. Now, the best part
is we've built these APIs directly into the

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:41.430
platform so that any Web app can leverage
these same APIs to build the same great experience

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.940
for all their users, too.
For example, we have been working with Box.net,

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.549
one of the leading online storage providers,
to build the same great app for their users

00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:54.170
so they can seamlessly upload docs and file
it directly into Box.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:59.190
So let me show you how that works. I've got
a PDF here, I've got a button that says "Save

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:06.190
to Box.net," and I am going to click it and,
bam, it's in the cloud already.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:10.750
I'm ready to go to Box.net and share this
with others.

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.900
It's just that simple.
[ Applause ]

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:18.880
&gt;&gt;Kan Liu: And of course working with a lot
of other service providers as well, like Dropbox,

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.230
for example, to build the same great experience
for them. And the best part is this is actually

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:28.869
really, really easy to use, or to build apps
on. It literally took Box.net less than one

00:51:28.869 --> 00:51:34.260
weekend leveraging their existing upload APIs
and some of our new file extension APIs to

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:39.579
build this app.
So you can imagine in the future, any user

00:51:39.579 --> 00:51:44.079
should be able to take an image from their
SD card and open it directly in an online

00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:48.319
photo editor. Or if someone sends me a CAD
file I should be able to open that directly

00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:52.750
in Tinkercad.
We are really trying to open up the world

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:59.750
of your offline files to the Web so that any
Web app can actually register themselves and

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:06.789
handle your local files.
And so it's our hope that you, as Web app

00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:12.190
developers, as Web service writers, will leverage
these same APIs to create the exact same experience

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:15.869
and seamless experience for all your users
as well.

00:52:15.869 --> 00:52:17.650
And with that, I'm going to hand it back to
Sundar.

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:22.740
Thank you very much.
[ Applause ]

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:29.740
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thank you, Kan. I'm personally
very, very excited by the file extension APIs.

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.640
The cloud has more storage than any single
computer, and so we really want to make it

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:40.240
possible for users to store their important
data in the cloud and access them anytime,

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.109
anywhere.
I can't wait to see the interesting use cases

00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:47.599
you all write on top of these APIs.
So we have been working hard to address the

00:52:47.599 --> 00:52:54.150
important use cases. Another important use
case is the ability to use Chromebooks while

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:59.410
you are disconnected.
So we worked hard to make many, many important

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:04.180
applications available offline.
Three of the most important applications which

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:11.180
users have requested us to bring offline are
Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google docs.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.369
We are all using internally offline versions
of these applications and they will all be

00:53:16.369 --> 00:53:22.760
available for Chromebook users this summer.
Already today there are hundreds of applications

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:28.470
on the Chrome Web Store which work offline.
New York Times, USA Today, Huffington Post,

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:33.670
Sports Illustrated. You should check it out.
They work seamlessly offline, and almost all

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:39.079
the games, they use package resources and
they work offline in the browser today in

00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:43.309
the Chrome Web Store.
Angry Birds, which you saw earlier, works

00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:46.819
offline as well.
We also realize it's a very connected world

00:53:46.819 --> 00:53:51.440
which is why we brought in seamless connectivity
with built-in 3G as well.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.819
So we have been working to complete this experience.
Back in December we told you we were working

00:53:56.819 --> 00:54:01.609
with some of the leading partners in the world
to bring Chromebooks to market. We are working

00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:07.270
with Samsung and Acer, two of the leading
companies in the world. Intel powers Chromebooks

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:12.400
with their great processors, and Verizon in
the U.S. with the Gobi modem has incredible

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.539
connectivity, and I have been using this app.
In fact, the connectivity piece of Chromebooks,

00:54:17.539 --> 00:54:23.329
we received such great feedback during the
pilot program, we worked internationally to

00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:28.829
partner with leading carriers all over the
world to make the same option available for

00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:33.930
Chromebooks internationally.
So let's take a look at first Chromebooks.

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:39.200
The first Chromebook is from Samsung. Samsung
is the world's leading consumer electronics

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:46.200
manufacturer. They worked with us very closely
to design a Chromebook optimized for Web usage.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:52.160
It has a 12.1 inch display. It looks great.
It's 300 net display and the Web looks great

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.869
on it.
It has all-day battery usage, so you literally

00:54:56.869 --> 00:55:01.180
have used it for many days now, you don't
run out of battery while you use it during

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.990
the day.
It comes in Wi-Fi as well as the built-in

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:10.880
3G option from Verizon in the U.S. and other
carriers internationally.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.339
And it's available in two colors.
[ Laughter ]

00:55:14.339 --> 00:55:21.339
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: The second Chrome book is
from Acer. Acer is the world's leading PC

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:28.430
manufacturer, and they work to come up with
a new Chromebook which is much more portable.

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:34.839
So it has 11.6 inch screen, so it's easy to
carry around. It's a full HD display, but

00:55:34.839 --> 00:55:40.460
they worked to fit in a full-size keyboard
so you can easily carry it around and be very,

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:45.140
very productive on this machine.
It's again available in Wi-Fi and 3G.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:50.309
We just want to give you a sneak preview.
Our partners will be holding events to announce

00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:57.210
more details. I should mention that the Samsung
device will be priced at $429 for the Wi-Fi

00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:04.210
option. With the built-in 3G option, it is
$499 in the United States.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:14.640
The Acer device, it's an incredible value.
It's priced starting at $349 and up.

00:56:15.369 --> 00:56:20.299
So when will they be available?
On June 15th, we have worked with two of the

00:56:20.299 --> 00:56:26.849
leading online retailers in the U.S., Amazon.com
and Best Buy.com so they will be available

00:56:26.849 --> 00:56:32.119
for consumers to order on June 15th.
In addition architects the same time they

00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:39.119
will be available in six more countries: UK,
France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Italy.

00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:45.079
In each of these countries, they will be available
through leading online retailers and will

00:56:45.079 --> 00:56:49.980
have 3G options from the top carriers in those
countries.

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:54.150
We really hope you get a chance to try out
these devices. For folks like you, we realize

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:59.130
these devices are designed to be very, very
simple to use, so hopefully you can share

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:03.619
with your family members. Like a lot of us,
I'm sure you all get asked to troubleshoot

00:57:03.619 --> 00:57:08.289
these devices all the time, so hopefully when
you visit Thanksgiving next time, you get

00:57:08.289 --> 00:57:14.180
to eat more Turkey and watch more football.
Of course, as you developers, we want to make

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:18.970
sure you can completely jailbreak these devices.
So my partners may not want to say it, but

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:21.359
these devices have full jail-breaking mode
built in, and you can play around with the

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:24.799
kernel all you want.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:57:24.799 --> 00:57:31.799
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Be another group which suffers
from the same complexity in computing are

00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:43.319
businesses and educational institutions. Schools.
Let's take a brief look at what their world

00:57:43.319 --> 00:57:47.519
looks like.
In most companies today, the IP infrastructure

00:57:47.519 --> 00:57:52.990
is so complicated, they actually have a hard
time even accounting for the layers and layers

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:58.430
of software they have within their companies.
In fact, it is so difficult to upgrade operating

00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:02.890
systems, over 50% of the companies are still
running Windows XP.

00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:09.890
This morning I checked in Wikipedia, Windows
XP was launched in 2001, ten years ago, so

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:15.420
most companies have such a hard time upgrading
their operating systems. It is very, very

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.950
costly to do so.
Meanwhile, usage patterns have changed dramatically.

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:25.529
Ten years ago, people used to use desktops.
Today, most users use laptops. They take it

00:58:25.529 --> 00:58:30.809
in and out of the enterprise firewall. They're
always connected. The security surface area

00:58:30.809 --> 00:58:34.809
is really challenging for I.T. administrators
to manage.

00:58:34.809 --> 00:58:40.740
All this adds up as costs for companies. If
you just do a rough survey, most companies

00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:47.740
spend starting from 3,000 to high thousands
of dollars per computer per year when they

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:55.160
deploy a PC environment. So it's really complicated.
There is good news. CIOs and I.T. administrators

00:58:56.089 --> 00:59:01.099
are well on their way to move things towards
the cloud. Cloud computing is real and big

00:59:01.099 --> 00:59:04.779
in the enterprise.
So if you look at it, even many traditional

00:59:04.779 --> 00:59:11.510
applications are already moving to the cloud.
Companies like SAP, SalesForce.com, are pioneering

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:16.690
this movement, so you can now, within companies,
use all of them as Web applications.

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:22.019
In addition, many companies are deploying
desktop virtualization. So they are taking

00:59:22.019 --> 00:59:27.269
the visual applications and bringing them
through a browser front end to their users.

00:59:27.269 --> 00:59:31.809
So for Chromebooks, we have partnered with
two of the leading retailers in the space,

00:59:31.809 --> 00:59:38.809
Citrix and VMware, to make sure the same applications
are available in Chromebooks through the browser.

00:59:40.059 --> 00:59:47.059
When we launched the Cr-48 pilot program,
we had over 50,000 companies apply to test

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:53.510
Chromebooks. We have deployed them in hundreds
of companies and thousands of devices.

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:58.730
Here are a few examples.
Intercontinental Hotels. They have hundreds

00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:04.849
of call service agents in distributed locations.
They have been piloting Chromebooks to great

01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:08.690
results.
A more classic example is Jason's Deli. They

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:14.380
have hundreds of retail store locations all
over the U.S. It is so cost-prohibitive for

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:20.390
them that in many stores, all store managers
share one Windows laptop in the back of the

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:24.150
store.
So we took a few stores, deployed Chromebooks.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:28.970
Every store manager gets one. They've been
able to seamlessly manage the deployment.

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:35.789
We have tested this with governmental institutions.
The city of Orlando, if you go there, you

01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:42.369
will find Chromebooks in offices, in some
cases inside fire trucks, and in some cases,

01:00:42.369 --> 01:00:45.349
even on the streets.
In fact, the only piece of feedback they've

01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:49.500
had is people have asked for more power cards,
because they are using them everywhere. So

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:55.619
this is really, really easy to use.
We did -- we spent four months talking to

01:00:55.619 --> 01:01:01.619
over 400 companies and had an in-depth survey
of where the Chromebooks are applicable. Almost

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:07.329
all companies said that the combination of
Web applications and desktop virtualization,

01:01:07.329 --> 01:01:12.650
they can migrate 75% of their users today
to Chromebooks.

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:19.019
So we want to make it available to them, the
same two Chromebooks which are available for

01:01:19.019 --> 01:01:23.380
consumers will be available for businesses
as well.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:29.599
In addition, when we talked with them, not
everyone has a mobile use case. For example,

01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:34.960
in retail store locations, they want a box
from which they can drive large monitors.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.510
Google engineers wanted the same thing as
well. They wanted a box from which they can

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:43.480
drive large monitors. We are working on a
Chromebooks as well which we think will be

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.880
ideal for many, many companies.
So how will we offer this?

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.420
As I said earlier, the device is only one
part of the cost.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:59.440
Most of the expenses are in management and
administration. So we worked to design a Web

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:06.180
console so just from a Web page, I.T. administrators
can centrally manage all Chromebooks. They

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:12.309
can add and remove users. They can install
apps, remove applications, have centralized

01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:18.319
group policy settings for their entire employee
base. It's dead simple to manage.

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:25.019
We want to make it really easy for them to
manage their computing, so we have an end-to-end

01:02:25.019 --> 01:02:31.839
offering. We call this Chromebooks for Business.
For the first time, it is software and hardware

01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:36.490
as a service, packaged together.
So what do companies get? They get the devices,

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:43.490
they get Chromebooks. You get a centralized
Web console. You get full support. You get

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:49.539
warranty and replacements. So if your device
breaks down, we ship you a new device. And

01:02:49.539 --> 01:02:56.539
when the hardware life cycle is over, we automatically
upgrade you to the next generation Chromebook.

01:02:56.619 --> 01:03:00.599
All for a convenient monthly price of $28
per user.

01:03:00.599 --> 01:03:05.839
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Software and hardware as

01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:09.589
a service.
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:15.339
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: We think this can fundamentally
change the way people use computing in companies.

01:03:15.339 --> 01:03:22.339
Another area which we passionately care about
is schools. It's incredible that in today's

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:27.240
age, most schools can't provide computers
for their students. Again, the reasons are

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.059
the same. You can go and buy a cheap PC, but
it's impossible -- we have talked to every

01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:38.200
school -- it's impossible to manage a deployment
of a thousand PCs in a cost-effective manner.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.309
They just cannot afford it.
So we want to make it possible for every student

01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:47.960
to have a computer in schools as well.
So we worked with our partners, and Chromebooks

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:54.960
for Education is priced at $20 per user for
schools and governmental institutions.

01:03:55.150 --> 01:04:02.150
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: So when are these available?

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:10.410
Just like for consumers, starting June 15th,
Chromebooks are available for companies and

01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:15.970
schools and governments. You can order them
directly from Google, and they're available

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:22.970
in the same seven countries.
Both consumers and businesses can go and find

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:29.130
all the information they want at google.com/Chromebook.
Many of us, as we were working on the project,

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:32.990
we were asked to describe what Chromebooks
are. And I'm sure a lot of you will get asked

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:36.779
the same question as well.
So to help that, we have put together a little

01:04:36.779 --> 01:04:38.700
something which describes what Chromebooks
are.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.039
Let's take a look.
[ Video. ]

01:04:40.039 --> 01:04:47.039
&gt;&gt;Video: This is a laptop. This is a computer.
This has the Web. That's weird.

01:04:54.569 --> 01:05:01.569
Okay. So it's the Web. There are no programs?
So there's nothing to start up?

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:12.990
Then how do I do stuff?
There's no messy desktop?

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:19.029
So no rolling hills of green.
[ Laughter ]

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:26.029
&gt;&gt;Video: Can I use it anywhere?
On a unicycle?

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:37.720
My calendars, e-mails, documents? Everything
can be saved to the Web.

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:47.960
That's crazy. So I can throw this thing into
a river, and I won't lose my stuff?

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.440
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Video: It doesn't need virus protection?

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:59.440
What about annoying updates?
Or patches? Or patches for the patches?

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:10.240
So it gets better in realtime.
I wonder if people are ready for this. It's

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:20.230
kind of a new thought.

[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: We think users are really

01:06:34.019 --> 01:06:40.170
ready for this, so we want to make sure we
make them available. And we are incredibly

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:45.380
excited about getting them to test this out.
The Web is what you make of it. Many of you

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:51.640
in the audience here are -- really helped
Chrome get early traction and get the word

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:56.960
out to our users. So we hope you all get a
chance to try out Chromebooks and help spread

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.640
the word as well.
In fact, which is why --

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:07.640
[ Laughter ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:18.690
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: -- we want to make sure every
I/O attendee gets a free Chromebook. These

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.019
are --
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:07:29.019 --> 01:07:36.019
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: These are available on June
15th. We will send you an e-mail with details

01:07:41.869 --> 01:07:46.059
so that you can claim your Chromebook very,
very soon.

01:07:46.059 --> 01:07:50.410
The Web is the most amazing platform --
[ Applause ]

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:57.410
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: The Web is the most amazing

01:07:59.339 --> 01:08:03.900
platform, development platform, in our lifetimes.
The future of the Web is in the hands of a

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:09.019
lot of you in the audience. We hope you continue
to write great applications and the Web is

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:10.140
what you make of it.
Thank you.
