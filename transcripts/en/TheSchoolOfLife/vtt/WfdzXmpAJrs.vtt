00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.090
We are sometimes swept away by a mood of sadness
that seems to have no cause. We wake up dispirited

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.470
and listless. We lack energy and direction.
Everything loses its taste and the smallest

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.050
challenges feel unfeasibly heavy. We struggle
to see the point of almost anything. We are

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.710
– as the doctors tell us – in a state
of severe depression. One of the strangest

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.070
but most provocative insights about depression
is found in works of psychoanalysis that tell

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.320
us that depression may not at heart be about
sadness; it is a kind of anger that has been

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.120
unable to find expression, that has turned
in on itself, and made us sad about everything

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.960
and everyone when we are in truth – deep
down – angry only about certain specific

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.610
things and specific people. If only we could
understand our disappointment and rage more

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.600
intimately, we could – the theory holds
– eventually regain our spirits. It isn’t

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.030
existence per se that has let us down, it
is a few particular events and actors whose

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.079
precise identity we have lost sight of. The
theory at once begs questions. How is it possible

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.939
that we be both profoundly angry and yet unaware
of the causes or direction of our annoyance?

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.289
However, this lack of self-knowledge is, in
terms of our overall mental functioning, not

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.049
entirely surprising or anomalous. We are endemically
bad at keeping close tabs on the origin and

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.490
nature of many of our feelings. We can laugh
deeply and yet struggle to explain exactly

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.289
why something has set us off. We can find
a landscape beautiful, a person charming or

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.030
a film nostalgia-inducing without having any
secure hold on the detailed mechanics of our

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.149
responses. Understanding has an established
habit of trailing far behind feeling. It isn’t

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.100
just around sadness and despair that we’re
strangers to ourselves. But there is another,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.020
more pointed reason why we can lose touch
with our anger: because we have been taught,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.180
probably since earliest childhood, that it
isn’t very nice to be angry. Anger violates

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.290
our image of ourselves as kindly and sympathetic
people. It can be too painful and guilt-inducing

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.370
to acknowledge that we may feel furious and
vengeful, not least towards people whom we

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.900
otherwise still love and who might have made
many sacrifices on our behalves. What we are

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.140
angry about may also sound absurd. Perhaps
we have been hurt by the sort of thing that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.660
can be unhelpfully dismissed as ‘small’
and which we learn not to pay attention to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.610
because we imagine ourselves as strong and
above being slighted by petty injuries; injuries

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.270
which wound us substantially just the same.
Lastly, we might be bad at getting angry because

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.959
we haven’t seen examples of successful expressions
of anger around us. We might associate the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.909
word with volcanic crazed destruction, as
dangerous as it is counter-productive. Or

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.829
else we might have lived for too long surrounded
by people who never dared to raise their voices

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.280
and bitterly swallowed every hurt instead.
We have not learnt the art of a controlled

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.659
and cathartic conversation. The way out of
this sort of depression is to realise that

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:25.030
its alternative isn’t cheerfulness, but
mourning. Mourning is a useful word for it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.159
indicates a focused kind of grief over an
identifiable kind of loss. As ‘mourners’,

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.209
we turn boundless, unnameable sadness into
much more specific hurt: a hurt about the

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.239
parent who wasn’t there for us, about the
sibling who mocked us, the lover who betrayed

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.900
us, the friend who lied. It isn’t necessarily
an idea to go out and confront these people

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.510
(some of them may already be dead anyway);
but mulling over what has happened and becoming

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.269
conscious of the full scale of our disavowed
rage and burden can decisively change our

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.269
mood all the same. Even as specific relationships
and episodes become more complicated in our

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.709
minds, life as a whole starts to appear more
manageable and hopeful. We’re never quite

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.290
done with the business of knowing our own
minds.
