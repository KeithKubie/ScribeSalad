&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.390
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple Claggett:
Thank you and welcome

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.800
to the Coolidge Auditorium
as we celebrate World IP Day,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.950
Innovation Improving Lives.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.260
My name is Karyn Temple Claggett
and I'm currently Acting Register

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.060
of the US Copyright Office.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.980
We are pleased to once
again this year partner

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.850
with the Copyright
Alliance on this event

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.880
and we are particularly
thrilled to have a special guest,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.200
Representative Doug Collins,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.260
who I will formally
introduce in just a moment.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.360
But first, I want to take a moment
to reflect on this year's theme

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.410
from a copyright perspective.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.460
We know that copyrighted
works such as books, films,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.040
and music entertain the world but
do they actually improve lives,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.740
as the theme of this year's
World IP Day celebrates?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.350
Well, I expect for most
of us in the audience

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.820
that question is a rhetorical one.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.620
Whether it is the way that
copyrighted works inspire us

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.330
like the iconic photograph of the
first female Boston Marathon runner

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.080
by Harry Trask, or the
way they impact change

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.090
in the political environment
like the groundbreaking novel,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.990
The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair, or
the way they humanize the struggle

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.470
for equality such as
the searing photograph

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.150
of Emmett Till's open
casket in Jet Magazine,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.120
copyrighted works improve our
lives in immeasurable ways.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.870
They make us laugh,
they make us think,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.130
and in many instances,
they make us act.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.390
In fact, copyrighted works can
actually impact our very health

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.690
and well-being.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.440
According to one study,
listening to music prior

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.200
to surgery actually lowered
patient's anxiety better

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.680
than medication.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.950
Another study pointed out something
I think we all know inherently

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.960
and probably have heard from
our parents since kindergarten,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.200
that reading a novel enhances
connectivity in the brain

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.220
and improves brain function.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.120
Simply put, it makes us smarter.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.630
As a CNN article recently
acknowledged,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.710
books can literally
change your life.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.830
Even videogames, which
are often seen by parents

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.770
as really just mere
child's play can,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.520
according to the American
Psychological Association,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.830
strengthen cognitive skills such
as reason, memory, and perception

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.170
and copyrighted works such as
software directly improve lives

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.380
by allowing people with
disabilities to access the world

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.710
in ways never imaginable before.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.850
Software allows those
with amputated, paralyzed,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.720 position:56%
or impaired limbs to operate
computers and navigate the internet.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.330
It can magnify and read
text on computer screens

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.550
for those with sight impairments.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.130
In short, innovative
software has opened the door

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.360
to an entirely new world of
knowledge for many who thought

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.140
that certain life experiences
were forever lost.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.950
So, while this year's
theme for World IP Day,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.430
Innovation Improving Lives may
not have immediately brought

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.490
to mind the role of copyright and
copyrighted works in our society,

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.150
it is fact very fitting description
of how important copyright

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.620
and copyrighted works are to our
culture and our everyday lives

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.430 position:56%
because of course, without copyright
law which gives artists, authors

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.000
and other creators the ability
to actually make a living

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.770
in the pursuit of their creativity,
many of our most iconic songs,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.280
films, and books simply
would not exist.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.000
For example, it was a full-time
photojournalist who took that photo

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.320
of Kathrine Switzer running
the Boston Marathon in 1967,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.950
that impacted and inspired female
runners for many years to come.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.950
It was a full-time writer who
wrote the iconic book, The Jungle,

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.520
which encouraged concrete
legislative changes

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.610
for the US workforce and
it took hundreds of workers

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.060
in the film industry, all
supported by copyright law

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.490
to complete the groundbreaking
films Norma Rae, Philadelphia,

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.100
The Thin Blue Line, and
Moonlight and many, many others,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.480
which have inspired
and touched thousands.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.060
Copyright, as the Supreme
Court has stated,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.810 position:56%
is the engine of free expression and
sometimes it is even more than that.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.880 position:56%
Many creators have used their
copyrights to directly improve lives

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.100
through a wide variety
of charitable endeavors.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.450
For example, Anne Frank's
father registered her copyright

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.250
but the proceeds of the sale of The
Diary of Anne Frank have been used

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.090
to fund The Anne Frank
Foundation's charitable initiatives

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.100
and many musicians have often
banded together to create

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.270
and perform benefit songs.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.900
The famous song, We Are
The World for example,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.480
raised more than 75 million
dollars for famine relief.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.210
Finally, as the examples you'll see
during the discussion later today

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.610
demonstrate, artists
often use technology

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.410
and other innovative
tools themselves

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.360
to improve their own
creativity and artistry.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.560
So again, while it may not have
been quite obvious at first glance,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.270
this year's theme for World IP
Day is perfectly, perfectly suited

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.510
to celebrate copyright
as we know it today.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:47.130
[ Applause ]

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.140
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple Claggett : And with
that as a backdrop, we are honored

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.700
to have with us someone who has
championed and supported copyright

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.720
and the Copyright Office directly
throughout his time in Congress,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.500
Representative Doug Collins.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.000
Representative Collins first
came to Washington in 2013.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.060 position:56%
In just a few years, he has been
one of the most passionate advocates

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.630
for creators in the
House of Representatives.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.790
He currently serves as Vice Chair

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.730
of the judiciary's committee
subcommittee on courts,

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.070
intellectual property, and
the internet and in 2014,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.960
he succeeded the late Chairman
Howard Coble as the Co-Chair

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.190
of the Creative Rights Caucus.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.420
Along with democratic Co-Chair
Representative Judy Chu,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.290
Representative Collins works on a
bipartisan basis through the caucus

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.660
to uphold the constitutionally
mandated protections of the rights

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.430
of the creative community.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.020 position:56%
Representative Collins proudly
touts the openness of his home state

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.530
of Georgia, which has provided a
friendly environment for artists

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.060
to engage in creative
processes there.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.860
As he has said before, copyright
is the foundation of innovation

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.030
and innovation is the force
that drives our economy.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.300
We are very, very pleased
and fortunate

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.600
to have Representative Collins
here today to lend his voice

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.620
to this worldwide celebration
of innovation, copyright

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.090
and how it changes
and improves lives.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.510
Please join me in welcoming
Representative Doug Collins.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:28.050
[ Applause ]

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.350
&gt;&gt; Doug Collins: Thank you.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.910
It is a pleasure to be here.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.460
For those who were here last night,
there was a show we did again just

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.010
to continue that whole theme
with the [inaudible] Foundation

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.290
in songwriting and I see my friends
in the audience and see others

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.960
that we've worked with
over the past few years.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.070
I want to thank you for
the invitation to be here.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:51.510
It is a special day, happy
World Intellectual Property Day,

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.810
happy IP Day.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.180
We'll get a cake out, we'll dance,
we'll sing, we'll do whatever,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.480
it's creative, we'll do it!

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.700
One of the things I want
to think today though is,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.930
when you look at what was
just described so eloquently

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:09.090
about the theme for this year's
event is innovation improving lives

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.060
and you can talk about it from
a lot of different perspectives.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.490
You just saw on the screen,
you've heard about it

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.770
as how things have changed
lives, that creative spark,

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.050
that creative use that changes
lives but I am going to come at it

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.450
from just a little bit different
perspective on this World IP Day

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.470
because I am going to come at it
from a perspective of how this

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.690
in many ways, even when I
did not know it, changed me.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.060
How intellectual property, at
the time when I was growing up,

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.140
had no idea of what
that even stood for,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.280
would not even have comprehended
what intellectual property would

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.550
mean to me because if
somebody were to tell me,

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.560
I wouldn't have recognized
it in its form.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.660
In fact, one of the things that
I'll challenge us here today

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.980 position:56%
on World IP Day is to begin to think
differently on how we discuss IP,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.890
intellectual property, copyright,
patent, we go down the list.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.970
If it was important enough
to involve the Constitution

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.590
of the United States, it should
be important enough for us today

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.260
to be able to explain it in
very simple terms to everyone

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.520
in our country on why
this is important

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.820
and why copyright protection
is valuable to the economy

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.760
of not only our financial sector
but it is valuable to the economy

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.210
of the soul, because I was a kid
who grew up in northeast Georgia,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.510
a beautiful part of the world.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.560 position:56%
I'd encourage anyone to come and
especially if you're making a movie,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.330
we have a lot of places for
you to come and if you listen

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.940
to any radio stations,
especially country

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.700 position:56%
in the last few years you understand
that Georgia is the great place

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.730
to do that but I grew up there
as a State Trooper's kid.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.550
My dad was a dedicated public
servant who worked for 31 years

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.850
for the Georgia State Patrol and
in one of those regards it's almost

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.670
like a lot of what I do now, we
did not have a lot of vacation time

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.170
and when we did, we only could get
away for a little bit because dad,

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.040
as a state law enforcement officer,
would have to work those times.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.000
So for me, when I thought of
intellectual property at a time

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.700
which I did not, I just
thought of the things that I,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.910
besides being in the woods, and
being in the fishing, and lake

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.190
and doing things, I would
come back to my room

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.890
and I would have my music,
and I would have my books.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.260
It was once said that no person
could ever be bound to anywhere

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.380 position:56%
as long as there was a book in their
hand and for me, that was true.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.810
For listening to a song that could
take me from the room in my house,

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.000
or my back porch, or
standing in the front yard,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.130
imitating that I was
performing for millions of people

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.390
at a worldwide stage, it was
something inside of me although

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.020 position:56%
for me who could not sing very well,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.690
the words still took me
away to a different place.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:50.070
In books, I found the strength to
carry on sometimes when I was down.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.440
I found the hope to say
there's something better

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.330
and that there's ways that
we can improve our lives.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.700
I found in books and music, I
found the ability to cross oceans

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.460
and to cross plains and to find
out what happens from the beginning

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.460
of time to my time and how
do I apply it to myself?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.460
So the question is
not very hard for me,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.150
how did innovation improve
lives, it improved mine.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.220
It took me from a place
in Gainesville,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.950 position:56%
Georgia to now being humbly standing
before you as the Congressman

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.550
from the ninth district of Georgia.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.490
When that occurs, you begin to
think of how do we communicate.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.950
I mentioned just a moment ago,
I want us to begin to think

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.650
about how we communicate the World
Intellectual Property Day is not

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.990
some off the wall kind of thing
that only lawyers or geeky folks,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.990
or folks who are creators get into.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.760
This is something for everybody.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.950
It is something we should trumpet
and triumph throughout the world

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.340
because it is the very thing that
will inspire the next generation

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.820
of those who will sit in this room

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.960
or those maybe standing behind
this podium but we've got to get

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.020
into the mode of talking about when
we discuss intellectual property,

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.740 position:56%
and for those who have heard me
speak before this is truly a passion

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.040
of mine.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.680 position:56%
I do not want us to talk in sections
and code numbers and bill numbers,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.700
I want to talk about
the dreams, and hopes,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.580
and aspirations that
copyright protects.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.560
It gives the incentive there's
been a move in our country and even

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.650
across the ocean to say that well,

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.450
we don't need as much
copyright protection

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.040
and intellectual property
protection.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.860
We need to make it just
sort of free and available.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.060
I will tell you right now
that if we go down a path

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.600
of weakening our copyright,

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.240
our structure of intellectual
property protections then we're

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.480
weakening the very
system of innovation

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.510
that has driven our
country for over 200 years.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.050
[ Applause ]

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.510
&gt;&gt; Doug Collins: Do
not let anyone tell you

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.860
that the protections
provided in the copyright,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.820
and the intellectual
property protections provided

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.750
in our law are not a
disincentive to creation,

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.290
they're the reason for creation.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.230
Why would I want to go out and not
be able to do what my heart's call,

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.680
what my passion in life to do

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.710
if there were not protected
rights to do so?

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:05.570
I have fed my family for all of
my adult life, I didn't realize it

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.640
until just a few years
ago, with simply what comes

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.360 position:56%
out for the most part of my mind and
my heart and my mouth and my hands.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:20.300
I can farm, I can do a little bit
of construction, I can get by,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.580
I can work but when it came to
the true passion in my life,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.300
I believe God invested in me
the ability to communicate

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.150
and to share vision and
the only way I did that was

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.450
through intellectual property.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.020
Didn't know it at the time,
that's why I came to this job

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.100 position:56%
with such a different perspective
so when you begin to talk about this

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.580
and why it's important and you
talk to other members of Congress,

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.800
and you talk to just your friends
at the grocery store, the bakery,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.300
or the ballgame, you
talk about it in terms

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.710
of innovation changing lives.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.950
You talk about that song that
right now if I said think of a song

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.050
that takes you from this place to
wherever, good or bad sometimes,

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.350
songs can take you that
way, you could name one.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.010
Think of the book that you read
that inspired you to do something

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.640
in your life that maybe changed
your perspective on something

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.110
that you had never thought about
and think of where it came from,

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.750
the heart and passion and
mind of somebody who were able

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.380
to take advantage of the copyright

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.880
and intellectual property
protections we have

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.240
to take us far beyond
where we are now.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.240
We have to think differently.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.850
If we do not think differently
then we're headed down a path

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.520
in letting others define
what this role means.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.980
We're headed down a path
in which others will define

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.130
that limited copyright is
better and that freedom is okay

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.430
and that everybody just graze.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.170
I'm telling you this, if we head

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.720
down that path then we are headed
towards a second rate economy

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.170
because there's nothing
in our economic system

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.570
that is not dependent
upon the protections

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.320
of intellectual property.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.300
When we understand that, then I
have a challenge for you today.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.650
My challenge for us today is to not
simply accept the world right here

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.060
as it is in intellectual property.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.670
My challenge for us today is I
have shared in committee meetings

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.400
and hearings about this all over
this country is, it is now time

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.700 position:56%
as you talk about songs and music,
we talk about how they have changed.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.970
For those of us in the room that
still remember buying a 45 record

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.960
and thinking that was the coolest
thing because you saved up 99 cents

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.660
to go get it, to having a cassette
tape (yes, they still exist),

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:27.650
eight tracks, CDs, streaming,
just in my short lifetime.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.800
So my challenge to you today is,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.050
how do we protect intellectual
copyright,

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.500
how do we protect our copyright
statues and how do we prepare them

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.770
for the next 30 to 40 years,
not just the next one?

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.140
When we get limited in our vision
then we lose the whole scope

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.010
of intellectual property
and copyright protection.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.010
I challenge you today to begin
to think outside of the box.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.480
Disruptive technologies

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.530
and disruptive thoughts
will always be here,

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.590
they're incorporated
inherently into the very system

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.660
because inherently those disrupting
thoughts and disrupting mediums

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.370
that we tend to deal with today,
especially in music all have

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.620
to also come back into
the protection

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.020
of this very same thing
that they're disrupting.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:15.580 position:56%
Some of us don't want to think about
that but the idea for streaming,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.590
the idea for a new way of music
delivery also enjoys the protection

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.260
of intellectual property.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.460
Let's not have us against them,
let's say where do we want to be

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.480
in the years to come so
that in 30 or 40 years,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.320
those sitting in this wonderful
auditorium will say you know,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.380
those folks back in 2017,
they celebrated World IP Day

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:43.890
by saying how it improves lives
and 40 years in the future,

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.790
somebody will be able to
stand here and proudly say,

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.410
they picked up the mantle, they
began to explain it in terms

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.380
that matters to individuals
on the street, and they began

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.900
to make a difference so that they
can stand here on that podium

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.620
on that day and say
intellectual property is something

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.920
worth protecting.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.280 position:56%
Intellectual property is what drives
our economy, it is what makes us

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.390
who we are and I for one am not
going to back up or back down

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:21.280
or look away, because I am that
child from northeast Georgia

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.700
who used the dreams of others
to inspire me to have dreams

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.710
that I now deposit in my wife and
my three children, so that they can

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.370
in turn give that gift to others.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.000
Today, dream big.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.230
Don't step back, don't give up, and
World IP Day will remind everyone

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.710
of the importance of the hopes,
dreams, and ambitious of us all.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.510
God bless you, have a great day.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:18:11.390
[ Applause ]

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.690
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple Claggett:
Thank you so much,

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.330
that was really truly
inspiring, inspiring words.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.670
Now we'll have Keith Kupferschmid,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.090 position:56%
who will give special remarks
before we turn it over to the panel.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.390
Thank you.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.740
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: I guess
I must have drawn the short

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.040
straw here.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.980 position:56%
How do I follow that, not to mention
the Acting Register's fantastic

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:36.200
remarks and then I'm in between a
wonderful panel you have here too.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.000
Can I just simply, would it
be copyright infringement

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.240
to say what he said and
what she said [laughter]?

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.130
I don't know but I do want
to thank a bunch of people.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.720
I want to thank first
off the Copyright Office

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.580
and the Acting Register.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.530
We've been partnering with
them for I guess six years now

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.830
and it's just fabulous
to be able to put this

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.780
on every World IP Day together,
obviously Representative Collins

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.820
who just gave such a
fabulous opening remarks.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.050 position:56%
I also want to thank Pat Collins
from [inaudible] and Barbara Zadina,

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:12.840 position:56%
who is the CEO of Higher Ground, for
helping us put this panel together

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.420
and of course the moderator and the
panelists which you'll see shortly.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.520
So, I am Keith Kupferschmid, the
CEO of the Copyright Alliance.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.460
For those of you who are unfamiliar
with the Copyright Alliance

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.340
and hopefully that's a
dwindling few at this point,

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.810
but for those dwindling
few out there,

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.760
we represent the copyright
interests of close

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.740
to two million individual creators,
creators like photographers

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.980
and performers, software coders and
songwriters, artists and authors,

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.860
and many, many others who make a
living through their creativity.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.580
We also represent the
copyright interests

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:55.420
of over 13,000 different
organizations across a spectrum

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.030
of different copyright disciplines
ranging from motion picture studios

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:04.840 position:56%
and record labels to book, magazine,
newspaper publishers, software

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.600 position:56%
and video game companies, even
sports leagues so anyone pretty much

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.800
who has a copyright interest
whether it's an organization

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.040
or individual is a
member of the alliance.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.150 position:56%
What our mission is, is to dedicate
ourselves to advocating for policies

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.240
that promote and preserve the
value of copyright as well

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.340
as to protecting the rights
of creators and innovators.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:33.740 position:56%
The individual creators and the
organizations that we represent rely

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.560
on copyright to protect
their creativity,

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.050
to protect their efforts, and
to protect their investments

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.100
in the creation and distribution

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.940
of new copyrighted works
for the public to enjoy.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.880
Now, the title of this year's
program the World IP celebration

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.840
as you've heard is
Innovation Improving Lives

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.460
and our event today will focus
on the impact of creative works

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.520
and performances on the lives
of both creators and the public.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.580
In the spirit of that theme,
I'd just like to say a few words

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.610
about the importance of copyright
as a means for spurring innovation

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.740
and spurring creation and how

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.130
that benefits the public
and improves lives.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.150
Copyright is a unique form
of property that is grounded

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.230
in an artist's own creativity,
hard work, and talent.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.660 position:56%
In many ways, it epitomizes the
American dream and I think you heard

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.860
that of course from
Representative Collins

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.840 position:56%
and Acting Register Temple Claggett.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.020
Copyright is about empowerment.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.310
It gives the creator the power
to determine when, where,

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:44.650
and how their creative genius can
be used by others and importantly,

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.430
to get compensated for that use.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.080
A copyright belongs to the creator
from the time that work is created

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.300
and recorded in some tangible
form regardless of whether

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:01.970
that work is registered or any
formal action has been taken.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.460
Copyright is also about freedom.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.460
It is core to protecting
our first amendment rights

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.610
of freedom of expression.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:17.690 position:56%
It also gives authors the freedom to
create and to thrive and the freedom

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.850
to create free from
outside influence.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.310
Importantly, copyright also
supports individuals freedom

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:29.100
to pursue a career and make
a living creating new works

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.750
for the public to enjoy.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:36.170
A focus on and a respect for
creators rights reflects the value

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.730
of our country, that our
country was built on and I think,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.470
as you all realize, has its
roots in our Constitution.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.720
As one of the few constitutionally
enumerated powers

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.260
of the federal government,

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.750
this grant of authority
reflects the founders belief

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.500
that insuring appropriate rights
to creators drives innovation

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.850
and benefits society and
this remains true today just

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.570
as it was true over 200 years ago.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:09.060
A robust, well-functioning, and up
to date copyright act is important

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.660
to all stakeholder,
especially the general public

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.450
which is the ultimate beneficiary
of a well-functioning system.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.350
The public benefits from the
intellectual and cultural diversity

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:26.220 position:56%
that results from the incentives to
create that are rooted in copyright.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.450
Now unfortunately, there are
some groups, let's call them sort

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.090
of copyright non-believers,
I'm not sure if there's any

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:36.790
in the audience here, that
like to pit creators rights

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.370
against the public
interest and in doing so,

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:45.450
they ignore the copyright laws
internal balancing mechanisms

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.360
which is ultimately detrimental
to the goals of copyright.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.780
Setting creators rights on one
scale and the public interest

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.910
on the other is both one
dimensional and detrimental

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.550
to the overall goals of copyright.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:04.850
The underlying assumption is that
creator's interests are distinct

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.180
from the public interest and
that one can only be furthered

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.110
at the expense of the other.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.340
I'm here to tell you
that is not the case.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.010
I think you've heard from others
that that is not the case.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.870
It seems more accurate to
describe the creator's interest

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.740
and the public interest
as inter-related

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.110
and mutually reinforcing.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.820
After all, in a very
basic sense the performer

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.270
and the audience need each other.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.480
Likewise, the author and reader.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.220
The idea behind copyright
is that a marketable right

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:43.020
and tangible expression that a
creator produces is the best way

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.900
to advance both of those interests.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.950
By keeping in mind the intertwined
nature of the private right

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.420
and the public gain, we can
better reach a more balanced

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.890
and healthy approach to
copyright protection so with that,

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.280
let me introduce, not
take any more time away

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.740
from our panel or our moderation.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:06.260
Let me introduce our
moderator Eric Schwartz.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:13.560
Eric is, probably there's no one
better to moderate this session.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.890
He is not only a fantastic attorney
but also has experience in some

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.080
of the things we'll talk about
today with regard to Soundbreaking.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.900
Eric has over 25 years of
experience as a copyright attorney,

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.940
providing counseling on US
and foreign copyright laws.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.730
He has also served as a
transactional attorney experienced

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:37.100
in production, distribution and
financing of musical recordings

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.670
and well as featured
in documentary films.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.030
He also has served as
Chief Production Counsel

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.850
for the PBS series Soundbreaking,
the eight hour documentary

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.050
about the history of recorded
music, which aired nationwide

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.330
in November 2016 and will
be discussed quite a bit

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.340
in the panel that's to follow.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:01.080
As a result of all the work
Eric did on Soundbreaking,

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.610
he received a producer's credit
for his assistance with the product

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.880
so as you hear, Eric kind
of knows just a little bit

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.230
about what we're going
to talk about today.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.630
And in addition to that,
for over the last 20 years,

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.300
he has served on the
Library of Congress' Film

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.000
and Recorded Sound
Preservation Boards.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.550
He has helped found the National
Film Preservation Foundation

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.690
and prior to private practice, Eric
also served as a Senior Attorney

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.340
and Acting General Counsel at
the US Copyright Office so Eric,

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.510
if you'd like to come on up?

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:44.130
[ Applause ]

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.620
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Thank you
Keith and thank you also to Jody

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:53.790 position:56%
and Eileen at the Copyright Alliance
and thank you Karyn and Katie

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.160
at the US Copyright Office and
all at the Copyright Office

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.880
for hosting us and especially thank
you to Congressman Doug Collins,

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.050
both for all your support
for creators and for advocacy

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:14.400
for strong copyright protection
and as demonstrated this morning,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.540
you can hear the passion
that he has for the topic.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.490
As you've heard, World IP Day
is a celebration of the role

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.210
of intellectual property,
copyrights,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.580
and patents in encouraging
innovation and creativity.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.180 position:56%
Our event here this morning is meant
to focus on the role of songwriters,

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.920 position:56%
performers, recording engineers, and
produces in the recording process.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.020
We'll also illustrate the
importance of recording technology

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.880
as a creative tool, we'll show you
a clip in a few minutes, and lastly

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.990
and more broadly, we'll talk about
how copyright law rewards creators

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.400
and in doing so, encourages
them to create

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.810
and disseminate their works
to the general public.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.630
Now, before I introduce the
two guests seated next to me,

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.620
we have a special message
from Linda Perry.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:07.120 position:56%
Linda, as you may know, was listed
on the program but unfortunately had

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.170
to drop off at the last minute
due to a scheduling conflict.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.530
She is after all, a
working producer.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.830
In fact, Linda is a Grammy winning
producer of Christina Aguilera.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:21.550
We'll show a segment of her
work later in the program.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.780
Also, Alicia Keys, Gwen
Stefani, and James Blunt.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.800
She's also a singer/songwriter,
most notably with 4 Non Blondes

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.100
where she composed the song

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.850 position:56%
and she was also their lead vocalist
including their hit song What's Up.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.880
Linda couldn't be here so she sent
a clip in lieu of her attendance

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.460
so John if will, let's
show the clip of Linda.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.390
Well thank you Linda,
and she was being harsh

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.040
on herself for not being here.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:55.800 position:56%
We appreciated that she was going to
redeye in and fly out this evening,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.270
so let me welcome our
two guests who are here.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:04.750
I'll start first to my left
with Steve Bogard and then

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.090
to his left Jason King,
I'll introduce in a minute.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:11.800
Steve is based in Nashville so
he's been a successful songwriter

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.880 position:56%
of hit songs for many performers
including Lee Greenwood, Etta James,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.110
George Strait and Rascal Flatts.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.500
Steve was also fortunate to
work in the recording studio

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.360
with legendary producer and
engineer Tom Dowd during the Derek

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.520
and the Dominos sessions,
when they recorded Layla.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.340
They, who recorded those
sessions if you don't know,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:36.720
was one of those stellar bands,
Eric Clapton, Duane Allman,

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:41.040
I think they had a guitarist
named George Harrison sitting in.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.760
Steve's also an advocate
on behalf of songwriters,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.600
very passionate advocate
on behalf of songwriters,

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.470
working with the National
Songwriter's

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.300
Association International.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.920
To demonstrate some
of Steve's works,

00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.040
we have a short clip we're
going to play for you now.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.490
It's a song entitled Seeing
Red, performed by David Lynch.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.230
The song was a Billboard country
airplay number one just a couple

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:10.180 position:56%
of weeks ago and it's Steve's latest
number one song, he's had many.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:16.510
So John, if you'll play this
clip we'll get a sample.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:22.110
[ Applause ]

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.410
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: Thank you.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.710
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Thank you and as
much as we'd love to hear all of it

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:27.760
and all of Jason's song too
we'll just stop it there.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.480
Tell us a bit about the song.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.660
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: Well, I think
it exemplifies the influences

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.610
of hip-hop and pop and rock
music in the country genre.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:44.400
We wrote it kind of like
a band would write a song,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.510 position:56%
instead of the traditional Nashville
start with a title and a hook

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.480
and a well-crafted lyric we
kind of started with a lick

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.210 position:56%
and somebody said I'm seeing red
and I said well, I know how to write

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.360
that and so it just kind
of moved on from there.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.450
It kind of focuses on
passion and that sort of thing

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.190
and it was a number one record.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.510
I'm proud of it.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.770
[ Applause ]

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.070
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Well
congratulations.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.160
So, to Steve's left is Jason
King, who's based in New York.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.790 position:56%
We've really covered our music bases
so we thought we had with Linda

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.620
from LA, New York, and Nashville.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.010
Jason teaches about the
business of recorded music

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:29.990
and is frequently used as an expert
in documentary films about music

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:33.400
and the history of recorded sound
as well as in copyright cases

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:37.400 position:56%
but as you'll hear in a minute, he's
also a songwriter and performer.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.140
He's a host of both
CNN and NPR podcasts

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.510
on music among his
many other talents.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.270
I love the first line of your
bio which says that Jason is,

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:52.280
and this is the quote, "A musician,
DJ, performer, producers, arranger,

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.780
songwriter, scholar,
curator, and journalist."

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.590
That's something else.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.640
He's Associate Professor
and founding faculty member

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.500
of the Clive Davis
Institute of Recorded Music

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.420
at New York University in
the Tisch School of the Arts.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.350
Some of his classroom guests
have included Pharrell Williams,

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:16.750
two of my favorites the
songwriting duo of Gamble and Huff,

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:21.750
a fan of Harold Melvin and the Blue
Notes among others, Phil Ramone

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.760
and Alicia Keys so
Jason welcome as well.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.300
We have a clip from one of
Jason's songs called Crackdown,

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.930
performed by his band
Company Freak and John,

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.750
if you will let's hear
a bit of that.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.550
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Thank
you for that.

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:42.050
[ Applause ]

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.350
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Tell us
something about the writing

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.690
of that and performance of that.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.140
&gt;&gt; Jason King: Thanks, I wanted to
play some funky music for you early

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.120
in the morning here so
that's my band company Freak.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.630
The idea of the band is to return
to the sound of classic soul,

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.680
funk and disco of the 1970s,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.240
that moment when there was
sophisticated song craft,

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.330 position:56%
and arranging, and production in New
York in particular, groups like Chic

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.180
and Change that congregated
around clubs like Studio 54

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.190
and the Paradise Garage and so
the band is multi-generational.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.500
There's 22 people in the
band, everyone from people

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.390 position:56%
who are 19 years old all the way up
to 75, and there are classic legends

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:26.020
in the band, musicians and singers
from those groups like Chic as well

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.190
as legends in the making.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.770
The reason I wanted
to play that track is

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.370
because I think it's a good
demonstration of the way

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.310 position:56%
that creativity in music can happen
in a way that I would call composite

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.820
so in other words in distinction
from the idea of just going

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.720
into a recording studio with a
band and just putting mics up

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.420
and recording everything,
which is how it used

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.030
to happen way back in the day.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.020
This is really recorded out
of sequence and out of step,

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.150
which is how a lot of recording,
I'm sure Steve can agree a lot

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.480
of recording happens these days

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.460
so that song started
off as a different song.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.080
I has this first line which
is, "Every crooked politician

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.120
on an anti-human mission, good for
them but not for me" not referring

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.930
to any politicians in
this room [laughter]

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.870
but there are some crooked
politicians in the world,

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.380
but not here and so,
I had that line.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.580
I had written a song around
that line but I didn't really

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.450
like the song but I
wanted to keep that line.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:19.380
I was teaching in the Middle
East, I partly teach in New York,

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.530
partly teach in the Middle East
and I kept hearing this word

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.530
on the news crackdown,
crackdown, and so I then came

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.320
up with this line,
"If you're thinking

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.380
about doing a crackdown you'd
better crack down on yourself"

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:33.320
so it was a kind of commentary
of political hypocrisy

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.620
and those kinds of things.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:40.260
And then, recorded part of the
instrumental in Istanbul in Turkey

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.950
with some musicians there, so
then I had a little bit of a track

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:47.170
and brought it back to
New York and finished it

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:52.720 position:56%
with my keyboard player Hubert Eaves
from the group D Train and a number

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.500
of other really talented
session musicians

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.120
and then I still didn't
even have a lyric

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.340 position:56%
so then I put the lyric together and
then I finally recorded the vocal

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.800
on it so that's me singing but I
wanted to do kind of like a Sly

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.380
and the Family Stone kind of early
70s funk thing so I ended up kind

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.670
of pitching my voice
so it sounds like it's

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.130
in a different kind of place.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.730
And then what I did
finally when I had the song,

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.090 position:56%
I actually switched all the parts
so the verse that I had recorded end

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.190
up becoming the chorus, the chorus
was the verse because you can do

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.010
that with technology and so it
actually became a totally different

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.280
song than the one I originally
intended but it's a song

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.250
that I really admire because of
the way that it came together.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.840
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Thank you, which,

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.250
the part about the technology
is a perfect segue way

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.860
because we're going to talk now
for a few minutes about the role

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.210
of technology in creativity and
we're going to demonstrate it

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:45.230
as we are for the remainder
of the program with some clips

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:50.080
from the documentary series which
Keith referred to, Soundbreaking,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.920
Stories From the Cutting
Edge of Recorded Music.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.280
Soundbreaking is, as
Keith mentioned,

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.830
an eight-hour PBS documentary.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:03.110
It aired nationwide last
November over eight nights.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:07.470
Interestingly, for those of
you here in DC, it was produced

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:12.290
by Higher Ground right here at
Dupont Circle, Barbara Zadina one

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.540
of the producers is here
with us today and thank you

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.870
for supplying the clips to us.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.510
It was produced in association

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:26.460
with legendary Beatles Producer Sir
George Martin and by the filmmakers

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.040
in New York, Show of Force.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.790
The series was Sir George's
legacy project to tell stories

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.710
of his experiences 60 years
in the music industry.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.370
He's the one who signed the Beatles

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:42.350
when every other record
label had turned them down.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.860
He and his son Giles worked on
the series for over a decade,

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.950
which in itself tells you something
about the creative process,

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:53.490
that it took 10 years to
make this documentary.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:57.740
Happily, he lived to
see the final cut of it.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:02.040 position:56%
George passed away a year ago March.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.280
The series includes 200 artists,
so pretty much everyone knowing

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:11.290
that this was Sir George's series
said put me in so you have Paul,

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:15.580 position:56%
and Ringo, and Eric Clapton and
Elton John, Linda Perry, Jason King,

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.250
somehow Steve, I don't
know why we missed you.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:24.880
It has 175 archival clips
and hundreds of music cues

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.640
and I should mention since
this is a copyright audience,

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.970
all licensed material.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.830
No fair usage in this series.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.760
The first clip we're going
to watch is six minutes long.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.310
It's from episode 102 and it's
called Painting With Sound

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.410
and it's a fantastic
illustration to Jason's points,

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.910
about the use of technology only
this was the use of technology

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:51.440
in the mid-1960s, in this
case during the recording

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.470
of the Beatles song, Tomorrow
Never Knows and how innovation

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.960
and technology were
used in the process,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.350
even a fairly rudimentary
one of the 1960s so John,

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:08.120 position:56%
if you'll roll the first clip, we'll
watch a segment from Soundbreaking.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:15.620
[ Applause ]

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.640
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: It was
incredible stuff for the time

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.490
and in an analog era, so let me ask
each of you talking a little bit

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:25.900 position:56%
about the use of technology, Jason
will start first I mean you referred

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.720
to it, it is a tool but it
can be an overwhelming tool.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.880
How do you sort of reign it in
with the ability to do everything

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.670
that you want, when you watch
that clip and you realize this was

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:41.740
on four tracks and they had
to sort of live perform it?

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.900
How do you stop yourself from
using too much technology?

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.560
&gt;&gt; Jason King: Legendary producer
Brian Eno always said even

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.500
if you have a lot of options
you should limit the options

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:58.490 position:56%
and you should just use few options
so that you can actually burrow sort

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:02.460
of more deeply into what those
are so he would cite the example

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.610
of Jimi Hendrix, who would
always use the same Stratocaster

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:06.910
and the same guitar.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:11.180
He always had a particular
instrument and amp

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:15.800
that he would always use as
opposed to just trying to run

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.840
through a variety of
different technologies.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.360
Today, we have a lot more options

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.590
and to some degree
options can be a problem

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.660
because if you have too many
options then what you might do is

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.230
for instance, go to a synthesizer
looking for the exact right sound

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.920 position:56%
that you wanted and spend five hours
just looking for that sound rather

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.290
than just taking one sound
and working with that alone.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.080
I mean, this clip is really
interesting because I think

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.150
to some degree, it lands us in
the 60s where you see the rise

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.140
of the recording studio as
kind of a creative laboratory

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.140
and it's the time in which
the studio starts to take

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.370
on this mythology as a place
where these studio wizards

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:56.380
like George Martin, who produced
the Beatles, or Phil Spector go in

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.160
and create these masterpieces
whether it's Sergeant Pepper's

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.890
Lonely Hearts Club Band
or the Revolver album

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.040
or Jimi Hendrix Electric Lady.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.750
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: And it
also compares, you know,

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:10.580
Brian Wilson in the Beach Boys
trying to outdo the Beatles

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.990
and their back and forth thing
and they're using the studio

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.200
as that laboratory as
you say, to do that.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.990
&gt;&gt; Jason King: Yeah, to create new
sounds that we haven't heard before

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.340
from Pet Sounds the Beach Boys,
to Sergeant Pepper's, Revolver,

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:27.100
all of these albums that occurred
in the 60s really opened up the way

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.560 position:56%
that we think about music and its
relationship to technology but prior

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.030
to this era, we were
really in a stage

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.320
of what you'd call a
documentarian producing so the idea

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:40.370
that you would only really
record bands or performers

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:41.870
who were worth recording.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:44.590
Ella Fitzgerald was a great
singer and all you had

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:48.140
to do was just take what she had
done in the club and just bring it

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.300
into the recording studio
and just try and capture it

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.870
in the best way possible with
as much fidelity to the sound

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.660
of what you would hear live in the
recording studio and of course,

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.500 position:56%
the creative decisions that were
being made in this documentarian era

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.260
of producing but for the most
part you were just trying

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.300
to capture a great live performance
but in the 60s with The Beatles,

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.310
what you see is the rise of
trying to create sonic fantasies

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.480
as Tony Visconte, the
producer, was saying here.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.340
You're trying to create
these surreal worlds

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.160
that could never actually exist in
real life so the idea of Revolver,

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.460
the idea of Sergeant Peppers
or Jimi Hendrix albums or Sly

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.060
and the Family Stone or
anybody who was doing this kind

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:31.260 position:56%
of amazing production was to take
you not back to the live performance

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.340
in your head but to take you to
a world that could only exist

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.640
in the context of recording.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Right although the
capturing live is something that's

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:43.460
still very much a skill even today
and is still very much a part

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:48.420 position:56%
of recording and I suppose the
pendulum swing where bands Nashville

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.910
in particular, want to
capture just as accurately

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.630
as possible the fidelity of live.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: In many cases,
I think it's interesting,

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:03.230
I almost see it as a circle because
if you think about Sam Phillips

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.570
and tape delay and the first
people who discovered how

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:11.330
to do echo chamber with a speaker
and a mic and you move that on

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:18.230 position:56%
to maybe visions that a producer has
on up to The Beatles and a situation

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.270
where it couldn't be
reproduced live.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:25.930
I was just at a Keith Urban Grammy
hype party to get you to vote

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:29.550
for him for Album of the Year,
which he deserved and he has a guy

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:33.160
in his band he plays
something called the phantom

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.660
and the phantom is just
a big old box that wheels

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.100
out and it's all samples.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.020
It's an embarrassment of riches of
samples so that every single song

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:47.750
on his record, this guy that plays
the phantom can put the samples

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.830
on for the background
vocals, for the guitar riffs,

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:55.530
for the string section, for
whatever is there so it's almost

00:42:55.530 --> 00:43:00.010
as if we've gone to the
recording studio as an instrument.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:04.170
We bring the recording
studio to the live stage.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.620
There are lots of concerts
that you can go

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.720
to where you know they're
not playing.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.030
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: And that was the
issue of course for The Beatles

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.720
when they came off of the road and
said we're never going to be able

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.580
to play this live,
they just couldn't do

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:25.520
that where the studio was the venue
for making music and now it's sort

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.420
of both, to the criticism
of some of their live shows.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.500
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: And Nashville has
changed just in the last five years

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.710
or so with the ubiquitous
availability of samples

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.020
and we call them track guys.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:45.840
I was just at a writer's retreat
with Warner Brothers and my company

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.840
and the hostess said okay,
I've got you guys all set up,

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.280
I've got four rooms where
everybody's got the rigs

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.330
in the rooms and in each room
we're going to have an artist,

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:59.630 position:56%
we're going to have a track guy, and
we're going to have a writer writer

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.260
and luckily I got to be a
writer writer but we had a lot

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:08.660
of fun gigging her about the
fact that we're all writers,

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:12.570
it's just that some of us are the
traditional songwriter, lyric,

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:18.150 position:56%
melody people and some of us are
more attuned to the track guy thing.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:26.900
It's really hurt the live musician
income stream, the advent of people

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.420
who are programmers who are
excellent at choosing the millions

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.760
of samples there are to choose
from and creating demos,

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.570
creating demonstrations of songs.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.060
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Yeah that's
tough so I'm cognizant of time

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:45.270
and we're going to now show another
clip but keep the discussion going.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:49.430
This is from episode 108 of the
series called, I am my Music,

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:53.090
which focuses on the role
of innovation and technology

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.050
in the dissemination of music,

00:44:55.050 --> 00:45:01.580
which as this is the story
often told the good and the bad

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.880
because simultaneously, this
technology allowed the distribution

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.740
and access to unauthorized
music so John,

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.240
if you'll roll the
second clip please.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.240
What's interesting is that the
second segment sort of ends the era

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.870
and we're ending for time
and then what happened

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:22.620 position:56%
after when the music industry was
allowed to roll out its own services

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.960
of course, there are now 70 music
streaming services in the US

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.650
with 30 million songs so more
music legally is now available

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.410
than at any time in the
history of recorded sound

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:37.650
so the system sort of works.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:41.400
There were a couple of
things in that segment,

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.160
one of course Bob Ludwig's
remarks about Brother in Arms.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:49.330
I bought my CD player when I bought
that album and my stereo system

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.690
so I guess I fit right
in that demographic

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:57.020
but the emotional connection when
Knopfler talks about the songs

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.030
and how you never expect
the emotional connection

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:04.170
that your songs would have but
Jason, you had the line in there

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.430
about private listening
and I was wondering how

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:10.910
if at all has the change to private
listening changed the creative

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:13.540
process, the way in which
songs are written and made

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.810
and then I'll ask you
the same question.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.070
&gt;&gt; Jason King: It's a big question.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:21.340
You know, I think one of the
things that it's easy to forget is

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:26.930
that if you were listening to an
orchestra play classical music

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:30.260
in the 19th century you
were in a particular space

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.530
that was bounded like, you were
in a concert hall listening

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:37.310
to this music, sitting in a
seat and having this experience.

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:42.100
And one of the results of
the technological changes

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:46.540
of the 20th century is that music
suddenly becomes unbounded in space

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.080
through recording so a
recording allows you to be able

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.070
to hear music outside of the space
in which it's actually performed

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:57.570
and so once you can do that, then
it changes the way that we think

00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.380
about music altogether and then
with the advent of other kinds

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:06.660
of technology like magnetic tape
and multi-tracking technology

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.660
that allows you to
record multiple tracks,

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:15.750
suddenly recording becomes a
very different thing altogether

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:19.440
that you can take parts out and
put parts back in, you can add,

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.410
you can subtract, you
can manipulate,

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.530
you can actually change the
nature of sound in a way

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:24.990
that was totally different

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.230
to what you would have
seen in previous eras.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:31.440
And the other, I think big change
in the 20th century is the fact

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.930
that music becomes portable so as
opposed to having to listen to it

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:36.700
in a particular bounded
space in time,

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.920
suddenly you can take
your music with you.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.600
You can listen to your Kanye West
album anywhere that you want to

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.900
and we just take it for granted
but that didn't always exist

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.400
and so once music becomes
unbounded in space and time

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.610 position:56%
and once you can add and subtract
and manipulate it in different kinds

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:56.760
of ways, I think the opportunities
for creativity just kind of go

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.340
through the roof and people can
do all sorts of different things

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.970
with music and so one of the
things we've seen is the rise

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:04.940
of what you'd call headphone
music where there's all

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.260
of this attention to sonic detail.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.060
You see it in the clip from The
Beatles, Tomorrow Never Knows,

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.570
that's a song that you can
listen to in a pair of headphones

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.490
and just hear all of the effects
like panning where a sound goes

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:20.660
from the left side to the right
side, you can hear the treatment

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.140
of John Lennon's voice in that
song and so on so there's a lot

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:27.860
of effects that take place
in music that are intended

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:32.650
for headphone listening and also
listening to music on the go

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.840
so the idea of listening to music
for instance at the gym means

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.920
that you're going to
have different type

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.790
of artist making different types
of music for particular experiences

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:43.720
that have to do with mobility.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.020
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: And
better listening, I assume

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.480 position:56%
or better listeners is something
that all creators can only hope for.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.370 position:56%
I guess the question for Steve,
changing the topic, is the challenge

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.550
of trying to protect your
creative works in this technology

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.210
and this is something
for both of you.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.650
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: No doubt well,
you mention the streaming services.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:08.740
The streaming services
now are the primary source

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.710
of recorded music income in
the United States for this year

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:20.050 position:56%
for the first time so the protection
of intellectual property in terms

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.960
of music, we've had
the longest battle.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.090
Film is a little bit shorter
battle but I can remember

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:32.680
when Napster became really
popular, I had a new song coming

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.300
out on an album by a country group
and the album was set for release

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.780
in a few days and I did an internet
search and it was available free

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:47.020
on 1,100 different sites
and I knew at that point,

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.870
that at least for this
little segment we were kind

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:53.190
of in a bad state.

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:58.790
Part of that is the clinging
nature of major labels at the time,

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:06.490
the panic of loss of control,
which caused I think some decisions

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:10.260
that they've decided to
rethink at this point.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:16.270
But, at this point the
protection of streaming has kind

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:19.590
of replaced piracy in
many ways since it's

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:22.200
so ubiquitous and so inexpensive.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:30.040
That's the good news and for
the sound recording copyright,

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.410
in my research it approaches
fairness,

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:39.490 position:56%
it approaches what a person might
earn if they were selling their CDs.

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:42.810
There's all kinds of
formulas, on 100 streams,

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:46.740
what a download would be or 150
streams what a download would be.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.990
When you're 12, you might
listen to your single 300 times

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:55.570
and when you're 40, you might
listen twice but you still buy it

00:50:55.570 --> 00:51:01.090
so the unfortunate part and the
part that I've worked on a lot is

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:05.870
that the underlying work,
the publishing copyright is

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:11.000 position:56%
so restricted by outdated laws that
the laws have not caught up with it,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.140
that as streaming becomes more
ubiquitous and as sales disappear,

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.700
the way to make a living

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:25.110
for a nonperforming songwriter is
becoming much, much more difficult.

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:29.160
The catalogue income that
many songwriters depend

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:37.410 position:56%
on is falling off a cliff so I think
the main theme here for me as far

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:42.120
as protecting rights is not
just it isn't the services fault

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:52.130
that the laws allow them to charge
a ridiculously unfair royalty,

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:58.140
it is incumbent upon all of us to
make those changes, to support guys

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:02.170
like Doug Collins who are
working slowly but surely,

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:07.420
"Lordy don't the wheels turn
slow " to quote Alan Jackson.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:12.960
If we can change the laws
and the consent degrees

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.710
and let my people go, I think

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:20.080
if we could actually negotiate
the way the labels do,

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.460
I think the technology is
going to be a great boon

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.530
for both creators and the public.

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.110
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Yeah, I mean I
think the last 20 years the perfect

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:34.810
storm of technology, which
is nothing to criticize,

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:36.950
a generational change

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:41.150
of a generation not understanding
why you would pay for music.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.790 position:56%
I remember asking my law school
students wait, you're the generation

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.670
who will pay three
dollars for a cup of coffee

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.330
but you won't pay a dollar
for a downloaded song.

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:53.570
Mine was just the opposite,
I don't get it.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:56.860
You have the combination of things

00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:02.320
and then antiquated laws
and that's where we are.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:08.400
I do think though, that the goal,
Jason you refer to the ubiquity

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.830
of music and making music and the
ability of technology to make it

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:14.990
but the goal here is to
have a professional class.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.810
I mean, you're both professionals.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:20.680
You're writers, you're performers,
you get up every day and you write

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.260
and it's the ability to
sustain an income doing that,

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:29.440
not just the ability of hobbyists
or those of us, in my case I peaked

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:35.140
as a guitarist at 14,
to be able to do that

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.420
but to have the professionals
be able to do

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.720
that and to keep doing that.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: That
was a big point.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.740
I just testified two weeks ago at
the Copyright Royalty Board and one

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:48.390
of our main points was to
actually accentuate the fact

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:51.650
that there is a difference between
amateur and professional content.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:54.670
You can watch Jerry Springer
or you can watch Downton Abbey

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:59.180
and it's fun, amateur
content is great

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.260
but professional content
is different

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:05.000
and the non-performing
songwriter will disappear

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.530
if we don't address these issues.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:08.110
&gt;&gt; Jason King: I think also,

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:12.960 position:56%
I've always asked my students I've
been teaching about 17 years at NYU,

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.830
I always ask my students over the
years how many of you buy music

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:21.340
and I have seen the
numbers drop to nothing.

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.980
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: And it's not good
or bad it's just that's what it is,

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.920
and it's the reality we live with.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.900
&gt;&gt; Jason King: Yeah, what the
internet did is mostly for worse,

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.940
I think it changed the perceptual
value of music to almost zero

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.820
for a lot of young people and so
the interesting thing is that all

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.340
of my students are aspiring
songwriters and producers

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.270
and engineers and so on,
and so I say to them well,

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:45.240
if you don't buy music how do
you plan to make money from music

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.310
and then they're like oh, I've got
to think about that a little bit.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.020
I'm like, that moment
of confusion there

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.350
for you is an important
one to consider.

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:52.650
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Merchandising,

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:54.420
they're going to sell
a lot of t-shirts.

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.810
&gt;&gt; Jason King: Exactly but
streaming services are here to stay

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:06.040 position:56%
and I think it's been a slow
journey to get there but I think now

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.590
since they're here, I see
my students using them

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:10.660
in particular ways that
are also very creative too.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:15.570
They write songs that are shorter
because the idea of writing a song

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:16.870
that was four minutes
long is something

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:18.620
that was created around
the radio format.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.650
Now that we have streaming
and that's the primary way-

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.350
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Or a double
album or a triple album format.

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:24.830
&gt;&gt; Jason King: All of
that, so it's interesting

00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:26.750
to see how creativity is
even shifting in the age.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: It's
almost full circle

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:34.920
from Doug Collins' description of
the 45 that he bought for 99 cents.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.270
It's almost come full circle

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.500
and it's totally changed the
way we write in Nashville,

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.950
and it's totally changed
the way we produce albums.

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:46.780
She was talking about one good
song and 18 bad songs but often,

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.990
some of the classic albums were
a journey that you could go

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:54.070
on for a good 30 minutes and
just interrupt long enough

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:58.480
to flip the side, but they
always had various aspects

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.820
of what the artist wanted to do.

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:02.970
Ten years ago in Nashville,

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:07.780
the art piece was an essential
part of every album we did.

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.160
The thing that George Strait
or Tim McGraw recorded

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.820
that wasn't necessarily perfect for
radio, you didn't necessarily dance

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.000
to it, but people would find it
and go oh man, listen to that

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.350
and they'd tell their friends
and an album would sell.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:21.450
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Deep
listening, as it was called.

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:25.880
So, we've talked about technology
a lot but we're going to look

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:31.150
at a final clip which in some ways
is my favorite five minute clip

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:33.990
from episode 103, called
The Human Instrument,

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:37.470
which focused on the human
voice but more importantly,

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:42.970
this segment is how emotions
and imperfections play a role

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:47.510
in creativity and innovation
in the studio.

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:53.090
[ Applause ]

00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:56.630
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Now that's
really Linda Perry at her best,

00:56:56.630 --> 00:57:00.170
being right in the
moment as artists.

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:05.570
I mean you know, imperfections and
emotion, and that is the connection

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:09.720
of all art, it's the emotional
connection and it's the antithesis

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:14.100
of the technology segments
and the technology discussion.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:18.810
I'll start first with you
to talk about imperfections

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:21.450
and failures and creativity.

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:24.290
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: Well, I spent some
time in Memphis in my early days

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:29.270
and worked with Charlie Rich and
Jerry Lee Lewis and so was familiar

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:31.090
with the Sam Phillips family.

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.880
You've got to laugh when
you say Jerry Lee Lewis.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:38.810
He almost broke my knees with a
piano bench once but when you think

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:43.210
about Sam Phillips and what he
did in creating rock and roll,

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.570
I'm kind of quoting the
Peter Guralnick book,

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:50.480
is one of his ongoing themes
was perfect imperfection

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.940
and he would argue and go to the
wall and he'd let people sing

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:56.560
but he'd go nope, you missed it.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.200
That was the take,
that was the take,

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:02.490
the one that created the
emotion and the connection

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:04.340 position:56%
between the artist and the audience.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:11.420
When multitrack recording and
digital copying became so easy,

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:16.210 position:56%
analog copying was a nightmare but
when digital copying became so easy,

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:22.890
by copying I mean taking five
vocal passes or 100 vocal passes

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:27.150
and picking the best parts of
each and creating a composite.

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:32.470
As a producer, I couldn't stand to
listen to 10, 12 different versions

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:41.470
of a vocal so as the vocal went
down, I had a little cheat sheet

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:48.340
and I would make little marks on
each line on the lyric that had,

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:52.260
I didn't care about pitch too
much, that had a little gravel,

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:58.020
a little hiccough, a Haney,
a little yodely effect,

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:01.530
something that I thought might
communicate the song better,

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:04.870
the emotion the best, and then
I would hand it to the engineer

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:06.800
and go all right, you're in charge.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.300
You can do pitch and you can
move the time but I want a lot

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:16.550
of this stuff in it, and a lot
of people do that to this day.

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:18.770
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Jason, are
you a fan of the imperfection?

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:20.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jason King: Sure, I mean I'm a
perfectionist so I'm always like no,

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.370
I don't want any mistakes but then

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:27.360
of course I actually really
do love the leaving space open

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.940
for imperfection and for
things to occur so I'm working

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:36.520
on a book called Blue Magic and it
looks at feeling in popular music,

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.560
because I think music is a conduit
for feeling and so for instance,

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.810
if you go to see an Aretha
Franklin concert, you would expect

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:45.590
for some kind of soulful
transference of feeling to happen

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:47.670
in the concert and actually,
you would judge the concert

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:50.600
by whether it was soulful or not,

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.170
not whether she hit every
single note exactly on pitch

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:56.430
but whether there was a kind
of soulful feeling in the room,

00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.490
whether the hair stood up
on the back of your neck.

00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:02.240
That's actually how music is moving
you, it's moving through space,

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.830
it's vibrational, it's effecting
you on a vibrational level

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:10.110
so I'm really attracted to that
aspect of music, which is very hard

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:12.390
to talk about because we don't
have really a physical language

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.570
to discuss it, but
it is so essential

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:18.050
to the cultural power of music.

01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:21.650
I just finished liner notes
for the R&amp;B artist D'Angelo,

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:24.480
it's a boxed set that's
coming out of his 90s albums

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.670
and he was particularly influenced
in terms of the rhythm of some

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:32.180
of his work by a hip-hop producer
named J Dilla, who passed away,

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.670
but J Dilla was one of the most
influential producers in hip-hop

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:38.750
over the last 20, 30 years and one
of the things that J Dilla was good

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.880
at was making sure that
when he would program drums,

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.730
in other words not using
an actual live drum set

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:47.530
but actually using drum samples,
you can go into recording software

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:49.310
and actually line up the samples

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:53.240
and you can use a tool
that's called quantization

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.440
where you can actually quantize the
beat and make sure it lands exactly

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.920
on the measures that you want
so instead of having kind

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.770
of sloppy drumming, you
can have exact drumming

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:06.410
and J Dilla was notorious
for actually moving all

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.630
of his drum samples
just a little bit off

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:14.860
so the sound is a little bit wonky
and kind of lurching and loping,

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.680
but it actually changed the
sound of hip-hop in the 1990s

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.640
and everybody wanted the J Dilla
sound and it actually is the sound

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.250
that empowers all of
D'Angelo's records

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.710
and he's won R&amp;B Grammy's
for most of his records.

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:27.710
We'd always go in and
make sure it has this kind

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:31.940
of what he would call inebriated
sort of sloppy drunken feeling

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:33.710
to the beats and it makes no sense.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:36.070
Why should a beat not
actually hit exactly right

01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:39.260
on where you want it to,
but the whole point was

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:44.940 position:56%
to do it deliberately to incorporate
the mistakes deliberately

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:48.170
to create a particular feeling
that would be powerful for people.

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.810
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: You can
actually get tempo maps

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:52.800
for various drummers,
whichever drum.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.700 position:56%
If you want Muscle Shoals behind
the beat you can get a Roger Hawkins

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.000
tempo map.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.500
If you want a jazzier Steve Gadd-

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.400
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: And only
Purdie can do the Purdie shuffle.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: Only Purdie
can do that, he's the only one.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.670
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: But you know,
there are some imperfections

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:12.430
and then there are also the
individual performances and part

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:16.160 position:56%
of this also is the role of the
producer in putting it all together,

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.240
when you break down
tracks and we've done that,

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.940 position:56%
we did that at The Copyright Society
a few years ago with Superstition,

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:27.840
and you listen to Stevie Wonder's
three recordings of the keyboard

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:33.400
and none of them are perfect by
any means, but that's what happens

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.870
in the mixing and in the producing.

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:41.860
We're putting them together, no one
can say that song's not as close

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:45.190
to perfection as it could
be emotionally whether

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:51.510
or not musically, even someone as
adept as Stevie Wonder would be.

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:55.680
So last question and then looking
at our time, we need to wrap

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.990
up our lessons for
up and coming artists

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:02.920
in this day and age of tough music.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.230
I'll start with you and so
what are the lessons for an up

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.820
and coming songwriter/performer?

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steve Bogard: First and foremost,
and I think we've covered some

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.760 position:56%
of this, is you have to move people.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.360
You have to create something that
moves people and I'd like to see

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.710
from the pop perspective it's
more like I'm cooler than you,

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:25.290
wouldn't you like to be me?

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:29.150
From a country perspective, it's
more like my mom gets sick too,

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:30.800
we're having coffee
at the kitchen table.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.410
It's just two funnels that
go two different directions

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:40.110
but for new artists, I'd say
concentrate on the emotion,

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:44.690
concentrate on, I had a kid at
a Bluebird gig show me a tattoo

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:47.910
that said, "Every mile a memory"
and he and his buddy went to Iraq

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:50.910
and that's a song I wrote
that Dierks Bentley did and he

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.720
and his buddy went to Iraq
and they said they were going

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.150
to make memories and
come back together,

01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:56.960
and his buddy didn't come home.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.670
So, if you can find ways to
communicate that kind of emotion

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:09.310
and then secondly, I'd say in this
current climate hedge your bets.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:10.610
Be a producer, be a
performer, be a singer,

01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:13.510
or make friends with
all of the above.

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:19.040
[ Laughter ]

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.340
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: And Jason?

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.610
&gt;&gt; Jason King: You know, I'm
director at a music school

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.420
so I'm constantly giving
advice to students,

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.110
that's literally the nature of the
classes we do but I think I agree

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:31.070
with Steve, I think part of
it is you need to be able

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:35.200
to connect what you do to your
passion so in other words,

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.240
a lot of our students
get into a state

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.550
where they are just thinking
okay, what's on the charts,

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:44.290
how can I be successful by sort
of gaming the system but really,

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:49.070
the most amazing music is some
of the most eccentric, singular,

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:52.030
idiosyncratic music so think of
a song like Bohemian Rhapsody,

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:53.980
I'm writing a book
on Freddie Mercury

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.970
so there's a song that
follows no rules.

01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:59.800
It doesn't even have a chorus,
it's like, seven minutes long,

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.590
it's strange, it's
unusual, but it's one

01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:03.330
of the top pop songs of all time.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:09.030
It doesn't follow a formula,
so I think getting young people

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:13.350
to be able to reach deep into
their bones, into the marrow

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:17.450
of their bones and pull something
out is so meaningful to them,

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:21.850
that's the first step, being able
to connect deeply to what you do.

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:24.250
Second, I also think it's really
important to learn your craft.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.410
I think craft is a word that
we just don't use enough

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:31.540
and it's really important to hone
your craft, to be able to develop,

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.880
and to shape your work over time,
and to fail and to make mistakes,

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.500
and to learn from those
mistakes and so on.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.800
And also, I think it's really
important for young performers

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:44.100
to learn the business, that it
is a business, it's not just show

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.830
and that they should empower
themselves by learning how

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:51.320
to write contracts, read
contracts, learn how revenue flows

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.820
through a system, learn
how to protect themselves,

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:57.060 position:56%
and all of those kinds of things and
when I think you marry that approach

01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.990
to being a really talented artist

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:03.350
with being a really savvy business
person, I think you can do wonders.

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:07.060
&gt;&gt; Eric Schwartz: Sound advice
and the craft part is the hardest,

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.090 position:56%
I think, to communicate to students.

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:13.020
Every writer I know, and I've
known a lot over my career

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.150
as a copyright lawyer,
gets up every day

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:20.450
at some point they have a schedule
and they write and you know,

01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:24.990
90 percent of it no one ever sees
but it's improving the craft.

01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:28.280
I've always thought too it's the
reason why copyright term was

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.200
as long as it was because
there are exceptions.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:38.390
John Lennon died at 40, but most
artists of any kind, writers,

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:43.820 position:56%
songwriters, performers, get better
as they age, as their craft improves

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:51.080
and so you have that
term to recognize that.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:56.270
So, we are out of time and I'm
going to now turn to Karyn,

01:06:56.270 --> 01:07:02.380
who's going to say a few closing
words I'm told and then I want

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.940
to thank very much Jason, Steve,

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:11.440
and Linda for your contributions
both today and beyond,

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.510
for all your hard work
and thank you so much.

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.730
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple Claggett: I will
keep my closing words very short

01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:28.590
and just say Happy World IP Day and
just of course thank our panelists

01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:32.960 position:56%
and our moderator, thank you to Eric
Schwartz, Steve Bogard, Jason King.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.870 position:56%

and uplifting panel on World IP Day,

01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:38.970
so we appreciate your time here.

01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:42.450
I also want to thank the Copyright
Alliance for partnering with us

01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:44.380

the photographs that you saw

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:50.320
in the earlier clip,

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.210
and Soundbreaking for

01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:55.270
