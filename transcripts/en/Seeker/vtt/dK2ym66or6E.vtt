00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.240
If there’s something most of us can agree
on, it’s that lightsabers are awesome.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.960
But this is probably the closest I'll get
to holding a real one... or is it?

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.440
Now, I don’t actually mean mining kyber
crystals or injecting our bloodstreams with

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.750
midi-chlorians (because everyone knows midi-cholorians
are a cop out) — but instead using real

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.470
technology we have today to create something
that looks, acts, and feels like the most

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.350
famous movie weapon ever.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.280
So, how close are we to creating a lightsaber?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, we realize there are no actual scientific
endeavors focused on specifically creating

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.970
a lightsaber at this point in time.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.970
Sadly.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.680
But if we were going to build our own, the
first thing we need to do is look at how the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.010
lightsaber works in the films.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.090
If you're trapped in a cell, you might be
able to use your lightsaber to cut through

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.290
the walls to be able to get your way out.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.929
If somebody is giving you trouble in a cantina,
you can chop off their arm and let them know

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.270
that you mean business.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.470
So our lightsaber needs to be a handheld device
hot enough to slice through what looks like

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.610
steel or cut off a limb.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.780
What else?

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.330
Lightsabers are powered by a Diatium power
cell.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.700
It's essentially the battery for the lightsaber.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.030
The beam of a lightsaber is contained by the
Force powers of the user being channeled through

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.500
the kyber crystals.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.610
Definitely don’t have any of those, so we’ll
need to find an alternate power source.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.710
Probably the characteristics of a lightsaber
that make it the most dramatic and exciting

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.530
to watch are one, the glowing beam, but two,
the sounds that it makes as you swing it back

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.350
and forth.That is very iconic.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.780
Or the crashing sound of two beams coming
together.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.060
Those are some of the most iconic aspects
of a lightsaber.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.560
Ok, so in total, there are five key functions
our lightsaber has to fulfill.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.310
A natural starting place for using real life
technology might be with light itself, given

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.310
the name.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.370
Even George Lucas has previously, and confusingly,
referred to the lightsaber as a laser sword.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.420
And although it’s true that lasers can be
powerful enough to cut through metal or cauterize

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.510
a wound, like current gamma knife technology
we use in hospitals, they do present some

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.360
other challenges in terms of our five criteria.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.280
So a laser lightsaber essentially is a very
high-powered flashlight or a very high-powered

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280
laser pointer.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.190
Your standard laser pointers obviously are
not going to be able to cut through metal

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.190
or anything like that.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.480
That would be quite dangerous for all your
screens and PowerPoint slides.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.440
But if you’ve ever held a laser pointer,
you know it doesn’t look anything like a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.950
lightsaber for two big reasons — one, you
can’t really see the beam from the side.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.880
And two, the beams go on infinitely, rather
than the roughly 1 meter long lightsaber.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.570
If you want to contain the beam in a finite
length, the best or easiest way to do that

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.690
with light would be to just have a mirror
that can retract or be extended from the hilt

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.131
of the lightsaber and then that is able to
reflect the light back and forth to create

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.410
a contained beam of light.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.370
And it's just not going to have the look of
a lightsaber.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.120
It's going to have the look of a flashlight
with a mirror on the end, even if that flashlight

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.590
is really powerful.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.570
Also, if you were to have a lightsaber battle
using this method, it would be the metal contraptions

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.090
holding your mirrors clunking into each other
rather than the actual beams of light, because

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.480
the beams of light, spoiler alert, would not
actually collide with one another.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.160
One light beam will just pass through another
light beam.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.819
But what if that could be changed?

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.480
Some researchers at Harvard and MIT found
that it would be possible to have photons

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.569
work together as they move through ultra-cold
rubidium atoms and behave much like a molecule

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.830
in the traditional sense.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.069
This study was able to show that they could
do this for two, three photons, but in principle

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.810
if we could do this for millions upon billions
of photons we could create a unified beam

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.000
of light that would be very much like a lightsaber.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.180
Photonic molecules are very difficult to make.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.830
They can only be generated in very precise
experimental conditions.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.540
Ah, I thought there might be a catch.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.310
Turning light into molecules really just opens
up a whole new can of space slugs, since it

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.460
would need to happen in a supercooled vacuum
and a beam wouldn’t actually cut through

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.460
anything.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.860
It again kind of takes away from the excitement
and the awesomeness of a lightsaber.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.389
I think the best method for generating a lightsaber
in the real world would be to create a highly

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.910
contained plasma.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.550
A plasma is one of the four states of nature.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.020
You know about solid, liquid, and gas.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.440
Plasma is, perhaps, like more gas than gas.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.470
What it is, is when you heat up gas so much
that you're actually breaking apart the atoms

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.090
so that the electrons and the center of the
atoms are no longer connected together, and

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.900
they kind of move around next to one another.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.560
If you want to see a plasma, go outside and
don't look directly at the sun, but know that

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.020
if you were to look at the sun, that is a
big ball of plasma.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.070
Plasma has a lot of uses.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.750
They can cut through metal very impressively.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.880
Some surgeons will use plasma scalpels.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.210
And these plasma scalpels actually make a
more precise cut than an ordinary scalpel.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.530
Now, this is definitely starting to sound
more like a lightsaber — plasma checks the

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.670
box for being hot enough, but I sense another
catch.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.000
It's incredibly difficult to hold a plasma
in, and so if you don't have strong magnetic

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.400
fields, it doesn't work.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.370
This is exactly the problem that tokamaks
face, the donut shaped devices that produce

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.620
controlled thermonuclear fusion power.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.040
The trouble has to do with the fact that plasma
is made up of charged particles.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.680
Charged particles moving around make their
own magnetic field.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.350
And so, you have the magnetic field of the
containment, but then you have the magnetic

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.600
field the plasma makes, and the two of them
interact, and it's very hard to keep a stable

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.970
field with that very, very complicated process.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.010
Right now if we tried to create a plasma lightsaber,
it would look nothing like what we'd imagine,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.860
and it would in fact be so large that we would
be unable to hold it.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.930
The smallest containers that can contain plasma
are still large enough that a human can walk

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:17.930
through them.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.930
Right.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.880
Ok, so until we can downsize that to a handheld
hilt to clip on our belt, do we have other

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.889
options in the meantime?

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:31.360
One possibility is that inside a lightsaber,
there's like a telescopic rod.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.590
So, like an old car antennae, the telescope
would come out of a lightsaber, perhaps, made

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.951
of ceramic so it wouldn't melt and that would
be the thing that would set the magnetic field

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.449
that would then control the plasma.

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.070
So, we would press the button on the hilt
and the ceramic rod would begin to come out

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.170
of the handle, producing the crucial buzzing
sound and the shape.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:59.740
Refractory ceramics and alloys also have melting
points as high as 4215 degrees celsius, so

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.430
they would be able to withstand plasma as
hot as 1370 degrees celsius — that is hot

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.300
enough to melt through a steel door.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.180
Essentially, the plasma would cut through
and the rod would follow through the hole.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.200
Ok, let’s acknowledge the bantha in the
room — that kind of heat is going to be

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.780
dangerous to be around.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.220
Essentially imagine having a cylindrical piece
of the sun three inches away from your hand.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.630
It's not going to go well for you unless you
have some kind of really, really insulating

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.919
gloves, probably got to be made out of tungsten.

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:32.919
Done.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:33.919
What about the color?

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.630
The color is very important.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.410
Luckily, generating the different colors of
a lightsaber is actually easy.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.390
All that matters is the gas that's in the
plasma.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.419
Change the gas, get a different color.

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:47.850
Exactly like neon lights.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.770
So that would mean using neon for a reddish
lightsaber, krypton for a green, helium or

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.320
sodium for a yellow, and xenon or argon for
a blue.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.520
And just for you Samuel L. Jackson: mercury
for purple.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.790
Problem with that is it gives off ultraviolet
light, too, which if you look at it too long

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:04.790
will make you blind.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.870
Ok so maybe we skip roleplaying Mace Windu.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.870
Got it.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.520
What about dueling with this prototype?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.270
If the idea of the telescoping center of the
lightsaber is real, then it actually could

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.320
be those two telescoping central rods are
touching one another.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.169
But, even if somehow we were able to make
magnetic fields that didn't have the telescoping

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:28.539
rod, what I was thinking is perhaps it would
be the interaction of the magnetic field of

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:31.110
one lightsaber with the plasma of the other
one.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.709
After all, if the magnetic fields can contain
the plasma of our saber, it will also repel

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:39.729
and interact with the plasma of the other
saber.

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:43.709
So, it's a bit of a stretch, but that's maybe
some way that could happen.

00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:47.709
In order to power this lightsaber design,
we’re likely going to need millions of amps

00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:52.589
of current to generate a magnetic field powerful
enough to contain this plasma.

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:54.939
Unless...we use antimatter?

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.000
Antimatter is something that sounds like science
fiction, but it's fact.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.050
If you mix antimatter and matter together,
you get a crazy amount of energy.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.869
How crazy is crazy?

00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:12.410
A single gram of antimatter could produce
an explosion equal to an atomic bomb.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.769
So maybe, just maybe inside the hilt of a
lightsaber, is a tiny few micrograms of antimatter,

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:21.829
and if there is, you got all the power you
need.

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:27.240
In 2006, NASA actually funded research to
explore the possibility of designing an antimatter-powered

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240
spaceship.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.379
Antimatter has the highest energy density
of any known substance.

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:36.839
We have been able to create a nanogram of
antimatter in the Large Hadron Collider, but

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.149
it wasn’t cheap.

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:43.629
current estimates put the cost of producing
just 1 gram of antimatter at about 25 billion

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:44.879
US dollars.

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:50.410
Which is a shame, because a super teeny amount
would fit perfectly in our handheld lightsaber

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:56.439
hilt, and wouldn’t come with the drawbacks
of say, radiation from a nuclear powered lightsaber.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.480
Ok, I think I already know the answer, but
how close are we to creating a lightsaber?

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.060
Although a number of advances are required
for this, individually all of these advances

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:17.110
are currently being researched to try to generate
better batteries, to try to generate smaller

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.450
contained plasmas, and to generate high temperature
superconductors.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:25.899
I would probably estimate that we're still
a century or two away from having a lightsaber

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:27.070
as we know and love them.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.550
We can generate variations on a lightsaber
today with current technology.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.160
It's just a matter of which aspects of your
childhood dreams you want to give up.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.009
I'm not sure that we'll ever be able to make
a lightsaber, and that certainly is a shame,

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:44.959
because it is an elegant weapon for a more
civilized age.

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:48.189
You know?

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:51.839
Lightsabers might not be real, but I want
them to be.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:55.899
