00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.040
- Meteorites are very difficult
to fashion into objects.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.830
Anybody, even today, who has
ever worked with a meteorite

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.540
will tell you that because
of the high nickel content,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.500
they're very, very brittle and
very difficult to work with.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.540
NARRATOR: Considering the
difficulties of working

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.710
with meteoric metal, even
with today's technology,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.670
how did metallurgists 3,300
years ago perform such tasks?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.830
JEFF WILLIAMS: This dagger
is completely out of place

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.580
in the fact that, unlike
simple objects like beads that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.250
can be simply hammered
out and rolled,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.580
this has been perfected
to a point where

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.080
it has no hammer marks on it.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.540
It's completely smooth.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.250
It has a nice edge all
the way around on it.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.380
It almost looks as
if it had been cast.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.250
But in order to
achieve that, you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.170
would have to reach
temperatures of 3,000 degrees

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.830
in order to melt that
meteorite, and then, of course,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.380
add the necessary fluxes
to get the impurities out,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.290
and then cast the blade,
which brings up even more

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.580
questions for the researchers.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.580
If they were smelting iron, it
would change our whole outlook

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.120
on Egyptian history.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.750
NARRATOR: What could
explain the presence

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.420
of this mysterious metal
dagger in King Tut's tomb

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.920
when no other similar artifacts
have been found in Egypt

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.210
dating back to this period?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.460
Might Egyptian metallurgists
have had help working

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.710
with this difficult compound?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.750
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.250
and suggest stories found
throughout the ancient world

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.880
reveal that extraterrestrials
taught our ancestors

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.170
the secrets of
metallurgy in order

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.830
to help move society forward.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.500
True metallurgy, in the sense
of putting different metals

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.460
together as alloys, dates back
to maybe 3,800 BC, when bronze

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.580
was first discovered as an
alloy of tin and copper,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.830
maybe the second most
important development

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.620
after the harnessing of fire.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.670
As we think of modern times
and our emphasis on technology,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.420
here is the secret
roots to all of that.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.580
Stories emerged out of
all the religious systems

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.120
about the gods as metalworkers.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.290
Hephaestus in the
Greek imagination

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.620
made the weapons and
the armor for the gods.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.330
In the Celtic imagination, it
was the great goddess Brigid,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.500
who made beautiful and wonderful
and powerful things into metal

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.170
and then into fabricated form.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.710
In Japanese lore, Kanayago
came to Earth to teach

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.290
the people metalworking.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.710
JASON MARTELL: There seems to
be a ubiquitous understanding

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.830
from ancient cultures that
metallurgy is from the heavens.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.880
Could there be some tie that
in the past certain abilities

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.710
were originally brought to man,
possibly by extraterrestrials,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.250
and things we would create had
a certain energy or myth about

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.420
them that still is alive today?

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.380
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.210
the most compelling
of these stories

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.420
originates in the same place as
King Tut's mysterious dagger--

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.420
Egypt, where they
worshipped a sacred object

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.420
called the Benben stone.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.250
Ancient Egyptian texts
describe the Benben

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.250
stone as a meteoric, iron object
that belongs to the heavens.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.170
The original Benben stone
mysteriously disappeared,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.330
but many ancient
depictions of it remain.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.580
The Benben stone has
a very strange origin.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.580
It is a thought that the Benben
stone descended from the sky

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.120
like a firebird.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.080
If you look at the
Benben stone, sometimes

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.120
it is described or depicted with
people coming out of the stone.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.790
Now to me, this looks very
similar to a lunar module.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.080
You have the idea
that this firebird

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.960
is descending from the
sky with fire and smoke.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.580
Well, if you look at
a rocket descending,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.750
these are firebirds.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.670
So our ancestors perhaps
witnessed some type

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.000
of a craft descending
from the sky, out of which

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.170
these extraterrestrials
came, which set in motion

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.170
our technological evolution.
