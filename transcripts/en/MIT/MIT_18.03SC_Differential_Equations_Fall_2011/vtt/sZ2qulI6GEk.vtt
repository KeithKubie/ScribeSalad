00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.754
Today, and for the next two
weeks, we are going to be

00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:14.787
studying what,
for many engineers and a few

00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:18.469
scientists is the most popular
method of solving any

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:22.512
differential equation of the
kind that they happen to be,

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:26.555
and that is to use the popular
machine called the Laplace

00:00:26.555 --> 00:00:30.030
transform.
Now, you will get proficient in

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.389
using it by the end of the two
weeks.

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:36.188
But, there is always a certain
amount of mystery that hangs

00:00:36.188 --> 00:00:38.809
around it.
People scratch their heads and

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.167
can't figure out where it comes
from.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:43.853
And, that bothers them a lot.
In the past,

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:47.784
I've usually promised to tell
you, the students at the end of

00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:50.601
the two weeks,
but I almost never have time.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:54.400
So, I'm going to break that
glorious tradition and tell you

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.414
up front at the beginning,
where it comes from,

00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:02.000
and then talk very fast for the
rest of the period.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.398
Okay, a good way of thinking of
where the Laplace transform

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:10.492
comes from, and a way which I
think dispels some of its

00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:13.374
mystery is by thinking of power
series.

00:01:13.374 --> 00:01:17.924
I think virtually all of you
have studied power series except

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:22.549
possibly a few students who just
had 18.01 here last semester,

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.962
and probably shouldn't be
taking 18.03 anyway,

00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:28.236
now.
But anyway, a power series

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:31.345
looks like this:
summation (a)n x to the n.

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:35.818
And, you sum that from,

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:40.484
let's say, zero to infinity.
And, the typical thing you want

00:01:40.484 --> 00:01:44.755
to do with it is add it up to
find out what its sum is.

00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:48.392
Now, the only way I will depart
from tradition,

00:01:48.392 --> 00:01:52.742
instead of calling the sum some
generic name like f of x,

00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:57.487
in order to identify
the sum with the coefficients,

00:01:57.487 --> 00:01:59.938
a, I'll call it a of x.

00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, I want to make just one
slight change in that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.885
I want to use computer
notation, which doesn't use the

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:11.011
subscript (a)n.
Instead, this,

00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:14.750
it thinks of as a function of
the discreet variable,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.997
n.
In other words,

00:02:15.997 --> 00:02:19.369
it's a function which assigns
to n equals zero,

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:23.548
one, two, three real numbers.
That's what this sequence of

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:27.434
coefficients really is.
So, the computer notation will

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:32.187
look almost the same.
It's just that I will write

00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:37.210
this in functional notation as a
of n instead of (a)n.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.584
But, it still means the real
number associated with the

00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:45.311
positive integer,
n, and everything else is the

00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:48.146
same.
See, what I'm thinking of this

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:53.007
as doing is taking this discreet
function, which gives me the

00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:56.572
sequence of coefficients of the
power series,

00:02:56.572 --> 00:03:02.000
and associating that with the
sum of the power series.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.048
Let me give you some very
simple examples,

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:08.617
two very simple examples,
which I think you know.

00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:13.005
Suppose this is a function one.
Now, what do I mean by that?

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.830
I mean it's the constant
function, one.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.697
To every positive integer,
it assigns the number one.

00:03:19.697 --> 00:03:23.266
Okay, what's a of x?
What I'm saying is,

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.423
in other words,
in this fancy,

00:03:25.423 --> 00:03:28.769
mystifying form,
is all of these guys are one,

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.222
what's a of x?
One plus x plus x squared plus

00:03:33.222 --> 00:03:37.518
x cubed.
Look, you are supposed to be

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.962
born knowing what that adds up
to.

00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:43.518
It adds up to one over one
minus x,

00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:47.444
except that's the wrong answer.
What's wrong about it?

00:03:47.444 --> 00:03:49.962
It's not true for every value
of x.

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:54.259
That's only true when x is such
that that series converges,

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:58.481
and that is only true when x
lies between negative one and

00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:03.123
one.
So, it's not this function.

00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:07.449
It's this function with its
domain restricted to be less

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.696
than one in absolute value.
What does that converge to?

00:04:11.696 --> 00:04:16.258
If x is bigger than one,
the answer is it doesn't

00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:19.168
converge.
There's nothing else you can

00:04:19.168 --> 00:04:21.764
put here.
Okay, let's take another

00:04:21.764 --> 00:04:23.730
function.
Suppose this is,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.000
let's see, one over n
you probably won't know.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.199
Let's take one you will know,
one over n factorial.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.588
Suppose a of n is the function

00:04:35.588 --> 00:04:38.122
one over n factorial,

00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:41.742
what's a of x?
So, what I'm asking is,

00:04:41.742 --> 00:04:46.158
what does this add up to when
the coefficient here is one over

00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:47.823
n factorial?

00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:51.805
What's summation x to the n
over n factorial?

00:04:51.805 --> 00:04:54.049
It is e to the x.

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:58.248
And, this doesn't have to be
qualified because this is true

00:04:58.248 --> 00:05:02.285
for all values of x.
So, in other words,

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:05.937
from this peculiar point of
view, I think of a power as

00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:09.318
summing the operation,
of summing a power series as

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:13.106
taking a discreet function
defined for positive integers,

00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:16.690
or nonnegative integers,
and doing this funny process.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.004
And, out of it comes a
continuous function of some

00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:22.439
sort.
And, notice what goes in is the

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.009
variable, n.
But, what comes out is the

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.000
variable, x.
Well, that's perfectly natural.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.850
That's the way a power series
is set up.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.281
So, the question I ask is,
this is a discreet situation,

00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:43.118
a discreet summation.
Suppose I made the summation

00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:48.648
continuous instead of discreet.
So, I want the continuous

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:54.670
analog of what I did over there.
Okay, what would a continuous

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.336
analog be?
Well, instead of,

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:02.372
I'll replace n zero,
one, two, that will be replaced

00:06:02.372 --> 00:06:08.000
by a continued,
that's a discreet variable.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.189
I'll replace it by a continuous
variable, t, which runs from

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:17.148
zero to infinity,
and is allowed to take every

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:22.601
real value in between instead of
being only allowed to take the

00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:27.000
values of the positive
nonnegative integers.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.125
Okay, well, if I want to use t
instead of n,

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:34.414
I clearly cannot sum in the
usual way over all real numbers.

00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:38.411
But, the way the procedure
which replaces summation over

00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:42.700
all real numbers is integration.
So, what I'm going to do is

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.625
replace that sum by the integral
from zero to infinity.

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:50.187
That's like the sum from zero
to infinity of what?

00:06:50.187 --> 00:06:54.039
Well, of some function,
but now n is being replaced by

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.929
the continuous variable,
t.

00:06:55.929 --> 00:07:00.000
So, this is going to be a
function of t.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.041
And, how about the rest of it?
The rest I will just copy,

00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.072
x to the n'th.
Well, instead of n I have to

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:09.597
write t and dt.
And, what's the sum?

00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:13.422
Well, I'll call the sum,
what's the sum a function of?

00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:17.175
I integrate out the t.
So, that doesn't appear in the

00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:19.412
answer.
All that appears is this

00:07:19.412 --> 00:07:21.432
number, x, this parameter,
x.

00:07:21.432 --> 00:07:23.886
For each value of x,
like one, two,

00:07:23.886 --> 00:07:26.917
or 26.3, this integral has a
certain value,

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:30.742
and I can calculate it.
So, this is going to end up as

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:35.000
a function of x,
just as it did before.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.489
Now, I could leave it in that
form, but no mathematician would

00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:42.875
like to do that,
and very few engineers either.

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:45.598
The reason is,
in general, when you do

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:50.162
integration and differentiation,
you do not want to have as the

00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:53.032
base of an exponential something
like x.

00:07:53.032 --> 00:07:57.154
The only convenient thing to
have is e, and the reason is

00:07:57.154 --> 00:08:01.571
because it's only e that people
really like to differentiate,

00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:05.997
e to the something.
The only thing is that people

00:08:05.997 --> 00:08:08.820
really like to differentiate or
integrate.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.089
So, I'm going to make this look
a little better by converting x

00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:17.014
to the t to the base e.
I remember how to do that.

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:21.215
You write x equals e to the log
x and so x to

00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:25.416
the t will be e to the
log x times t,

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:28.991
if you want.
Now, the only problem is I want

00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:32.973
to make one more little change.
After all, I want to be able to

00:08:32.973 --> 00:08:36.314
calculate this integral.
And, it's clear that if t is

00:08:36.314 --> 00:08:39.012
going to infinity,
if I have a number here,

00:08:39.012 --> 00:08:40.939
for example,
like x equals two,

00:08:40.939 --> 00:08:44.151
that integral is really quite
unlikely to converge.

00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:46.720
For example,
if a of t were just

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.868
the constant function,
one, the integral certainly

00:08:49.868 --> 00:08:52.373
wouldn't converge.
It would be horrible.

00:08:52.373 --> 00:08:56.291
That integral only has a chance
of converging if x is a number

00:08:56.291 --> 00:08:59.118
less than one,
so that when I take bigger and

00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:02.008
bigger powers of it,
I get smaller and smaller

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:04.831
numbers.
Don't forget,

00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.094
this is an improper integral
going all the way up to

00:09:08.094 --> 00:09:10.014
infinity.
Those need treatment,

00:09:10.014 --> 00:09:13.021
delicate handling.
All right, so I really want x

00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:16.668
to be less than one.
Otherwise, that integral is

00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:20.123
very unlikely to converge.
I'd better have it positive,

00:09:20.123 --> 00:09:23.770
because if I allow it to be
negative I'm going to get into

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.969
trouble with negative powers,
see what's minus one,

00:09:26.969 --> 00:09:29.592
for example,
to the one half when t is one

00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:32.689
half.
That's already imaginary.

00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:35.864
I don't want that.
If you've got an exponential,

00:09:35.864 --> 00:09:38.567
the base has got to be a
positive number.

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:41.000
So, I want x to be a positive
number.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.918
All right, if x in my actual
practices going to lie between

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.364
zero and one in order to make
the integral converge,

00:09:48.364 --> 00:09:50.256
how about log x?
Well, log x,

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.972
if x is less than one,
so log x is going to be

00:09:53.972 --> 00:09:57.824
less than zero,
and it's going to go all the

00:09:57.824 --> 00:10:02.597
way down to negative infinity.
So, this means log x is

00:10:02.597 --> 00:10:05.376
negative.
In this interesting range of x,

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:08.155
the log x is always going to be
negative.

00:10:08.155 --> 00:10:11.907
And now, I don't like that.
The first place I'd like to

00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:15.728
call this by a new variable
since no one uses log x as a

00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:18.229
variable.
And, it would make sense to

00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:20.938
make it a negative,
to make it negative,

00:10:20.938 --> 00:10:24.134
that is, to write log x is
equal to negative s.

00:10:24.134 --> 00:10:28.233
Let's put it on the other side,
in order that since log x is

00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:32.054
always going to be less than
zero, then s will always be

00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:35.764
positive.
And it's always more convenient

00:10:35.764 --> 00:10:39.009
to work with positive numbers
instead of negative numbers.

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:42.254
So, if I make those changes,
what happens to the integral?

00:10:42.254 --> 00:10:44.588
Well, I stress,
all these changes are just

00:10:44.588 --> 00:10:48.174
cosmetic to make things a little
easier to work with in terms of

00:10:48.174 --> 00:10:49.370
symbols.
First of all,

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.557
the a I'm going to change.
I don't want to call it a of t

00:10:52.557 --> 00:10:55.745
because most people
don't call functions a of t.

00:10:55.745 --> 00:10:58.876
They call them f of t.
So, I'll call it f of t.

00:10:58.876 --> 00:11:01.779
x is e to the log x,
which is e to the minus s.

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:06.266
So, x has its name changed to e

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:09.556
to the minus s.
In other words,

00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:13.942
I'm using as the new variable
not x any longer but s in order

00:11:13.942 --> 00:11:17.597
that the base be e.
t, I now raise this to the t'th

00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:21.618
power, but by the laws of
exponents, that means I simply

00:11:21.618 --> 00:11:24.104
multiply the exponent by t,
and dt.

00:11:24.104 --> 00:11:28.125
And now, since I'm calling the
function f of t,

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:32.000
the output ought to be called
capital F.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.751
But it's now a function,
since I've changed the

00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:39.502
variable, of s.
It's no longer a function of x.

00:11:39.502 --> 00:11:42.927
If you like,
you may think of this as a of,

00:11:42.927 --> 00:11:46.107
what's x?
x is e to the negative s,

00:11:46.107 --> 00:11:49.858
I guess.
I mean, no one would leave a

00:11:49.858 --> 00:11:53.935
function in that form.
It's simply a function of s.

00:11:53.935 --> 00:11:57.115
And, what is that?
So, what have we got,

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:58.828
finally?
What we have,

00:11:58.828 --> 00:12:00.948
dear hearts,
is this thing,

00:12:00.948 --> 00:12:05.759
which I stress is nothing more
than the continuous analog of

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:12.308
the summation of a power series.
This is the discrete version.

00:12:12.308 --> 00:12:16.527
This is by these perfectly
natural transformations the

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:19.393
continuous version of the same
thing.

00:12:19.393 --> 00:12:23.771
It starts with a function
defined for positive values of

00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.636
t, and turns it into a function
of s.

00:12:26.636 --> 00:12:29.900
And, this is called the Laplace
transform.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.119
Now, if I've done my work
correctly, you should all be

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:37.860
saying, oh, is that all?
But, I know you aren't.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.000
So, it's okay.
You'll get used to it.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.863
The first thing you have to get
used to is one thing some people

00:12:46.863 --> 00:12:50.569
never get used to,
which is you put in a function

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:53.426
of t, and you get out a function
of s.

00:12:53.426 --> 00:12:56.823
How could that be?
You know, for an operator,

00:12:56.823 --> 00:13:00.297
you put in 3x,
and you get out three if it's a

00:13:00.297 --> 00:13:04.210
differentiation operator.
In other words,

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.651
when you have an operator,
the things we've been talking

00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:13.171
about the last two or three
weeks in one form or another,

00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:16.481
at least the variable doesn't
get changed.

00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:21.325
Well, but for a transform it
does, and that's why it's called

00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:24.554
a transform.
So, the difference between a

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:29.317
transform and an operator is
that for a transform a function

00:13:29.317 --> 00:13:34.000
of t comes in,
but a function of s comes out.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.258
The variable gets changed,
whereas for an operator,

00:13:37.258 --> 00:13:40.581
f of t goes in and
what comes out is g of t,

00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:43.709
a function using the
same variable like

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:47.032
differentiation is a typical
example of an operator,

00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:50.551
or the linear differential
operators we've been talking

00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:52.832
about.
Well, but this doesn't behave

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.373
that way.
The variable does get changed.

00:13:55.373 --> 00:13:58.110
That's, in fact,
extremely important in the

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.687
applications.
In the applications,

00:14:01.687 --> 00:14:05.230
t usually means the time,
and s very often,

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.292
not always, but very often is a
variable measuring frequency,

00:14:10.292 --> 00:14:14.004
for instance.
But, so that's a peculiar thing

00:14:14.004 --> 00:14:18.729
that's hard to get used to.
But, a good thing is the fact

00:14:18.729 --> 00:14:22.441
that it's a linear transform.
In other words,

00:14:22.441 --> 00:14:26.828
it obeys the laws we'd love and
like that the Laplace

00:14:26.828 --> 00:14:30.540
transform-- oh,
I never gave you any notation

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.581
for the laplace transform.
Hey, I'd better do that.

00:14:35.581 --> 00:14:39.009
Okay, so, some notation:
there are two notations that

00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:41.250
are used.
Your book mostly uses the

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.006
notation that the laplace
transform of f of t is capital F

00:14:45.006 --> 00:14:48.500
of s,
uses the same letter but with

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.004
the same capital.
Now, as you will see,

00:14:51.004 --> 00:14:54.365
there are some places you
absolutely cannot use that

00:14:54.365 --> 00:14:56.277
notation.
It may seem strange,

00:14:56.277 --> 00:14:59.572
looks perfectly natural.
There are certain laws you

00:14:59.572 --> 00:15:03.000
cannot express using that
notation.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.779
It's baffling.
But, if you can't do it this

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.823
way, you can do it using this
notation instead.

00:15:08.823 --> 00:15:11.470
One or the other will almost
always work.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.639
So, I'll use my little squiggly
notation, but that's what I use.

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:19.345
I think it's a little more
vivid, and the trouble is that

00:15:19.345 --> 00:15:21.595
this piles up too many
parentheses.

00:15:21.595 --> 00:15:23.647
And, that's always hard to
read.

00:15:23.647 --> 00:15:26.955
So, I like this better.
So, these are two alternate

00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:32.485
ways of saying the same thing.
The Laplace transform of this

00:15:32.485 --> 00:15:36.171
function is that one.
Okay, well, let's use,

00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:39.857
for the linearity law,
it's definitely best.

00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:44.742
I really cannot express the
linearity law using the second

00:15:44.742 --> 00:15:49.285
notation, but using the first
notation, it's a breeze.

00:15:49.285 --> 00:15:54.342
The Laplace transform of the
sum of two functions is the sum

00:15:54.342 --> 00:16:00.000
of their Laplace transforms of
each of them separately.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.037
Or, better yet,
you could write it that way.

00:16:03.037 --> 00:16:06.922
Let's write it this way.
That way, it looks more like an

00:16:06.922 --> 00:16:10.030
operator, L of f plus L of g.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.350
And, of the same way,
if you take a function and

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.306
multiply it by a constant and
take the laplace transform,

00:16:17.306 --> 00:16:19.637
you can pull the constant
outside.

00:16:19.637 --> 00:16:22.039
And, of course,
why are these true?

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:25.995
These are true just because of
the form of the transform.

00:16:25.995 --> 00:16:29.033
If I add up f and g,
I simply add up the two

00:16:29.033 --> 00:16:33.233
corresponding integrals.
In other words,

00:16:33.233 --> 00:16:37.347
I'm using the fact that the
integral, this definite

00:16:37.347 --> 00:16:40.390
integral, is itself a linear
operator.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.023
Well, that's the general
setting.

00:16:43.023 --> 00:16:47.794
That's where it comes from,
and that's the notation for it.

00:16:47.794 --> 00:16:50.344
And, now we have to get to
work.

00:16:50.344 --> 00:16:54.457
The first thing to do to get
familiar with this is,

00:16:54.457 --> 00:16:59.064
obviously what we want to do is
say, okay, these were the

00:16:59.064 --> 00:17:04.000
transforms of some simple
discreet functions.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.883
Okay, suppose I put in some
familiar functions,

00:17:09.883 --> 00:17:14.616
f of t.
What do their Laplace

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:19.604
transforms look like?
So, let's do that.

00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:24.976
So, one of the boards I should
keep stored.

00:17:24.976 --> 00:17:28.941
Why don't I store on this
board?

00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:37.000
I'll store on this board the
formulas as we get them.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.539
So, let's see,
what should we aim at,

00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:41.162
first?
Let's first find,

00:17:41.162 --> 00:17:44.337
and I'll do the calculations on
the sideboard,

00:17:44.337 --> 00:17:47.794
and we'll see how it works out.
I'm not very sure.

00:17:47.794 --> 00:17:51.039
In other words,
what's the Laplace transform of

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.239
the function,
one?

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.496
Well, there's an even easier
one.

00:17:54.496 --> 00:17:57.953
What's the Laplace transform of
the function zero?

00:17:57.953 --> 00:18:00.997
Answer: zero.
Very exciting.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.491
What's the Laplace transform of
one?

00:18:03.491 --> 00:18:07.767
Well, it doesn't turn out the
constant anymore than it turned

00:18:07.767 --> 00:18:11.259
out to be a constant up there.
Let's calculate it.

00:18:11.259 --> 00:18:14.395
Now, you can do these
calculations carefully,

00:18:14.395 --> 00:18:17.245
dotting all the i's,
or pretty carefully,

00:18:17.245 --> 00:18:19.241
or not carefully at all,
i.e.

00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:21.949
sloppily.
I'll let you be sloppy after,

00:18:21.949 --> 00:18:25.441
generally speaking,
you could be sloppy unless the

00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:29.289
directions tell you to be less
sloppy or to be careful,

00:18:29.289 --> 00:18:32.786
okay?
So, I'll do one carefully.

00:18:32.786 --> 00:18:36.497
Let's calculate the Laplace
transform of one carefully.

00:18:36.497 --> 00:18:40.139
Okay, in the beginning,
you've got nothing to use with

00:18:40.139 --> 00:18:43.025
the definition.
So, I have to calculate the

00:18:43.025 --> 00:18:47.216
integral from zero to infinity
of one, that's the f of t times

00:18:47.216 --> 00:18:51.133
e to the negative s t,
so I don't have to

00:18:51.133 --> 00:18:52.370
put in the one,
dt.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.638
All right, now,
let me remind you,

00:18:54.638 --> 00:18:58.555
this is an improper integral.
This is just about the first

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:01.922
time in the course we've had an
improper integral.

00:19:01.922 --> 00:19:06.045
But, there are going to be a
lot of them over the next couple

00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:10.622
of weeks, nothing but.
All right, it's an improper

00:19:10.622 --> 00:19:12.907
integral.
That means we have to go back

00:19:12.907 --> 00:19:15.551
to the definition.
If you want to be careful,

00:19:15.551 --> 00:19:19.038
you have to go back to the
definition of improper integral.

00:19:19.038 --> 00:19:21.502
So, it's the limit,
as R goes to infinity,

00:19:21.502 --> 00:19:24.508
of what you get by integrating
only up as far as R.

00:19:24.508 --> 00:19:27.994
That's a definite integral.
That's a nice Riemann integral.

00:19:27.994 --> 00:19:31.000
So, this is what I have to
calculate.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.162
And, I have to take the limit
as R goes to infinity.

00:19:34.162 --> 00:19:37.697
Now, how do I calculate that?
Well, this integral is equal

00:19:37.697 --> 00:19:40.054
to, that's easy.
It's just integrating.

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:43.155
Remember that you're
integrating with respect to t.

00:19:43.155 --> 00:19:45.759
So, s is a parameter.
It's like a constant,

00:19:45.759 --> 00:19:48.364
in other words.
So, it's e to the minus s t,

00:19:48.364 --> 00:19:50.720
and when I differentiated,

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.449
the derivative of this would
have negative s.

00:19:53.449 --> 00:19:57.356
So, to get rid of that negative
s, so the derivative is e to the

00:19:57.356 --> 00:20:00.581
minus s t.
You have to put minus s

00:20:00.581 --> 00:20:05.643
in the denominator.
And now, I'll want to evaluate

00:20:05.643 --> 00:20:09.431
that between zero and R.
And, what do I get?

00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:14.806
Well it is at the upper limit.
So, it's e to the minus s times

00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:19.387
R minus, at the lower limit,
it's t is equal to zero,

00:20:19.387 --> 00:20:21.678
so whatever s is,
it's one.

00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:25.555
And that's divided by this
constant up front,

00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:28.991
negative s. So,

00:20:28.991 --> 00:20:32.691
the answer is,
it is equal to the limit of,

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:37.273
as R goes to infinity,
of e to the negative s R minus

00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:43.000
one divided by minus s.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.151
Now, what's that?
Well, as R goes to infinity,

00:20:47.151 --> 00:20:52.225
e to the minus 2R,
or minus 5R goes to zero,

00:20:52.225 --> 00:20:57.022
and the answer is minus one
over minus s.

00:20:57.022 --> 00:21:02.188
So, that's one over s.
And so, that's our answer.

00:21:02.188 --> 00:21:05.601
Let's put it up here.
It's one over s,

00:21:05.601 --> 00:21:10.727
except it isn't.
I made a mistake.

00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:16.663
Well, not mistake,
a little oversight.

00:21:16.663 --> 00:21:22.117
What's the oversight?
This is okay.

00:21:22.117 --> 00:21:26.288
This is okay.
This is okay.

00:21:26.288 --> 00:21:31.101
This is not okay.
This is okay.

00:21:31.101 --> 00:21:38.000
But that's not okay.
What's wrong?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.490
I did slight a verbal hand.
Maybe some of you have picked

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.232
it up and were too embarrassed
to correct me,

00:21:44.232 --> 00:21:48.096
but I said like e to the minus
2R obviously goes to

00:21:48.096 --> 00:21:51.337
zero, and e to the minus 5R
goes to zero.

00:21:51.337 --> 00:21:54.390
How about e to the minus minus
3 R?

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.070
Does that go to zero?
No, that's e to the 3R,

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.000
which goes to infinity.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.835
The only time this goes to zero
is if s is a positive number.

00:22:05.835 --> 00:22:10.698
Minus s looks like a negative
number, but it's not,

00:22:10.698 --> 00:22:16.144
if s is equal to minus two.
So, this is only true if s is

00:22:16.144 --> 00:22:22.077
positive because only if s is
positive is this exponent really

00:22:22.077 --> 00:22:26.064
negative and large,
and therefore going to

00:22:26.064 --> 00:22:30.441
infinity, going to zero as R
goes to infinity.

00:22:30.441 --> 00:22:34.331
So, the answer is not one over
s.

00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:39.000
It is one over s,
s must positive.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.995
Now, once again,
here, people don't worry about

00:22:41.995 --> 00:22:45.706
this sort of thing with power
series because it seems very

00:22:45.706 --> 00:22:48.116
obvious, you know,
one over x,

00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:51.241
absolute value of x is less
than one,

00:22:51.241 --> 00:22:54.953
when it gets to be the Laplace
transform, just because the

00:22:54.953 --> 00:22:58.079
Laplace transform is mysterious,
the question is,

00:22:58.079 --> 00:23:01.204
okay, the Laplace transform is
one over s of one,

00:23:01.204 --> 00:23:05.176
well, Laplace transform of one
I understand is one over s if s

00:23:05.176 --> 00:23:09.862
is positive.
What is it if s is negative?

00:23:09.862 --> 00:23:15.791
Okay, right down in your little
books, this, but that down,

00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:21.311
what is it if s is negative,
and write underneath that,

00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:26.831
this question is meaningless.
It doesn't mean anything.

00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:31.931
I'll draw you a picture.
This is a picture of the

00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:34.827
Laplace transform of one.
It is that.

00:23:34.827 --> 00:23:39.655
It's one branch of this curve.
It does not include the branch

00:23:39.655 --> 00:23:43.114
on the left.
It doesn't because I showed you

00:23:43.114 --> 00:23:46.091
it doesn't.
That's all there is to it.

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:50.839
Okay, so I did that carefully.
Now I'm going to get a little

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:54.379
less careful.
What's the Laplace transform of

00:23:54.379 --> 00:23:57.597
e to the a t?
First of all,

00:23:57.597 --> 00:24:01.942
in general, the kind of
functions for which people like

00:24:01.942 --> 00:24:06.126
to calculate the Laplace
transform, and basically the

00:24:06.126 --> 00:24:10.954
only ones there will be in the
tables are exactly the sort of

00:24:10.954 --> 00:24:15.379
functions that you used in
solving linear equations with

00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:21.092
constant coefficients.
What kinds of functions entered

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:22.576
in there?
Exponentials,

00:24:22.576 --> 00:24:25.680
sines and cosines,
but they were really complex

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.963
exponentials,
right?

00:24:26.963 --> 00:24:30.607
e to the t sine t,
but that was really a

00:24:30.607 --> 00:24:33.509
complex exponential,
too, just a little more

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:35.398
complicated one,
polynomials,

00:24:35.398 --> 00:24:38.705
and that's about it.
t times e to the t,

00:24:38.705 --> 00:24:41.000
that was okay,
too.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.242
These are the functions for
which people calculate the

00:24:44.242 --> 00:24:46.994
Laplace transform,
and all the other functions

00:24:46.994 --> 00:24:49.625
they don't calculate the Laplace
transforms.

00:24:49.625 --> 00:24:52.010
So, I don't mean to disappoint
you here.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.069
You're going to say,
oh, what, that same old stuff?

00:24:55.069 --> 00:24:57.454
For two more weeks,
we've got that same,

00:24:57.454 --> 00:25:01.063
well, the Laplace transform
does a lot of things much better

00:25:01.063 --> 00:25:04.000
than the methods we've been
using.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.410
And, I won't.
I'll sell it when I get a

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.391
chance to, for now,
let's just get familiar with

00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:11.293
it.
All right, so while I'm not

00:25:11.293 --> 00:25:14.465
going to calculate e to the a t
for you,

00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:17.890
because I'd like instead to
just prove a simple formula

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.441
which will just give that,
and will also give us e to the

00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:24.993
a t sine t.
It will give us a lot more,

00:25:24.993 --> 00:25:27.023
instead.
I'm going to calculate a

00:25:27.023 --> 00:25:30.257
formula for the Laplace
transform of this guy if you

00:25:30.257 --> 00:25:34.000
already know the Laplace
transform of it.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.458
Now, see, this falls in that
category because this is really

00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:41.178
e to the a t times one.

00:25:41.178 --> 00:25:44.806
But, I already know the Laplace
transform of one.

00:25:44.806 --> 00:25:48.584
So that's, if I can get a
general formula for this,

00:25:48.584 --> 00:25:53.345
I'll be able to get the formula
for e to the a t as a

00:25:53.345 --> 00:25:56.594
consequence.
So, let's look for this Laplace

00:25:56.594 --> 00:25:59.012
transform.
Now, it's really easy.

00:25:59.012 --> 00:26:02.035
Let's see, where am I doing
calculations?

00:26:02.035 --> 00:26:05.413
Over here.
Okay, so we've got e.

00:26:05.413 --> 00:26:09.386
So, I want to calculate the
Laplace transform e to the a t f

00:26:09.386 --> 00:26:13.022
of t.
So I'm going to say that's the

00:26:13.022 --> 00:26:16.927
integral from zero to infinity
of e to the a t times f of t.

00:26:16.927 --> 00:26:19.688
And now, the rest I copy.

00:26:19.688 --> 00:26:23.256
That's the function part of it
that goes to the input,

00:26:23.256 --> 00:26:25.344
and then there's the other
part.

00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:29.249
This part is called the kernel,
by the way, but don't worry

00:26:29.249 --> 00:26:33.264
about that.
However, if you drop it in

00:26:33.264 --> 00:26:36.747
conversation,
people will look at you and

00:26:36.747 --> 00:26:39.969
say, gee, they know something I
don't.

00:26:39.969 --> 00:26:43.714
And you will.
You know that it's the kernel.

00:26:43.714 --> 00:26:47.633
Okay, well, now,
what kind of formula can I be

00:26:47.633 --> 00:26:51.291
looking for?
Clearly, I can only be looking

00:26:51.291 --> 00:26:56.081
for a formula which expresses it
in terms of the Laplace

00:26:56.081 --> 00:27:02.062
transform of f of t.
Let's calculate and see what we

00:27:02.062 --> 00:27:04.323
get.
Now, what would you do to that

00:27:04.323 --> 00:27:06.319
thing to make?
Well, obviously,

00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:09.645
the thing to do is to combine
the two exponentials.

00:27:09.645 --> 00:27:13.370
So, that's going to be the
integral from zero to infinity

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.430
of f of t.
e, now, I'd like to put it,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.955
to combine the exponentials in
such a way that it has,

00:27:19.955 --> 00:27:23.215
still, that same form,
so, I'm going to begin with

00:27:23.215 --> 00:27:26.407
that negative sign,
and then see what the rest of

00:27:26.407 --> 00:27:30.000
it has to be.
What is it going to be?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.137
Well, minus s t and
plus a t,

00:27:34.137 --> 00:27:39.122
but I can make that minus a
here, and it will come out

00:27:39.122 --> 00:27:42.225
right.
So, it's minus s t plus a t,

00:27:42.225 --> 00:27:46.081
and there are the two parts,

00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:48.056
those two factors,
dt.

00:27:48.056 --> 00:27:52.288
So, what's that?
That's the Laplace transform.

00:27:52.288 --> 00:27:56.802
If the a weren't there,
this would be the Laplace

00:27:56.802 --> 00:28:03.242
transform of f of t.
What is it with the a there?

00:28:03.242 --> 00:28:08.799
It's the Laplace transform of f
of t,

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:15.515
except that instead of the
variable, s has been replaced by

00:28:15.515 --> 00:28:19.915
the variable s minus a.

00:28:19.915 --> 00:28:24.200
I'll give you a second to
digest that.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:30.915
Well, you digest it while I'm
writing it because that's the

00:28:30.915 --> 00:28:35.607
answer.
And, the way this is most often

00:28:35.607 --> 00:28:38.971
used, I have to qualify it for
the value.

00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:42.757
So, if F of s is good
for s positive,

00:28:42.757 --> 00:28:45.448
the way it would be,
for example,

00:28:45.448 --> 00:28:50.158
if I used the function one
here, then to finish that off,

00:28:50.158 --> 00:28:53.607
then, F of s minus a will be,

00:28:53.607 --> 00:28:57.897
this will be good when s is
bigger than a.

00:28:57.897 --> 00:29:02.501
Why is that?
Well, because this is true.

00:29:02.501 --> 00:29:06.022
This is true.
If s minus a is

00:29:06.022 --> 00:29:11.118
positive, that's the condition.
That's what this Laplace

00:29:11.118 --> 00:29:15.287
transform is good.
But that simply says that s

00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:18.345
should be bigger than a.

00:29:18.345 --> 00:29:23.626
And, since this doesn't look
pretty, let me try to make it

00:29:23.626 --> 00:29:29.000
look a little bit prettier.
So, let's write it.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.984
So, this is assuming F of s is
for s greater than zero.

00:29:34.984 --> 00:29:38.712
Now, this is called something.

00:29:38.712 --> 00:29:43.028
This is called,
well, what would you call it?

00:29:43.028 --> 00:29:47.737
On the left side,
you multiply by an exponential.

00:29:47.737 --> 00:29:50.386
On the right,
you translate.

00:29:50.386 --> 00:29:53.525
You shift the argument over by
a.

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:58.136
So, this is called,
gulp, the exponential shift.

00:29:58.136 --> 00:30:02.489
What?
Well, I'll call it the formula.

00:30:02.489 --> 00:30:06.344
The thing before,
when we talked about operators,

00:30:06.344 --> 00:30:10.922
we called it the exponential
shift rule or the exponential

00:30:10.922 --> 00:30:12.769
shift law.
But, in fact,

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:16.463
this is, in a way,
a disguised form of the same

00:30:16.463 --> 00:30:19.274
law.
And, engineers who typically do

00:30:19.274 --> 00:30:23.691
all their work using the Laplace
transform and don't use

00:30:23.691 --> 00:30:28.510
operators, this is the form of
the exponential shift law that

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:33.125
they would know.
What you can do with one,

00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:37.119
you can do with the other.
You can now use both.

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:41.200
So, what's the answer to e to
the a t?

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.259
Well, the answer is,
I'm supposed to,

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:48.849
e to the a t times one,
the Laplace transform of one is

00:30:48.849 --> 00:30:51.740
one over s.
And, therefore,

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.500
what I do is to multiply by e
to the a t, I change s to s

00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.750
minus a .
And so, that's the answer.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:05.000
Let's see, what else don't we
know?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.960
Well, how about sines and
cosines?

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:15.319
Well, the way to do sines and
cosines is by making the

00:31:15.319 --> 00:31:22.400
observation that this formula
also works when a is a complex

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.119
number.
So, can use also for a a

00:31:26.119 --> 00:31:31.640
complex number, for e to 
the a plus b i times t.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:37.126
The Laplace transform of e to

00:31:37.126 --> 00:31:40.938
the a plus b i times t is one
over s minus a plus b i.

00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:47.683
And again, it will be for s
bigger than a.

00:31:47.683 --> 00:31:50.909
So, let's calculate the Laplace
transform of,

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:54.354
let's say, well,
I've got to cover up something.

00:31:54.354 --> 00:31:57.140
Okay, so, that's the Laplace
transform.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:02.454
I've got to remember that.
So, let's calculate the Laplace

00:32:02.454 --> 00:32:05.226
transform of,
let's say, sine of a t

00:32:05.226 --> 00:32:08.235
and cosine a t.

00:32:08.235 --> 00:32:12.036
What do you get for that?
Well, just for a little

00:32:12.036 --> 00:32:15.599
variety, we could do it by using
that formula,

00:32:15.599 --> 00:32:18.687
and taking its real and
imaginary parts.

00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:23.280
Since some of you had so much
difficulty with the backwards

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.527
Euler formula,
he is a good case where you

00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:29.852
could use it.
Suppose you want to calculate

00:32:29.852 --> 00:32:35.000
the Laplace transform of cosine
a t.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.554
Well, I'm going to write that
using, I want to calculate using

00:32:39.554 --> 00:32:43.064
complex exponentials.
The way I will do it is by

00:32:43.064 --> 00:32:45.528
using the backwards Euler
formula.

00:32:45.528 --> 00:32:50.157
So, this is e to the i a t plus
e to the minus i a t divided by

00:32:50.157 --> 00:32:52.546
two.

00:32:52.546 --> 00:32:57.026
Remember, the foreword Euler
formula would say e to the i a t

00:32:57.026 --> 00:33:01.208
equals cosine a t plus i sine a
t.

00:33:01.208 --> 00:33:04.769
That expresses the complex

00:33:04.769 --> 00:33:07.560
exponential in terms of sines
and cosines.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.507
This is the backward formula,
which just read it backwards,

00:33:11.507 --> 00:33:15.591
expressing cosines and sines in
terms of complex exponentials

00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:17.837
instead.
Both formulas are useful,

00:33:17.837 --> 00:33:19.879
almost equally useful,
in fact.

00:33:19.879 --> 00:33:23.486
And anyway, just remind you of
it, let's use this one.

00:33:23.486 --> 00:33:26.209
Okay, what's the Laplace
transform, then,

00:33:26.209 --> 00:33:30.669
of cosine a t?
Well, by linearity,

00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:35.501
it's equal to one half the
Laplace transform of this guy

00:33:35.501 --> 00:33:38.839
plus the Laplace transform of
that guy.

00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:43.232
And, what are those?
Well, the Laplace transform of

00:33:43.232 --> 00:33:48.416
e to the i a t is one over s
minus i a,

00:33:48.416 --> 00:33:53.072
and the Laplace
transform of the other guy is

00:33:53.072 --> 00:33:56.762
one divided by s plus i a.

00:33:56.762 --> 00:34:00.452
Now, of course,
this has become out to be a

00:34:00.452 --> 00:34:03.951
real function.
This is real.

00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:07.832
Every integral is real.
This must come out to be real.

00:34:07.832 --> 00:34:10.761
This looks kind of complex,
but it isn't.

00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:15.227
I know automatically that this
is going to be a real function.

00:34:15.227 --> 00:34:17.497
How I know that?
Well, mentally,

00:34:17.497 --> 00:34:20.352
you can combine the terms and
calculate.

00:34:20.352 --> 00:34:24.745
But, I know even before that.
Remember, there are two ways to

00:34:24.745 --> 00:34:28.772
see that something is real.
You can calculate it and see

00:34:28.772 --> 00:34:32.579
that its imaginary part is zero,
hack, or without any

00:34:32.579 --> 00:34:36.387
calculation, if you change i to
minus i,

00:34:36.387 --> 00:34:41.000
and you get the same thing,
it must be real.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.421
Now, if I change i to minus i
in this expression,

00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:48.921
what happens?
If I change i to minus i,

00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:54.263
this term turns into that one,
and this one turns into that

00:34:54.263 --> 00:34:57.394
one.
Conclusion: the sum of the two

00:34:57.394 --> 00:34:59.881
is unchanged.
And therefore,

00:34:59.881 --> 00:35:03.066
this is real.
Well, of course,

00:35:03.066 --> 00:35:07.199
in the time I took to make that
argument, I could have actually

00:35:07.199 --> 00:35:09.333
calculated it.
So, what the heck,

00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:12.333
let's calculate it?
So, you do the high school

00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:15.333
thing, and it's this guy plus
that guy on top,

00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:18.333
which makes 2s.
I on the bottom is the product

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:22.066
of those, which by now you
should know the product of two

00:35:22.066 --> 00:35:25.066
complex numbers.
A product of a number and its

00:35:25.066 --> 00:35:29.000
complex conjugate is the sum of
the squares.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.618
So, what's the answer?
The twos cancel,

00:35:31.618 --> 00:35:35.545
and the answer is that the
Laplace transform of cosine a t

00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:39.472
is s over s squared plus a
squared.

00:35:39.472 --> 00:35:41.883
And, that will be true as,

00:35:41.883 --> 00:35:46.017
in general, it's true up there
for positive values of s only.

00:35:46.017 --> 00:35:49.875
And, the sine a t,
you can calculate that in

00:35:49.875 --> 00:35:53.389
recitation tomorrow.
The answer to that is a divided

00:35:53.389 --> 00:35:56.627
by s squared plus a squared.

00:35:56.627 --> 00:36:00.348
You would get the same answers
if you took the real and

00:36:00.348 --> 00:36:04.000
imaginary parts of that
expression.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.254
It's another way of getting at
the recitations tomorrow;

00:36:08.254 --> 00:36:11.966
we'll get practice in
calculating other functions

00:36:11.966 --> 00:36:16.762
related to these by using these
formulas, and also from scratch

00:36:16.762 --> 00:36:20.861
directly from the definition of
the Laplace transform.

00:36:20.861 --> 00:36:24.806
Well, there are two things
which we still should do.

00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:29.602
The first is I want to get you
started with calculating inverse

00:36:29.602 --> 00:36:33.943
Laplace transforms.
And, the reason for doing that

00:36:33.943 --> 00:36:36.729
is, in other words,
I've started with f of t,

00:36:36.729 --> 00:36:40.357
and we've been focusing
on what is capital F of s?

00:36:40.357 --> 00:36:42.883
But, you will find that when

00:36:42.883 --> 00:36:45.863
you go to solve differential
equations, by far,

00:36:45.863 --> 00:36:49.167
the hardest part of the
procedure is you get F of s.

00:36:49.167 --> 00:36:52.990
The Laplace transform of the
answer, and you have to convert

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:56.877
that back into the answer in
terms of t that you were looking

00:36:56.877 --> 00:36:58.107
for.
In other words,

00:36:58.107 --> 00:37:01.995
the main step in the procedure
that you are going to be using

00:37:01.995 --> 00:37:04.392
for solving differential
equations is,

00:37:04.392 --> 00:37:07.760
and the hardest part of the
step will be to calculate

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.315
inverse laplace transforms.
Now, you think that could be

00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:15.631
done by tables,
but, in fact,

00:37:15.631 --> 00:37:19.932
it can't unless the tables are
too long to be useful.

00:37:19.932 --> 00:37:23.902
You have to do a certain amount
of work yourself.

00:37:23.902 --> 00:37:28.781
And, the certain amount of work
that you have to do yourself

00:37:28.781 --> 00:37:33.000
involves partial fractions
decompositions.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.655
And, in case you were wondering
which you are not,

00:37:36.655 --> 00:37:41.056
the reason you learned partial
fractions in 18.01 was not to

00:37:41.056 --> 00:37:45.383
learn those silly integrals,
but he learned it so that when

00:37:45.383 --> 00:37:48.889
you got to 18.03 you would be
able to calculate,

00:37:48.889 --> 00:37:53.066
solve differential equations by
using Laplace transforms.

00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:54.409
Sorry.
That's life.

00:37:54.409 --> 00:37:59.108
Now, so a certain amount of the
recitation time tomorrow will be

00:37:59.108 --> 00:38:03.659
devoted to reminding you how to
do partial fractions since you

00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:06.643
haven't done it in a while,
and I assume,

00:38:06.643 --> 00:38:10.000
yeah, we had that,
I think.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.970
Okay, now, they also remind you
of the most efficient method,

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:23.360
which about half of you have
had, and the rest think you

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.775
might have had,
but really aren't sure.

00:38:27.775 --> 00:38:33.701
So, here's the answer.
We want to find out what it's

00:38:33.701 --> 00:38:39.306
inverse Laplace transform is.
What you have to do,

00:38:39.306 --> 00:38:42.180
it normally won't be in the
tables like this.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:46.229
You have to put it in a form in
which it will be in the tables.

00:38:46.229 --> 00:38:48.777
As you do that,
you have to make partial

00:38:48.777 --> 00:38:51.977
fractions decompositions,
which, to do it quickly,

00:38:51.977 --> 00:38:55.961
so if you don't know what I'm
doing now, or you think you once

00:38:55.961 --> 00:38:59.619
knew but don't quite remember,
go to recitation tomorrow.

00:38:59.619 --> 00:39:02.297
To get the coefficient here,
I cover up s,

00:39:02.297 --> 00:39:07.000
and I put s equals zero
because that's the law.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.713
To get this coefficient,
I cover up s plus three and I

00:39:10.713 --> 00:39:14.566
put s equals a negative three
because that's what you're

00:39:14.566 --> 00:39:17.509
supposed to do.
Put s equal negative three,

00:39:17.509 --> 00:39:20.732
you get minus one third.
This is equal to that.

00:39:20.732 --> 00:39:23.675
In this form,
I don't know what the inverse

00:39:23.675 --> 00:39:25.987
Laplace form is,
but in this form,

00:39:25.987 --> 00:39:29.700
I certainly do know with the
inverse Laplace transform

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.993
because the inverse Laplace
transform is linear,

00:39:32.993 --> 00:39:36.917
and because each of these guys
especially occurs in those

00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:40.000
tables.
Well, what's this?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.849
Well, it's whatever the Laplace
transform of,

00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:49.012
inverse Laplace transform of
one over s is multiplied by one

00:39:49.012 --> 00:39:51.724
third.
Well, the inverse Laplace

00:39:51.724 --> 00:39:56.974
transform of one over s is one.
So, it's one third times one.

00:39:56.974 --> 00:40:00.474
How about the other guy?
Minus one third,

00:40:00.474 --> 00:40:05.199
the inverse Laplace transform
of one over s plus three,

00:40:05.199 --> 00:40:09.666
that's this formula.
a is negative three,

00:40:09.666 --> 00:40:13.333
and that makes e to the minus
3t.

00:40:13.333 --> 00:40:18.250
So, if this was the Laplace
transform of the solution to the

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:22.666
differential equation,
then the solution in terms of t

00:40:22.666 --> 00:40:26.083
was this function.
Now, you'll get lots of

00:40:26.083 --> 00:40:30.000
practice in that.
All I'm doing now is signaling

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.583
that that's the most important
and difficult step of the

00:40:34.583 --> 00:40:40.000
procedure, and that,
please, start getting practice.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.468
Get up to snuff doing that
procedure.

00:40:42.468 --> 00:40:46.308
Okay, in the time remaining,
I want to add one formula to

00:40:46.308 --> 00:40:50.354
this list, and that is going to
be the Laplace transform of,

00:40:50.354 --> 00:40:52.617
we still haven't done
polynomials.

00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:56.251
And now, to polynomials,
because the Laplace transform

00:40:56.251 --> 00:41:00.434
is linear, all I have to do is
know what the Laplace transform

00:41:00.434 --> 00:41:04.000
of, the individual term of a
polynomial.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.571
In other words,
what the Laplace transform of t

00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:10.987
to the n,
where n is some positive

00:41:10.987 --> 00:41:13.548
integer?
Well, let's bravely start

00:41:13.548 --> 00:41:17.663
trying to calculate it.
Integral from zero to infinity

00:41:17.663 --> 00:41:22.554
t to the n e to the negative st
dt.

00:41:22.554 --> 00:41:26.513
Now, I think you can see that

00:41:26.513 --> 00:41:31.171
the method you should use is
integration by part because this

00:41:31.171 --> 00:41:35.597
is a product of two things,
one of which you would like to

00:41:35.597 --> 00:41:40.022
differentiate a lot of times,
in fact, and the other won't

00:41:40.022 --> 00:41:44.369
hurt to integrate it because
it's very easy to integrate.

00:41:44.369 --> 00:41:48.033
So, this factor is going to be

00:41:48.033 --> 00:41:50.406
the one that's to be
differentiated,

00:41:50.406 --> 00:41:54.406
and this is the factor that
will be pleased to integrate it.

00:41:54.406 --> 00:41:57.864
Let's get started and see what
we can get out of it.

00:41:57.864 --> 00:42:01.932
Well, this time I'm going to
be, well, I'd better be a little

00:42:01.932 --> 00:42:06.000
careful because there's a point
here that's tricky.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.034
Okay, the first step of
integration by parts is you only

00:42:10.034 --> 00:42:12.601
do the integration.
You don't do the

00:42:12.601 --> 00:42:15.828
differentiation.
Remember, the variable is t.

00:42:15.828 --> 00:42:19.276
The s is just a parameter.
It's just a constant.

00:42:19.276 --> 00:42:22.430
It's hanging around,
not knowing what to do.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:26.757
Okay, so the first step is you
don't do the differentiation.

00:42:26.757 --> 00:42:30.792
You only do the integration.
Evaluate it between limits,

00:42:30.792 --> 00:42:36.000
and then you put a minus sign
before you forget to do it.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.800
And then, integral zero to
infinity.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.440
Now you do both operations.
So, it's n t to the n 

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.079
minus one,
and you also do the

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:49.280
integration.
Okay, let's consider each of

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.239
these pieces in turn.
Now, this piece,

00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:55.840
well, there's no problem with
the lower limit,

00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:00.480
zero, because when t is equal
to zero, this factor is zero,

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:06.000
and the thing disappears as
long as n is one or higher.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.503
So, it's minus zero here at the
lower limit.

00:43:10.503 --> 00:43:15.006
The question is,
what is at the upper limit?

00:43:15.006 --> 00:43:20.452
So, what I have to do is find
out, what is the limit?

00:43:20.452 --> 00:43:25.270
The limit, as t goes to
infinity, that's what's

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:30.192
happening up there,
of t to the n times e to the

00:43:30.192 --> 00:43:37.000
negative s t divided
by minus s.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.508
Well, as t goes to infinity,
this goes to infinity,

00:43:40.508 --> 00:43:43.035
of course.
This had better go to zero

00:43:43.035 --> 00:43:46.894
unless I want an answer,
infinity, which won't do me any

00:43:46.894 --> 00:43:48.719
good.
If this goes to zero,

00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:52.508
s had better be positive.
So, I'd better be restricting

00:43:52.508 --> 00:43:56.087
myself to that case.
Okay, so let's assume that s is

00:43:56.087 --> 00:44:01.000
positive so that this minus s
really is a negative number.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.623
Okay, then I have a chance.
So, this is going to be the

00:44:04.623 --> 00:44:06.636
limit.
Let's write it in a more

00:44:06.636 --> 00:44:08.917
familiar form with that down
below.

00:44:08.917 --> 00:44:12.474
So, it's t to the n.
That's going to infinity.

00:44:12.474 --> 00:44:15.761
But, the bottom is e to the
minus s t.

00:44:15.761 --> 00:44:19.854
But now, it's plus s t.
And, that's going to infinity,

00:44:19.854 --> 00:44:23.545
too, because s is positive.
So, the two guys are racing,

00:44:23.545 --> 00:44:26.632
and the question is,
oh, I lost a minus s here.

00:44:26.632 --> 00:44:30.054
So, oh... equals minus
one over s.

00:44:30.054 --> 00:44:33.557
How's that?
So, the question is only,

00:44:33.557 --> 00:44:35.986
which guy wins?
In the race to infinity,

00:44:35.986 --> 00:44:38.291
which one wins,
and how do you decide?

00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:41.218
And, the answer,
of course, is that's the bottom

00:44:41.218 --> 00:44:43.585
that wins.
The exponential always wins,

00:44:43.585 --> 00:44:45.828
and it's because of L'Hopital's
rule.

00:44:45.828 --> 00:44:47.821
You differentiate top and
bottom.

00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:49.939
Nothing much happens to the
bottom.

00:44:49.939 --> 00:44:53.489
It gets another factor of s,
but the top goes down to t to

00:44:53.489 --> 00:44:56.542
the n minus one.
L'Hopital it again,

00:44:56.542 --> 00:44:59.469
and again, and again,
and again, and again until

00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:03.020
finally you've reduced the top
to t to the zero where it's

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.757
defenseless and just sitting
there, and nothing's happened to

00:45:06.757 --> 00:45:11.493
the bottom.
It's still got e to the s t.

00:45:11.493 --> 00:45:14.911
and that goes to infinity.

00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:19.345
So, the answer is,
this is zero by n applications

00:45:19.345 --> 00:45:23.594
of L'Hopital's rule.
Or, if you're very clever,

00:45:23.594 --> 00:45:27.843
you can do it in one,
but I won't tell you how.

00:45:27.843 --> 00:45:32.000
So, the answer is that this is
zero.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.298
At the upper limit,
it's also zero at least if s is

00:45:35.298 --> 00:45:38.267
positive, which is the case
we're considering.

00:45:38.267 --> 00:45:41.829
That leaves the rest of this.
All right, let's pull the

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:43.940
constants out front.
That's plus.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.909
Two negatives make a plus.
n over s,

00:45:46.909 --> 00:45:49.680
now, what's left?
The integral from zero to

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.243
infinity of t to the n minus
one, e to the minus s t dt.

00:45:57.003 --> 00:46:00.763
But, what on Earth is that?
That is n over s times

00:46:00.763 --> 00:46:04.524
the Laplace transform of t to
the n minus one.

00:46:04.524 --> 00:46:08.218
We got a reduction for it.
We don't get the answer in one

00:46:08.218 --> 00:46:11.518
step.
But, we get a reduction

00:46:11.518 --> 00:46:13.960
formula.
And, it says that the Laplace

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.865
transform, let me write it this
way for once.

00:46:16.865 --> 00:46:20.694
The first way is now better,
is equal to n over s times the

00:46:20.694 --> 00:46:24.787
Laplace transform of n minus t
to the n minus one.

00:46:24.787 --> 00:46:27.097
Okay, the next step,

00:46:27.097 --> 00:46:30.794
this would be n over s times n
minus one over s times the

00:46:30.794 --> 00:46:34.887
Laplace transform of t to the n
minus two.

00:46:34.887 --> 00:46:38.679
If I can continue,

00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:44.000
I finally get in the top n
times n minus one times all the

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.573
way down to one divided by the
same number of s's,

00:46:48.573 --> 00:46:53.706
n of them, times the Laplace
transform of t to the zero,

00:46:53.706 --> 00:46:55.853
finally.
See, one, zero,

00:46:55.853 --> 00:46:59.213
n minus one.
And so, what's the final

00:46:59.213 --> 00:47:02.760
answer?
It is n factorial over s to the

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:07.790
what power?
Well, the Laplace transform of

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:13.186
this is one over s.
So, the answer is it's s to the

00:47:13.186 --> 00:47:18.116
n plus one,
n of them here plus an extra

00:47:18.116 --> 00:47:21.372
one coming from the one over s
here.

00:47:21.372 --> 00:47:26.210
And, that's the answer.
The Laplace transform of t to

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:29.001
the n, oddly enough,

00:47:29.001 --> 00:47:33.466
is more complicated,
and looks a little different

00:47:33.466 --> 00:47:37.280
from these.
It's n factorial over s to the

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.164
n plus one.

00:47:40.164 --> 00:47:43.885
And, with that,
you can now calculate the

00:47:43.885 --> 00:47:47.951
Laplace transform of anything in
sight, and tomorrow you will.
