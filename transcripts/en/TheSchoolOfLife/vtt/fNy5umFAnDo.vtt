00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.100
THE

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.000
DARKEST

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.800
TRUTH

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.900
ABOUT

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.800
LOVE

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000
THE DARKEST TRUTH ABOUT LOVE

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.180
1.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.680
1. You

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.400
1. You will never

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.400
You will never find the right person.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.900
Such a creature does not exist.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.700
YOU

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.500
ARE

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.200
IRREDEEMABLY

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.500
ALONE

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.900
You

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.900
You will

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.700
You will not be

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900
You will not be understood.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.500
The moments of love were an illusion.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.300
There  is something wrong with you

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.500
And with everyone else.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:28.700
The idea of love distracts us from an existential loneliness.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.500
NOW LET'S PRETEND WE DO NOT KNOW ANY OF THIS

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:58.000
