00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.670
In movies, hacking is all finesse, excitement,
and genius coding, but in reality it's angelheaded

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.800
hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly
connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.330
of night.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.690
-- Ginsberg.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.210
Hey there Zero Cools, Neos and Seatec astronomers,
I'm Trace.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.589
Thanks for tuning in for some DNews.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.800
Passwords are like apples in a fictional garden,
they're perfect, ripe, and there for the taking,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.170
if you know how.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.830
Websites have a lot of different ways to store
passwords, hashing, salting, tokens, two-factor

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.560
authentication -- we have a whole video about
it -- but hacking a password?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.300
That's a lot more fun, right?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.620
So first, for n00bs, passwords aren't stored
as words, but as a set of encrypted characters

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.670
called hashes.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.810
They look like this.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.930
If I want to access your account, I don't
really need your password, I just have to

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.700
find the thing that lets me decrypt that hash!

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.200
To do that, hacker communities created 'lookup
tables' and 'rainbow tables' -- data files

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.550
of common passwords that are pre-hashed.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.200
Password123 hashed is this.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.240
abcde12345 hashed, is this.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.710
If a hacker did this beforehand, and has millions
of passwords, they just compare them and they

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.299
can get access to your account.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.149
And hackers can do this comparison really
fast.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.200
In a test for Ars Technica, a computer could
try 350 billion combinations every second!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.869
350 billion password guesses.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:27.869
Every.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.869
Second.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.090
How common does your password feel now?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.310
But companies have a weapon against rainbow
tables -- it's called "salt!"

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.490
Not like literal salt.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.740
It's basically taking random chunks of code
and tossing them into the hashed password.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.529
As our AP Donna says, "It changes the flavor."

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:48.200
If salted hashes are found, the rainbow tables
are useless, they'll never find a match!

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.090
Computers aren't great at problem solving,
so even this little change can fumble automated

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.619
hacking programs.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.210
Without the tables, everything takes longer.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.380
Hackers have to find out how the salt was
added -- beginning of each password?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.840
After the 15th character?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.859
Is it different for every user?

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:10.080
Then they have to figure out what the salt
characters are, one encoder bcrypt puts $2a$

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.720
at the beginning of every hash…

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.190
But usually, salted passwords are enough to
stop a lot of hackers, because it's faster

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.780
to change tack and use dictionary attacks
or brute force attacks -- these were made

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.370
famous in Mr. Robot.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.250
Dictionary attacks use wordlists to take common
passwords, like Password123, and just try

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.250
them out.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.280
They salt and hash them on the fly, and compare
them to passwords in the database at the speed

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.320
of light.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.410
Brute force attacks are even more crazy, starting
with say, "aaaa" salted hashing it various

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.687
ways and then compare those to the database,
then "aaab," then "aaac..." you get it.

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:44.687
They just try every possible combination.

00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:45.687
It takes FOREVER.

00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:46.687
Sidebar: and this is why randomly generated
passwords don't always help.

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:47.687
In a 2014 study done for DARPA by a security
company, half of our "random" passwords use

00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:48.687
the same five patterns to construct that "randomization."

00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:49.687
Because nothing's actually random -- we have
a video about it.

00:02:49.687 --> 00:02:51.490
Hackers know this and just copy those methods
and add them to the pile of known passwords.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.940
When it comes to simple text, computers are
wicked fast.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.760
A hacker doing a test for Ars Technica cracked
over 10,000 passwords in 16 minutes just trying

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.350
combinations at random within the password
specifications (less than 8 characters, capital

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.500
letter, lowercase letter, et cetera).

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.550
Hackers are in a constant race against time,
not necessarily because the Feds are right

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.430
over their shoulder like in the movies, but
because once a company or agency realizes

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.551
they've been hacked, they usually adjust security
and go public, encouraging users to change

00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:21.850
their passwords.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.480
Which is why hackers just hack YOU.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.590
If you're on an open wifi network without
a password, you're basically shouting your

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.250
passwords for anyone listening to hear.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.140
Some hackers will set up fake "Free WiFi"
points to get common passwords and email addresses.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.200
Still, others just use spam!

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.190
If you click on a word document or link in
an email, it can execute code on your computer,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.160
called malware, to copy everything you type
(including passwords, credit card numbers

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.470
and so on) and send it direct to the hacker.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.190
And still, others pose as Facebook security,
or as a representative of the bank, or as

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.890
the IT department… some will CALL YOU ON
THE PHONE.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.069
Never EVER give someone your password EVER.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.470
If they're the company, they already have
it!

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.930
Why spend all that time hacking a server if
I can just trick you into telling me your

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.930
password?

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.700
The moral of the story, other than hacking
is crazy interesting…

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.170
Is to use long, complicated passwords.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.540
And never use the same one twice.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.310
Long passwords are harder for dictionary and
wordlist-based attacks to solve quickly.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.870
It's actually less important to use Passwords
where letters are numbers -- but instead use

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.430
a long set of words…

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.070
Like "correct horse battery staple" or song
lyrics -- easy to remember, but so long it

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.210
would take a hacking program years of computing
time to guess!

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.800
It's sort of like that old joke about running
from a bear, you don't have to have to be

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.320
the fastest, you just don't want to be the
slowest.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.521
If you haven't check out the other video we
just did about hacking and passwords, do that

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:50.521
right here.

00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:53.260
And let us know down in the comments if you
just changed your password, because I know

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.610
I did after this.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.550
