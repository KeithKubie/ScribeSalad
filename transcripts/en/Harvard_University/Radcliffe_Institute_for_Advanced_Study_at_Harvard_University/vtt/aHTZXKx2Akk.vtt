00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.520
-Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.200
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.330
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.110
And I'm delighted to
welcome all of you

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.110
as well as Professor Diana
Mutz of the University

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.740
of Pennsylvania, who will
deliver the inaugural Davis

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.580
Lecture today.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.390
The Davis Lecture Series
has been established

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.910
by Kim and Judy Davis.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.640
I'm very happy to have them
both and their daughter Lauren

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.930
with us in the audience today.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.840
Kim and Judy are
enthusiastic supporters

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.680
of Radcliffe's mission
to foster inquiry

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.730
across disciplinary boundaries,
to convene faculty and students

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.830
from all of Harvard's
schools, and to share

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.730
the fruits of deep
research with the public.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.810
Their generosity has
established this series

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.750
to bring leading thinkers to
Radcliffe Yard for the purpose

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.379
of tackling important
questions in all fields,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.560
whether the arts, sciences,
or as we will hear today,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.670
the social sciences.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.270
On your chairs, you will find
an announcement demonstrating

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.840
the breadth of topics
that we can look forward

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.150
to in the Davis
Lectures next year.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.160
So thank you, Kim and
Judy, for your support

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.210
and especially for this
invaluable lecture series.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.980
The Davis Lectures join
the Radcliffe Institute's

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.610
wide array of programs dedicated
to ideas at work in the world.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.850
In just over two
weeks, on May 27,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.970
we will celebrate Radcliffe
Day, the traditional culmination

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.170
of our academic year.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.150
On that day, we will
honor the life and work

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.620
of Janet Yellen, the Chair
of the Federal Reserve,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.060
with a panel discussion
entitled "Building an Economy

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.880
for Prosperity and Equality."

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.070
We will hear personal remarks
from former Fed Chair Ben

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.340
Bernanke.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.270
And we will observe
a conversation

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.610
between Harvard professor
of economics Greg Mankiw

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.410
and Yellen herself.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.800
The whole day will be live
streamed on our website.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.560
And video will be
posted soon thereafter.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.010
I hope you will tune in.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.440
Along with the Davis
Lectures next year,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.240
we have a wide range of
additional programming planned.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.660
We'll be holding conferences
on topics ranging from oceans

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.390
and the International
refugee crisis

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.680
to universities
relationship with slavery

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.580
and the global
explosion of cities.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.760
And we will hear lectures from
scientists, artists, novelists,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.510
and activists among many others.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.130
And a full calendar will
be available on our website

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.450
by the end of this month.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.750
And I hope to see you many
times in the year ahead.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.780
But back to today as we happily
inaugurate the Davis Lectures

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.170
by welcoming Professor Diana
Mutz, the Samuel A Stouffer

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.410
Professor of Political
Science and Communications,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.250
and the director
of the Institute

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.970
for the Study of Citizens and
Politics at the University

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.460
of Pennsylvania.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.430
Professor Mutz earned her
PhD at Stanford University.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.640
And she taught at the
interview at University

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.100
of Wisconsin and the
Ohio State University

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.030
before arriving at the
University of Pennsylvania

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.270
in 2003.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.550
She has written many
books, including

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.780
most recently In
Your Face Politics,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.410
the Consequences
of Uncivil Media,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.660
which was published in 2015.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.020
Professor Mutz has
been an elected fellow

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.040
of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences since 2008.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.450
And in 2011, she won the
lifetime career achievement

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.810
award in political communication
from the American Political

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.800
Science Association.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.630
Just this spring, she was named
a Guggenheim fellow for 2016.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.700
She won that Guggenheim
to support her work

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.090
on the very topic that she will
be discussing with us today--

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.520
how the public
understands globalization

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.140
and how that understanding
shapes individual's

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.420
political preferences.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.110
Professor Mutz's new
project grows out

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.370
of her longstanding
interest in the causes

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.115
and effects of public opinion.

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:30.100
One of her most influential,
early books, entitled,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.580
Impersonal: Influences, How
Perceptions of Mass Collectives

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.350
Affect Political
Attitudes, looked

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.040
beyond traditional elite
sources to learn more

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.940
about important,
long-term trends.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.450
In Interpersonal Influences
Mutz took a new, critical look

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.110
at polling data and
opinion surveys.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.290
And her findings
recast what we thought

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.160
we knew about how individuals
make up their minds

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.010
on a range of issues, from the
controversial to the mundane.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.880
She argued that well
publicized poll results

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.830
can cause individuals to shape
their own views in response

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.330
to what the polls identify
as widely shared attitudes

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.040
and experiences.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.400
In other words, she discovered
that sometimes individual

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.720
shift their views significantly
in order to align themselves

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.580
with visible trends.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.590
Her findings amounted
to a sea change

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.730
from an older view of
polls as merely reflecting

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.500
some pre-existing reality to
a fresh appreciation of how

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.080
poll results actually
shape a new reality.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.220
Professor Mutz's field
is political science.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.650
But in true Radcliffe
interdisciplinary fashion,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.760
her work resonates with a
paradigm shift that affected

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.650
my own field of US history.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.220
Just as political science
once focused primarily

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.440
on elite thought and
political actions,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.130
so the study of history
once centered chiefly

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.720
on the works in deeds
of elite leaders.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.330
Then starting in the
1960s, historians

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.960
began investigating the
past from the bottom up,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.150
as the expression went,
looking at sources left behind

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.070
by ordinary Americans
and more marginalized

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.790
groups to understand better
their particular historical

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.350
experiences.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.660
So my work as an historian
grew out of that shift.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.350
For example, in my book,
A Consumer's Republic,

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.920
the Politics of Mass
Consumption in Post-war America,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.590
I investigated the difference
it made politically

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.820
for ordinary Americans to
identify primarily as consumers

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.790
rather than producers.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.260
I was interested in how the
explosion of mass consumption

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.790
in the years
following World War II

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.510
had impacts beyond
the marketplace

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.100
in helping shift the
political, economic,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.980
and ideological
orientations of Americans.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.360
Using opinion polls
and consumer surveys,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.270
among many other sources, I
learned that ordinary Americans

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.830
believed that as mass
consumers, they not only improve

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.170
their personal
standard of living,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.360
but they also boosted
the nation's economy,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.750
and they help demonstrate
the superiority of capitalism

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.260
over communism in
the global Cold War.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.430
Consuming, moreover, was far
from a passive act politically.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.240
Many Americans use
their power as consumers

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.080
to endorse, to boycott, and to
protest products, producers,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.550
and retailers that they felt did
harm, socially and materially.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.300
The American political
economy that I

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.070
chronicle in A
Consumer's Republic

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.130
was not a timeless one.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.090
In recent years we
have been feeling

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.630
the effects of the end
of that political economy

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.240
and the transition to a new
post-industrial economy.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.970
We tend to group these changes
under the label globalization.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.360
Globalization is not new.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.680
It began at least in the early
modern era of the 16th century.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.530
But its manifestations in the
past 30 years have been unique.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.950
Trade policy has
often instigated

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.650
political controversy.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.330
And as we are seeing in
this current election cycle,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.679
it continues to spark
vigorous debate.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.440
Campaign rallies for
candidates as disparate

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.880
as Donald Trump
and Bernie Sanders

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.320
reach fever pitch when their
candidates bash free trade.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.060
Hillary Clinton find
yourself under fire

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.350
for her earlier support of the
Trans Pacific Partnership Trade

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.190
deal.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.080
Before John Kasich quit the race
for the Republican nomination,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.310
he frequently had to defend
himself for supporting NAFTA.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.430
And after facing criticism for
supporting the so-called Trade

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.000
Promotion Authority
bill last year,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.040
Ted Cruz tried to salvage
his now defunct candidacy

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.200
by reversing course and
labeling the same bill

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.760
a corrupt swindle.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.080
He even ran a television ad
in the Wisconsin primaries

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.330
promising to, and
I quote, "bring

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.360
our jobs back from China."

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.910
So it's putting it mildly
to say that Americans

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.710
feel very strongly about
the issue of free trade.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.630
The work that Professor Mutz
will share with us today,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.340
I hope, will help us understand
better the intense emotion that

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.530
surround debates over the impact
of global trade on the US.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.910
So now let me tell you a little
bit about how today will work.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.330
First Professor Mutz
will deliver her lecture.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.300
And at the end will be time
for you to ask questions.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.340
If you'd like to ask a
question, please come up

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.290
to the microphone we will
set up in the center file.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.280
And when your turn
come, we'd like

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.320
you to introduce yourself
and then ask your question.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.730
Finally, I hope you will join
us for a reception for Professor

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.810
Mutz, and our
audience, for you, too,

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.710
right here in the Knaful Center
at the conclusion of today's

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.290
event.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:21.640
So now, please join me in warmly
welcoming Professor Diana Mutz.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.010
-Thank you very much.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.880
And thank you, Liz, for
that warm introduction.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.030
And thank you also
to Judy and Kim

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.990
for making this
opportunity possible.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.830
The work I'm talking about is
very much work in progress.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.770
So I very much look forward
to your comments and ideas

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.230
as I proceed through it.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.170
During my own
lifetime, I think one

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:52.720
of the most dramatic changes
that I've seen in the world

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.130
is the growing
interconnectedness

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.340
of people and countries
all around the world.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.300
And this is partly
due to developments

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.210
in communications and also
transportation as well.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.710
We seem in one way more
interconnected than ever

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.560
before.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.190
And it's for this
particular reason

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.230
that I found this graph
rather surprising.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.060
This is a percentage
of people who

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.450
think it'll be best for
the future of our country

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.390
if we stay out of world affairs.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.840
Now interpret that item
as you will, but it's

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.800
been asked back since 1947.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.930
And the largest
percentage of people

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:36.860
are saying we need to stay out,
more so than during the Vietnam

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.320
War era and all
kinds of other eras

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.260
when you might have
expected that people

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.390
would have expressed that
particular sentiment.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.380
I found that surprising.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.730
And yet, at the same
time when we look around

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.420
at the world of
consumers these days,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.380
we also see a huge
emphasis on the whole

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.090
be American, buy American
kind of sentiment.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.400
And I'm going to show
you a brief Super Bowl

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.940
ad that I think illustrates
well the type of sediment I'm

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.458
talking about that's
quite prevalent now.

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:14.326
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.286
-Is there anything more
American than America.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.850
Because you can import original.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.920
You can't fake true cool.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.455
You can't fake legacy.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.050
Because what Detroit
created was a first

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.960
and became the inspiration
to the rest of the world.

00:12:58.005 --> 00:13:00.784
Yeah, Detroit made cars.

00:13:00.784 --> 00:13:01.700
And cars made America.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.433
Making the best, making the
finest takes conviction.

00:13:12.532 --> 00:13:17.400
And you can't import the heart
and soul of men and woman

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.750
working on the line.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.750
You can search the world
over for the finer things,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:29.500
but you find a match for the
American road and the creatures

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.750
that live on it.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.216
Because we believe in the zoom
and the roar and the thrust.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.140
And when it's made
here, it's made

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.760
with the one thing you
can't import from anywhere

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.600
else, American pride.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.761
So let Germany brew your beer.

00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:55.820
Let Switzerland make your watch.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.150
Let Asia assemble your phone.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.427
We will build your car.

00:14:11.295 --> 00:14:12.770
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.450
-OK, I know that's really
subtle in terms of the message

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.300
it's trying to get across here.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.250
But basically the idea
is Americans are cool,

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.790
forget about the rest of world.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.795
One of the truly absurd
things about this ad-- aside

00:14:27.795 --> 00:14:30.410
from the fact that
it's Bob Dylan--

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.040
is the fact that the car
they're showing you there

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.730
is not assembled in
the United States.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.260
It's assembled from parts
made over the world.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.690
And it's Fiat Chrysler.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.880
It's actually an Italian
company these days,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.330
not an American company.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.210
But you get the general
idea, this kind of sentiment,

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.600
this pro-American manifestation
of this underlying

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.630
sense of turning inward and
pro-isolationism is something

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.780
we encounter all the time.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.540
And they're scholars
who demonstrated

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.180
that in fact people will pay
a premium for something that's

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.580
made in the United States as
opposed to another country.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.720
What does this all mean?

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.040
And where do these
trade preferences

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.500
that people have to buy only
American goods come from?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.820
Well, in international
political economy,

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.175
there's pretty much one answer.

00:15:20.175 --> 00:15:23.950
And that is it comes from
economic self-interest

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.680
on the part of the worker.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.770
But what's surprising
about all this

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.670
is the evidence on which
this is based is primarily

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.820
looking at people's incomes and
also especially their levels

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.210
of education.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.500
Education, high
levels of education

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.540
are very strong predictors
of support for free trade.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.590
And the assumption was that
those who are well educated

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.600
are less likely to be
hurt by trade personally.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.640
And that's why they are
a lot more supportive

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.620
than those with less education.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.140
But as social scientist,
we know that there

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.910
are a lot of other
things that are

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.400
driven by education as well.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.160
And it's not intuitively
obvious that that's

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.100
what education represents when
this relationship is found.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.330
So together with one of my
international political economy

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.040
colleagues, one of
our initial studies

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.970
was an attempt to find out
whether education was really

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.540
representing what
we thought it was.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.190
And surprisingly, what we found
that was that people's trade

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.490
attitudes weren't
actually influenced

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.590
by whether the
occupation they were in

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.260
or the industry
that they were in

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.430
was vulnerable to
the effects of trade.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.690
We classified things
along whether they

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.790
were imported competing
or export oriented

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.160
or trade neutral kinds of jobs.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.730
And that didn't seem
to have anything

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.770
to do with their
trade preferences,

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.210
although education
definitely did.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.737
We also looked at
the communities

00:16:53.737 --> 00:16:54.570
in which they lived.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.780
Maybe if you're in a
manufacturing community that's

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.190
been really hard hit by trade.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.640
You would be more anti-trade.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.550
We didn't find that.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.260
We didn't find the people
who had lost their jobs were

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.390
more anti-trade.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.520
We also asked people in the
context of national surveys,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.760
whether they thought their
place of employment exported,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.450
imported, and so
on and so forth,

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:22.660
and even using their own self
perceived status in the economy

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.109
didn't predict how
they felt about trade.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.089
Further, the usual
suspects, that

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.230
is political party, those
kinds of identifications

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.350
are not strong predictors of
people's trade attitudes, which

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.770
makes it a rather unusual issue
in the world of public opinion

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.360
these days.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.600
So what did we find?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.060
Well, if you look
here, what you'll

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.650
see in the shaded areas of
this graph, the shaded bars,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.150
it shows the number of
Americans, the percentage who

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.360
say they are affected positively
or negatively by trade

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.209
or not influenced at all.

00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:58.000
And if you look at that
bar in the middle--

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.260
the tall, dark bar-- you see
that over 60% of Americans

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.730
say trade has no effect
on them and their family

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.730
financial situation.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:13.170
And in fact, at the moment,
that's actually not so far off.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.420
Most occupations in the
US are neither trade

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.770
positive or negative.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.020
They're actually trade neutral.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.600
That may change obviously.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.970
But this is part of the reason
that people aren't so much

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.790
politicizing their own
economic self-interest is

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.760
that most people
don't see themselves

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.970
as affected by trade,
whether they are

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.200
or they aren't in practice.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.610
On the other hand, when it
comes to perceiving trade

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.530
as having effects
on the US economy,

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.050
people definitely
do perceive that.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:47.030
Slightly more perceive
it overall as having

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.850
detrimental effects
than negative.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:53.232
But it's fairly split
along those lines.

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:56.390
The problem was we had
kind of discovered what

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.980
didn't drive trade attitudes.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.340
But we really hadn't
made a positive case

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.750
for what was
actually responsible.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.120
We know that the perceived,
collective national interest

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.410
with respect to trade
does seem to matter,

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.520
it does seem to predict
people's trade attitudes.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.520
What hadn't been
looked at much is

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.540
how people were affected
by how they thought

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.220
trade affected other countries.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.130
Were they concerned
about things like effects

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.130
on the environment?

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.300
Or potentially the treatment
of workers overseas as a result

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.680
of trade?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.310
Overall, we also have a
very thin understanding

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.760
of how the media
covers these issues

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.080
and what the impact of that
coverage is likely to be.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.450
So if not self-interest,
then what?

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:43.420
Well, one of the peculiar
findings in our earlier surveys

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.610
of attitudes toward trade was
that very consistently measures

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.550
of domestic racism
predict trade preferences.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:55.820
Higher prejudice levels are
linked to anti-trade views.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.800
And this is the kind of
measure whether you do it

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.600
with using racial
resentment, or you

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.380
do it having each racial group
evaluate other racial groups

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.520
and make a
comparison, regardless

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.550
of how it was measured, it
was a really strong predictor

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.560
of trade attitudes.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.350
And this initially struck
us as kind of strange,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.250
because what does domestic
racism have to do with trade?

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.660
Well, what these
things have in common

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.490
is a tendency to divide
the world into us

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:28.800
and them, a tendency to
think of the world in terms

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.490
of in groups and out groups.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.420
And that was really the point
of departure for the studies

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.870
that I'm going to talk about
for the most part today was

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:43.070
to look at the role of in
group and out group tendencies

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.900
in predicting
attitudes toward trade.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.850
When we think about things like
other globalization views like,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.030
let's say, immigration, then it
becomes a little more logical

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.350
to people that
prejudice matters,

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.670
because you're talking
about people coming

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.562
from other countries to the US.

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:03.770
But it's important to note
that in the case of trade,

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.040
we're talking about
products coming in and out.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.330
We're not talking about human
beings for the most part.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.130
Nonetheless, it's very much
part of the same framework

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.700
of attitudes toward
globalization.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.600
So the way I approached this
theoretically to begin with

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.190
was I thought in terms of a
standard two by two matrix,

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.500
thinking about how
people in the US

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.360
perceive their country to
be helped or hurt by trade,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.620
and how they perceive our
trading partner countries

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.330
to be affected by trade.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.350
And in the upper
left there, you see

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.620
what I call the standard
economist's view.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.130
And that's the idea
that trade is basically

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:47.460
a win-win kind of thing,
both for the United States

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.380
and for a trading
partner countries,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.740
that it helps both entities.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.280
And most surveys of
economists show that over 90%

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.770
of economists endorse
this viewpoint.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.290
Now they may have quibbles with
particular trade agreements

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.850
and the details, but
over all, they're

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:09.210
very likely to espouse
views this suggests why not?

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.930
Everybody wins.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.470
There are some
economists that are

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.940
in the lower left-hand cell,
what I've labeled zero sum

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.170
exploitation, meaning
that they see trade

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:24.980
agreements as designed to
help the United States,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.290
not only gain, but gain more
than other countries and to,

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.780
thus, exploit other countries.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.700
In the lower right
quadrant, we have

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.100
people who think it's bad
for us and bad for them,

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.890
both the in group and
the out group, the United

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.360
States and our trading
partner countries.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.250
These people tend to be
highly isolationist overall,

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.750
not surprisingly.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.660
And then finally, in the
upper right-hand cell

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.870
is a zero sum
perception of trade

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.830
that suggests people see it
as largely bad for the US,

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.590
but helping other countries.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.890
And as you'll see
a few minutes, that

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.940
is overwhelmingly where most
Americans place themselves

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.790
with respect to trade.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.620
So when we ask people in
an open-ended context,

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.350
after they've told us
their trade attitudes, why?

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.300
What are the reasons that
they'd give for opposing trade?

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.770
Overwhelmingly, people
pick hurting US jobs.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.960
That is the major
reason for opposition

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.440
to trade without us
telling them anything.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.590
The second largest
category is that we

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.930
should put the US first.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.440
And again, it's pretty much
implying the same thing,

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.190
that to trade would be not
putting the US first and not

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.880
in the US's best interests.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.970
So in terms of the breakdown
of the American public,

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.800
just over 50% of the public
espouses the foreign aid view,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.640
meaning that they see
trade as essentially

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.330
a form of foreign aid, that we
are engaging in a practice that

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.680
benefits trading partner
countries at the expense

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.300
of United States.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.110
So from that
perspective, it's obvious

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.930
why it's not very popular,
because foreign aid itself

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.630
is not very popular either.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.460
But the answer that
people give here

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.770
turns out to be really
important for understanding

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:26.080
how it falls into this in group,
out group kind of framework.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.990
So what we did is
after we asked people

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.030
in an open-ended context
in a large, national survey

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.240
about their reasons for
favoring, opposing trade,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.490
we then asked them along
a lot of other dimensions,

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.850
because one of the
things that's lacking

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.750
in our understanding of
public opinion about trade

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.520
is an understanding of how these
other dimensions factoring in.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.720
What about the environment?

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.400
What about impact on
the cost of goods?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.300
Or what about the democratic
peace kind of argument?

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.560
Do people see it as good
for national security

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.690
to trade with other
countries and so forth?

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.660
So we asked about all
these different dimensions,

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.330
both with respect to the
United States and with respect

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.810
to the United States
trading partner countries.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.160
What we found was, I guess,
in some ways not surprising.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.130
But we found that trade is not
particularly multi-dimensional.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.850
And although I know
there's certainly

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.070
interest groups out
there that emphasize

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.970
one dimension or another
of these benefits

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.510
or costs of trade, if you see
trade as good for one thing,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.766
you see it as good
for everything.

00:25:32.766 --> 00:25:34.890
And when you think about
that that especially makes

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.190
very little sense in
that people, for example,

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.580
say it's bad for
jobs also say it's

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.900
terrible for the cost of
goods in the United States.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.120
And in fact, about
48% of US public

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.920
believes that trade raises
the cost of consumer

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.660
goods in this country.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.450
So what appears to be
going on is you either

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.580
like it or you hate it.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:02.444
And everything else kind of
flows from that overall feeling

00:26:02.444 --> 00:26:03.860
in terms of whether
you think it's

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.095
good for all of these
different dimensions.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.840
Within each of these
dimensions also

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.700
people are either very
positive or very negative

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.500
for the most part.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.220
That is either they think it's
good for jobs in both places

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.370
or good for cost of
goods in both places,

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.600
or bad in both cases.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.770
There's one is really
important exception.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.540
And again, I think
this underlines

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.880
why it's become such a
contentious issue in the United

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.780
States.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.890
And that one exception is jobs.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.542
The more you think
it helps the US--

00:26:38.542 --> 00:26:40.500
or the more you think it
helps other countries,

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.100
the more you think
it hurts the US.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.350
And looking across
these bars here,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.370
they represent-- the
height represents

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.150
the extent to which
you think it helps

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.810
versus hurts the US and its
trading partner countries.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.140
And what you'll notice is in
that in five of these seven

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.940
dimensions, the mean
is significantly higher

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.510
in terms of it helping
trading partner countries.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.920
There are two exceptions.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.060
The cost of goods, where it's
much more even in the US,

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:13.190
sees itself as having slightly
more benefits than harm.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.240
And the environment where,
again, the US is the white bar,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.100
is slightly higher than the
benefits for trading partner

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.120
countries.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.350
But jobs, in particular,
has this enormous gap.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.060
And in fact, rather than
being positively correlated,

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.290
as I mentioned all these
other measures are,

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.290
these two are strongly
negatively correlated.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:37.080
So you see it very
much in zero sum terms,

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.870
as if there's a
finite number of jobs.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.640
And if you move them
from here to there,

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.580
than this place gets less
and this place gets more.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.100
Well, if you have
to ask yourself,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.630
if people think that this is
harmful to the US for the most

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.890
part, why do they
think we do it?

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.610
And here, I turned
to popular books

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.310
on the global economy, the
kind that you can pick up

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.760
an airport bookstore.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.160
And they were actually very
useful for these purposes,

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.080
because there's a
certain narrative that

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.640
flows through these books.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.640
And basically, it
goes like this.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.300
If trade benefits them
at the expense of the US,

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.750
the only way to explain it is
it's about greed versus loyalty

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.510
to one's country.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.620
Corporate greed
leads top executives

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.020
to sell out the American
worker in favor of greater

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.100
profits for themselves.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.970
So that's the main
story line that kind of

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:39.430
explains US involvement in
trade in many popular books

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.919
and articles these days.

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:42.460
But what's interesting
is if you read

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.585
these books a little
further-- and this is actually

00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:47.600
from that same one-- you'll
find that they're a little more

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.930
nuanced than that.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:54.750
They actually do say that trade
maximizes collective benefits.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.500
They just argue that that's not
good enough because it doesn't

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.100
maximize in group benefits.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.960
So to give you an example
here from one of the pages,

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.500
his firm's investment committee
discusses the question

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.370
of who wins and who
loses in today's economy.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.870
He said one of the
senior colleagues

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.270
had argued that
the hollowing out

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.130
of the American middle
class doesn't really matter.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.380
His point the CEO explained,
was that if the transformation

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.660
of the world economies
lifts four people

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.630
in China and India
out of poverty

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.890
and into the middle
class, and meanwhile

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.870
means one American drops
out of the middle class,

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.030
that's not such a bad trade.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.370
Now, the authors of
this book feel obviously

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.820
that isn't a good trade.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.610
And as they continue,
the only problem

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.650
is that no one told
working Americans

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:42.030
they were going to forfeit their
future so that people in China,

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.650
India, Brazil, and other
developing countries

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.640
could become part of
a global middle class.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.340
So they are acknowledging
collective benefits.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.520
It's just not
collective benefits

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.600
for the ingroup nation.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:02.420
So this is what really led
me to my studies of things

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.790
other than self-interest that
will predict trade attitudes.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:09.410
And the first one is a fairly
simple and obvious one,

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.500
and that is the idea
that people favor

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.620
they're national
ingroup strictly

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.310
because they are all
members of the same country.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.780
What I call the
compatriotism hypothesis.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.200
And what I consider evidence
of this in my studies

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.070
is if they follow
a strategy that

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:31.380
maximizes the in group
benefit rather than

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.130
the maximum collective
benefit for everyone.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:39.400
So that's one form of
ingroup favoritism.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.800
The second form of
ingroup favoritism

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.780
comes out of some of
Jim Sidanius's work

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.800
here at Harvard.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.450
And he calls this form of
ingroup favoritism Vladimir's

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:51.120
Choice.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.880
And it comes from an old
Eastern European folktale.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.770
And the story goes like this.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.670
Vladimir is a peasant.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:03.630
And one day late in his life,
God comes to him and says,

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.760
Vladimir, you've
been a good man.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.050
I'm going to grant you
one thing that you want,

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.280
anything in the world.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.550
You just tell me what it is.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:14.870
But there's a catch.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.430
And that catch is
whatever I give to you,

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.850
I give to your neighbor
Ivan twice over.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.570
So Vladimir thinks
about it for a minute.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:29.280
And he says, OK, fine,
take one of my eyes out.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.620
OK, now, Vladimir
is not better off.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.580
However, relative to Ivan
he's a lot better off

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.830
because Ivan can't see at all.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.150
I mean, he has at least one eye.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.360
So this is a case
where what matters

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.740
to him is his relative
advantage over his neighbor.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.170
This is a second form
of ingroup favoritism

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.836
that we also see with
respect to trade.

00:31:56.836 --> 00:31:58.210
There are certain
kinds of people

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.830
that we know are especially
likely to exhibit

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.390
this kind of intergroup
competition perspective

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.690
on ingroup favoritism.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:12.840
And first of all, if
they choose something

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.960
that isn't necessarily
good for them,

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.030
but because it puts them
above some other group

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.720
or above some other
individual, then we

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.370
know they're trying to maximize
the relative ingroup benefit,

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.000
not just the overall benefit.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.740
So one group very susceptible
to this particular tendency

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.370
are people who
are high in what's

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.110
known as social
dominance orientation.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.540
And again, this is a
concept that also comes out

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.490
of Jim Sidanius's work.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:45.270
But it basically
is a short scale

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.700
that taps people's
belief in group

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.630
hierarchy, the appropriateness
of group hierarchy.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.850
Should some groups
have authority

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.480
over others and so forth?

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.980
So we'd expect people
with a high degree

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.170
of social dominance--
it matters to them who's

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.370
on top-- to be
especially likely to care

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.830
about relative gains
over absolute gains.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.140
The second characteristic
that we know

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.920
exacerbates this tendency is
when you perceive something

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.790
to be a zero sum game.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.420
So to the extent
that you believe

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.280
trade is zero sum,
like those people

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:23.660
in the upper right-hand corner
of my two by two matrix,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.400
if they think they only when
somebody else loses, then

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.340
they are very likely
to also exhibit

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.690
a preference for relative
gains over absolute gains.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.730
So what I did to
look at this was

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:43.020
I had a large scale survey
of the American population,

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.310
about 3,000 people.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.110
And I did what's known
as a survey experiment.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.370
And for those of you who
don't know that term,

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:54.200
it's basically like doing
any other experiment,

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.260
except that rather than
using college sophomores

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.810
or a convenience
sample of people,

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:05.400
you use a representative sample
of the population to execute

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.960
your experimental design.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.960
And this particular one is
done on the web in order

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.310
to make that possible.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:16.090
Basically, there are two
experimental factors here.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:20.190
One is who gains and who loses
from a trade policy that's

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.139
described to the public.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.620
In one set of conditions, the
US gains and the trading partner

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.580
loses.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.699
In another, the trading
partner gains same amount

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.420
and the US loses.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.219
And then the third
condition, both gain.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.560
And this is really
the conditions

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.839
that is meant to simulate the
view of trade that is everybody

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:41.880
gets something out of it.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.130
It's a win-win kind of scenario.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:48.219
The numbers across the top refer
to how much is gained or lost

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:51.000
by each party in each
condition, because we

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.739
did vary that as well to see how
much difference it really made.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:59.980
So this is the
actual description

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.740
of the policy we gave people.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.070
The words that are
in yellow change

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:06.390
if you were in a lose
or a gain scenario.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.380
And the numbers
obviously changed.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.420
And all we did was
ask people on a 1 to 4

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:16.660
scale how much they'd support
this particular trade policy.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.260
So to talk at the
compatriotism hypothesis,

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.290
we compare conditions where
the absolute gain is the same.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.940
But in one case, it's the
US that's gaining more.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.440
And in the other case, it is
the trading partner country

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.700
that is gaining.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.730
And not surprisingly,
there's a huge preference

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:39.560
for the policy the benefits the
US over the trading partner.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.440
Now, in looking at this, one
of the things that immediately

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.230
occurred to me, and the reason
we did the varying the amount

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.730
of gain or loss,
is surely there's

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:55.420
some level of trading partner
gain and some low level of loss

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.690
in the US that would raise
people's level of support

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.450
for the policy.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.710
And when I initially did
this, I pre-tested it

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.830
on a convenience sample people.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.330
And this is what I found.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.630
If you look at the two
lines, the green line

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:16.420
shows you if the US gains some
amount and the trading partner

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.835
loses, how much support
for trade they exhibit.

00:36:19.835 --> 00:36:23.590
And as you can see,
if the US gains only 1

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:29.880
and the trading partner loses
1,000, support is very low.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.736
Vice versa, if you say
the US loses only 1

00:36:32.736 --> 00:36:36.290
and the trading
partner gains 1,000

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.490
you have a higher level of
support, not surprisingly.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:43.460
And this simply shows the means
that each of those points.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.460
But the most important
thing to note

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.400
here is that the
lines cross, meaning

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.120
that there is a point
at which we can say

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.270
how much one American is worth.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.970
In this particular
sample, 1 American

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.330
is worth 25 foreigners.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.730
And as crass as that
may sounds, basically

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.920
in weighing gains and
losses, at a certain point,

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.120
if there's 25 or more
gains on the other side,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.850
people are willing to
support it at the same level

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.427
that they would otherwise.

00:37:14.427 --> 00:37:16.510
But as I mentioned, this
was a convenience sample.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.880
I did it mainly to
make sure people

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.750
understood the treatments and
could answer them and so forth.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.600
In that same convenience
sample, quite logically,

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.470
when you gave people
the gain-gain scenario,

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.360
they're far more
supportive of trade

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.560
as shown in the
yellow line here,

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.280
because what's not so
like if everybody wins?

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.960
Unfortunately, a representative
sample of the United States

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.870
didn't look quite the same.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.480
And in fact, what
you see here is

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.460
when we go to a representative
national sample,

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.610
the lines never cross,
at least not when

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.790
we go up to 1,000 people.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:38:00.820
If they do cross it's at a much
greater number of foreigners

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.040
than only 25 or even 1,000 here.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.250
So basically, what we see is
no amount of trading partner

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.990
gain will compel
Americans to support trade

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:17.550
in the absence of the
gains for the US itself.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.650
The other thing that's kind
of surprising about this

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:25.930
is that I looked and looked for
subgroups that perhaps showed

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.690
this pattern of crossing over.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.620
And the only one
I was able to find

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.880
was people who are low in
social dominance, people

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.480
who don't believe in hierarchy.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.660
They're far more oriented
toward egalitarianism.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.980
At 1 American to
1,000 foreigners,

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.476
those lines do, in fact, meet
strictly for in those low

00:38:45.476 --> 00:38:46.510
in social dominance.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.830
But it doesn't matter.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.400
You could look at liberals and
conservatives and all kinds

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.950
of subgroups and not find
any point at which they meet.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.770
After they were asked the
question about the trade

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.480
policy, we asked people to
tell us what kinds of things

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.390
they were thinking about as
they answered the question.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.550
And I found reading
through these

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:12.960
a very sobering experience
for reasons you'll understand.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.310
People were very
forthright in saying

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:21.850
that the priority for our
care should be our own people.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.570
We need to help ourselves first.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.670
I think the US
should require two US

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.290
jobs for each foreign jobs.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.630
I think we need to take care
of our own first, that's

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:33.230
what's most natural.

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:34.680
And so on and so forth.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.860
So there are a lot--
I'll be honest,

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.170
this is just a tiny sample.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:42.970
There a lot of very, very
vitriolic, bitter comments

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.150
of this kind.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.780
But I can also say that
there are some comments that

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.620
are totally the opposite.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:57.810
There are people who basically
thought this through and said

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.460
out right, at the
end of the day,

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.000
humanity, not nationality,
is what matters.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.220
And basically these
are people who

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.690
realized the tremendous
importance of where

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.540
you're born.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.300
And they would say
things along the lines

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.620
that people shouldn't be favored
because of where they live.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.340
Some said they had
more to gain than we

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.740
have to lose from that trade-off
on a basic human level.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.590
And I particularly
like this last one--

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:30.230
it's a numbers game, have to
consciously suppress tribalism.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.790
So obviously, some
people are very

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:35.380
aware that this ingroup
outgroup kind of thing

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.490
is going on when they think
about policies of this kind.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.690
But we had purposely
set up the policies

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:44.540
to involve gains and
losses of various kinds.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:49.060
In some cases, people
berated the United States

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.680
for engaging in trade,
saying that basically we're

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.790
just too darn generous, that
we need to help ourselves,

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.110
and how did we become
the world's savior

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:02.570
and so on and so
forth, and suggesting

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.260
that the politicians should
move there and give all

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.820
their money away, and so forth.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.700
So you get the general idea
in these statements of what

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.030
people are thinking about.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.170
And this is across all of the
experimental conditions, not

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:19.120
one in particular here.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.750
Basically, the bottom line
from this first finding

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:27.230
is that putting Americans first
is a highly socially acceptable

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.630
form of ingroup favoritism.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.050
Obviously, as a
political psychologist,

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.330
we spend lots and lots
of time and effort

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.480
trying to tap
attitudes that we think

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.840
are so socially undesirable
that people won't express them

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.310
publicly.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:44.090
People didn't seem to have
any trouble expressing

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.980
their feelings on this issue.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.260
And they didn't
seem to have qualms

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.550
about the social
desirability of doing so.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.760
Further you get-- even
though I'm talking mainly

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.890
about trade today,
just as trade groups

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.850
these issues like
immigration and trade

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:06.550
and so forth, so, too, we
see hugely similar patterns

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.250
in attitudes toward
other issues as well.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.000
The whole point
being whether you

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.450
think it has a negative
impact on jobs in the US

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:19.190
or you see it as
hurting American jobs,

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.920
you think that, as
one respondent put it,

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.360
Americans are more
deserving of those jobs.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:31.370
And people express that quite
forcefully in the answers.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.490
Now, there's another
way to view this.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:36.310
And you could say we're really
not being very near here

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:40.390
on this characterization of
this as ingroup favoritism,

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.970
because couldn't
people feel like it's

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:47.370
a duty or obligation
of citizenship

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:52.350
to help their less fortunate
compatriots who need work?

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:55.610
And so I did quite a
bit of investigating

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.230
this particular possibility.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.850
And my conclusion thus
far is probably not.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.310
And the reason I say
that is that what we find

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:10.110
is that when it comes to caring
for the American ingroup,

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.060
Americans show very
little enthusiasm

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.180
for helping other national
ingroup members that

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.710
are in need, whether it's social
welfare policies or health care

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.900
or other things of this kind.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.460
Now, if they can
personally select

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.280
who the beneficiaries
are-- for example, if it's

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.790
charitable giving
or volunteerism--

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:37.860
then they will make
these choices to give.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:42.320
But basically, as in many
highly heterogeneous societies,

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.830
we don't see the
strong tendency to take

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:47.500
care of one's compatriots.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.330
And in fact, when it comes to
things like social welfare,

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.330
the more strongly you
identify as American,

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.670
the less supportive you
are of social welfare

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.810
types of policies in the US.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.980
So again, this is that to
be investigated further.

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.800
But it's pretty
difficult to argue

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.810
that they feel this
overwhelming desire

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.050
to take care of one
another as compatriots.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.930
Now, there's one
group of people,

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.570
I call them the oxygen
mask argument people,

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:19.550
because they seem to understand
that what they're saying

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.460
is definitely
ingroup favoritism.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.220
But they have a justification
for that ingroup favoritism

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.630
that's exactly like what
you get on the airplane

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:33.010
when they tell you you've got to
put your oxygen mask on first,

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:36.720
so you'll be able to help the
person next to you afterward.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.830
And many people virtually
said that word for word.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.540
We need to support
our own country

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.840
before assisting others.

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:48.160
Then we should help the less
fortunate after we're OK.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.960
If we don't take care
of our own first,

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.460
how could we be expected
to help our neighbors when

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:56.180
we are in such need ourselves,
and so on and so forth.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.880
So the idea here
is it's not that we

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.800
don't want to accidentally
help someone else,

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.310
it's that we need to
take care of ourselves

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:06.530
first in order to be of use.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.800
So just to give you an
idea, as I leave aside

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.090
these open-ended comments, one
of the fascinating things to me

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:18.220
is the difference in
levels of ingroup favoring

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.080
an outgroup denigrating
comments versus the opposite

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.990
in these different conditions.

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:27.040
When trade is framed as
something where the US loses

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.170
and the trading
partner games, you

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.400
get a huge amount of vitriol.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.410
You get a lot of
nastiness about foreigners

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.380
and so on and so forth.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.560
That gives less when the US
gains and the trading partner

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.280
loses.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.880
And it gets lower still,
although it's still

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.030
at 23% of people
who make comments

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:49.540
of that kind when the US gains
and the trading partner games.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.590
So even when everyone
wins, there's

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.230
a fair amount of that
sentiment coming forth.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:58.020
OK, the second
hypothesis I think

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:02.090
is even more problematic
in a lot of ways,

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:02.930
the evidence of it.

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.790
And that is the idea
of Vladimir's choice,

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:07.460
or intergroup competition.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.930
The idea that even
when we both win

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:14.900
we might not be happy about it
because it doesn't advantage us

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.340
over another country
in competitive terms.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.170
So these are just the
means in trade support

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.590
when the US gains and
the trading partner

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:27.420
loses versus the US gains and
the trading partner gains.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:31.090
Now you might think what's not
to like when everybody gains?

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.560
And they're gaining
the same amount overall

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.900
in these two scenarios.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.680
But there's no difference in
levels of support for trade

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.170
regardless of whether it's
a win-win or win for the US

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.400
and loss for our trading
partner countries.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.030
So very little
evidence that people

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:51.390
care a lot about the
impact on other countries.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.080
In reality, though,
what we're looking

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:58.030
at here hides two very
distinct patterns.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:01.120
Here is the same graph that
we looked at earlier, but,

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.430
in this case, also showing
you the win-win line,

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:06.220
the yellow line.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.780
As you can see,
there's no difference

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.890
between the win-win scenario
in levels of support

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.040
and the one where
only the US wins.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.190
So people seem to
be using strictly

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:18.980
how much the ingroup
gains as the primary basis

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.480
for their decision.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.320
However, what's interesting
is if you look at people who

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.990
are high in this social
dominance kind of orientation,

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:33.890
they're actually significantly
less supportive of trade

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:37.380
if it benefits the
trading partner country.

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:42.170
So basically, they care more
about relative advantage.

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:44.610
For those who are low
in social dominance,

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:46.500
it actually increases support.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.950
And those two groups are
largely canceling one another

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.850
out in the overall
means that we saw there.

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:57.430
But basically, if you
care about your position

00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:01.030
relative to others, you
are far more favorable

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:05.030
when your side gains and
the other side loses.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.510
Same thing is true looking
at whether or not people

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.130
see trade in zero sum terms.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:13.870
If they see it as something
that is a zero sum game,

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:16.110
then they are less
likely to support it

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:17.460
when it's a win-win scenario.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:21.340
And that makes perfect
sense, because if me winning

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:26.860
means somebody else has to lose
and vice versa, then obviously,

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.170
it makes a lot more sense for
them in terms of relative gains

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:35.300
to oppose trade when
everybody gains from it.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.920
The other thing that's
fascinating about intergroup

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.370
competition is it
does a really good job

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:43.140
explaining a lot of the
demographic differences

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.350
that we see with respect
to trade attitudes.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:51.200
For example, women tend to be
more anti-trade than are men.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.710
And that's a very
consistent finding.

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:56.570
By if you look at
the win-win policy,

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:00.240
women are actually
significantly more supportive.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.310
Men, on the other hand,
are more supportive

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:04.870
when the other side
loses, thus reflecting

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.930
higher levels of
competitiveness in that group.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:11.650
It also explains the
bizarre kinds of things

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.880
that we see with Republicans
and Democrats these days.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.730
Traditionally, we
think of Republicans

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:20.460
as being pro-trade because of
their strong belief in market

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.340
values and so forth.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.910
And yet, what we see
here is in the US wins

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:28.830
trading partner loses
condition, yes, Republicans

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:31.650
are indeed more
supportive of trade.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.940
But in the US wins, trading
partner wins condition,

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.940
it's Democrats that are a
lot more supportive of trade.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.980
So obviously, how one views
any particular trade policy

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.790
arrangement is not something
we're examining here.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:50.220
But it tells us why,
for different reasons,

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:54.450
both political parties
find a lot to dislike

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.310
about trade these days.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:01.890
So the next step
in this project was

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:04.590
to look a bit at what
our opinion leaders were

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:05.560
saying about trade.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.490
How are they articulating
to the American public what

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:13.210
one should think about trade?

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.370
And to give you a
sense of this, here

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.804
are two quick ads from the most
recent presidential election.

00:50:19.804 --> 00:50:20.470
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.470
-Fewer Americans are
working today than when

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.770
President Obama took office.

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:28.100
It doesn't have to be this
way if Obama would stand up

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.230
to China.

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:33.090
China is stealing American
ideas and technology, everything

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.690
from computers to fighter jets.

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.340
Seven times, Obama could
have taken actions.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.340
Seven times he said no.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.000
His policies cost
us $2 million jobs.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.500
Obama had years to
stand up to China.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.700
We can't afford four more.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.590
-I'm Mitt Romney and I
approve this message.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.700
-It's time to stand
up at the cheaters

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.830
and make sure we protect
jobs for the American people.

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.330
-Mitt Romney, tough on China.

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:01.630
Romney's companies
were called pioneers

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.436
in shipping US
manufacturing jobs overseas.

00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:06.990
He invested in firms
that specialize

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:10.900
in relocating jobs to low
wage countries, like China.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.860
Even today, part of Romney's
fortune is invested in China.

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.470
Romney's never
stood up to China.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:19.240
All he's done is
send them our jobs.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.190
-I'm Barack Obama and
I approve this message.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.160
[END VIDEO]

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.350
-OK, so as you can
see, the candidates,

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:28.000
they're both saying,
let's beat up on China.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.660
And in fact, the
China bashing ads

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.670
took a huge proportion-- I can't
remember the exact percentage

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:38.030
offhand-- of the advertising
budgets of both candidates.

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.860
So what we see in
terms of public opinion

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.280
is around election
time, everybody

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.690
becomes more anti-trade.

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:49.030
The candidates are,
in effect, leading

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:50.410
in many cases in this position.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.290
But we see the dip
happen in public opinion

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:56.280
as well during election years.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.700
And no doubt, we're going to see
it again this particular year

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.840
based on what's
happened thus far.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.320
So one of the interesting
things is, what kind of effect

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.070
does this have?

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:08.690
Given that the
voices we're hearing

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.110
on both sides of the
political spectrum

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:13.670
are very much that
this is dangerous.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.680
This is harmful, and so forth.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.820
Well, in collaboration with
one of my graduate students,

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.220
we did an experiment
using those very ads.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.810
And people just saw
one of those ads.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:27.360
And then like 30 or
40 minutes later,

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.470
after doing something else,
they were given a task

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:35.780
that involved admitting
undergraduates to a college.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.550
And so they are given a whole
big list of different college

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:39.340
students.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.590
And the different descriptions
of these college students'

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.360
skills and
accomplishments and all

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.110
that are randomly assigned to
each of the different pictures

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:49.580
and so forth.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.990
But what we
systematically varied

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:55.980
in this Latin square
design was the nationality

00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.140
of the student and
secondly, whether there

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.220
were Chinese--
separately whether they

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.670
were Chinese American or not.

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:09.160
And maybe not
surprisingly, although I

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:14.070
think it's a very sad kind of
statement about our politics,

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.420
in this study of who
should be admitted,

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.300
those who had been
randomly assigned

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.340
to see the anti-China rather
than just a product ad,

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.310
systematically discriminated
more in admissions

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:29.900
against both Chinese nationals
and also Chinese Americans.

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:34.880
So what this suggests is that
when political leaders use

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:39.430
this issue for purposes
of getting more votes,

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:42.660
it's not without its
consequences for other aspects

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:44.970
of society as well.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:48.340
The idea of the Chinese and
threatening and so forth

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:53.180
trickles down even to American
citizens of Chinese descent.

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:58.040
In case I haven't
made this point clear,

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.610
it's not about the jobs and
the economy, strictly speaking.

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:05.550
And this slide shows you
what I think many people find

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:06.720
quite surprising.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.020
And that is if we
look at members

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.010
of minority groups,
non-whites and whites,

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:13.512
we see a difference here.

00:54:13.512 --> 00:54:14.970
Let me see if I
can use my pointer.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:18.080
If you look at the red
line on the bottom,

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:21.910
that's when the US loses and
the trading partner gains.

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:26.200
Minorities are much
more supportive of trade

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.640
than our whites over here.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.170
And overall, their
means are very different

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:33.360
regardless of condition.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.040
Now what's
interesting about this

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.770
is if you're thinking
about this in terms

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:42.360
of who has the kind of jobs most
susceptible to being displaced

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.060
by competition, it's minorities.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.730
They actually are more
vulnerable to the impact

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:51.700
of trade than are
whites, on the whole.

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.100
So it's surprising,
and further indicative,

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:58.610
I think, of this fact
that it's not just

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.930
about economic vulnerability.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:05.050
To the extent that plays a
role, it's not a very big one.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:09.610
The sense of ingroup
outgroup kinds of animosity

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:14.880
plays a large role in where
people stand on this issue.

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.800
So what about news coverage?

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.770
As you know, I'm
somebody who likes

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.630
to study political
communication in particular.

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:28.300
So I began collecting huge
databases of all references

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:32.290
to globalization and to trade
in particular for this project

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:33.550
as well.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:35.520
Surprisingly, until
this year, there

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.920
have been relatively
small amounts of coverage.

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.710
And they're primarily negative.

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:44.050
They're about job
loss overwhelmingly.

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:47.090
But one more fascinating
things about this

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.540
is how they're covered.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:53.560
The harms of globalization, of
trade in particular, job loss,

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.680
are concrete.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.310
They're easy to observe and
easy to report on for reporters.

00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:00.750
They go and they
interview the poor person

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:03.380
whose job has disappeared
and have been sent to China

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.960
or whatever the case might be.

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.800
On the other hand job gains are
reported on very differently.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:14.340
When they're covered, they're
presented very abstract terms.

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:18.670
And it's very
difficult to humanize

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.790
the coverage of job
gains, because it

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:25.500
tends to be many steps
along the process.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.880
What we know from
political psychology

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.330
is people are likely to think
about losses very differently

00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.370
from how they think about games.

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:36.880
So what I embedded in
this larger experiment

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.085
is a look at how differences in
the type of media coverage that

00:56:41.085 --> 00:56:43.170
are received by
winners and losers

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:46.160
impact attitudes about trade.

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.180
And I'll be honest, this
is from when I first

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.150
started this project.

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:51.430
I googled job loss.

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:53.050
Google Image search,
just randomly

00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:54.220
what happened to come up.

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.070
And what you get are
these pictures of mainly

00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:02.362
white man looking sad, because
they have pink slips in hand.

00:57:02.362 --> 00:57:03.820
You've also get
that one about that

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.100
have PhD finished three
post-docs graduate--

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.420
students in the audience,
please don't look.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.790
It's very depressing.

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:12.500
In any case, when you
put in job gain or job

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.270
creation, what you get is this.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:17.950
You get a bunch of
abstract statistics.

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:22.410
And that's very consistent with
how we see trade being covered,

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:25.130
the gains and losses of trade.

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:27.680
Certainly, it has
both gains and losses.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.800
But they aren't framed
at all in the same way.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.530
We know that people's
judgments about policies

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:39.600
are commonly influenced by
the kind of mental imagery

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.850
that we think about when
an issues brought up.

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.820
And what we know
from previous studies

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:49.190
is that negative consequences
are a lot easier to visualize

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.400
than positive ones.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.860
And for that reason,
I hypothesized

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:58.260
that trade losers are going to
be more vivid in people's minds

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.750
than are trade winners.

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:03.760
Secondly, I also
hypothesized based

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.760
on a lot of previous research
that in those scenarios

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.340
where we say one
loser versus, say,

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:15.790
1,000 losers, that the
kind of sympathy or empathy

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:19.220
that is evoked for
those users will

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:24.410
be far less when it's 1,000
losers than when it's just one.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:29.690
We know that the
one often creates

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:35.570
very vivid images in our
mind that statistics do not,

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.550
especially when they're
large and abstract.

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:40.550
So we predicted that the
one person affected would

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:42.710
be more visible than the many.

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:46.240
These illustrations
of these findings

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:48.780
come from the open-ended
comments people gave.

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:51.740
First of all, losers
were a lot more vivid.

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.050
People said, I
pictured in my mind

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:56.210
the people who would be jobless.

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:59.290
I pictured the people who would
automatically lose their jobs,

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.920
and so on and so forth.

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.350
Second hypothesis
was also confirmed.

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:07.450
That is people, regardless
of whether the one person was

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:12.060
a foreigner or an American,
they pictured that one person

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:16.180
far more vividly than they
pictured in their minds' eye

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.700
the large collective.

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.750
I picture the people affected,
but more so the single person

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:25.780
who wouldn't be able to
support their family.

00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:30.150
Abstract thought seems to
be a necessary condition

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:33.560
for understanding both
the gains and losses that

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.810
come from trade.

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.950
I found it fascinating that
respondents said things like,

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:42.430
I didn't picture real people,
but rather abstract people,

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:43.920
such as on a chart.

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:47.760
Just like the image from the
Google Image search, people

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.230
who think in terms
of abstract numbers,

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:54.220
find it easier to see
this as advantageous.

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:58.860
So just to summarize where I
am with this project so far,

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:02.060
we know that ingroup
favoritism matters a lot

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.020
to trade preferences in
multiple different ways,

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:09.900
both via compatriotism and
through this kind of intergroup

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.450
competition that
makes people unhappy

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:16.060
even with trade policies they
perceive to be helping both us

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.120
and our trading partners.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.350
What's more, media
coverage really

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:25.110
makes it easier for us to
focus on individuals as opposed

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:29.180
to groups as well as on loss.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:32.730
So why did people favor
trade in the beginning?

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:37.420
We have this tendency now to
see trade as about competition.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.060
And that lends itself really
easily to this intergroup

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:42.990
competition way of
viewing the world,

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:45.880
where we're only happy
if we beat the other guy.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.750
Well, if you go back to
the ancient Phoenicians who

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:52.120
developed these keeled boats
that were capable of finally

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.450
going out in the big ocean and
trading with others, what they

01:00:55.450 --> 01:00:59.670
cared about was consumer
goods basically,

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.590
the stuff they could get
from being able to trade.

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.650
And this is a quote
from Plutarch,

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:08.960
who argued that "the sea brought
the Greeks the vine from India,

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.310
from Greece transmitted the
use of grain across the sea,

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:15.060
from Phoenician imported
letters as a memorial

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.900
against forgetfulness,
thus preventing the greater

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.870
part of mankind
from being wineless,

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:22.390
grainless, and unlettered."

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:25.180
So this is obviously not
a competitive framework.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.840
And if you read things from
that era, it was seen as a way

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.560
to get things you
couldn't otherwise get.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.300
Interestingly, among
Americans to do favor trade,

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.080
other than those who
just say it generally

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.650
helps the economy, the most
common positive statement

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:46.450
is that it improves
their access to goods.

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:48.850
So in some ways,
things haven't changed.

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:51.050
What resonates with
the American public

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:55.030
is not theories of comparative
advantage and specialization

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:56.130
and so forth.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.380
Its access to goods.

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.350
And in fact, in
some countries that

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:05.320
is quite salient as a
means for supporting trade.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.970
Obviously, the same kind
of ingroup favoritism

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.350
and the same kind of attitudes
that I'm talking about

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:13.130
are playing a big role
in politics these days.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:16.430
So I have just recently
collected some data

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.920
from a large scale panel
that goes back several years.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.650
And when we look at what drives
support for Donald Trump,

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:26.990
measures of racial
prejudice support it--

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:29.110
and these things
all at the same time

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:33.960
support it-- anti-trade views
encourage support for trade,

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.460
anti-immigration views
independent of that,

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.060
and people with a very high
level of social dominance

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.030
orientation, which
I would bet you

01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:46.470
Trump score quite
high on the SDO index.

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:48.640
So all of the kinds
of things that we're

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.900
talking about-- the need to
win, win, win, and dominate

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.190
others, and be the best, and the
top, and first and so forth--

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:59.420
all of those kinds of things and
those reasons for favoring him

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.660
are part of the same complex
of attitudes and ways

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.670
of viewing the world.

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:11.580
One of the things I find
particularly disappointing, I

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.930
guess is the best word for it,
about the politicians we're

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:19.560
looking at these days
is that basically

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.860
because public opinion sees
trade and sees globalization

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:28.300
as a fairly frightening
kind of development,

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.230
we see politicians
regardless of party

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.030
backing away from free trade.

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:38.580
And a rather than embracing
it, and but saying, hey,

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.300
we need to do
something about workers

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.790
who lose their jobs
to trade, we need

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:45.220
to worry about compensation
and job retraining

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.680
and so forth,
which is inevitably

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.570
going to be part of our
future, we have things like,

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:54.390
oh, let's put up walls,
which is obviously

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:57.480
a metaphor for the very same
kind of thing we're talking

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.820
about-- cutting ourselves off
from the rest of the world.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.450
Whether it's due to
technology or if it's

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:07.640
due to globalization, jobs
are going to disappear.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:11.560
We know that trade both
eliminates jobs and creates

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.420
jobs.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.320
But we really don't want
people to be employed as pin

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.760
setters anymore I'm assuming.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.420
We don't have a need
for pin setters.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.931
Same thing is true, we don't
need switchboard operators

01:04:22.931 --> 01:04:23.430
anymore.

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:27.340
So it doesn't make
sense to save those jobs

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.950
as a means of saving the
livelihood of the people who

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.600
hold those jobs.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.700
So what I'm waiting
for is a politician

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:39.690
who will both embrace
the benefits as well

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:43.290
as the risks of trade and be
willing to put forth policies

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:47.130
that actually create
the kind of reassurance

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.920
that people need
in order to feel

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.880
like it's OK to
open up the United

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.370
States to the rest of the world.

01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:57.190
I'm going to stop there and
open things up for questions.

01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:58.180
Thank you very much.

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:01.230
