00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:12.117
In 1985, three researchers on 
a dolphin-studying expedition

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:13.662
got a little bored.

00:00:13.662 --> 00:00:16.913
To lighten things up, one pretended
to be Poseidon

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:21.565
by placing a seaweed garland on his head
and then throwing it into the ocean.

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:27.193
Moments later, a dolphin surfaced
with the seaweed crowning her head.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.274
Sure, this could have been a coincidence,

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:35.255
but it's also entirely possible that
the dolphin was mimicking the scientist.

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:39.940
That's because dolphins are one
of the smartest animals species on Earth.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.990
So exactly how smart are they?

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.108
Like whales and porpoises,

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:47.709
dolphins belong to the group
of aquatic mammals

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:52.540
known as cetaceans
who comprise 86 different species,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.104
and share a common link with ungulates,
or hoofed animals.

00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:59.500
Originally land mammals,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.160
the first cetaceans entered the water
about 55 million years ago

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:06.791
as large predators with sharp teeth.

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:11.550
Then, a shift in ocean temperatures
about 35 million years ago

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.568
reduced the availability of prey.

00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:17.686
One group of cetaceans who survived
this distruption,

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:22.103
the odontocetes, wound up smaller
with less sharp teeth,

00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:25.538
but also larger and more complex brains

00:01:25.538 --> 00:01:28.238
that allowed for complex 
social relationships,

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:31.893
as well as echolocation to navigate
and communicate.

00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:33.466
Jump ahead to the present,

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:38.227
and modern dolphins' brains are so large
that their encephalization quotient,

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:41.566
their brain size compared to the average
for their body size,

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.855
is second only to humans.

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:46.603
Dolphins have evolved to survive

00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:49.844
through their ability to form 
complex social networks

00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:54.021
that hunt, ward off rivals,
and raise offspring together.

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:56.728
For example, one group of Florida dolphins

00:01:56.728 --> 00:02:01.023
practices a sophisticated form
of cooperation to hunt fish.

00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:04.785
A dolphin designated 
as "the net-maker" kicks up mud

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:06.647
while another gives the signal

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:12.075
for the other dolphins to simultaneously
line up and catch the escaping fish.

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:16.223
Achieving a goal like this requires
deliberate planning and cooperation,

00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:20.521
which, in turn, requires some form
of intentional communication.

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:24.025
Dolphins pass down their communication
methods and other skills

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:26.046
from generation to generation.

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:30.157
Different dolphin populations exhibit
variations in greetings,

00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:33.237
hunting strategies,
and other behaviors.

00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:37.510
This sort of cultural transmission
even extends to tool use.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.303
One group of bottlenose dolphins
off the Australian coast

00:02:41.303 --> 00:02:43.514
nicknamed The Dolphin Sponge Club,

00:02:43.514 --> 00:02:49.073
has learned how to cover their rostrums
with sponges when rooting in sharp corals,

00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:51.859
passing the knowledge 
from mother to daughter.

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.954
Dolphins have even demonstrated
language comprehension.

00:02:54.954 --> 00:02:58.068
When taught a language based on
whistles and hand gestures,

00:02:58.068 --> 00:03:00.544
they not only understood
what the signals meant,

00:03:00.544 --> 00:03:02.849
but that their order had meaning:

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.353
the difference between 
bringing the ball to the hoop

00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:07.633
and bringing the hoop to the ball.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:11.974
So they were able to process two
of the main elements of human language:

00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:14.571
symbols that stand 
for objects and actions,

00:03:14.571 --> 00:03:18.556
and syntax that governs 
how they are structured.

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:22.772
Dolphins are also one of the few species
who pass the mirror test.

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:27.719
By recognizing themselves in mirrors,
they indicate physical self-awareness,

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.786
and research shows they can recognize
not just their bodies,

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:36.956
but also their own thoughts,
a property called metacognition.

00:03:36.956 --> 00:03:39.653
In one study, 
dolphins comparing two sounds

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:44.371
could indicate a same, different,
or uncertain response.

00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:45.625
Just like humans,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:49.384
they indicated uncertainty
more often with difficult trials,

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:51.572
suggesting they're aware 
of what they know,

00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:54.557
and how confident they feel
about that knowledge.

00:03:54.557 --> 00:03:57.443
But some of the most amazing things
about dolphins

00:03:57.443 --> 00:04:01.172
are their senses of empathy, altruism,
and attachment.

00:04:01.172 --> 00:04:05.982
The habit of helping injured individuals
extends across the species barrier

00:04:05.982 --> 00:04:07.817
as evidenced by the many accounts

00:04:07.817 --> 00:04:11.476
of dolphins carrying humans
to the surface to breathe.

00:04:11.476 --> 00:04:14.142
And like us, dolphins mourn their dead.

00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:16.353
When we consider all the evidence,

00:04:16.353 --> 00:04:19.669
we may wonder why humans still hunt
dolphins for meat,

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.176
endanger them through fishing
and pollution,

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:25.028
or imprison them to perform tricks.

00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:28.534
The ultimate question may not be
whether dolphins are intelligent

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.424
and complex beings,

00:04:30.424 --> 00:04:34.601
but whether humans can empathize with them
enough to keep them safe and free.
