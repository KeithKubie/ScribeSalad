00:00:00.831 --> 00:00:03.399
- [Voiceover] Where is the
point on the number line?

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.196
Here we have a number
line that starts at 1.5

00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:10.316
or 1 5/10 and goes to 1 7/10.

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:13.783
The distance between these
larger blue tick marks

00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:17.550
is 1/10 because we go
from 1 5/10 to 1 6/10,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.110
so that went up at 1/10
and then up to 1 7/10.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.277
This distance here is 1/10
or we could write that as

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.218
0.1 or as a fraction 1/10.

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:36.139
That distance between each of these

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:39.300
blue large tick marks is 1/10,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.868
but we want to know what is
this green point right here.

00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:46.342
To figure that out we also
need to figure out what do

00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:50.509
these black tick marks represent,
these smaller distances.

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:55.219
From here to here is 1/10,
and within that 1/10th

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.899
there are one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.899
seven, eight, nine, 10 equal spaces.

00:01:03.023 --> 00:01:07.190
Each of these little spaces
is 1/10 of this distance

00:01:10.252 --> 00:01:14.278
because it's one of the 10 equal spaces.

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:18.445
This, right here, is 1/10th of this 1/10th

00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:23.772
because the large distance is 1/10th

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:26.947
and this is 1/10 of that 1/10th.

00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:30.826
Another way we could say that is 1/100.

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:34.369
1/10th of 1/10th, if you
take 1/10 and divide it

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.585
into 10 pieces, now you have 1/100.

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:42.129
This distance is 1/100 which
means that each of these

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:45.863
distances, this is another
1/100 and another 1/100,

00:01:45.863 --> 00:01:49.610
so how many 1/100 till
we get to our point?

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.443
Let's see.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:55.284
1/100, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:57.710
7/100 is what it took us to get there,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.877
so we could say 7/100, the
fraction or the decimal, 0.07

00:02:03.643 --> 00:02:06.560
with a seven in the hundreds place.

00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:10.128
Looking at the whole number
line now, putting the whole

00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:14.295
thing together, we
started at 1.5 or 1 5/10,

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:21.408
and we went another 7/100, so
we can write that as +7/100.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.688
We have 1 5/10 plus 7/100

00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:33.688
which is a total of 1 57/100 or 1.57.

00:02:36.703 --> 00:02:39.536
Our point, right here, is at 1.57.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:47.233
1 5/10 plus 7/100 gets us to 1 57/100.
