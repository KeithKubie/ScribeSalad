00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.390
The basic premise of any person being within
six degrees of relationship to each other

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.610
traces back to at least 1929, mentioned in
the short story “Chain-Links” from the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.649
book Everything is Different, by Hungarian
author Frigyes Karinthy.

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.700
In the story, Karinthy was putting forth the
idea that, with advances in technology, despite

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.520
vast distances between people and the growing
world population, the world was actually shrinking

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.179
from an interconnectedness standpoint- a trend
that would no doubt only continue over time.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.880
As such, a game is proposed in the story as
follows:

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.860
We should select any person from the 1.5 billion
inhabitants of the Earth – anyone, anywhere

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.860
at all.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.610
He bet us that, using no more than five individuals,
one of whom is a personal acquaintance, he

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.459
could contact the selected individual using
nothing except the network of personal acquaintances.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.960
Although a few toyed with this general idea
(though not necessarily six degrees specifically)

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.650
over the following decades when studying network
theory- most notably Stanley Milgram in his

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.440
famous “Small-World Experiment“- the specific
idea of a supposed maximum of six degrees

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.660
of separation between everyone on Earth didn’t
really enter into popular culture until John

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.920
Guare incorporated it into his play, Six Degrees
of Separation, in 1990.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.590
This was later made into a 1993 film starring
Will Smith, Stockard Channing, and Donald

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.590
Sutherland.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.410
(Ironically, Donald Sutherland for a time
held the crown as the actual most interconnected

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.380
actor, as we’ll get into shortly.)

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.819
This all brings us around to Kevin Bacon and
a trio of college students with nothing better

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.940
to do owing to a snow storm in 1994.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.160
The students in question, Craig Fass, Mike
Ginelli and Brian Turtle of Albright College

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.750
in Reading, PA, were watching Footloose on
TV.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.099
After it ended, the 1994 The Air Up There
either came on or was being advertised.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.090
The three naturally noticed Bacon in both
and began to discuss the amazing number of

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.840
movies Kevin Bacon had starred in and with
whom he worked.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.739
Inspired, they came up with a game in which
someone would mention a random actor or actress’

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.190
name and they would try to figure out how
to connect that person to Bacon in six degrees

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.190
or fewer.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.810
For example: Julia Louis-Dreyfus is connected
to Kevin Bacon by two degrees, as Bacon worked

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.480
with Wayne Knight on JFK and Knight also played
Newman on Seinfeld, in which Louis-Dreyfus

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.130
was Elaine Benes.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.329
She can also be connected in two degrees via
the fact that she and Dianne Weist appeared

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.290
together in Hannah and Her Sisters.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.579
Diane Wiest, of course, appeared with Kevin
Bacon in Footloose.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.489
So how did this go from college party game
to one known the world over?

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.449
This is thanks, in part, to John Stewart and
his aptly named talk show, The Jon Stewart

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.039
Show (1993-1995).

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.060
The students wrote Stewart about their game
and, thinking it would make good fodder for

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.960
his show, they were invited to appear on The
Jon Stewart Show to talk about it.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.789
They also ultimately appeared on the The Howard
Stern Show with Kevin Bacon himself; the game

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.650
spread far and wide from there.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.660
As for Bacon, he at first didn’t care for
the game, but later came around.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.060
In fact, by the time Fass, Turtle, and Ginelli
released the book, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.110
(1996), a companion to the Six Degrees of
Kevin Bacon board game, Bacon had such a change

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.880
of heart, he even wrote the book’s introduction.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.229
Interestingly, while back in the day, we had
to rely on our memories to play the game and

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.740
find a celebrity’s Bacon number, today Google
will do the work for you.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.569
Simply run a search with “Bacon number”
and the person’s name, and Google will tell

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.650
you the degrees of separation.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.580
Just as helpfully, the Oracle of Bacon provides
the same service.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.870
And speaking of the Oracle of Bacon, it turns
out they found you can’t actually connect

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.199
every actor in Hollywood to Bacon in under
six moves.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.560
Further, Bacon isn’t even the most linkable
actor (though after analyzing over 800,000

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.830
actors and actresses in the history of film,
they did find Bacon was more linkable than

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.530
approximately 99% of actors in history).

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.270
As for the true most linkable actor in Hollywood,
this has varied over time, but has included

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.260
such people as Donald Sutherland, Dennis Hopper,
Rod Steiger, and, as of right now, Eric Roberts.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.220
Bacon, interestingly enough, is currently
all the way down at number 455.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.669
Rounding out the top 5 at present are #2 Michael
Madsen, #3 Samuel L. Jackson, #4 Danny Trejo,

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.740
and #5 Willem Dafoe.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.940
One of the earliest popular social media sites
more or less resembling modern social site

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.690
networking (profiles, friends lists, status
updates through the social media site, etc.)

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.560
was SixDegrees.com, created all the way back
in 1997.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.330
Founder Andrew Weinreich even noted they attempted
to make sharing pictures a centerpiece of

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.020
the service, but too few people used digital
cameras at the time, so, as he put it, “We

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.460
had board meetings where we would discuss
how to get people to send in their pictures

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.310
and scan them in.”

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.499
Only a few years later, widely adopted technology
would catch up to the idea.

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:34.689
At its peak, SixDegrees had nearly 4 million
members, ultimately selling for $125 million

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.979
to YouthStream Media Networks in 1999.

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.110
The site would be shut down just two years
later.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.809
Not long after that, sites like Friendster,
MySpace, LinkedIn, XING, and Facebook would

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:49.129
pop up using more or less the same base model.

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:53.029
While Hollywood has the Six Degrees of Kevin
Bacon, the world of mathematics has Erdős

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:57.860
number, coined after famed mathematician Paul
Erdős, whose prolific work saw him publish

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.860
countless papers.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.560
As such, a given mathematician’s Erdős
number is the distance said individual is

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.569
to Paul based on published papers (and the
authors listed), rather than movies and actors

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:36.060
as in the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.
