00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.242
The task for today is to find
particular solutions.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.890
So, let me remind you where
we've gotten to.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.048
We're talking about the
second-order equation with

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:21.036
constant coefficients,
which you can think of as

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:25.024
modeling springs,
or simple electrical circuits.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:29.945
But, what's different now is
that the right-hand side is an

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:35.367
input which is not zero.
So, we are considering,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:41.235
I'm going to use x as your book
does, keeping to a neutral

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:43.808
letter.
But, again, in the

00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:48.338
applications,
and in many of the applications

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:54.000
at any rate, it wants to be t.
But, I make it x.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.799
So, the independent variable is
x, and the problem is,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.613
remember, that to find a
particular solution,

00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:10.741
and the reason why we want to
do that is then the general

00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:17.416
solution will be of the form y
equals that particular solution

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:23.872
plus the complementary solution,
the general solution to the

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:30.000
reduced equation,
which we can write this way.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.141
So, all the work depends upon
finding out what that yp is,

00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:37.556
and that's what we're going to
talk about today,

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:40.099
or rather, talk about for two
weeks.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.296
But, the point is,
not all functions that you

00:01:43.296 --> 00:01:47.510
could write on the right-hand
side are equally interesting.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.925
There's one kind,
which is far more interesting,

00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:54.558
but more important in the
applications than all the

00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:56.956
others.
And, that's the one out of

00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:00.152
which, in fact,
as you will see later on this

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:03.931
week and into next week,
an arbitrary function can be

00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.000
built out of these simple
functions.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.199
So, the important function is
on the right-hand side to be

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.486
able to solve it when it's a
simple exponential.

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:22.320
But, if you allow me to make it
a complex exponential,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.520
so, here are the important
right-hand sides where we want,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.989
we want to be able to do it
when it's of the form,

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.744
e to the ax.
In general, that will be,

00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:40.372
in most applications,
a is not a growing exponential,

00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:43.232
but a decaying exponential.
So, typically,

00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:46.093
a is negative.
But, it doesn't have to be.

00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:48.953
I'll put it in parentheses,
though, often.

00:02:48.953 --> 00:02:52.720
That's not any assumption that
I'm going to make today.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.000
It's just culture.
But, we want to be able to do

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.906
it for sine omega x and cosine
omega x.

00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:03.150
In other words,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.680
when the right-hand side is a
pure oscillation,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.053
that's another important type
of input both for electrical

00:03:11.053 --> 00:03:15.503
circuits, think alternating
current, or the spring systems.

00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:19.800
That's a pure vibration is
you're imposing pure vibration

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.173
on the spring-mass-dashpot
system, and you want to see how

00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:27.396
it responds to that.
Or, you could put them

00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:32.000
together, and make these
decaying oscillations.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.724
So, we could also have
something like e to the ax times

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:41.974
sine omega x,
or times cosine omega x.

00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:45.037
Now, the point is,

00:03:45.037 --> 00:03:50.025
all of these together are
really just special cases of one

00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:52.300
general thing,
exponential,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.587
if you allow the exponent not
to be a real number,

00:03:56.587 --> 00:04:02.918
but to be a complex number.
So, they're all special cases

00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:07.949
of e to the, I'll write it alpha
x,

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:14.088
well, why don't we write it (a
plus i omega) x, right?

00:04:14.088 --> 00:04:16.905
If omega is zero,

00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:20.628
then I've got this case.
If a is zero,

00:04:20.628 --> 00:04:26.666
I got this case separating into
its real and imaginary parts.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:32.000
And, if neither is zero,
I have this case.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.247
But, I don't want to keep
writing (a plus i omega) all the

00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:38.631
time.
So, I'm going to write that

00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:41.760
simply as e to the alpha x.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.784
And, you understand that alpha
is a complex number now.

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:48.317
It doesn't look like a real
number.

00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:52.713
Okay, so the complex number.
So, the equation we are solving

00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:55.768
is which one?
This pretty purple equation.

00:04:55.768 --> 00:04:59.792
And, we are trying to find a
particular solution of it.

00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:03.964
And, the special functions we
are going to use are these,

00:05:03.964 --> 00:05:08.137
well, this one in particular,
e to the alpha x.

00:05:08.137 --> 00:05:13.426
That's going to be our input.

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:19.687
Now, it turns out this is
amazingly easy to do because

00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:26.540
it's an exponential because I
write it in exponential form.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.092
The idea is simply to use a
rule which, in fact,

00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:38.000
you know already,
the rule of substitution.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.600
So, I'm going to write the
equation in the form,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.842
so, there it is.
It's y double prime plus A y

00:05:48.842 --> 00:05:55.276
prime plus B y equals f of x.

00:05:55.276 --> 00:06:02.663
But, I'm going to think of the
left-hand side as the polynomial

00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:07.696
operator, AD plus B.
A and B are constants,

00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:10.705
applied to y equals f of x.

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:13.173
That's the way I write the
thing.

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:16.490
And, this part,
I'm going to think of in the

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.033
form.
This is p of D,

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:21.118
a polynomial in D.
In fact, it's a simple

00:06:21.118 --> 00:06:25.052
quadratic polynomial.
But, most of what I'm going to

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:29.603
say today would apply equally
well if we were a higher order

00:06:29.603 --> 00:06:34.000
polynomial, a polynomial of
higher degree.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.043
And, just to reinforce the
idea, I've given you one problem

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:42.156
in your problem set when p is a
polynomial of higher degree.

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:44.805
I should say,
the notes are written for

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:48.151
general polynomials,
not just for quadratic ones.

00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:52.403
I'm simplifying it by leaving
it, today, I'll do what's in the

00:06:52.403 --> 00:06:56.516
notes, but I'll do it in the
quadratic case to save a little

00:06:56.516 --> 00:07:00.908
time, and because that's the one
you will be most concerned with

00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:05.657
in the problems.
All right, so p of D y equals f

00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:09.771
of x.
And now, there are just a

00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:15.000
couple of basic formulas that
we're going to use all the time.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.971
The first is that if you apply
p of D to a complex

00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:23.828
exponential, or a real one,
it doesn't matter,

00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:27.942
the answer is you get just what
you started with,

00:07:27.942 --> 00:07:32.057
with D substituted by alpha.
So, it's p of alpha.

00:07:32.057 --> 00:07:36.000
In other words,
put an alpha wherever you saw a

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.268
D in the polynomial.
And, what is this?

00:07:40.268 --> 00:07:43.721
Well, this is now just an
ordinary complex number,

00:07:43.721 --> 00:07:46.681
and multiply that by what you
started with,

00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:48.936
e to the alpha x.

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:52.812
So, that's a basic formula.
It's called in the notes the

00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:55.912
substitution rule because the
heart of it is,

00:07:55.912 --> 00:08:00.000
you substitute for the D,
you substitute alpha.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.540
Now, this hardly requires
proof.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.377
But, let's prove it just so you
see, to reinforce things and

00:08:07.377 --> 00:08:12.131
make things go a little more
slowly to make sure you are on

00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:15.573
board all the time.
How would I prove that?

00:08:15.573 --> 00:08:20.409
Well, just calculate it out,
what in fact is (D squared plus

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:25.491
AD plus B) times e to the alpha
x.

00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:30.163
Well, it's D squared e to the
alpha x by linearity plus AD

00:08:30.163 --> 00:08:34.426
times e to the alpha x plus B
times e to the alpha x.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.139
Well, what are these?
What's the derivative of e to

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:46.780
the alpha x?
It's just alpha times e to the

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.358
alpha x.
What's a second derivative?

00:08:50.358 --> 00:08:53.623
Well, if you remember from the
exam, you can do tenth

00:08:53.623 --> 00:08:56.385
derivatives now.
So, the second derivative is

00:08:56.385 --> 00:08:58.520
easy.
It's alpha squared times e to

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.717
the alpha x.

00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:03.228
In other words,
this law, what I'm saying

00:09:03.228 --> 00:09:06.430
really is that this law is
obviously, quote unquote,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.170
"true."
Okay, I'm not even going to put

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.971
it in quotes.
It's obviously true for the

00:09:12.971 --> 00:09:16.263
operator, D, and the operator D
squared.

00:09:16.263 --> 00:09:19.274
In other words,
D of e to the alpha x equals

00:09:19.274 --> 00:09:22.495
alpha times e to the alpha x.

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:25.997
D squared times e to the alpha

00:09:25.997 --> 00:09:30.128
x equals alpha squared times e
to the alpha x.

00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:34.118
And, therefore,

00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:37.997
it's true for linear
combinations of these as well by

00:09:37.997 --> 00:09:39.787
linearity.
So, therefore,

00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:42.994
also true for p of D.
And, in fact,

00:09:42.994 --> 00:09:45.828
so if you calculate it out,
what is it?

00:09:45.828 --> 00:09:50.080
This is alpha squared e to the
alpha x plus alpha e to the

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.555
alpha x times the

00:09:54.555 --> 00:10:00.000
coefficient plus b times e to
the alpha x.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.950
So, it's in fact exactly this.
It's e to the alpha x times

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:10.247
(alpha squared plus A alpha plus
B).

00:10:10.247 --> 00:10:13.807
Now, how are we going to use

00:10:13.807 --> 00:10:16.847
this?
Well, the idea is very simple.

00:10:16.847 --> 00:10:21.623
Remember, we're trying to solve
this, I should have some

00:10:21.623 --> 00:10:25.010
consistent notation for these
equations.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.918
Purple, I think,
will be the right thing here.

00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:33.000
You are solving purple
equations.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.289
The formulas which will solve
them will be orange formulas,

00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:42.210
and we will see what we need as
we go along.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.584
So, I would like to just
formulate it,

00:10:45.584 --> 00:10:49.415
this solution,
the particular solution now.

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:54.977
I'm going to call it a theorem.
It's really too simple to be a

00:10:54.977 --> 00:10:57.349
theorem.
On the other hand,

00:10:57.349 --> 00:11:02.000
it's too important not to be a
theorem.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.683
So, let's call it,
as I called it in the notes,

00:11:06.683 --> 00:11:11.570
the exponential input theorem,
which says it all.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:17.272
Theorem says it's important.
Exponential input means it's

00:11:17.272 --> 00:11:21.650
taking f of x to be an
exponential.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:27.352
It's an exponential input,
and the theorem tells you what

00:11:27.352 --> 00:11:33.330
the response is.
So, for that equation,

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:40.899
I'm not going to recopy the
equation for the purple

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:46.802
equation, adequately indicated
this way.

00:11:46.802 --> 00:11:51.041
There.
Now try to take notes.

00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:59.215
For the purple equation,
a solution is e to the alpha x.

00:11:59.215 --> 00:12:05.391
Somewhere I neglected to say

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:09.831
that f of x, all right,
so for the purple equals e to

00:12:09.831 --> 00:12:14.101
the alpha x, how about that?

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:17.774
That equation,
y double prime plus a y prime

00:12:17.774 --> 00:12:22.812
plus b y equals e to
the alpha x.

00:12:22.812 --> 00:12:25.460
So, here's the exponential

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.534
input.
The solution is e to the alpha

00:12:28.534 --> 00:12:34.000
x divided by p of alpha.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.649
Now, that's a very useful
formula.

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:40.823
In fact, Haynes Miller,
who also teaches this course,

00:12:40.823 --> 00:12:45.800
in his notes calls of the most
important theorem in the course.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.332
Well, I don't have to totally
agree with him,

00:12:49.332 --> 00:12:53.426
but it's certainly important.
It's probably the most

00:12:53.426 --> 00:12:57.038
important theorem for these two
weeks, anyway.

00:12:57.038 --> 00:12:59.688
But, you will have others as
well.

00:12:59.688 --> 00:13:03.942
Okay, so that's a theorem.
The theorem is going green.

00:13:03.942 --> 00:13:09.000
You can tell what they are by
their color code.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.923
Well, in other words,
what I've done is simply write

00:13:12.923 --> 00:13:16.846
down the solution for you,
write down the particular

00:13:16.846 --> 00:13:19.923
solution.
But let's verify it in general.

00:13:19.923 --> 00:13:24.307
So, the proof would be what?
Well, I have to substitute it

00:13:24.307 --> 00:13:27.692
into the equation.
So, the equation is p of D

00:13:27.692 --> 00:13:31.000
applied to y is equal to alpha
x.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.239
And, I want to know,
when I substitute that

00:13:34.239 --> 00:13:37.710
expression in,
is it the case that when I plug

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.643
it in, that the right-hand side,
I calculate it out,

00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:46.117
apply p of D to it.
Is it the case that I get e to

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:49.202
the alpha x on the right?

00:13:49.202 --> 00:13:51.747
Well, all you have to do is do
it.

00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:56.143
What is p of D applied to e to
the alpha x divided by p of

00:13:56.143 --> 00:14:00.000
alpha?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.735
Well, p of D applied to e to
the alpha x is p of alpha times

00:14:03.735 --> 00:14:07.534
e to the alpha x.

00:14:07.534 --> 00:14:10.636
That's the substitution rule.
What about this guy?

00:14:10.636 --> 00:14:13.929
This guy is a constant,
so it just gets dragged along

00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:17.601
because this operator is linear.
If this applied to that is

00:14:17.601 --> 00:14:21.400
this, then if I apply it to one
half that, I get one half the

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.502
answer, and so on.
So, the p of alpha

00:14:24.502 --> 00:14:27.098
is a constant and just gets
dragged along.

00:14:27.098 --> 00:14:30.264
And now, they cancel each
other, and the answer is,

00:14:30.264 --> 00:14:34.000
indeed, e to the alpha x.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.500
That's not much of a proof.
I hope that to at least half

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.399
this class, you're wondering,
yes, but what if Peter had not

00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:48.600
caught the wolf?
I mean, what if?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.000
What if?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.992
I'm looking stern.
Okay, we will take care of it

00:15:04.992 --> 00:15:10.004
in the simplest possible way.
We will assume that p of alpha

00:15:10.004 --> 00:15:13.317
is not zero.
The case p of alpha is zero

00:15:13.317 --> 00:15:17.650
is, in fact,
an extremely important

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:22.832
case, one that makes the world
go 'round, one that contributes

00:15:22.832 --> 00:15:27.674
to all sorts of catastrophes,
and they occur first here in

00:15:27.674 --> 00:15:32.262
the solution of differential
equations, and that's what

00:15:32.262 --> 00:15:37.792
controls all the catastrophes.
But, there's a good side to it,

00:15:37.792 --> 00:15:39.585
too.
It also makes a lot of good

00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:41.667
things happen.
So, there are no moral

00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:44.212
judgments in mathematics.
For the time being,

00:15:44.212 --> 00:15:46.236
let's assume p of alpha is not
zero.

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:48.896
And, that proof is okay because
the p of alpha,

00:15:48.896 --> 00:15:51.614
being in the denominator,
it's okay to be in the

00:15:51.614 --> 00:15:55.026
denominator if you're not zero.
Okay, let's work in a simple

00:15:55.026 --> 00:15:56.992
example.
Well, I'm picking the most

00:15:56.992 --> 00:16:00.000
complicated example I can think
of.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.249
Simple examples,
I'll leave for your practice

00:16:04.249 --> 00:16:08.981
and for the recitations,
can start off with simple

00:16:08.981 --> 00:16:12.457
examples if you are confused by
this.

00:16:12.457 --> 00:16:17.866
But, let's solve an equation,
find a particular solution.

00:16:17.866 --> 00:16:23.757
So, y double prime plus minus y
prime plus 2y is equal to 10 e

00:16:23.757 --> 00:16:29.358
to the minus x sine x.

00:16:29.358 --> 00:16:33.055
Gulp.
Okay, so, the input is this

00:16:33.055 --> 00:16:36.328
function, 10 e to the minus x,

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:40.742
it's a decaying oscillation.
You're seeing those already on

00:16:40.742 --> 00:16:44.396
the computer screen if you
started your homework,

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:47.669
if you've done problem one on
your homework.

00:16:47.669 --> 00:16:52.160
It's a decaying exponential,
and I want to find a particular

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.052
solution.
Well, let's find a particular

00:16:55.052 --> 00:17:00.000
and the general solution.
Find the general solution.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.442
Well, the main part of the work
is finding the particular

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:10.203
solution, but let's quickly,
the general solution,

00:17:10.203 --> 00:17:14.576
let's find first the
complementary part of it,

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:19.047
in other words,
the solution to the homogeneous

00:17:19.047 --> 00:17:22.739
equation.
That's D squared minus D plus

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:26.043
two. No, let's not.

00:17:26.043 --> 00:17:31.000
I don't want to solve messy
quadratics.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.877
Okay, we're going to find a
particular solution.

00:17:34.877 --> 00:17:39.992
I thought it was going to come
out easy, and then I realized it

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:43.210
wasn't because I picked the
wrong signs.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.417
Okay, so if you don't like,
just change the problem.

00:17:47.417 --> 00:17:49.809
I can do that,
but you cannot.

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:53.275
Don't forget that.
So, we want a particular

00:17:53.275 --> 00:17:57.234
solution in our equation.
It is this equals that.

00:17:57.234 --> 00:18:01.690
Now, let's complexify it to
make this part of a complex

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:06.603
exponential.
So, the complex exponential

00:18:06.603 --> 00:18:12.002
that's relevant is ten times e
to the (minus one plus i),

00:18:12.002 --> 00:18:15.473
you see that? x.

00:18:15.473 --> 00:18:19.523
What is this?
This is the imaginary part of

00:18:19.523 --> 00:18:24.730
this complex exponential.
So, this is imaginary part of

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:29.261
that guy, e to the negative x
times e to the i x,

00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:33.889
and the imaginary part of e to

00:18:33.889 --> 00:18:39.000
the i x.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.238
The ten, of course,
just comes along for the ride.

00:18:42.238 --> 00:18:44.816
Okay, well, now,
since this is a complex

00:18:44.816 --> 00:18:48.517
equation, I shouldn't call this
y anymore by my notation.

00:18:48.517 --> 00:18:52.284
I like to call it y tilde to
indicate that the solution we

00:18:52.284 --> 00:18:56.117
get to this is not going to be
the original solution to the

00:18:56.117 --> 00:18:59.158
original problem,
but you will have to take the

00:18:59.158 --> 00:19:03.511
imaginary part of it to get it.
So, we are looking,

00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:08.204
now, for the complex solution
to this complexified equation.

00:19:08.204 --> 00:19:11.784
Okay, what is it?
Well, the complex particular

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:14.727
solution I can write down
immediately.

00:19:14.727 --> 00:19:18.227
It is ten, that,
of course, just gets dragged

00:19:18.227 --> 00:19:22.125
along by linearity,
times e to the (minus one plus

00:19:22.125 --> 00:19:27.056
i) times x.
And, it's over this polynomial

00:19:27.056 --> 00:19:31.952
evaluated at this alpha.
So, just write it down with,

00:19:31.952 --> 00:19:33.974
have faith.
So, what do I get?

00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:36.762
The alpha is minus one plus i.

00:19:36.762 --> 00:19:37.739
I.
square that,

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:41.643
because I'm substituting this
alpha into that polynomial.

00:19:41.643 --> 00:19:45.756
The reason I'm doing that is
because the formula tells me to

00:19:45.756 --> 00:19:47.778
do it.
That's going to be that

00:19:47.778 --> 00:19:50.567
solution.
Okay, so it's minus one plus i,

00:19:50.567 --> 00:19:54.193
the quantity squared, minus
minus one plus i plus two.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:58.167
All I've done is substitute

00:19:58.167 --> 00:20:01.792
minus one plus i for
D in that polynomial,

00:20:01.792 --> 00:20:07.534
the quadratic polynomial.
And now, all I want is the

00:20:07.534 --> 00:20:12.797
imaginary part of this.
The imaginary part of this will

00:20:12.797 --> 00:20:18.548
be the solution to the original
problem because this was the

00:20:18.548 --> 00:20:22.935
right hand side with the
imaginary part of the

00:20:22.935 --> 00:20:28.783
complexified right hand side.
Okay, now, let's make it look a

00:20:28.783 --> 00:20:32.000
little better,
yp tilde.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.902
Clearly, what we have to do
something nice to the

00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:37.321
denominator.
So, I'll copy the numerator.

00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:40.466
That's e to the minus (one plus
i) x

00:20:40.466 --> 00:20:43.006
and how about the denominator?
Well, again,

00:20:43.006 --> 00:20:46.272
don't expand things out because
it's already this long.

00:20:46.272 --> 00:20:48.933
And, what's the point of making
it this long?

00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:50.989
You want to make it as long,
right?

00:20:50.989 --> 00:20:53.952
Okay, then there is room here
for one real number,

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:57.157
and another real number times
i, there's no more room.

00:20:57.157 --> 00:21:02.295
Okay, what's the real number?
Okay, we're looking for the

00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:07.309
real part of this expression.
So, just put it in and keep it

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:09.944
mentally.
So, minus one squared:

00:21:09.944 --> 00:21:13.684
that's one, plus i squared,
that's minus one.

00:21:13.684 --> 00:21:18.019
One minus one is zero.
I can forget about that term.

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:21.759
The term gives me plus one for
the real part,

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:24.819
plus two.
The answer is that the real

00:21:24.819 --> 00:21:28.474
part is three.
How about the imaginary part?

00:21:28.474 --> 00:21:31.535
Well, from here,
there's negative 2i,

00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:38.008
negative 2i.
I'm expanding that out by the

00:21:38.008 --> 00:21:44.227
binomial theorem,
or whatever you like to call

00:21:44.227 --> 00:21:51.829
that, minus 2i minus i makes
minus 3i.

00:21:51.829 --> 00:21:56.252
Is that right?
Minus 2i, minus i,

00:21:56.252 --> 00:22:00.398
minus 3i.
So, it is ten thirds,

00:22:00.398 --> 00:22:08.000
and now in the denominator I
have one minus i.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.456
I'll put that in the numerator,
make it one plus i,

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:17.537
but I have to divide by the
product of one minus i and its

00:22:17.537 --> 00:22:20.479
complex conjugate.
In other words,

00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:24.846
I'm multiplying both top and
bottom by one plus i.

00:22:24.846 --> 00:22:30.105
And so, that makes here one
squared plus one squared is two.

00:22:30.105 --> 00:22:35.186
And now, what's left is e to
the negative x times cosine x

00:22:35.186 --> 00:22:40.000
plus i sine x.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.775
Now, of that,
what we want is just the

00:22:43.775 --> 00:22:46.938
imaginary part.
Well, let's see.

00:22:46.938 --> 00:22:52.142
Two goes into ten makes five,
so that's five thirds.

00:22:52.142 --> 00:22:55.918
So, we're practically at our
solution.

00:22:55.918 --> 00:22:58.673
The solution,
then, finally,

00:22:58.673 --> 00:23:05.000
is going to be yp is the
imaginary part of yp tilde.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.796
And, what's that?
Well, what's the coefficient

00:23:08.796 --> 00:23:12.255
out front, first of all?
It's five thirds,

00:23:12.255 --> 00:23:16.641
so let's pull out to five
thirds before we forget it.

00:23:16.641 --> 00:23:21.619
And, we'll pull out the e to
the negative x before we forget

00:23:21.619 --> 00:23:24.572
that.
And then, the rest is simply a

00:23:24.572 --> 00:23:28.452
question of seeing what's left.
Well, it's one.

00:23:28.452 --> 00:23:33.261
I want the imaginary part.
So, the imaginary part is going

00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:37.816
to be one times cosine x,
and then the other

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:42.962
imaginary part comes from these
two pieces, which is one times

00:23:42.962 --> 00:23:47.957
sine x.
And, that should be the

00:23:47.957 --> 00:23:52.297
particular solution.
Notice that most of the work is

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:56.808
not getting this thing.
It's turning it into something

00:23:56.808 --> 00:24:02.000
human that you can take the real
and imaginary parts of.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.142
If we don't like this form,
you can put it in the other

00:24:07.142 --> 00:24:12.476
form, which many engineers would
do almost automatically,

00:24:12.476 --> 00:24:16.285
make it five thirds,
e to the negative x,

00:24:16.285 --> 00:24:21.142
and what will that be?
Well, you can use the general

00:24:21.142 --> 00:24:24.666
formula if you want.
Remember, cosine,

00:24:24.666 --> 00:24:30.095
the two coefficients are one
and one, so it's one and one.

00:24:30.095 --> 00:24:33.333
So, this is the square root of
two.

00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:37.809
So, it is times,
this part makes the square root

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:44.000
of two times cosine of x minus
pi over the angle.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.220
This is a phi.
So, that's pi over four,

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.000
minus pi over four.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.283
Okay, all right,
now let's address the case

00:25:02.283 --> 00:25:07.484
which is going to occupy a lot
of the rest of today,

00:25:07.484 --> 00:25:11.563
and in a certain sense,
all of next time.

00:25:11.563 --> 00:25:16.968
What happens when p of alpha is
zero?

00:25:16.968 --> 00:25:21.966
Well, in order to be able to
handle this decently,

00:25:21.966 --> 00:25:28.288
it's necessary to have one more
formula, which is very slightly

00:25:28.288 --> 00:25:34.000
more complicated than the
substitution rule.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.014
But, it's the same kind of
rule.

00:25:36.014 --> 00:25:38.744
I'm going to call this,
or it is called the

00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:41.473
exponential.
So, I'm going to first prove a

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:45.373
formula, which is the analog of
that, and then I will prove a

00:25:45.373 --> 00:25:48.167
green formula,
which is what to do here if p

00:25:48.167 --> 00:25:51.157
of alpha turns out to be zero.

00:25:51.157 --> 00:25:54.796
But, in order to be able to
prove that, we're going to be

00:25:54.796 --> 00:25:56.876
the analog of the orange
formula.

00:25:56.876 --> 00:26:00.840
And, the analogue of the orange
formula, that tells you how to

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.000
apply p of D to a
simple exponential.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.302
I need a formula which applies
p of D to that simple

00:26:11.302 --> 00:26:14.873
exponential times another
function.

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:20.861
Now, I found I got into trouble
by continuing to call that

00:26:20.861 --> 00:26:24.747
alpha.
So, I'm now going to change the

00:26:24.747 --> 00:26:30.000
name of alpha to change alpha's
name to a.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.703
But, it's still complex.
I don't mean it's guaranteed to

00:26:34.703 --> 00:26:37.782
be complex.
I mean it's allowed to be

00:26:37.782 --> 00:26:40.861
complex.
So, a is now allowed to be a

00:26:40.861 --> 00:26:43.769
complex number.
I'm thinking of it,

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:46.934
in general, as a complex
number, okay?

00:26:46.934 --> 00:26:51.381
I hope this doesn't upset you
too much, but you know,

00:26:51.381 --> 00:26:54.375
you change x to t's,
and y's to x's.

00:26:54.375 --> 00:26:58.480
This is no worse.
All right, what we going to do?

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.756
Well, I'm going to use this
exponential shift rule,

00:27:02.756 --> 00:27:06.006
I'll call it,
exponential shift rule or

00:27:06.006 --> 00:27:11.402
formula or law.
That's the substitution rule

00:27:11.402 --> 00:27:13.977
for me.
So, this is going to be

00:27:13.977 --> 00:27:17.067
exponential shift law.
And, to apply,

00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:21.272
it tells you how to apply the
polynomial to not D,

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:25.992
not just the exponential,
but the exponential times some

00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:28.223
function of x.
What's that?

00:27:28.223 --> 00:27:32.000
And now, the rule is very
simple.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.616
See, you can understand the
difficulty.

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:37.025
If you try to start
differentiating,

00:27:37.025 --> 00:27:40.743
you're going to have to
calculate second derivatives of

00:27:40.743 --> 00:27:44.117
the stuff, and God forbid,
higher order equations.

00:27:44.117 --> 00:27:47.283
You would have to calculate
fourth derivatives,

00:27:47.283 --> 00:27:50.106
fifth derivatives.
You barely even want to

00:27:50.106 --> 00:27:53.067
calculate the first derivative.
That's okay.

00:27:53.067 --> 00:27:55.545
But, second derivative,
do I have to?

00:27:55.545 --> 00:27:58.712
No, not if you know the
exponential shift rule,

00:27:58.712 --> 00:28:01.810
which says you can get rid of
the e to the ax,

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:06.010
make it pass to the left of the
operator where it's not in any

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.246
position to do any harm any
longer, or upset the

00:28:09.246 --> 00:28:14.090
differentiation.
And, all you have to do is,

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:18.427
when it passes over that
operator, it changes D to D plus

00:28:18.427 --> 00:28:21.215
a. So, the answer is,

00:28:21.215 --> 00:28:24.855
e to the ax.
There, it's passed over.

00:28:24.855 --> 00:28:28.340
But, when it did so,
it changed D to D plus a.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.367
And, what about the u?
Well, the u just stayed there.

00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:36.945
Nothing happened to it.
Okay, there's our orange

00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:40.108
formula.
I guess we better put the thing

00:28:40.108 --> 00:28:43.837
around the whole business.
Should I prove that,

00:28:43.837 --> 00:28:48.378
or the proof is quite easy.
So, let's do it just again to

00:28:48.378 --> 00:28:53.243
give you a chance to try to see,
now, if somebody gives you a

00:28:53.243 --> 00:28:56.486
formula like that,
you first stare at it.

00:28:56.486 --> 00:28:59.648
You might try a couple of
special cases,

00:28:59.648 --> 00:29:03.945
try it on a function and see if
it works, but already,

00:29:03.945 --> 00:29:08.000
you probably don't want to do
that.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.909
I mean, even if you took a
function like x here,

00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:14.128
you'd have to do a certain
amount of differentiating,

00:29:14.128 --> 00:29:17.780
and some quadratic thing here.
You'd calculate and calculate

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.628
away for a little while,
and then if you did it

00:29:20.628 --> 00:29:23.909
correctly, the two would in fact
turn out to be equal.

00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:26.942
But, you would not necessarily
feel any the wiser.

00:29:26.942 --> 00:29:30.719
A better procedure in trying to
understand something like this

00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:34.000
is say, well,
let's keep the u general.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.328
Suppose we make D simple.
For example,

00:29:36.328 --> 00:29:39.664
well, if D is a constant,
of course there's nothing to

00:29:39.664 --> 00:29:43.503
happen because if this is just a
constant, both sides of these

00:29:43.503 --> 00:29:46.209
are the same.
This doesn't make any sense if

00:29:46.209 --> 00:29:49.797
p doesn't really have a D in it.
Well, what's the simplest

00:29:49.797 --> 00:29:52.125
polynomial which would have a D
in it?

00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:54.958
Well, D itself.
So, let's take a special case.

00:29:54.958 --> 00:29:58.608
p of D equals D,
and check the formula in that

00:29:58.608 --> 00:30:03.669
case; see if it works.
So, the formula is asking us,

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:08.732
what is D, that's the p of D,
of e to the ax times u?

00:30:08.732 --> 00:30:12.230
I'm not going to put in the

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.648
variable here because it's just
a waste of chalk.

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:21.066
Well, what is that?
I know how to calculate that.

00:30:21.066 --> 00:30:25.669
I'll use the product rule.
So, it's the derivative.

00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:30.271
I'll tell you what;
let's do the other order first.

00:30:30.271 --> 00:30:35.242
So, it's e to the ax times the
derivative of u plus the

00:30:35.242 --> 00:30:40.213
derivative of e to the ax,
which is a times e to the ax

00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:45.000
times u.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.027
Do you follow that?
This is the product rule.

00:30:48.027 --> 00:30:51.467
It's e to the ax times the
derivative of u plus the

00:30:51.467 --> 00:30:55.183
derivative of e to the ax,
which is this thing times u,

00:30:55.183 --> 00:30:58.142
the other factor.

00:30:58.142 --> 00:31:01.933
Now, is that right?
I want to make it look like

00:31:01.933 --> 00:31:04.510
that.
Well, to make it look like that

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.947
I should first factor e to the
ax out.

00:31:07.947 --> 00:31:11.527
And now, what's left?
Well, if I factor e to the ax

00:31:11.527 --> 00:31:15.680
out, what's left is Du plus au,
which is exactly (D plus a)

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.474
operating on u,
D u plus a u.

00:31:19.474 --> 00:31:23.556
Well, hey, that's just what the
formula said it should be.

00:31:23.556 --> 00:31:27.780
If you make e to the x pass
over D, it changes D to 

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.379
D plus a.
Okay, now here's the main thing

00:31:32.379 --> 00:31:34.989
I want to show you.
All right, now,

00:31:34.989 --> 00:31:37.368
well let's try,
if this is true,

00:31:37.368 --> 00:31:41.667
also works out for D squared,
then the formula is

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:45.658
clearly true by linearity
because an arbitrary p of D

00:31:45.658 --> 00:31:49.496
is just a linear
combination with constant

00:31:49.496 --> 00:31:53.027
coefficients of D,
D squared, and that constant

00:31:53.027 --> 00:31:57.249
thing, which we agreed there was
nothing to prove about.

00:31:57.249 --> 00:32:01.471
Now, hack, you're a hack if you
take D squared and start

00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:06.000
calculating the second
derivative of this.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.476
Okay, it's question about
hacks.

00:32:08.476 --> 00:32:12.230
I mean, it's just,
you haven't learned the right

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.865
thing to do.
Okay, that will work,

00:32:14.865 --> 00:32:17.421
but it's not what you want to
do.

00:32:17.421 --> 00:32:20.137
Instead, you bootstrap your way
up.

00:32:20.137 --> 00:32:24.450
I have already a formula
telling me how to handle this.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.763
And, you can be anything.
Look at this not as D squared

00:32:28.763 --> 00:32:32.429
all by itself.
Calculate, instead,

00:32:32.429 --> 00:32:36.041
D squared e to the ax times u.

00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:39.050
Think of that as D,
the derivative of the

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.587
derivative of e to the a x u.

00:32:42.587 --> 00:32:45.747
In other words,
we will do it one step at a

00:32:45.747 --> 00:32:48.456
time.
But you see now immediately the

00:32:48.456 --> 00:32:51.766
advantage of this.
What's D of e to the a x u?

00:32:51.766 --> 00:32:55.152
Well, I just calculated that.

00:32:55.152 --> 00:32:57.786
Now, don't go back to the
beginning.

00:32:57.786 --> 00:33:02.000
Don't go back to here.
Use the formula.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.926
After all, you worked to
calculate it,

00:33:04.926 --> 00:33:06.745
or I did.
So, it's D of,

00:33:06.745 --> 00:33:10.937
and what's this inside?
It's e to the ax times (D plus

00:33:10.937 --> 00:33:15.762
a) times u.
Well, that looks like a mess,

00:33:15.762 --> 00:33:19.954
but it isn't because I'm taking
D of e to the ax times

00:33:19.954 --> 00:33:23.118
something.
And I already know how to take

00:33:23.118 --> 00:33:25.649
D of e to the ax times
something.

00:33:25.649 --> 00:33:30.000
It doesn't matter what that
something is.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.322
Here, the something was u.
Here, the something is D plus

00:33:35.322 --> 00:33:40.935
(a times u) operating on u.
But, the principle is the same,

00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:46.064
and the answer is what?
Well, to take D of e to the ax

00:33:46.064 --> 00:33:50.419
times something,
you pass the e to the ax over

00:33:50.419 --> 00:33:53.903
the D.
That changes D to D plus a.

00:33:53.903 --> 00:33:57.580
And, you apply that to the

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:03.000
other guy, which is (D plus a)
applied to u.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.743
What's the answer?
e to the a x times (D plus a)

00:34:06.743 --> 00:34:09.292
squared u.

00:34:09.292 --> 00:34:14.150
It's just what you would have
gotten if you had taken e to the

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:18.451
e to the x, pass it over,
and then changed D to D plus a.

00:34:18.451 --> 00:34:22.194
Now, another advantage to doing

00:34:22.194 --> 00:34:26.654
it this way is you can see that
this argument is going to

00:34:26.654 --> 00:34:31.323
generalize to D cubed.
In other words,

00:34:31.323 --> 00:34:36.088
you would continue on in the
same way by the process of

00:34:36.088 --> 00:34:39.264
mathematical,
one word, mathematical,

00:34:39.264 --> 00:34:41.647
begins with an I,
induction.

00:34:41.647 --> 00:34:44.911
By induction,
you would prove the same

00:34:44.911 --> 00:34:49.588
formula for the nth derivative.
If you don't know what

00:34:49.588 --> 00:34:53.029
mathematical induction is,
shame on you.

00:34:53.029 --> 00:34:57.000
But it's okay.
A lot of you will be able to go

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
through life without ever having
to learn what it is.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.897
And, the rest of you will be
computer scientists.

00:35:08.897 --> 00:35:13.443
Okay, so that's the idea of
this rule.

00:35:13.443 --> 00:35:18.481
Now, we can use it to calculate
something.

00:35:18.481 --> 00:35:23.764
Let's see, I'm going to need
green for this,

00:35:23.764 --> 00:35:27.573
I guess, for our better
formula.

00:35:27.573 --> 00:35:32.733
The formula,
now, that tells you what to do

00:35:32.733 --> 00:35:39.000
if p of alpha is zero.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.616
So, we're trying to solve the
equation, D squared plus A D,

00:35:45.616 --> 00:35:49.794
we are trying to find a

00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:54.785
particular solution,
e to the ax,

00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:58.616
let's say.
Remember, a is complex.

00:35:58.616 --> 00:36:05.000
a could be complex.
It doesn't have to be real.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.519
But, the problem is that p of
alpha is zero.

00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:12.080
How do I get a particular
solution?

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.641
Well, I will write it down for
you.

00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:18.407
So, this is part of that
exponential input theorem.

00:36:18.407 --> 00:36:21.496
I think that's the way it is in
the notes.

00:36:21.496 --> 00:36:25.789
I gave all the cases together,
but I thought pedagogically

00:36:25.789 --> 00:36:30.233
it's probably a little better to
do the simplest case first,

00:36:30.233 --> 00:36:34.000
and then build up on the
complexity.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.467
So, what's yp?
The answer is yp is e to the a,

00:36:38.467 --> 00:36:43.443
except now you have to multiply

00:36:43.443 --> 00:36:48.215
it by x out front.
Where have you done something

00:36:48.215 --> 00:36:51.870
like that before?
Yes, don't tell me.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:56.135
I know you know.
But, what should go in the

00:36:56.135 --> 00:36:59.587
denominator?
Clearly not p of alpha.

00:36:59.587 --> 00:37:04.055
What goes in the denominator is

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:09.567
the derivative.
Okay, but what if p prime of

00:37:09.567 --> 00:37:14.426
alpha is zero?
Couldn't that happen?

00:37:14.426 --> 00:37:18.644
Yes, it could happen.
So, we better make cases.

00:37:18.644 --> 00:37:22.312
This case is,
the case where this is okay

00:37:22.312 --> 00:37:27.905
corresponds to the case where
we're going to assume that alpha

00:37:27.905 --> 00:37:31.573
is a simple root,
is a simple root of the

00:37:31.573 --> 00:37:35.515
polynomial, p.
I don't know what to call the

00:37:35.515 --> 00:37:40.321
variable, p of D is okay.
A simple zero,

00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:43.247
in other words,
it's not double.

00:37:43.247 --> 00:37:48.061
Well, suppose is double.
One of the consequences you

00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:52.592
will see just in a second,
if it's a simple zero,

00:37:52.592 --> 00:37:57.312
that means this derivative is
not going to be zero.

00:37:57.312 --> 00:38:01.843
That's automatic.
Yeah, well, suppose it's not as

00:38:01.843 --> 00:38:05.430
simple.
Well, suppose is a double root.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:11.000
How did a-- How did that get
changed to, argh!

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.434
[LAUGHTER] That's not an alpha.
Oh, well, yes it is,

00:38:16.434 --> 00:38:18.245
obviously.
Change!

00:38:18.245 --> 00:38:21.655
All of you, I want you to
change.

00:38:21.655 --> 00:38:27.622
They should have something like
in a search key where 147

00:38:27.622 --> 00:38:34.229
occurrences of alpha have been
changed to a with a stroke of a,

00:38:34.229 --> 00:38:39.385
just your thumb.
They don't have that for the

00:38:39.385 --> 00:38:42.792
blackboard, unfortunately.
Well, too bad,

00:38:42.792 --> 00:38:46.114
for the future.
Correctable blackboards.

00:38:46.114 --> 00:38:51.311
Well, what if a is double root?
It can't be more than a double

00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:55.655
root because you've only got a
quadratic polynomial.

00:38:55.655 --> 00:39:00.000
Quadratic polynomials only have
two roots.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.630
So, the worst that can happen
is that both of them are a.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.261
All right, in that case the
formula should be yp is equal

00:39:09.261 --> 00:39:14.388
to, you are now going to need x
squared up there times e 

00:39:14.388 --> 00:39:18.440
to the ax,
and in the denominator what you

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.161
are going to need is the second
derivative of,

00:39:22.161 --> 00:39:25.965
evaluated at a.
Now, you can guess the way this

00:39:25.965 --> 00:39:29.273
going to go on.
For higher degree things,

00:39:29.273 --> 00:39:33.738
if you've got a triple root,
you will need here x cubed,

00:39:37.294 --> 00:39:41.015
except you're going to need a
factorial there,

00:39:41.015 --> 00:39:45.142
too.
So, don't worry about it.

00:39:45.142 --> 00:39:49.171
It's in the notes,
but I'm not going to give you

00:39:49.171 --> 00:39:53.371
that for higher roots.
I don't even know if I will

00:39:53.371 --> 00:39:57.657
give it to you for double root.
Yes, I already did,

00:39:57.657 --> 00:40:01.000
so it's too late.
It's too late.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.440
Okay, so we will make this two
formulas according to whether a

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.791
is a single or a double root.
Okay, let's prove one of these,

00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:16.518
and all of that will be good
enough for my conscience.

00:40:16.518 --> 00:40:21.245
Let's prove the first one.
Mostly, it's an exercise in

00:40:21.245 --> 00:40:24.635
using the first exponential
shift rule.

00:40:24.635 --> 00:40:29.629
Okay, this will be a first
example actually seeing a work

00:40:29.629 --> 00:40:34.000
in practice as opposed to
proving it.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.484
Okay, so what does that thing
look like?

00:40:37.484 --> 00:40:42.398
So, what does the polynomial
look like, which has a as a

00:40:42.398 --> 00:40:46.240
simple root?
So, we're going to try to prove

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.886
the simple root case.
So, I'm just going to calculate

00:40:50.886 --> 00:40:53.924
what those guys actually look
like.

00:40:53.924 --> 00:41:00.000
What does p of D look
like if a is a simple root?

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.700
Well, if it's a simple root,
that means it has a factor.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.632
When it factors,
it factors into the product of

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:13.589
(D minus a) times something
which isn't, D minus some other

00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:16.666
root.
And, the point is that b is not

00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:20.170
equal to A.
The roots are really distinct.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.162
Okay, what's,
then, p prime,

00:41:23.162 --> 00:41:27.692
I'm going to have to calculate
p prime of a.

00:41:27.692 --> 00:41:32.086
What is that?
Well, let's calculate p prime

00:41:32.086 --> 00:41:34.461
of D first.
It is, well,

00:41:34.461 --> 00:41:38.491
by the ordinary product rule,
it's the derivative of this

00:41:38.491 --> 00:41:41.513
times, which is one times (D
minus a) plus,

00:41:41.513 --> 00:41:45.399
that's one thing plus the same
thing on the other side,

00:41:45.399 --> 00:41:49.285
the derivative of this,
which is one times (D minus b).

00:41:49.285 --> 00:41:51.660
So, that's p prime.
And therefore,

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:55.042
what's p prime of a?
It's nothing but,

00:41:55.042 --> 00:41:59.000
this part is zero,
and that's a minus b.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.721
Of course, this is not zero
because it's a simple root.

00:42:02.721 --> 00:42:06.924
And, that's the proof for you
if you want, that if the root is

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:10.715
simple, that p prime of a
is guaranteed not to

00:42:10.715 --> 00:42:12.437
be zero.
And, you can see,

00:42:12.437 --> 00:42:15.539
it's going to be zero exactly
when b equals a,

00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:19.398
and that root occurs twice.
But, I'm assuming that didn't

00:42:19.398 --> 00:42:22.016
happen.
Okay, then all the rest we have

00:42:22.016 --> 00:42:24.635
to do is calculate,
do the calculation.

00:42:24.635 --> 00:42:28.908
So, what I want to prove now is
that with this p of D,

00:42:28.908 --> 00:42:32.698
what I'm trying to calculate
that p of D times that guy,

00:42:32.698 --> 00:42:36.281
x e to the a x,
except I'm going to

00:42:36.281 --> 00:42:39.245
write it as e to the a x times
x, guess why,

00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:44.000
divided by p prime of a.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.119
This is my proposed particular
solution.

00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:50.079
So, what I have to do is
calculate it,

00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:54.800
and see that it turns out to
be, what do I hope it turns out

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.760
to be?
What the right hand side of the

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.766
equation, the input?
The input is e to the ax.

00:43:01.766 --> 00:43:03.753
If this is true,

00:43:03.753 --> 00:43:07.874
then yp, a particular solution,
indeed, nothing will be a

00:43:07.874 --> 00:43:11.186
particular solution.
Of course, there could be

00:43:11.186 --> 00:43:14.718
others, but in this game,
I only have to find one

00:43:14.718 --> 00:43:18.251
particular solution,
and that certainly by far is

00:43:18.251 --> 00:43:21.268
the simple as one you could
possibly find.

00:43:21.268 --> 00:43:25.610
So, I have to calculate this.
And now, you see why I did the

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.363
exponential shift rule because
this is begging to be

00:43:29.363 --> 00:43:34.000
differentiated by something
simpler than hack.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.660
Okay, you can also see why I
violated the natural order of

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:43.647
things and put the e to the ax
on the left in order

00:43:43.647 --> 00:43:48.635
that it pass over more easily.
So, the answer on the left-hand

00:43:48.635 --> 00:43:51.987
side is e to the ax times p of
(D plus a).

00:43:51.987 --> 00:43:56.157
Now, what is (p of D) plus a?
Write it in this form.

00:43:56.157 --> 00:44:00.000
It's going to be a minus b.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.327
So, p of (D plus a)
is, change D to D plus a.

00:44:04.327 --> 00:44:07.805
So, the first factor is going

00:44:07.805 --> 00:44:10.587
to be D plus a minus b.

00:44:10.587 --> 00:44:15.224
And, what's the second factor?
Change D to D plus a.

00:44:15.224 --> 00:44:16.925
It turns into D.

00:44:16.925 --> 00:44:21.021
All this is the result of
taking that p of D,

00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:25.426
and changing D to D plus a.
And now, this is to be applied

00:44:25.426 --> 00:44:28.285
to what?
Well, e to the a x

00:44:28.285 --> 00:44:33.000
is already passed over.
So, what's left is x.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.925
And, that's to be divided by
the constant,

00:44:36.925 --> 00:44:41.808
p prime of a.
Now, what does this all come

00:44:41.808 --> 00:44:44.968
out to be?
e to the ax,

00:44:44.968 --> 00:44:48.127
what's D applied to x?
One, right?

00:44:48.127 --> 00:44:53.297
And now, what's this thing
applied to the constant one?

00:44:53.297 --> 00:44:57.223
Well, the D kills it,
so it has no effect.

00:44:57.223 --> 00:45:02.947
It makes it zero.
The rest just multiplies it by

00:45:02.947 --> 00:45:07.957
a minus b.
So, the answer to the top is (a

00:45:07.957 --> 00:45:12.673
minus b) times one.
And, the answer to the bottom

00:45:12.673 --> 00:45:17.782
is p prime of a,
which I showed you by just

00:45:17.782 --> 00:45:21.024
explicit calculation is a minus
b.

00:45:21.024 --> 00:45:25.936
And so the answer is,
e to the a x comes

00:45:25.936 --> 00:45:29.165
out right.
Now, the other one,

00:45:29.165 --> 00:45:31.618
the other formula comes out the
same way.

00:45:31.618 --> 00:45:34.992
I'll leave that as an exercise.
Also, I don't dare do it

00:45:34.992 --> 00:45:38.611
because it's much too close to
the problem I asked you to do

00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:41.310
for homework.
So, let's by way of conclusion,

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.579
I'll do one more simple
example, okay?

00:45:43.579 --> 00:45:46.462
And then, you can feel you
understand something.

00:45:46.462 --> 00:45:49.836
I'm sort of bothered that I
haven't done any examples of

00:45:49.836 --> 00:45:53.271
this more complicated case.
So, I'll pick an easy version

00:45:53.271 --> 00:45:56.092
instead of the one that you have
in your notes,

00:45:56.092 --> 00:46:01.000
which is the one you have for
homework, which is even easier.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.099
So, this one's epsilon less
easy.

00:46:04.099 --> 00:46:10.106
Y double prime minus 3 y prime
plus 2 y equals e to the x.

00:46:10.106 --> 00:46:14.465
Okay, notice that one is a

00:46:14.465 --> 00:46:18.340
simple root.
The one I'm talking about is

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:23.378
the a here, which is one.
One is a simple root of the

00:46:23.378 --> 00:46:28.706
polynomial D squared minus 3D
plus two,

00:46:28.706 --> 00:46:32.000
isn't it?
It's a zero.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.596
Put D equal one and you get 
one minus three plus 

00:46:35.596 --> 00:46:38.108
two equals zero.
It's a simple root because

00:46:38.108 --> 00:46:41.590
anybody can see that one is not
a double root because you know

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.330
from critical damping,
if one were a double root,

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.127
you know just what the
polynomial would look like,

00:46:47.127 --> 00:46:49.240
and it wouldn't look like that
at all.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.379
It would not look like D
squared minus 3D plus two.

00:46:52.379 --> 00:46:54.492
It would look differently.

00:46:54.492 --> 00:46:57.232
Therefore, that proves that one
is a simple root.

00:46:57.232 --> 00:47:01.000
Okay, what's the particular
solution, therefore?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.684
The particular solution is x
times e to the x divided by the

00:47:06.684 --> 00:47:11.405
derivative, the derivative
evaluated at the point,

00:47:11.405 --> 00:47:15.740
so, what's p prime of D?
It is 2D minus three.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.943
If I evaluate it at the point,
one, it is negative one.

00:47:20.943 --> 00:47:25.182
So, if this is to be divided by
negative one,

00:47:25.182 --> 00:47:30.000
in other words,
it's minus x e to the X.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.708
And, if you don't believe it,
you could plug it in and check

00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:39.191
it out.
Okay, I'm letting you out one

00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:41.803
minute early.
Remember that.

00:47:41.803 --> 00:47:44.603
I'm trying to pay off the
accumulated debt.
