Diabetes Mellitus can be alternatively
written as DM or just diabetes,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.790
and it can be coded using ICD as 250.00,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.540
or as 73211009 in SNOMED.

What problem does this contribute to?

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.180

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.126
Is it care coordination?

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:25.506
Both?

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:26.376
