to think of myself as a pragmatic
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.649
to think of myself as a pragmatic
progressive so I think when you worry

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
progressive so I think when you worry
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990
progressive so I think when you worry
about wages for ordinary workers in the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
about wages for ordinary workers in the
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179
about wages for ordinary workers in the
US which I do worry about I think you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
US which I do worry about I think you
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
United States I think you have to look
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120
United States I think you have to look
at public expenditure on education and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130
at public expenditure on education and
 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.190
at public expenditure on education and
key services that actually reach

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
key services that actually reach
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319
key services that actually reach
ordinary people so I think what Larry

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
ordinary people so I think what Larry
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.410
ordinary people so I think what Larry
Summers is arguing is that there are

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420
Summers is arguing is that there are
 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.060
Summers is arguing is that there are
fiscal measures and policy measures you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
fiscal measures and policy measures you
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.649
fiscal measures and policy measures you
could take that would really make life

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
could take that would really make life
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.749
could take that would really make life
better for the working class I don't

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
better for the working class I don't
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.520
better for the working class I don't
think Larry Summers is arguing against

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
think Larry Summers is arguing against
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649
think Larry Summers is arguing against
the free trade regime but I think he's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
the free trade regime but I think he's
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.539
the free trade regime but I think he's
smart enough to realize that if you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
smart enough to realize that if you
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.370
smart enough to realize that if you
don't do something for ordinary workers

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
don't do something for ordinary workers
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499
don't do something for ordinary workers
in the United States you may lose the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
in the United States you may lose the
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.330
in the United States you may lose the
political support for free trade and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
political support for free trade and
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.370
political support for free trade and
that really is an important engine of

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
that really is an important engine of
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.660
that really is an important engine of
the whole global growth

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670
the whole global growth
 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.729
the whole global growth
