BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.940
Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.542
Welcome to the fourth segment
in our week-long exploration

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:18.720
of Creative Sandbox Gallery
uses of our technology.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.405
We have a really, really fun
couple of things we're going

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:22.150
to look at today.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.850
Today we're going
to be looking at

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.150
some Google+ API usage.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.310
It's pretty kinetic.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.150
There's a lot of action
involved.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.480
So I think it should be a pretty
exciting and pretty fun

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.670
conversation.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.370
Before we begin, I want to
introduce a colleague of mine

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.780
out on the West Coast.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.930
Please note his powerful
mustache.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.010
Jonathan, can you say hello?

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.410
JONATHAN BERI: How's it going?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.480
My name is Jon Beri.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.066
I'm the developer advocate
for Google+.

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.060
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.460
Jonathan is going to be here to
answer questions that the

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.530
agencies have, answer questions
that viewers have.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.280
As you guys are watching this,
and if things come up that you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.770
like answered, either by the
folks at the agencies who

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.099
built these very fun
applications, or by Jonathan

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.660
on the developers' team here at
Google, please go ahead and

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.765
put those into our
moderator tool.

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:10.820
And we'll put that link
up over in the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.860
course of this Hangout.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.260
Please do not hesitate
to ask questions.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.410
We will answer everything
we get.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.600
With that said, let's go ahead
and we're going to talk with

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.510
Resn first, followed
by Goodby and Hook.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.850
Let's take a look at Resn's
video, so you have a sense of

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.190
what they did with
the Google+ API.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.630
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.940
-Resn presents Face Arcade,
a Google Hangouts game.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.500
Do you want to game with your
friends online but get tired

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.060
of all the cables?

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.900
Using powerful Google and Resn
technologies, you can now

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.077
control games using your
face and a Web cam.

00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:48.190
-How many games, Face Arcade?

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.830
-How many, you ask?

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.280
Face Arcade gives you not none,
not two, not even four,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.700
but four life-like games.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.466
-Requires no actual CDs.

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:56.850
-They don't exist.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.310
-Have you ever wondered
what it would be

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.810
like to be a snake?

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.100
Wonder no more.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.312
Control a caterpillar with
your face in Browzilla.

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:06.310
It's the next best thing.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.990
-What about ancient history?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.982
-Old news.

00:02:08.982 --> 00:02:09.479
-Old news.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.520
-The Greeks were notorious
for fun.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.880
Were you?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.830
With Face Arcade's TechnoYawn,
you can now play a tastefully

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.240
re-imagined Rome of the ages.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.900
This unlimited time offer from
Face Arcade also includes

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.080
Noddy Nelly.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.675
Nice Noddy.

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:26.570
-What about feline manipulation
through the power

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.830
of self-hypnosis?

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.020
-Impossible!

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.170
-Now you can harness your inner
mentalism in the comfort

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.520
of your own fireplace.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.460
Best of all, Google Hangouts
lets you play against your

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.070
friends all across the
world and battle them

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.640
face-to-face-to-face-to-face.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.780
Face Arcade Off.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.300
No more playing solo.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.380
Best of all, Face
Arcade is free.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.840
-But how?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.865
-It won't take one,
not even two, but

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:54.160
just three easy steps.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.560
First, go to your
Google account.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.970
Start a Hangout.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.820
Don't forget to add
your friends.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.610
Then, add the app.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.260
It's that simple.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.930
You'll be battling your
friends in no time.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.460
Play Face Arcade.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.710
Made in Resn.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.020
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.090
Face Arcade--

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.070
the first question I have for
you guys at Resn before you

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.170
introduce yourselves is, are you
certain that no one will

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.320
get a concussion
with your game?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.560
Once we answer that, you guys
over at Resn, can you give us

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.710
a quick intro and a walk through
of who's on the line

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.920
today, and what your roles
are at the agency?

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.285
MARK WORDSWORTH: Sure.

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:38.820
Sure Firstly, we accept no
responsibility for any damage

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.270
caused by playing the game.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.270
I'm Mark, the producer
at Resn.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.410
WADE COWIN: I'm Wade, a
[INAUDIBLE] at Resn.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.145
EMLYN: My name's Emlyn.

00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:48.492
I'm a senior developer
at Resn.

00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:49.410
BRANDEL ZACHERNUK:
Hi, I'm Brandel.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.830
I'm an experience developer
at Resn.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.050
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.790
And for those of you watching,
it is 8:30 in the morning for

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.030
them out in New Zealand, so if
it looks a little dark, and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.720
they look a little tired, they
are being real troopers in the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.530
office that early.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.110
Guys, I'm going to ask you guys
a couple questions and

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.140
just would love to hear your
takes on what it took to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.120
develop what you did.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.050
Where the ideas came from,
who was involved.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.829
Let's just start with what was
the idea generation process,

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.100
because this is obviously a very
fun, very funny, but also

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.140
very unexpected use
of the technology.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.630
How did you guys come
up with the idea?

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.690
Who generated that idea and who
got together to say, this

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.330
is what we should do?

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.520
WADE COWIN: The idea just came
from looking at all the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.100
different things we could get
from the API and realizing

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.820
that we could get some really
interesting, random

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.770
stuff out of it.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.150
The goal was just to make
something really

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.940
ridiculous and fun.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.220
And so we started looking at all
the APIs and just going,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.600
what can we do with this that's
going to make all the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.450
users look completely absurd
and ridiculous.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.530
That was probably one of initial
key points that we hit

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.420
upon which was the creative
hook for the whole idea--

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.880
making people look ridiculous.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.130
BRIAN MOROZ: Excellent.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.010
WADE COWIN: So with the social
engagement bringing everyone

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.760
down to a level of looking
really ridiculous, we were

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.250
hoping that the game was going
to work as kind of a social

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.500
lubricant in Hangouts.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.660
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.605
So making people look ridiculous
together, that was

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.570
the creative idea.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.000
Excellent.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.400
I love it.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.860
And it does do that.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.460
And it is super fun.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.050
How did you guys interact
with the technology?

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.130
When I say that, you said
there's lots of things that

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.970
you realized the API could do.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.220
How did you A, figure out what
was possible and B, then say

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.260
OK, out of all of these
possibilities, these are the

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.040
five or six elements we
want to work with.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.120
And we'll build a game around
a handful of these.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.440
How did you guys go
through that?

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.990
MARK WORDSWORTH: At first we
didn't realize how the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.890
[INAUDIBLE] would be
presented, like how

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.870
noisy it would be.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.430
We knew that we wanted to work
with particular tracking

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.820
elements, so the ideas
were born from

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.900
these individual elements.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.440
And then the ideas were refined
once we knew how high

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.535
fidelity the data was
coming out of it.

00:06:24.535 --> 00:06:25.940
Probably Brendal and Emlyn it'll
be better to talk about

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.770
that process of the testing
of the data there.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.800
EMLYN HUGHES: Yeah, there's
pretty good

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.100
documentation around it.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.940
Looking through that gave us a
good idea about the points on

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.140
the face that are getting
tracked and

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.630
that sort of thing.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.800
Yes, breaking it down into
facial elements and saying,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.790
OK, well, yeah, what's
going to look silly.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.490
OK, moving forward and back
really quickly with your head,

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.670
that's going to look
pretty silly.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.150
What sort of creative can
we stick that with.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.610
BRIAN MOROZ: So when you were
doing that, you found the

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.290
points of the face that could
be read and then the motions

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.890
that you could detect
with that.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.520
How did you guys test that?

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.000
Did you just have a lot of
people in-house, like going

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.560
like this a lot, or how did
you figure out that it was

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.240
actually going to work?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.110
EMLYN HUGHES: Yeah,
pretty much.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.560
We had a lot of squeaking
seats.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.420
You'd be sitting around
coding and you'd hear

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.996
[SQUEAKING SOUNDS].

00:07:18.996 --> 00:07:21.440
You'd turn around and someone
would be rocking around on

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.020
their seats.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.450
Yeah, fortunately we had a
couple of interns at the time

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.460
and they got pretty
good workouts.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.970
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.220
strong muscles.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.325
BRIAN MOROZ: Excellent.

00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:36.640
A lot of in-house user testing
going on to make sure that it

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.460
was accurate and it worked.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.280
Let me ask you this-- who all
was involved building this?

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.800
Because it's not like the idea
came to you guys and, correct

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.840
me if I'm wrong, it sounds like
it came pretty quickly.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.410
You figured out, OK, we can
make people look silly.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.300
And then we can map that to
something that will be fun and

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.800
competitive, but social.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.630
Who did you pull in and say,
this is the team that's going

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.860
to come up with what the game
is going to look like, what

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.870
the games are, how it's going
to be technically feasible?

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.140
How did you determine who was
going to be involved?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.050
MARK WORDSWORTH: It was open
season for the whole team

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.610
across Resn in Wellington
and Amsterdam.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.605
We're about 20 strong,
all-in-all.

00:08:14.605 --> 00:08:17.400
But I guess the full development
team and the full

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.470
production team ended up being
around ten people.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.760
But it was all open season.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.010
Everyone throughout Resn
could contribute ideas.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.710
The creative process went from
the very start to the very end

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.090
of the production cycle.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.659
People could throw
a gag in here and

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.486
there all the way through.

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:37.289
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.110
And who made a decision, or was
it just that group of ten?

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.120
Is that who made the decisions
as to OK, here's the 50 ideas

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.385
that we're going to make
it into the five.

00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:48.980
Is that how that worked?

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.370
MARK WORDSWORTH: Pretty much.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.000
We kind of, this is what
[INAUDIBLE] about the bitch

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.843
process around the time we were
invited to collaborate in

00:08:54.843 --> 00:08:56.930
the Hangout Hackathon.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.930
We had a lot of ideas
at that point and we

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.190
boiled them all down.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.110
WADE COWIN: We tried to make it
a ridiculous matrix of all

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.270
the key points that we wanted
to fulfill with the ideas,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.815
ranging from feasibility right
up to awesomeness.

00:09:14.815 --> 00:09:18.110
So we had to tic all the boxes
in each concept just run

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.022
through this thorough
check list.

00:09:21.022 --> 00:09:24.260
Make sure it was good enough
and it went from there.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:29.116
I guess one of the key things
about having a game with a lot

00:09:29.116 --> 00:09:32.960
of little micro-games in it,
was it was good for getting

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.420
everyone on the team a little
piece of the project

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.520
that they could own.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.510
There's a lot of people just
working on little separate

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.720
elements, bringing
those together.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.940
And I think that adds to the
creative of it as well.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.065
There's a lot of ideas and
a lot of wackiness

00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:51.380
and a lot of insanity.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.220
Just because it comes from
all across the board.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.360
EMLYN HUGHES: Yeah, that was
one of the things that,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.000
because it was so, so modular
that we could divided up into

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.090
nice sort of discrete chunks,
and hand it off to the smaller

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.550
sets of one designer, one
developer kind of thing.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.680
It was a nice way to
do it, I think.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.970
BRIAN MOROZ: Interesting,
so it was actually very

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.700
decentralized setup when it
comes to the individual pieces

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.340
rather than having a particular
creative or a

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.040
particular developer say I am
the one who's going to approve

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.310
everything and design this and
I'll have people work on it.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.370
It sounds like it was very much
a ground up, lots and

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.160
lots of people making all these
individual pieces that

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.790
you guys stitched together,
which is a really interesting

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.410
way to go about it.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.710
On the note of how you actually
got it made, it

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.670
sounds like all these discrete
teams had their

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.630
pieces and made them.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.505
And then you pulled
them together.

00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:45.680
Did you guys have help
from our side,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.336
from the Google side?

00:10:46.336 --> 00:10:48.810
Or is this something that you
guys did totally on your own?

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.860
You had the API.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.330
You understood it,
put it together.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.590
How did that work?

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.440
EMLYN HUGHES: Yeah, that was
pretty much just looking

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.900
through the API documentation
to get a good

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.260
idea of what was there.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.960
And then we did some prototyping
and some testing

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.900
just to see what sort of data
came out of it and how we

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.020
might use it.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.370
BRANDEL ZACHERNUK: Then the
framework that we put together

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.040
for everybody to work within.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.290
EMLYN HUGHES: We had sort of a
framework that managed all the

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.970
multiplayer aspects and
server side stuff.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.800
And then we had each of the
individual games sort of just

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.600
worked by themselves.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.720
And then we had teams working
on each of the games.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.980
And then we had sort of an
overall architecture to pull

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.490
them all together and make it
sort of one linear process.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.390
BRIAN MOROZ: So that they could
just basically plug

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.930
their piece of the
game into the--

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:34.940
EMLYN HUGHES: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.700
BRIAN MOROZ: Got it.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.390
Got it.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.870
On the technical side,
what was the one--

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.880
if there was one--

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.900
was there one particular
hurdle that was quite

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.890
difficult technically speaking,
or anything that you

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.536
guys really had trouble
getting through?

00:11:48.536 --> 00:11:51.980
EMLYN HUGHES: Yeah, we sort of
underestimated the difficulty

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:58.870
in setting up some sort of
peer-based multiplayer system.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.030
We had a basic system to begin
with, and it kind of quickly

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.020
became apparent that it wasn't
going to hold up.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.240
So we went back to the drawing
board basically and spent a

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.080
lot more time planning out
how all the multiplayer

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.100
interaction was going to work.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.850
Because you're not dealing with
a centralized server and

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.670
this stuff is all sort
of peer-to-peer.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.390
There's a bit more complication
involved in

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.160
coordinating a lot of the
multiplayer aspects.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.340
BRIAN MOROZ: That makes sense.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.960
When did that occur?

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.580
When did that issue come up?

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.030
Early on, or was it like
the week before?

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.030
EMLYN HUGHES: Reasonably
late in the game.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.800
Probably about a week out.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.740
We sort of realized that we were
going to have to sit down

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.660
and do some more in-depth
planning.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.985
But what we came up with
was really good.

00:12:39.985 --> 00:12:42.790
It ended up being reasonably
robust.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.870
And it was an interesting
architectural experience to

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.770
have to go through.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.480
BRIAN MOROZ: It always comes
up about a week before,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.360
doesn't it?

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.240
EMLYN HUGHES: Yeah.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.000
A few late nights.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.530
BRIAN MOROZ: How long was the

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.150
development process all totaled?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.670
I mean obviously, the give or
take, what was the general

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.040
timeline like for you guys?

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.960
EMLYN HUGHES: I think we were
originally planning to try,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.010
and we spent a week of kind
of initial planning and

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.560
pre-production.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.780
And then we were trying to hit a
game a day for the Hackathon

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.020
in the second week.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.370
And we almost got there.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.970
I think we planned on
doing five games.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.360
We ended up getting to four.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.460
And then after the two
weeks, we had a

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.620
reasonably solid product.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.000
But there was a few things that
weren't quite happy with,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.460
so I think we spent probably
about a week or so just sort

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.170
of polishing things up, and
cleaning them up, getting them

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.688
to a better standard.

00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:34.600
So, yeah, about three
or four weeks.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.490
BRIAN MOROZ: Three
or four weeks?

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.040
Wow, OK.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.860
So that was actually
really quick.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.060
That's really amazing,
actually.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.720
I didn't realize that you guys
put this together so rapidly.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.240
How did you get the word out,
or how did you get people

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:45.980
involved in the game?

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.470
Is it something where it
was completely viral?

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.600
You told your friends, said
tell your friends.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.890
What did you guys do to get
people to know that

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.150
the game was there?

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.380
WADE COWIN: We made a ridiculous
video, pretty much.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.460
That was our whole campaign, was
making a ridiculous video.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.870
I guess trying to show people
how much fun they can have

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.650
with something free
and just sent that

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.910
around wherever we could.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.030
And it seemed to get picked up
quite well and hopefully got

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.730
people playing it as well.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.560
MARK WORDSWORTH: We also tried
communicating out every

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.570
[INAUDIBLE] development.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.250
Every single day we blogged on
our Google+ page and our

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.370
Facebook page.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.350
We tried to communicate all the
way through the process.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.970
WADE COWIN: Resn Labs has got
a lot of-- there's a blog

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.010
almost every second day at at
least on Resn Labs going

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:40.210
through the process, kind of
feeling our pain as we rushed

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.830
towards the deadline.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.690
That's full of a lot of the
development process there.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.530
We can look back on it.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.180
Yeah.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.260
BRIAN MOROZ: But you were
actually broadcasting the fact

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
that it was going to be coming
during the actual development

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.610
process, is that true?

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.730
Is that what you
just mentioned?

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.980
MARK WORDSWORTH: Yeah.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.540
BRIAN MOROZ: Interesting.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.810
So you didn't wait until it was
a polished product, ready

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.070
to launch, and give
it a big launch.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.040
You guys were letting people in
as it was happening, as it

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.670
was being built.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.870
BRANDEL ZACHERNUK: Yeah.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:12.970
We were conscious of the need
to make something that would

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.260
be able to stand up
aesthetically throughout that

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.490
development process.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.090
So we made sure that the
visual style and the

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.870
interactions were such that we
could show them at any point

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.670
and they would be still
pretty hilarious--

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.520
confusing and shocking, but
also quite appealing.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.680
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.310
I guess just one last question
for you guys

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.170
on the broader front.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:41.230
Given that you guys did four
games in a handful of weeks,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.220
you got kind of slammed at the
last minute on how multiple

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.330
servers were going to work
with the architecture.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.040
You were giving out little bits
and pieces and images and

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.560
ideas as you were developing
it, to the public.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.220
If someone wanted to do
something similar, if someone

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.850
said, I want to do something
like that.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.100
I want to do it within a month,
develop something

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.190
really fun with the Hangouts
API, and I want to follow

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:02.480
their path.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.450
What would be the one big
piece of advice that

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.700
you would give them?

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.370
EMLYN HUGHES: I guess from a
technical point of view,

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:18.010
probably the debugging we found
reasonably difficult, in

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.638
that there's a lot of
noise, a lot of

00:16:19.638 --> 00:16:21.250
communications going on--

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.630
there's a lot of
things talking.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.520
So your debug consoles and
things fill up pretty quickly.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.960
We ended up outputting a lot
of our debug stuff to a

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.430
front-end to the UI so you
could read the debug

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.105
information on the Web page,
rather than through your

00:16:37.105 --> 00:16:38.320
consoles and stuff like that.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.530
I think debugging is a pretty
important part of the

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.490
developmental process.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.670
So yeah, that was one thing
that we had to try and

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.770
establish fairly early on to
make sure that it was a

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:48.560
smoother ride.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.750
EMLYN: Yeah.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.510
BRIAN MOROZ: So debugging.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.750
Put it up front.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.490
Anything else?

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.700
Anything from the creative side
that you would recommend?

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.720
WADE COWIN: I think it's
important to make sure that

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.430
how you are taking all that
data, you've still, at the end

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:07.880
of the day.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.280
you've got to turn it into
something entertaining.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:16.126
And there's a there's a lot of
freedom with what you can do

00:17:16.126 --> 00:17:18.310
with face tracking.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.660
It's pretty massive, really.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.240
So I think if you're looking for
a creative idea, you don't

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.700
have to far on something like
that to really start getting

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.710
into some really insane
territory.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.980
EMLYN HUGHES: It was also easy
to get up and going as well.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.200
Anyone looking to do any
development in it, we've got

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.690
things working on screen
really quickly.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.660
Within a matter of hours, we had
things tracking to faces

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.020
and moving around.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.560
BRANDEL ZACHERNUK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.080
and even making single games
was really, really simple.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.835
The only complexity was when
we had follow the leader.

00:17:50.835 --> 00:17:53.800
If it was two player, then
it'd be simpler as well.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.770
There are a lot of things
that can come

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.200
straight out of the box.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.100
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.560
Folks over at Goodby, why don't
we start with you guys.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.760
You each want to give a quick
round of introduction of who

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.810
is on the call today.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.950
JESSICA HARDY: Yeah, sure.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:07.870
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: Hey there.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:08.640
I'm Dean Rubinstein.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.910
I'm the account leader
across all things

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.610
Google here at Goodby.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.470
JESSICA HARDY: And I'm account
manager, Jessica Hardy, for

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.820
Google+ here at Goodby.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.380
LISA KOURAKOS: And I am Lisa,
the assistant account manager

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.452
for Google at Goodby.

00:18:19.452 --> 00:18:21.360
BRIAN MOROZ: OK.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.290
And now folks over at Hook.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:25.715
MICHAEL WATTS: Hello.

00:18:25.715 --> 00:18:26.890
My name's Michael Watts.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.680
I'm a producer at Hook.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.570
AARON SCHWARTZ: Hi, I'm
Aaron Schwartz.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.730
I'm the creative lead
here at Hook.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.388
BRIAN MOROZ: See, you
guys get headbands.

00:18:33.388 --> 00:18:34.364
MICHAEL WATTS: Oh, yeah.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:36.316
We made those things.

00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:37.300
CHRIS: I'm Chris.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.630
I'm a technical director
at Hook.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.145
BRAD: I'm Brad.

00:18:40.145 --> 00:18:42.651
I did the game development
here.

00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:43.060
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.400
Very cool.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:45.960
Thank you guys.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.500
I think this looks like a very,
very fun game to play

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.880
when it launches publicly.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.020
Why don't you guys give us just
an overview of where the

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.490
idea came from, how you worked
together to develop it, and

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.440
just what the back-end
idea was.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.850
Why did you guys come
up with this

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.870
particular use of the API?

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.140
JESSICA HARDY: Sure.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.340
Well, I get started with some
of the really cool features,

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.480
like the facial tracking
effects, that we really wanted

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.210
to highlight and do something
cool with-- something that's

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.270
never been done before.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.150
And just knowing that social
gaming is very popular, we

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.010
wanted to take advantage of that
competitive spin and put

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.290
together a really
cool game that

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.170
would show those features.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.200
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: We also wanted
to do something that

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.820
was fun for us and something
that also hadn't kind of been

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.470
overdone in this this sphere.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.430
And Ping-Pong was something that
a lot of folks here do

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.450
here to blow off steam or
[INAUDIBLE] and thought

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.940
everybody else might
want the same.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.088
So.

00:19:37.088 --> 00:19:38.460
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.060
And so between Goodby and Hook,
how did you guys work

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:42.770
together on this?

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.740
What was the connection point
and the responsibilities?

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.200
How did that break out?

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.360
JESSICA HARDY: It's very
collaborative.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.330
I know we've spent a lot of
quality time with Hook, going

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.860
back and forth developing
this game.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.260
There was a lot of code that
went into putting it together.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.550
Ultimately, it ended up us
being the go-between with

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.450
Google and Hook.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.440
Once they would develop
it, we would vet it.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.610
And then when there was
feedback, we'd go back to Hook

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.480
and just look for where we could
make enhancements and

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.300
make it as smooth as
possible game.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.810
LISA KOURAKOS: We knew that
Hook was super attuned to

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.860
detail as we are over
at the Goodby team.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.796
And they're really great paying
attention to those

00:20:21.796 --> 00:20:22.490
kinds of things.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.810
They were excellent through
that whole process.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.890
MICHAEL WATTS: Plus once
they hire us, they

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.850
can't get rid of us.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.100
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: We don't
want to say it, but--

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.350
BRIAN MOROZ: What was the
idea generation process

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.290
like over at Goodby?

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.150
How did you guys come
up with this?

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.700
Who was involved?

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.640
Was this one person's spark of
genius, was it a group of

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.505
people working together?

00:20:43.505 --> 00:20:45.760
How did this come about?

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.670
JESSICA HARDY: Well, I think
it was really an

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.850
all-hands-on-deck sort
of situation.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.730
We had production, concepting,
creative concepting.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.760
I mean, account people
were involved.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.100
Everybody pretty much
had hands in it.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.350
I just think with the amount of
times that we've played and

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.620
seen the process, you discover
things as the development

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.110
process goes, that enhance
the creative.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.770
It's been a work in progress.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.200
LISA KOURAKOS: And I also
know that we really--

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.260
Hangout has these incredible
features, such as Hangout

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.700
effects and facial tracking.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.060
And we really wanted to leverage
those features.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.553
A lot of our game development
was based on figuring out how

00:21:22.553 --> 00:21:25.010
we could enhance them, and
make them really fun, and

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.260
incorporate them
into the game.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.810
And that drove a lot of
our creative process.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:29.190
BRIAN MOROZ: Interesting.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.820
So the technology drove some of
the ideation in this case.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.980
It wasn't, we have this idea,
let's figure out what

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.900
technology works.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.530
It was, this technology has
lots of opportunities.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.190
What can we do that's
interesting with that.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.465
LISA KOURAKOS: Absolutely.

00:21:41.465 --> 00:21:43.090
It definitely went both ways.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.010
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: I think it's a
lot of the real time type of

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.980
stuff when you're dealing with
working on a new platform and

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.410
seeing what works, and actually
getting really

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.210
excited and self correcting
as you go along.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.680
Which is also something
that we are

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.150
excited to take on here.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.210
BRIAN MOROZ: Who worked
on the project?

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.140
Obviously you guys have
introduced yourself.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.090
I assume the team was
a little larger.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.722
So both on the Goodby side and
on the Hook side, what were

00:22:05.722 --> 00:22:08.220
the roles had to come together
to really make this happen?

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.630
Was it a massive group
of people?

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.580
Was it a very small group?

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.340
What was that like?

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.110
JESSICA HARDY: Well I think our
interactive producer was

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.270
obviously very heavily involved
in making sure that

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.710
all the game updates
were flowing.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.280
And then also we had operations
involved just

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.680
because we are coordinating
with several

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.010
people on our end.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.515
I know we have a few creative
minds in here who have put

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:32.370
some input into the copy and
the look and feel of it.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.970
But ultimately, that was
established early on by some

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.180
of our top teams.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.250
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: There was a
little bit of everybody.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.275
And then, of course the core
team coming together.

00:22:41.275 --> 00:22:44.042
And the good thing for us about
having a wide net is

00:22:44.042 --> 00:22:46.220
that we had a lot
of fresh eyes.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.590
So over the course of the
project we have a lot of

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.716
people using and seeing it,
seeing how they can enhance

00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:53.630
it, quite a few kitchen tables,
add milestones to see

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.180
how we could make the project
better and better.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.770
BRIAN MOROZ: And on the
technical side, folks over at

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.470
Hook, but also at Goodby as
well, is there anything that

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.150
happened during the development
process that was a

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.930
particularly difficult hurdle
that you guys had to get over?

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.240
Or was it all smooth sailing
all the way through?

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.820
MICHAEL WATTS: I mean
rare that a project

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.420
is all smooth sailing.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.596
I think anybody will
admit that.

00:23:15.596 --> 00:23:17.800
Thankfully, we'd done quite a
bit of Hangout's API work

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.500
before we jumped into
this with Goodby.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.500
And we were on a very
condensed timeline.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.060
We essentially had about two
weeks to get our first

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.165
prototype out and then around
eight weeks to fulfill the

00:23:28.165 --> 00:23:29.990
first round of the project.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.020
We like to approach those
types of things as an

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.800
iterative process.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.850
So we, soon after prototyping,
got the first version out in

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.200
two weeks or less and got
people playing it.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.150
And then started rolling in
different API features into

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.320
the game and making it a more
rich user experience.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.280
As opposed to trying to
implement 20 features up

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.982
front, show the game halfway
through, and then fix what we

00:23:50.982 --> 00:23:51.830
can before it went out.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.420
So it was a very evolutionary
type of development process.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.472
We started off with playing with
your mouse, and that was

00:23:56.472 --> 00:23:56.960
kind of lame.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.320
And we tried other methods and
ultimately netted out with

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.090
face tracking.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.750
And once that happened,
a lot of the

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:04.710
game parameters changed.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.190
And it's definitely a living
process as went through those

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.006
eight weeks.

00:24:10.006 --> 00:24:12.430
BRIAN MOROZ: But nothing in
particular that was a

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.090
particular technical
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.920
It was iterative, just kind of
bit-by-bit moving through.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.420
MICHAEL WATTS: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.960
From my previous comment about
having done a little bit of

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.650
Hangout development before this,
we knew to stay away

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.370
from some certain things and
to approach things from a

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.690
different angle.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.400
As the Resn guys said, the
peer-to-peer system wasn't

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.265
quite robust enough for them, so
we took the route of using

00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:36.270
a centralized server from the
beginning, just to make sure

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.490
that we could get things up
and running quickly, have

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.825
something that could traverse
the globe in these toolkits.

00:24:40.825 --> 00:24:43.810
And then ultimately scale
out to a public version.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.680
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: And on our
end, it's like, if things

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.150
aren't bumpy, it's
not advertising.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.340
It's certainly not innovative
advertising.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.370
If they're not bumpy, it's
when I get concerned.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.840
MICHAEL WATTS: Brad broke his
skateboard a couple of times,

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.990
but I'm not sure that counts.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.410
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: Yeah.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.860
MICHAEL WATTS: Good thing.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.490
BRIAN MOROZ: Very cool.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.860
I think I have a very
important question

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.630
for you guys now.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.180
Just who is the best
at Ping-Pong?

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.180
MICHAEL WATTS: Oh well,
Brad made it, so--

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.666
BRIAN MOROZ: There's some
cheats put in there.

00:25:12.666 --> 00:25:13.150
MICHAEL WATTS: Oh, yeah.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.570
It knows his face
it [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.748
BRIAN MOROZ: It tracks
his face.

00:25:16.748 --> 00:25:17.632
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: I always feel
that there's an unfair

00:25:17.632 --> 00:25:19.386
advantage to those who
built it, but I won't

00:25:19.386 --> 00:25:20.475
get into this theory.

00:25:20.475 --> 00:25:23.550
JESSICA HARDY: I've had
a lot of practice.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.300
BRIAN MOROZ: So how are you
guys-- so Goodby, how are you

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.620
guys going to have the folks
at large engage with this?

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.320
What's the plan to roll out?

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.590
What is the goal?

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.640
What would be your ideal end
point for this, as far as who

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.720
gets involved and
how they use it?

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.150
JESSICA HARDY: The first
iteration of the game actually

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.660
launched during Ad Week and
right now it's available in

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.470
several different toolkits
that have been traveling

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.920
around the globe at
specific events.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.810
And then ultimately, we're
going to push out another

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.890
phase that's specific
to agencies.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:53.310
So the idea will be to really
kind of tap into that

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.360
motivation and that competitive
nature to get

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.405
creatives involved and really
want to dominate, and score

00:25:58.405 --> 00:26:02.280
the most points, and show their
bragging rights off.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.040
That'll be the next roll out.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.645
And that video is a little
bit of a teaser of

00:26:05.645 --> 00:26:07.710
that version to come.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.250
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.950
Agency versus agency.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.180
Prepare yourselves folks.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.840
Those of you who are involved
who are at an agency, start

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.150
stretching out a little bit.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:16.450
JESSICA HARDY: Absolutely.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:20.150
You might as well start
limbering up now.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.500
BRIAN MOROZ: So one final
question for you guys--

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.330
the same question that I asked
the folks over at Resn.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.230
If you had one piece of advice
to give people who are trying

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.640
to develop a Hangout API that's
something that's going

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.360
to be really fun and engaging,
that sounds just like-- the

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.230
Resn guys did this in a very
short period of time.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.560
What's your one piece of advice
on the creative side,

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.650
and one piece of advice
in the technical side?

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.530
LISA KOURAKOS: I think,
from a creative

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.510
standpoint, it takes time.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:50.180
But as we said, the platform
allowed a lot of room for

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.430
exploration and creativity.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.780
And I think that was a really
exciting part of the process.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.080
As we really dug into it, our
creators had a lot of range.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.235
So while it took time, it's
definitely a doable platform

00:27:03.235 --> 00:27:05.820
and an exciting platform
to work on.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.690
DEAN RUBINSTEIN: I think to that
point too, I would just

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.850
add from the creator
standpoint-- as account people

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.610
love to do--

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.490
that I think that either you
shoot for the stars and see

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.600
how close you can get to it.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.440
It's like anything else
you can try and do.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.830
Don't limit yourself and
just try and make

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:21.135
some really cool stuff.

00:27:21.135 --> 00:27:23.120
BRIAN MOROZ: And Hook, anything
from the technical

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.420
side that you would say is the
one thing to keep in mind when

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.200
doing the stuff?

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.690
CHRIS: I would say one thing
that's important is to make

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:34.680
sure that you have sort of a
well-thought out testing

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.440
regime, so that when you get
to the beta of the product.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.610
Especially if you're trying to
work on a multiplayer game,

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.540
you need to develop
enough test cases.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.910
With this platform, you need
to coordinate your testing

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.800
with multiple people to make
sure that it plays across all

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.240
the possible scenarios that
can come through in a

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.230
Hangout-- so making
sure of that.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.470
You know, people can enter and
exit a Hangout at many points.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.600
So making sure that if you are
building a game or something,

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.230
that no matter when a person
comes in or comes out, or what

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.760
happens, or how many people are
in the Hangout, that the

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.147
game adapts so that everybody
is sort of seeing the

00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:15.180
application in a way that makes
sense when it's made

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.300
available to them.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:21.690
And there are many more
scenarios that can happen when

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.450
you're building something in
this sort of system than if

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.030
you are just building a game
that two people are playing on

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.175
the same computer, or
something like that.

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:30.670
BRIAN MOROZ: Right.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.660
Right.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.970
All right.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.190
That's a great point that with
Hangouts, it is something

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.900
where people are-- yeah, I
hadn't even thought of that--

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.090
where people are popping
in and out.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.570
How do you handle
that situation?

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.900
Jonathan, hanging out over on
the West Coast, what are your

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:49.370
thoughts on both of these, or
questions for these guys?

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.990
JONATHAN BERI: I guess I'll
touch on the last point.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.750
Hangouts are very dynamic.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.542
You're never know when a user's
going to join, when

00:28:55.542 --> 00:28:56.690
they're going to leave.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.215
Somebody rejoins, like we lost
GSP for a few minutes, and

00:28:59.215 --> 00:29:00.710
they just popped back in.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:01.960
And nobody was the wiser.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.110
Thank you for the example,
because [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.670
When we designed the API, we
added those features into the

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.400
actual platforms.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.770
As a program, you can know when
somebody joins or when

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:23.740
somebody leaves, where do they
join, and have your app

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.840
respond to that.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.756
And say, maybe throw up a
loading screen saying, there

00:29:27.756 --> 00:29:29.640
are four people playing
this game right now,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.720
you're next in the queue.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.950
Or change the table, if
it's appropriate.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:34.920
You can add another person
to the table

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.380
and things like that.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.750
Just as Hangouts are dynamic
and responsive, we made the

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.740
API in such a way to allow
for that functionality.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.480
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.370
And just to do a quick wrap
before we get to the questions

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.850
that people have sent in.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.220
We'll start with the Resn.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.160
Folks at Resn, now that you have
Jonathan captured here on

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.270
camera, what would be the one
or two things that you would

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:03.400
love to see from the Google+
APIs that he guarantees he's

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.670
going to do, or at
least will try?

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.080
It's early in the morning, so
if you don't have anything,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.007
Jonathan's fine with that.

00:30:19.007 --> 00:30:20.680
JONATHAN BERI: That's easy.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.260
EMLYN HUGHES: It was
all pretty good.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.210
I guess one thing, like I
mentioned before, some of the

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.900
debugging stuff was quite noisy,
and as part of the

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.530
polling to get all the network
data going back and forth, it

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.380
seemed to slow down the Chrome
debugger quite a bit.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.780
Do you have any plans to maybe
change the way that that

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.510
system might work to make
it a little bit

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:43.580
more efficient, perhaps?

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.420
JONATHAN BERI: So starting with
debugging, both groups

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.640
said that that was a
challenge for them.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.180
And we know that.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.660
Actually, what's a funny thing
that ends up happening,

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.770
everybody works on this big
scale project, they all figure

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.240
out that debugging's hard, and
they write their own debugging

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.170
infrastructure, or system,
or toolkit, right?

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.900
I actually have seen a
bunch of people do

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.450
the exact same problem.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.450
First thing that we start out
is, part of our weekly office

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.130
hours, we've been educating
people on best practices for

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.760
debugging and some of the tips
and tricks that we were seeing

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.230
in the wild.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:22.890
Definitely cleaning up the tools
is high on our priority.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:27.520
And making the debugger better
and tuning the API to make it

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.020
better is things that are
definitely on target for fix.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.470
In general, I think you guys
all do the same route.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.970
Using the client, using the
Chrome Developer Tools is a

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.715
powerful system and actually
gets you pretty far along.

00:31:42.715 --> 00:31:45.440
So combining us fixing it and
just taking better advantage

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.490
of the tools there, I think
solves most people's problems.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.780
EMLYN HUGHES: Yeah.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.760
I mean, it wasn't too
much of a problem.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.865
Once we realized that having the
consoles and things open,

00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:56.650
it would slow down after while,
we built some little

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.420
things on screen that would
output the ticks

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:58.740
and stuff like that.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.150
And that worked pretty
well from then on.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.570
JONATHAN BERI: We can
always do better.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.750
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.326
And now, Goodby and Hook, any
thoughts for Jonathan, if he

00:32:09.326 --> 00:32:12.250
could grant you a wish for
your next project?

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.040
MICHAEL WATTS: Chris and Wade
might have some others, but I

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.640
want some of Jon's
famous gelato.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.080
It's posted all over the place
but, nobody gets any.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.130
JONATHAN BERI: I'm going to
make that my number one.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.950
CHRIS: One thing that would be
helpful would be maybe a

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:31.710
little bit more complete access
to the person's, the

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.280
participant's, person object
from the Google API.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.220
Because there's a lot of--

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.460
it would be nice
if you could--

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.435
right now you get sort of the
person's profile image, their

00:32:41.435 --> 00:32:42.350
name, and a few other things.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.770
But it would be nice if there
were some way to pull in more

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.500
of their person object to
possibly get like their

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.990
location or any of the other.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.220
There's a large data set that
comes with a person being a

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.790
Google+ person that would be
nice to possibly have access

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.650
to some more of that in Hangouts
without needing to

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.820
rely on the Google+ REST API.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.440
MICHAEL WATTS: I also think
it be nice to--

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.415
people I think get a little
big confused when they log

00:33:07.415 --> 00:33:09.170
into an app from something,
invited to an app from

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.580
somebody, and they have
to click on the left

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.320
bar to load it up.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.790
Maybe a streamlined way of
auto-loading the app like

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.280
people were able to do with
our initiation URLs.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.940
Or if we put the GID
into the URL.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.760
But if that was kind of
automated for the API, I think

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.260
that would help a lot of people
in terms [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:22.370
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:25.760
An easier way to direct launch
the apps would be better.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.880
It's a little difficult
right now.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.320
JONATHAN BERI: So starting
with the

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.570
first question, gelato.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.980
I make gelato at home, for
anybody who doesn't know that.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.770
And I did a Hangout on
air teaching people.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:38.940
Yeah.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.350
It makes about a pint a trip.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.260
I don't think it will make it
all the way to you guys, but

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.770
if you visit San Francisco--

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:46.935
MICHAEL WATTS: It's frozen
all the way to Michigan.

00:33:46.935 --> 00:33:47.485
Just put it outside.

00:33:47.485 --> 00:33:49.910
It'll get here.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.220
JONATHAN BERI: But leaving
California, I don't know.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.420
Anyway, the [INAUDIBLE],
that's a

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.960
great piece of feedback.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.910
We're always trying
to improve that.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.720
We're also trying to improve
the REST API to

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.400
provide more data.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.590
I think you should expect
more things down

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.080
there in the future.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:09.270
But was there pieces of database
besides the location

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:12.293
that you would love to use, or
just, it would be great if it

00:34:12.293 --> 00:34:13.543
was better?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.840
CHRIS: I think that
there's a lot of

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.000
different options in there.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.670
I don't have anything
specific.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:25.199
But I know there were a couple
things we had talked about

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:29.156
during the project that if we
had been able to pull data in

00:34:29.156 --> 00:34:30.810
from that person object.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.920
Part of it depends
upon how much the

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.170
person has filled out.

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:41.650
I could envision apps where
posts that people had put up

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.239
or something like that
could be important.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.580
Or if you're trying
to make an app.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.730
Any sort of app that would
involve connecting people with

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.320
other people in their circles
would probably need to start

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.840
with the person object, or at
least some way to get access

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.940
to their connections.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.810
You can grab some of that right
now with the REST API.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:03.030
It's just that, it's sort
of in two places.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.780
I guess, I don't know, may have
seen it as sort, if the

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.430
two were merged a
little bit more.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.120
Because they're sort of--

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.630
to me, they sort of serve--

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:14.220
they're sort of two parts
of a similar ecosystem.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:14.525
JONATHAN BERI: Got it.

00:35:14.525 --> 00:35:15.775
Noted.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.970
BRIAN MOROZ: So we will wrap up
by taking a couple of the

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.580
questions that have come
in via the moderator.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.910
The first question--

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.810
very important--

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:29.830
out of LA.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.500
How long did it take to
make the headbands?

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.520
The question that has come in,
I think they were pre-made.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.100
I cannot tell you how long it
took me to get the wristband.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.036
I was just given it.

00:35:41.036 --> 00:35:43.460
I think the headbands are a
fantastic touch and you guys

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.323
you keep those at all times.

00:35:45.323 --> 00:35:47.420
MICHAEL WATTS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.940
BRIAN MOROZ: They
never come off.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.350
MICHAEL WATTS: Never.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.880
BRIAN MOROZ: The second question
is, what technology

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.860
is used on the back end to make

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.080
people ridiculous together?

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.580
I think that we answered that.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:00.230
Essentially it's the Google+
API, specifically with regards

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.690
to Hangouts, right?

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.820
It's very easy to make people
ridiculous together with that

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.110
particular piece
of technology.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.820
A question that came in that I
thought was actually pretty

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.330
key was, besides
Hangout games--

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.890
I'm reading this here-- what
other types of innovations are

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.730
possible using the
Google+ API?

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.980
And that's from Daniel
out of planning.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.910
What else are you guys
looking at besides?

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.450
These are both kind of gaming
elements in Hangouts.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.630
Are you looking at other
ways to use that API?

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.200
Are there other things that you
guys have thought about

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.200
before, but decided not to do?

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.560
Or have you been mostly focused
on the Hangouts kind

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.810
of gaming element?

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.400
LISA KOURAKOS: I think the one
thing that we're really

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.750
excited about, especially with
our agency tournament

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:48.010
eventually launching is, we want
to get the creative eyes

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.630
to see where this platform
can go and what

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:51.490
people can do with it.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.520
And we thought having the agency
tournament would be a

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.020
really fun way to kick that
off and give us the

00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:00.390
opportunity to start
that conversation.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.260
JONATHAN BERI: And I'd say from
working with a lot of

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.580
partners who've been buidling
apps and the developer in the

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.980
garage, we see about three major
types of apps that are

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.180
being built.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.710
The game is a great use case,
especially because it's fun

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.080
and engaging.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.840
But a big, big chunk of them
are around broadcast.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.880
So Hangouts on Air, like we're
doing right now, are broadcast

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.860
video that streams over
YouTube and Google+.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.550
It's kind of hard to manage--

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:29.005
switching between who's on
camera, the mike volume, all

00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:31.210
those kind of things.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.720
We are building tools
around broadcast.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.430
And the other one is taking
traditional productivity-style

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:40.020
web apps and bringing it
into a collaborative

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.970
platform like Hangouts.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:46.870
One [INAUDIBLE] out of Denmark,
I believe, they have

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:50.230
the traditional scrum boards
with post-it notes

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.810
all over the place.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:55.030
We can drag and drop
across the board.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.100
And they are doing that
in real time.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.650
And they have a web app
that's kind of cool.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.310
And they get a lot
of use out of it.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.270
But when they brought
it to Hangout.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.660
Now it's totally immersive.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.540
It's like, the distributed
teams are right there and

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.505
they're all doing project
planning and work on the same

00:38:07.505 --> 00:38:09.000
board together.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.580
It's games, productivity,
and broadcast.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.550
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:20.580
Any last comments in general,
or questions for Jonathan,

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.048
folks on the call, Resn,
Goodby, and Hook?

00:38:24.048 --> 00:38:25.410
LISA KOURAKOS: I think
we're good.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.180
BRIAN MOROZ: Everyone is good.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:26.680
All right.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.440
Thank you guys so much for
jumping on in various time

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.000
zones and various parts of the
world to discuss how you guys

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.926
built these incredibly fun
applications which, by the

00:38:36.926 --> 00:38:39.740
way, for those who are watching,
can be found at

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.440
creativesandbox.com.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.170
dot com.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:45.200
Tomorrow we are talking about
the GO API, for those of you

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.700
who are interested in
that, tune in then.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.890
Otherwise, thank you guys
so much for joining.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.580
And hopefully one of you will
develop a 3-D application for

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.617
the API so this works next
time we try that.

00:38:55.617 --> 00:38:56.371
All right.

00:38:56.371 --> 00:38:57.010
Thanks guys.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.950
Have a wonderful afternoon.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.200
Bye.
