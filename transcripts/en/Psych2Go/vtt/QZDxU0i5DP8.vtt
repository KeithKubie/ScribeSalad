00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.269
hi everyone my name is Matt and today
i'm working with Psych2Go to bring

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.410
you this extremely informative video
today I'll be giving you some advice on

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.039
dating people with social anxiety for
all you extroverts out there and those of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.220
you who have little to no problem
socializing as someone who deals with

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.480
social anxiety and anxiety in general on a
daily basis these tips are important to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.750
build a relationship with someone who
has trouble socializing i will say this

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.910
advice is just from my perspective

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.690
everybody's different but I feel like I
have a pretty good grasp on what it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.260
takes for people like me to form
successful relationships or even close

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.070
friendships without further ado let's
get into it first thing be

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.309
straightforward with them we're shy
people that's why they call it social

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.329
anxiety sure we may muster up the
courage to ask you out but I never know

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.350
what to do afterwards do i make a move
do i go in for the kiss like what what

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.829
do i do we need to date extroverts or
nothing's gonna freakin happen in the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.670
relationship for example i dated a very
shy person someone even shyer then me

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.330
surprisingly and we ended up breaking up
because we never really communicated

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.540
their needs to be that one person in the
relationship that can initiate this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.688
stuff at first did you hear that last
part at first

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:15.869
usually when a shy person gets to know
someone they were up to them and they

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.319
become a lot more extroverted with them
so the straightforward thing is the push

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.670
to get that ball rolling

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.810
second thing to take into consideration
we're not mind reader's what i mean by

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.159
this is if something is bothering you
tell us this kind of ties in with the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.459
whole straightforward thing but bear
with me people with anxiety are the

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.819
biggest fans of conflict and nine out of
ten people want to know what the problem

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.509
is so they can resolve it in an ideal
relationship you get what you give so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.540
communication especially about something
that's bothering you

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.430
it's a must and ignored problem doesn't
go away it just gets worse third thing

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.890
reinsurance is an amazing thing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
look we all have our bad days with
people with anxiety and people like me

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.610
that juggle depression with that when it
rains it freakin pores what everyone

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.369
needs in the situation is reassurance
from their significant other

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.640
they need to know that their wanted
needed loved what have you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.419
I mean of course they already know that
but it's nice to be reminded when you're

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.960
down the last piece of advice I have to
offer panic attacks happen

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.770
sometimes for no reason at all this goes
for your significant other your friends

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.360
your family etc just be aware that they
happen and it's not easy to get out of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.389
them and it's even impossible to get
someone to stop having one

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.110
all you can do is hold them let them
know you're not going anywhere and just

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.979
wait it out

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.130
panic attacks are one of the scariest
things I've ever experienced and all you

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.150
can really do is just let it run its
course understanding that and just being

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.080
there for the person is all you really
need to do well i hope you guys learned

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.530
something from this but remember like in
any relationship you get what you put

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.069
into it nobody likes a selfish partner
if you have any tips that I might have

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.130

comments if you like staring at my face

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.180

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.130
