00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.610
In this lesson, we learn that when and where a gene is expressed matters a lot.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.570
&gt;&gt; Lactase expression is present in nearly

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.880
all babies and slows over time. However,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.190
if you're one of the people who

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.000
has the allele that keeps lactase expression high.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.890
&gt;&gt; Now all the differences in the different cell types of your body

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.190
have to do with these kinds of differences in the activity of gene products.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.860
&gt;&gt; Every cell in your body has the exact

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.840
same instructions. They just read different parts at different

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.700
times, depending on the coordination between the coding and non-coding regions.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.600
&gt;&gt; Now, what we've learned in this lesson and the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.290
three lessons previous are really important for us to build

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.660
on in the following lessons. So if you've had trouble

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.080
with this material or material before this, I want you to

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.900
go back watch some of those videos again, take some

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.220
of the problem sets, go to the forums and talk to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.150
some of the other students. Because it's really important that

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.260
you have a firm understanding of this material before moving forward.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.380
&gt;&gt; Now, in the meantime, next time you

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.460
reach for that glass of milk and cookies

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.120
&gt;&gt; Think twice about how that amazing human

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.750
evolution has allowed you to enjoy this yummy drink.
