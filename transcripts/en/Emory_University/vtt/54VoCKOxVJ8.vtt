00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.600
A crowd of people, active shooters and the chaos

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.060
that ensues. Although still relatively
unlikely, it's not an unthinkable occurrence.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.620
In a drill involving first responders from several metro area jurisdictions, some outfitted with body cams,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.500
Emory's Office of Critical Event Preparedness Response (or CEPAR)

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.180
tested reactions to a mass casualty

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.840
shooting conducted recently at White Hall. The event was staged in collaboration

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.620
with the Atlanta Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), which is made up of

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.230
Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the City of Atlanta.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.239
The task was to take down the gunman and get victims, played here by Emory community volunteers,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.560
out of harm's way as quickly as possible.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.049
"You've got personnel who are armed, who are actively shooting individuals.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.350
It's a threat obviously to the victims and the in the public in the area, and it's a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.130
threat to the responding officers." 
As if ripped from recent headlines,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.689
this scenario not only involved active shooters, but mock improvised explosive

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.240
devices on both the Emory and CDC campuses. The aim was to test

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.420
communications, equipment, and police and emergency medical teams under extreme pressure.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.620
"This was a multi-venue exercise and part  of this exercise not only

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.590
looked at the capabilities of EMS operating in the warm zone

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.479
under escort to provide free eyes and
immediate life-saving intervention,

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.649
but we also surged a couple of the local hospitals with patients to see how their

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.390
surge management plan worked."
One of the major goals of UASI is to make sure that

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.530
multi-jurisdictional plans and collaborations exist between local core

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.869
first response units and their state and federal partners. During this exercise,

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.539
the region's tactical operations con plan, which bring SWAT teams together,

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.470
was tested along with the region's
interoperable communications

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.360
capabilities for command and control. Drills such as this one are designed to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.860
identify gaps which UASI works to overcome or eliminate.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.220
"It's crucial that I know who you are, that you know who I am, so that when the phone rings at

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.920
2 in the morning, it's not the first time we've had a conversation."

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.209
But it was the first time area first  responders were able to coordinate a plan of action on

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.420
this scale since the recent annexation
of the Clifton corridor

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.580
into the City of Atlanta.
