00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: On behalf acting
Librarian of Congress, David S. Mao,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.060
I'm pleased to be here to
introduce Jo Ann Jenkins.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.700 position:56%
I'm Robert Newlen, Chief of Staff
for the Library of Congress and it's

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.110
so wonderful to see so many people
here today in this beautiful room.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.820
Jo Ann Jenkins is no stranger
to the Library of Congress

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.090
and we're a better
place because of her.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.080
As the libraries Chief of
Staff, Jo Ann was a disruptor

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.550
and I don't mean making a lot
of noise in the reading rooms.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.800
But in her fifteen years here,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.030
she changed the way the nation
interacts with its library.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.440
Among her many special
contributions,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.590
she lead the many bi-centennial
celebrations of the Library.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.650
She led and grew the
National Book Festival,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.700
the nation's premier celebration
of literacy and reading.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.630
She re-energized the
junior fellows program,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.680 position:56%
which gives talented college
students internships at the library.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.200
She spearheaded the young reader's
center to provide a special place

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.060
at the library for young
children and their families.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.460
She designed an award winning,
state of the art new experience

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.250
for visitors to the Library.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.580 position:56%
She launched an innovative upward
mobility and health related programs

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.920
for staff and she intergraded
the Libraries unique facility

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.580
in Culpepper Virginia housing
the nation's film, television,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.470
radio and sound recording heritage
into the Culpepper community.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.470 position:56%
Jo Ann left the Library in two
thousand and ten to become President

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.820
of the AARP Foundation,
AARP's charitable arm.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.320
As President of the
Foundation, Jo Ann transformed

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.500
that organizations far
reaching development

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.260
and social impact initiatives
including the drive to end hunger,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.980
a national effort to help
millions of older Americans

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.420
who struggle with hunger every day.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.720
Under her leadership,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.970
the foundations overall
donor base increased

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.390
by ninety percent in two years.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.460
She was appointed Chief Operating
Officer in two thousand thirteen

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.980
and made executive officer

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.770
of the thirty eight million
member organization in September

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.540
of two thousand and fourteen.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.740
We are very proud to count AARP
among our esteemed private sector

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.960
partners who are instrumental in
advancing the libraries mission.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.050
With her track record for making
a difference, this is no surprise

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.100
to me that she finally
decided to write

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.710
down her thoughts on disruption.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:22.310
I am particularly interested in how
she disrupted the aging paradigm

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.570
because it directly affects me.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.970
In fact whether you are of age,
guilty, or are dealing with parents

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.890
or friends that are, I suspect

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.390
that everyone here today will
learn something they can apply

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.090
to improve their quality of life.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.700
I do have just one bone
to pick with you Jo Ann,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.440
how is it since you have become the
spokesperson for changing the air

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.500
of aging paradigm, how
is it you never age?

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.610
You know many years later here I am

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.470
with this white hair,
what can I say.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.460
It's a great pleasure to welcome
Jo Ann back to the Library

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.510
to tell us how she launching a
national movement to disrupt aging.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:25.470
[ Applause ]

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.990
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: Well thank you
Robert and thank you all for coming

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.170
out to talk about disrupting
aging today.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.430
As we were waiting over
at the ceremonial office,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.600
one of my favorite
place, I told my colleague

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.330
from AARP don't touch
anything because if you come

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.400
into this room you have
to give a million dollars.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.010
So I wanted to make sure when
they said do you want water,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.610
we said no we don't want anything.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.220
But thank you all today and thank
you Robert for sort of going

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.390
through that list of projects
that really have so much meaning

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.640 position:56%
in my life and as I was saying I
had the good fortune last week to be

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.100
in New York for the Women
of the World conference

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.320
and Laura Bush was there with
us and we were reminiscing

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.890
about the National Book Festival
with John and Sue and so many all

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.290
of you who worked on the National
Book Festival and I recall saying

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.260
to her, do you remember
our first meeting

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.280
and I asked you what would
success look like and she said

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.740
if we could get five thousand
people that would be great

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.090
and we all have a different
answer as to how many showed up on

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.390
that first book festival.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.550
It sort of goes anywhere
from fifteen thousand people

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.710
to thirty thousand, but we're
certainly above the five thousand

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.270
that she start, so,
good to be back here.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.880
I want to start today by
having a conversation with you

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.440
about disrupt aging,
which is our new book

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.590
that we put out two weeks ago.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.120
And why it's so important
this whole idea

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.400
of age disruption and
what it is we do.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.640
So the first really
idea around this is

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.200
that the way people
are aging is changing.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.760
That fifty today is very
different than it was years ago.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.900
Whether you're fifty,
or sixty or seventy,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.550
that it looks very different
than it did for our parents

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.620
or our parent's parents and
today with increased longevity

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.770
and generally better health and
medical advances, that we're going

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.310
to live another twenty
or thirty years longer

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.730
than our parents or
grandparents lived.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.230
And as a result of that,
people are living much longer.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.580
The fastest growing age group in
this country is people over the age

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.690
of eighty five and second are
people over the age of a hundred.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.560
Ten thousand people a day are
turning the age sixty five

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.960
and that's going to happen every
day for the next fourteen years.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.650 position:56%
We are getting older, but our focus
is really not about how you're going

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.790
to age, but how you're
going to live.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.700
So when people say, so why
did you write disrupt aging,

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.230
it actually I would say has its
beginnings here at the Library

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.910 position:56%
of Congress because when I turned
fifty my colleague David Alby who is

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.030
with me at AARP, him and my
husband cooked up this idea

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.670
that they were going to have a
surprise fiftieth birthday party

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.790
and it's actually the
introduction to the book.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.190
And then those of you who
have worked with me know

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.060
that I don't like secrets.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.280 position:56%
I like to know exactly what's going
to happen, when it's going to happen

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.730
and why it's going to happen

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:36.380
and so my husband decided he
was going to take me to brunch.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.910
We got there.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.710
There were no reservations or
they had lost the reservations.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.750
We had a table back by the kitchen.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.630
And I was getting angrier
and angrier

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.630
and then the maÃ®tre d'came
back and said actually,

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.350
I made a mistake you're
in a different room.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.530
And I go over and it was
actually all of my colleagues

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.040
from the Library of Congress
celebrating my fiftieth birthday.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.250
But as the story goes, it was
about those birthday cards

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:05.050
of congratulations, you're
fifty, you're over the hill.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.020
You know, you're not getting
older, you're just forgetting

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.610
where you put things and all
of those different stereotypes

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.670
that we see, so it was that idea
and that concept about where I was

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:22.790
in my own life and how important I
thought it was for us to feel good

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.420
about being fifty or sixty or
seventy or eighty or whatever

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.960
that number is and this whole
idea about creating the book

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.020
around disrupt aging was really to
start a movement in this country

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.620
about how do we change the
conversation in this country

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.660
about what it means
to be fifty and older.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:44.110
And how do we focus on positive
aging and positive living,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.500
than looking at it
as something to fear.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:54.770
I find it fascinating that as we go
around the country talking to folks

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.960
that we really see this ah ha
moment of I feel just like that.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.800
I'm so glad you're saying it.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.880
Now I can say it and
sort of repeat it.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.050
But how do we begin
to disrupt aging?

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.190
What we're trying to do is to
challenge out dated beliefs

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.770
and spark solution so
that more people can live

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.690
and chose how they want to age.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.480
As I mentioned earlier,
it's about challenging

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.740
out dated beliefs and
sparking new ideas.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.130
That we are creating both
a wide spread awareness

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.830
about out dated beliefs
and also trying to engage

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.780
and ignite this conversation
and get the private sectors

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.520
and the public sectors
involved about how we need

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.510
to create new products
and new solutions

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.350
that allow people to
live and age better.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:51.160
So let's begin if I could around
challenging these outdated beliefs.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.390
One of the important
things I think it is,

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.760
is really with owning your own age.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.440
I tell everybody I meet
that I'm fifty eight.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.540
I was born in the year that AARP's
founder Doctor Ethel Percy Andrus

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.520
started AARP, and also I want to
claim the first permanent woman

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.790
to be the CEO in our fifty
eight year here history

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.440
and very proud of that.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.730
But it is about this whole
idea that you see in television

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.430
and ad magazine commercials
that fifty is the new thirty.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.760
I say fifty is not the new thirty
and sixty is not the new forty,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.270
fifty is the new fifty
and it looks good.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.880
And it's ok to own your age and
feel good about where you are

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.760
and what it is you want to
do in your fifty plus life.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:46.660
If you go to the google search
bar and you type in a word,

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:53.120
I lied about my, the first
thing that pops up is age.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.420
Why do you this?

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.720
How many of you have
lied about your age?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.660
You don't have to answer that.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.810
You know, but it's this whole idea

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.930
that society thinks
that younger is better.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.790
And so for me, in owning your age
and feeling about where you are

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.630
that it's a bout thinking
through and being comfortable

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.500
with the experiences that
life has brought you.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.330
And that for me, I know that
I am a more purposeful person

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.620
because of the experiences, the
wisdom these years have brought me.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:32.000
And that we're not getting younger
every day, we're aging every day

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.740
from the day we were born and
that we need to own that reality

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.040
and feel good about it and
not let us that hold us back

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.670
as we're thinking about
what it is we want to do

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.450
in these extra years
that are coming to us.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:51.870
The second part of this is
about fighting ageism, not age.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.160
And there is a big distinction.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.390 position:56%
Our ability to live longer and
healthier, more productive lives is,

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.700
is really one of man-kinds
greatest accomplishments.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.240
Yet we don't often see it that way

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.870
and certainly society
doesn't see it that way.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:11.010 position:56%
And these negative stereotypes of
aging are so ingrained in our psyche

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.970
that they are difficult to overcome
and we don't even try at times

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.690
and so this idea of
how do we fight ageism.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.580
How do we call it out
not in a hateful way,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.610
but in a very direct way when you
do it yourself or when you see one

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.240
of your colleagues or family
members making fun of someone

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.910
because of their age
or making age an excuse

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.730
for why you can't do something?

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:41.000
And so that's a huge part of
how we begin to fight ageism

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.880
in our own personal lives.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.190

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.280
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: What I think is
so fascinating about this video is

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:32.030
that one interaction actually
changes perception of aging

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.050
to these young people and
also think for the perception

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.900
of the older people
about millennials,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.060
and I think that's what we're
trying to do with disrupt aging

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.150
to get people to not judge
someone based on how old they are,

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.300
but what they can do and what
they can bring to the table.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:55.670
If you think about it this way,
today it is socially unacceptable

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.860
to ignore, to ridicule, or
stereotype someone based

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.400
on their gender, their race,
or their sexual orientation.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.020
Well I said right before
this presidential campaign

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.320
that was not acceptable.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.210
So why is it that we still allow
people to make fun and tell jokes

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.270
about someone based on their age?

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.650
Its part of that cultural
norm that we need to dispel

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.220
so that people are judged
based on who they are

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.940
and not how old they are.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.070

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.720
Disrupt aging also focuses
around new solutions.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.400
So that we as, as we age, are not
having to adapt to what society

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.310
or people from the private
sectors, products and services,

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.070
that weren't having to adapt to
what they put in the market instead

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.650
of them developing products
and services that we need to,

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.100
in the market in order to age well.

around financial resilience,

you as individuals

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.610
to focus on those three areas?

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:25.090
That whole idea requires changing
the way we talk about aging

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.650
from something to fear, to
something to look forward to.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:33.010

area, how do we start thinking

about health and what we're eating
and how we exercise at an early age,

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.510
so that as we get to
these additional twenty,

thirty years that we might live
beyond our traditional retirement

focusing on those areas early

decline is drastically condensed?

In the area of the wealth, how do we
get people to start saving earlier?

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:05.030
And saving longer so that
they don't outlive their money

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.170
and that they're not solely
dependent on social security

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:13.680 position:56%
and then in the area of self, how
do we find that personal fulfillment

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.180 position:56%
in our own lives that allow us to be
able to do the things that we want

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.640
to do and think about
what it is we want to do.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.040
I love to use the Maya Angelo
quote and she says that a fifty,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.620
we finally come the person
we always wanted to be.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.790
And how we start in
our fifty plus years,

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:38.240
figuring out who is the
person that we want to be

and how do we go about
living our lives?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.450
I certainly like to focus this
around what I call the three P's,

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.950

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:51.900
to take a personal responsibility
on how we go about doing this.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.200
That there is a public
role in our communities

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.340
around how we address these
issues and that there's a role

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.390
for the private sector at all
levels to start thinking about

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.900
and creating new solution for
people who are fifty and over

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.730
to allow them to live better.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.160
I often talk about the
example about the car.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.550
That why don't we have a seat that
swivels out that makes it easier

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.680
for us to get into the car or makes
it easier for that mother trying

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.450
to put that car seat in
to be able to do that.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.990
Many of the solutions that we're
talking about, not only is good

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.160
for the old, but also
good for the young

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.170
and how do we stop this
pitting against generations,

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.790
but really getting us to think
about solutions that are ageless

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.210 position:56%
that allow all of us to live better.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.420
I wanted to just focus
if I could from these,

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:49.070
these state of how we're moving
from to an area as we said,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.320
let's go back to the first
one Camilie on health.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.230
How do we move from physical
and mental diminishment

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.000
to physical and mental fitness?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.500
How do we move from being dependent
patients of the health care system

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.800
to empower users of our health
information and how we go about

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.810
and have conversations with
our doctors and hospitals

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.400
and health care providers?

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.380
How do we move from that uncertain
access to care to dependable access

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.340 position:56%
to care that we are the ones in the
driver's seat to be able to do this?

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:30.260
And then in the financial areas,
older people viewing older people

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:37.010
as economic burdens to older
people as economic contributors;

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.560
people fifty plus contribute
seven point one trillion dollars

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.480 position:56%
at economic activity to our country.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.640
And I always like to say, but
where else but Washington would

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.620
that be a problem rather
than a solution

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.780
as we're dealing our
friends across the street.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.730
That we move from this
depletion of finances over time

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.170
to resources you don't out live
and start thinking about saving

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:08.340
for the life I want to live
rather than saving for retirement.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.510
And do we start thinking
about that at a younger age

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:17.480
so that you are making it
a part of your daily life?

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.380
How do we move from an
undervalued fifty plus workforce

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.250
to a higher competitive
fifty plus workforce?

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.840
Particularly those folks at the
Library, the Library of Congress

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.760
and libraries all around the world,
if it were not for our volunteers,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.120
most of whom are fifty and
older, libraries couldn't exist.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.980
They couldn't afford to hire
the workforce that is needed

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.670
to do the work that librarians
do all across this country

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.750
and how do we use this
fifty plus work force

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.630 position:56%
to help us start solving some of the
issues that are facing our country.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:57.010 position:56%
And then in the area of personal
fulfillment, how do we start to move

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:01.900
from aging as only about
decline to aging is about growth?

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.040
From the fact aging presents
only challenges that it's an area

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.650
of opportunity for the fifty
plus, but also for the community?

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.250
And that we start viewing
older people not as burdens,

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.980
but as contributors to society as
they continue to live some twenty,

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.970
thirty past what is
traditional retirement.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.100
&gt;&gt; And so what I'd
like to do is talk

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:33.350
about what I call the
aging four freedoms.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:38.080
That a new vision for living and
aging in America and inspire us

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.640
to start disrupt aging
in making that a reality.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.150
On January six in nineteen
forty one,

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.750 position:56%
President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt stood before joint session

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.860
of Congress to deliver his annual
state of the union address and in

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:58.510
that speech he spoke about four
freedoms that still ranked true

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:02.900
to this day about the basic
values that decline American life

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.070
and examples of American
exceptionalism.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:11.020
He spoke about the freedom of
speech, freedom of worship,

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:15.220
freedom from want and
freedom from fear.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.340
And so much like President
Roosevelt,

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:23.110
we've identified what I
call aging's four freedoms.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.830
The first one is the,
the freedom is chose.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.930
The freedom to choose how you want
to live and age and when it comes

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.000
to aging, there is
no one size fits all.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.740
If you want to follow that
traditional path to retirement,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.090
you should be able to do that.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.270
If you want and act and engage life
and you want to continue working,

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.420
you should be able
to do that as well.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.910
If you want to retire and live
in a retirement community or live

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:54.250
in an institutional setting,
you should have the opportunity

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.180
to do make those decisions and all

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.630
of those options should
be available to you.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:02.950
It's all about having, you having
the options to decide how you want

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.130
to live out the rest of your life.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:12.500
The second freedom, the freedom
to earn, a key part of retirement,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.580 position:56%
the retirement model that most of us
grew up, was the freedom from work.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.410
That's what retirement
was all about.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.590
That I was going to go
home and not do anything,

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.730
but play golf and go on vacation.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:30.350 position:56%
But today, a key part of this
extended age is the freedom to work.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.000
Many of us want or need to
continue working in order

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.920
to subsidize our financial security
or the fact that we have a lot more

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.630
to give back and I think
that's where I found myself

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.530
when I left the Library of Congress
to think that I had the opportunity

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:49.730
to retire or go home or, but I
felt like I had a lot more to give

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:54.370
and so I made that choice to make
that transition over to AARP.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.850
But this second freedom is
about giving you the opportunity

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:02.750
and not letting society decide at
a certain age you're no longer able

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.520
to work to be able to do that.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.400
And the third freedom, freedom to
learn; and this certainly applies

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.420
to the work that you guys do
here at the Library of Congress

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:17.090
which is the need to keep
learning and staying engaged

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.680
and being involved in a productive
during this extended little age

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:27.330 position:56%
that gives you the opportunity to be
engaged to avoid social isolation,

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.020
to be able to have those
learning experiences.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.010
You know I often talk about
the idea that we are going

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:38.580
to continue learning throughout our
life time and how important it is

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.780
for us to stay engaged in
a learning environment.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.790
To keep up with the
use of technology,

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.320
to be to stay engaged
rather in libraries

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.520
or in traditional education
settings.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.480
But that we should
have the opportunity

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.270
to continue to learn as we age.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.930
And then the fourth freedom,
the freedom to pursue happiness,

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.180
that this is about discovering and
fulfilling your purpose in life

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.900
and really becoming the person
that you've always wanted to be.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.310
This extra twenty or thirty
years gives us an extraordinary

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:13.160
opportunity to become the people
that we've always wanted to be;

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.510
that we're no longer
burdened by the day

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.190
to day stresses that
consume our lives.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.460
Most of our kids are
off to college or work;

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.580
hopefully they're not coming
back in, but to visit,

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:30.140 position:56%
but it gives us an extraordinary
opportunity to do what it is we want

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:35.700 position:56%
to do as adults and be able to focus
on ourselves and on our communities

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:41.070
and live our life with
meaning and purpose.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:47.340
So in winning these four freedoms
it gives each of us an opportunity

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.270
to really become the
person that we wanted to be,

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.580
but I wanted to give
you this challenge.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.160
In conversations with your family
and friends, and I've had some

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.590
of those conversation with you
as I've come back here today,

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:06.150
and in your work not only in
the library, but in your family

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.460
and communities, how will you start

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.100
to challenge these outdated
beliefs about aging.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.880
In your own life and in your work
what solutions will you spark

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.930
in everything you do, think
about the new possibilities

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:25.930
that you can create for
yourself and for those around you

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:30.240
and in your communities so
that we begin this conversation

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.990
about disrupt aging and not
judging people by how old they old,

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:39.180
but giving the opportunity to see
the value that you bring back.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.630
So we're excited about the book.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.880
I'm delighted to be here
at back at the Library.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.640
I told David when we
left the office;

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.360
let's go home, back
over the Library.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.750
And everybody at AARP went ahhhh.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.910
But it's an exciting time for
all of us as we think about aging

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.070
and thinking about
the possibilities.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:03.560 position:56%
I know that one of the unique things
about the work that we do at AARP

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.540
and the Library of
Congress is that both

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.490
of us have very similar
kinds of work places.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.570
People work at AARP and
at the Library of Congress

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.100
because they believe
and love the mission.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.990
It is also one of the places
that I know that when I was here

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:23.200 position:56%
at the Library, the majority of the
employees were over the age of fifty

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.260
and that if you go down and
you talk to Jim Hudson or one

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.500
of those other curators,
they're not thinking

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.040
about leaving this institution

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.890
because they have so
much to give back.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.580
And I think that's what
disrupt aging is all about.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:41.090
How do we create opportunities and
value what people have to give?

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.230
So thank you all for
having me here today.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:47.120
We'll be, I think available
to sign books

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.380
in the Congressional Reading Room.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.680
Am I saying too much?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.980
Are you going to do that?

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.780
So thank you all very much.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:32:05.140
[ Applause ]

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.840
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Jo
Ann thank you so much.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.010
I learned a lot.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.310
I loved that video.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.150
I was feeling a little
verklempt at the end of it.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.710
It was so, so well done.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:19.280
Jo Ann is absolutely right,
we're going to have a reception

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.250
in the back of the room and
then she will be signing books

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.990
in our Congressional
Reading Room next door.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.990
So Jo Ann thank you so much.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:31.420
It was so nice to meet your
colleagues from AARP today

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.530
and thank you all for coming.
