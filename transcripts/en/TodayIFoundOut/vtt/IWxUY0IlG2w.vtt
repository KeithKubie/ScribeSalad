00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.639
The Articles of Confederation - The Constitution
Before the Constitution

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:17.950
For four hot, humid July days, 56 delegates
of the Second Continental Congress gathered

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.390
in Philadelphia with one purpose – to ratify
the Declaration of Independence.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.840
The document, originally drafted by Thomas
Jefferson with the help of Ben Franklin, John

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.020
Adams, Roger Sherman, ad Robert Livingston,
declared that the thirteen American colonies

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.200
were now independent and free of the tyranny
of the British Empire.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.870
On July 4th, with the final wording in place,
it was ready for the whole world to read;

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.620
though, it would be about another month before
congress would actually sign it, contrary

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.960
to popular belief.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.429
With independence now declared and the British
Empire booted as the governing body of the

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.790
colonies, there was an immediate need for
a document that established an American government.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.969
While most people think that the Constitution
was the first such document, this is false.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.040
The Constitution would not be ratified and
established until 1788.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.590
America’s first attempt at a government
was based on a document called “The Articles

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.090
of Confederation.”

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.760
Even before any independence was declared
or any articles were written, leaders of the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.970
colonies knew they were going to need a government
in place immediately.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.120
Ben Franklin several times proposed documents
establishing “intercolonial collaboration,”

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.320
including during the Albany Congress in 1754.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.900
Out of fear of a centralized government due
to their experience with the British Empire,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.210
colony leaders shot this proposal down.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.570
The suspicion of a centralized government
became a theme in the Articles of Confederation

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.390
that eventually led to its downfall and it’s
replacement by the Constitution as the new

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.990
nation’s governing document.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.320
On July 12, 1776, a mere eight days after
the adoption of the Declaration of Independence,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.620
a committee led by John Dickinson (former
President of both Delaware and Pennsylvania)

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.310
submitted a draft of the Articles of Confederation.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.460
Despite the need for speed, the Continental
Congress took over a year to debate, rewrite,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.030
and fight over what should be in the document.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.319
Many in the Congress feared centralized government
and having too much influence in the hands

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.400
of too few.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.959
The power of each individual state become
a hot button issue, plus how votes should

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.220
be divided amongst the states.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.590
Many argued that states with larger populations
(or ones that had given the most money to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.310
the national treasury) should have more votes,
while others wished that each state be given

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.049
one equal vote, no matter the size.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.629
After settling on these issues, the final
draft of Articles of Confederation was ready

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.650
for ratification on November 15, 1777.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.549
It would not be completely ratified until
1781 (with Maryland finally signing off on

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.940
it on February 22nd), but was used as the
de facto system of government beginning in

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.730
late 1777.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.889
The Articles of Confederation asked each state
to “enter into a firm league of friendship

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.270
with each other, for their common defense,
the security of their liberties, and their

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.939
mutual and general welfare,” but it was
different from the Constitution in a few significant

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:07.939
ways.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:14.049
Under the AOC, the national government consisted
of only a one-house (unicameral) legislative

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.049
branch.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.599
There were no executive (President) or judicial
(Supreme Court) branches.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.239
Delegates to Congress were appointed by state
legislatures, not voted upon by the public.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.249
Each state had only one vote, appeasing smaller
states who feared that bigger states would

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.029
hold more power in the newly formed country.

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:35.079
Most significantly, though, any power that
was not specifically granted in the Articles

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.950
of Congress, was left to the individual states.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.669
It was no coincidence that slavery was not
mentioned at all in the AOC.

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.769
The law of slavery was left at the discretion
of each individual state.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.159
The articles did allow for Congress to declare
war, deal in foreign policy, print/coin money,

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.799
run the military (though the troops must come
from the states), and negotiate Native American

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:57.799
affairs.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.909
To many citizens of the time, these were the
most important issues that they expected their

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.670
government to deal with, but the lack of a
truly centralized national government began

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.219
to take its toll.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.420
States regularly had conflicts with one another
over commerce, varying business interests,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.100
and matters of state-run militia.There was
no leadership, no one power source, to make

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.070
determinations in these cases.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.560
Civil War amongst the states was a constant
underlying threat.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.740
In addition, Congress did not have the direct
power to tax – the states determined their

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.210
own taxes – thus leaving the new government
broke and its currency nearly worthless.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.229
It all came to head in late 1786 with Shays’
Rebellion, led by American Revolutionary War

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.889
veteran Daniel Shays.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.819
Shays and his followers revolted against the
Massachusetts’ state government because

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.620
they believed that the lack of national control
and the inability to monitor state’s actions

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.110
by the national government was making non-wealthy
citizens go broke.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.940
In May 1787, the Philadelphia Convention gathered
“for the sole and express purpose of revising

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.900
the Articles of Confederation.”

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.550
By 1790, with the help of James Madison, Alexander
Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, and

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.280
others of the original framers, every one
of the original 13 states had signed off and

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.139
ratified the United States Constitution, replacing
the Articles of Confederation as the governing

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.370
document in the United States.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.050
The framers of the Constitution had learned
lessons, both good and bad, from the AOC:

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.850
the need for a centralized and empowered national
government, taxing as a source of income for

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.500
the country, a checks and balances system,
and the ability to create a document that

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.100
could be amendable and changed as time necessitated
it.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.199
For all it’s flaws, the Articles of Confederation
gave the framers of the Constitution a blueprint

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:55.290
to get it right the next time.
