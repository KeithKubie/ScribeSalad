so there be themes having to do with

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119
so there be themes having to do with

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
political social economic history
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.029
political social economic history
in the 20th century in britain and the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
in the 20th century in britain and the
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.100
in the 20th century in britain and the
idea is that moving images have played a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
idea is that moving images have played a
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.160
idea is that moving images have played a
key role in those kinds of histories and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
key role in those kinds of histories and
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.110
key role in those kinds of histories and
that different moving images often give

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
that different moving images often give
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.690
that different moving images often give
a different viewpoint and our plan is to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
a different viewpoint and our plan is to
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.370
a different viewpoint and our plan is to
actually juxtapose those different

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380
actually juxtapose those different
 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.560
actually juxtapose those different
moving images online and give people a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570
moving images online and give people a
 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.660
moving images online and give people a
chance to actually look at the different

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
chance to actually look at the different
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.020
chance to actually look at the different
ways a particular event or idea was

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
ways a particular event or idea was
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.630
ways a particular event or idea was
expressed through moving images we're

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
expressed through moving images we're
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.220
expressed through moving images we're
really excited about this project and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
really excited about this project and
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.960
