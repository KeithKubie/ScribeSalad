00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.439
butcher and today in our special episode
of Android design in action I feel like

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449
of Android design in action I feel like
 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.540
of Android design in action I feel like
I say special episode every week but

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
I say special episode every week but
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.609
I say special episode every week but
because it is a special episode yeah I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
because it is a special episode yeah I
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.990
because it is a special episode yeah I
guess but this week it's actually a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
guess but this week it's actually a

special a very special episode we're
gonna be talking about what's new in

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
gonna be talking about what's new in
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.290
gonna be talking about what's new in
Android 4.4 KitKat which was just

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
Android 4.4 KitKat which was just
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.450
Android 4.4 KitKat which was just
recently announced we're going to talk

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
recently announced we're going to talk
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520
recently announced we're going to talk
through a couple of specific changes a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
through a couple of specific changes a
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.639
through a couple of specific changes a
couple of new design guidelines updates

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649
couple of new design guidelines updates
 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.930
couple of new design guidelines updates
that all designers should be aware of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
that all designers should be aware of
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.520
that all designers should be aware of
when planning for Android 4.4 KitKat so

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
when planning for Android 4.4 KitKat so
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440
when planning for Android 4.4 KitKat so
without further ado let's jump into the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
without further ado let's jump into the
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.549
without further ado let's jump into the
content okay so the very first thing

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
content okay so the very first thing
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.959
content okay so the very first thing
that we should probably talk about is

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
that we should probably talk about is
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.580
that we should probably talk about is
the new Nexus 5 as with every platform

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
the new Nexus 5 as with every platform
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.889
the new Nexus 5 as with every platform
release for Android there's usually a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
release for Android there's usually a
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.950
release for Android there's usually a
lead device as we call it I guess that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
lead device as we call it I guess that
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.450
lead device as we call it I guess that
comes out and it's kind of the the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
comes out and it's kind of the the
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.070
comes out and it's kind of the the
showcase device for that platform

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
showcase device for that platform
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.240
showcase device for that platform
release I think for Android 4.2 it was

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
release I think for Android 4.2 it was
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.190
release I think for Android 4.2 it was
the lows of the Nexus 4 the Nexus 10 I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
the lows of the Nexus 4 the Nexus 10 I
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.149
the lows of the Nexus 4 the Nexus 10 I
forget already

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
forget already
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.940
forget already
and then for Android 4.3 is a new the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
and then for Android 4.3 is a new the
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.600
and then for Android 4.3 is a new the
Nexus 7 2013 edition but anyway so for

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
Nexus 7 2013 edition but anyway so for
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.580
Nexus 7 2013 edition but anyway so for
Android 4.4

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
Android 4.4
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.980
Android 4.4
it's the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 5 as you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
it's the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 5 as you
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.320
it's the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 5 as you
might imagine is about a 5-inch device I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
might imagine is about a 5-inch device I
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.510
might imagine is about a 5-inch device I
think it's something like 4.95 inches

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
think it's something like 4.95 inches
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149
think it's something like 4.95 inches
diagonally but here are some of the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
diagonally but here are some of the
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.499
diagonally but here are some of the
interesting characteristics that you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
interesting characteristics that you
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960
interesting characteristics that you
don't really get from the spec sheet if

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
don't really get from the spec sheet if
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.179
don't really get from the spec sheet if
you will these are characteristics that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
you will these are characteristics that
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.460
you will these are characteristics that
are very important for designers so the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
are very important for designers so the
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.770
are very important for designers so the
first is that as seen at five inches so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
first is that as seen at five inches so
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.060
first is that as seen at five inches so
it's a phone it's obviously very

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
it's a phone it's obviously very
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950
it's a phone it's obviously very
obviously a phone not really a tablet at

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
obviously a phone not really a tablet at
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490
obviously a phone not really a tablet at
all but next I think is is a very

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
all but next I think is is a very
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.499
all but next I think is is a very
important point here is the the screen

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
important point here is the the screen
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389
important point here is the the screen
resolution in density-independent pixels

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
resolution in density-independent pixels
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.999
resolution in density-independent pixels
so as most of you know anytime you're

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
so as most of you know anytime you're
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.560
so as most of you know anytime you're
designing layouts or things like that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
designing layouts or things like that
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.999
designing layouts or things like that
you should really be thinking in terms

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
you should really be thinking in terms
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.980
you should really be thinking in terms
of density-independent pixels rather

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
of density-independent pixels rather
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.289
of density-independent pixels rather
than just regular pixel units because

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
than just regular pixel units because
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.209
than just regular pixel units because
that more accurately represents the size

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
that more accurately represents the size
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.190
that more accurately represents the size
of the device which is very important

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
of the device which is very important
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.859
of the device which is very important
obviously for layout purposes so the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
obviously for layout purposes so the
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.369
obviously for layout purposes so the
screen size of the Nexus 5 is 640 by 360

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
screen size of the Nexus 5 is 640 by 360
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.820
screen size of the Nexus 5 is 640 by 360
dips and that's actually the same exact

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
dips and that's actually the same exact
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160
dips and that's actually the same exact
screen size in dips as the Galaxy Nexus

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
screen size in dips as the Galaxy Nexus
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.680
screen size in dips as the Galaxy Nexus
it's a little more narrow than the Nexus

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
it's a little more narrow than the Nexus
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720
it's a little more narrow than the Nexus
4 but that's kind of the screen size

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
4 but that's kind of the screen size
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.520
4 but that's kind of the screen size
there and then the last bit of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
there and then the last bit of
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.400
there and then the last bit of
information here is the logical density

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
information here is the logical density
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.770
information here is the logical density
of the device now the the screen itself

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
of the device now the the screen itself
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.920
of the device now the the screen itself
is about 440 points per inch or dots per

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930
is about 440 points per inch or dots per
 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.620
is about 440 points per inch or dots per
inch but the logical density as you guys

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630
inch but the logical density as you guys
 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.110
inch but the logical density as you guys
probably know you know we actually use

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
probably know you know we actually use
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.870
probably know you know we actually use
density buckets the logical density of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880
density buckets the logical density of
 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.810
density buckets the logical density of
the device is xxhdpi or 480 dpi so if

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820
the device is xxhdpi or 480 dpi so if
 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.790
the device is xxhdpi or 480 dpi so if
you're creating assets now if you're

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800
you're creating assets now if you're
 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.040
you're creating assets now if you're
creating assets for you know for your

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050
creating assets for you know for your
 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.000
creating assets for you know for your
apps

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
apps
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.340
apps
you should definitely start thinking

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350
you should definitely start thinking
 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.360
you should definitely start thinking
about and actually if you haven't

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370
about and actually if you haven't
 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.290
about and actually if you haven't
already been thinking about it because

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300
already been thinking about it because
 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.750
already been thinking about it because
of other devices like the galaxy s4 or

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
of other devices like the galaxy s4 or
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.830
of other devices like the galaxy s4 or
the HTC One

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
the HTC One
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.940
the HTC One
you should definitely start thinking

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
you should definitely start thinking
 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.640
you should definitely start thinking
about xxhdpi as kind of the highest

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650
about xxhdpi as kind of the highest
 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.060
about xxhdpi as kind of the highest
density assets so before we move on

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070
density assets so before we move on
 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.350
density assets so before we move on
anything else you guys want to say about

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
anything else you guys want to say about
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.500
anything else you guys want to say about
the Nexus 5 no really

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510
the Nexus 5 no really
 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.050
the Nexus 5 no really
it's a it's a great device yeah I'm just

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
it's a it's a great device yeah I'm just
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.750
it's a it's a great device yeah I'm just
discreet incredibly quick yeah it's it's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
discreet incredibly quick yeah it's it's
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.120
discreet incredibly quick yeah it's it's
pretty amazing reading text on the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130
pretty amazing reading text on the
 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.580
pretty amazing reading text on the
screen is just is a really really great

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
screen is just is a really really great
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.920
screen is just is a really really great
experience it's a it's beautiful here's

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930
experience it's a it's beautiful here's
 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.570
experience it's a it's beautiful here's
the Nexus we have a couple of Nexus 5's

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580
the Nexus we have a couple of Nexus 5's
 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.009
the Nexus we have a couple of Nexus 5's
but here it is I'm sure you guys will

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019
but here it is I'm sure you guys will
 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.350
but here it is I'm sure you guys will
see it in stores and all that whatever

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360
see it in stores and all that whatever
 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.460
see it in stores and all that whatever
anyway let's move on to branding Nick do

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
anyway let's move on to branding Nick do
 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.390
anyway let's move on to branding Nick do
you want to talk about brainy yeah

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400
you want to talk about brainy yeah
 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.660
you want to talk about brainy yeah
absolutely so one of the changes in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670
absolutely so one of the changes in
 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.509

reason but one of the things that we
should probably mention is that there's

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.089
should probably mention is that there's
a new section in the design guide called

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099
a new section in the design guide called
 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.339
a new section in the design guide called
the your branding section I think it's

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349

yeah so basically anytime you have to
 

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.970
yeah so basically anytime you have to
actually back in your app try to avoid

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980
actually back in your app try to avoid
 

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.660
actually back in your app try to avoid
the stock default blue and actually the

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:05.670
the stock default blue and actually the
 

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.180
the stock default blue and actually the
the default blue if your developers out

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:08.190
the default blue if your developers out
 

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.620
the default blue if your developers out
there if you just use selectable item

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:09.630
there if you just use selectable item

background that is no longer blue it's

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820
background that is no longer blue it's
 

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.180
background that is no longer blue it's
actually kind of like a light gray at

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:14.190
actually kind of like a light gray at
 

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.400
actually kind of like a light gray at
about ten or twenty percent opacity but

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:16.410
about ten or twenty percent opacity but
 

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.509
about ten or twenty percent opacity but
the idea is that it should be more

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519
the idea is that it should be more
 

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.009
the idea is that it should be more
subtle and anytime you have touched

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019
subtle and anytime you have touched
 

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:20.689
subtle and anytime you have touched
feedback or basically any widget in your

feedback or basically any widget in your
 

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:23.120
feedback or basically any widget in your
app make sure that it's not using you

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.130

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.750
how you should present fullscreen
you eyes to your users so there's two

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760
you eyes to your users so there's two
 

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.150
you eyes to your users so there's two
modes - I guess approaches that they

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160
modes - I guess approaches that they
 

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.340
modes - I guess approaches that they
talk about and the they're called lean

00:10:59.340 --> 00:10:59.350
talk about and the they're called lean
 

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.490

it's this is called lean back because

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:33.640
it's this is called lean back because
 

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.040
it's this is called lean back because
generally if you're watching a video

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.050
generally if you're watching a video
 

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.600
generally if you're watching a video
you're not really interacting with the

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:36.610
you're not really interacting with the
 

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.520
you're not really interacting with the
screen right you're not like doing stuff

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:38.530
screen right you're not like doing stuff
 

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.110
screen right you're not like doing stuff
in the middle of the screen you're just

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120
in the middle of the screen you're just
 

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.610
in the middle of the screen you're just
sitting back and watching the video and

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:41.620
sitting back and watching the video and
 

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.940
sitting back and watching the video and
so as soon as you touch the screen you

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:44.950
so as soon as you touch the screen you
 

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.190
so as soon as you touch the screen you
know the thing the bars appear that

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200
know the thing the bars appear that
 

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.920
know the thing the bars appear that
basically you know prevents the app from

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:49.930
basically you know prevents the app from
 

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.160
basically you know prevents the app from
doing anything else on the screen now or

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.170
doing anything else on the screen now or
 

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.470
doing anything else on the screen now or
I guess using the or interacting yes

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480
I guess using the or interacting yes
 

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.430
I guess using the or interacting yes
exactly

00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440
exactly
 

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.620
exactly
with immersive mode this is something

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:01.630
with immersive mode this is something
 

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.600
with immersive mode this is something
that's new in android 4.4 kitkat an

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:03.610
that's new in android 4.4 kitkat an
 

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.270
that's new in android 4.4 kitkat an
immersive mode basically again hides the

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:06.280
immersive mode basically again hides the
 

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.030
immersive mode basically again hides the
bars but it also allows the user to

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040
bars but it also allows the user to
 

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.620
bars but it also allows the user to
interact with the middle of the screen

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:10.630
interact with the middle of the screen
 

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.480
interact with the middle of the screen
and immersive mode is more suitable for

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:12.490
and immersive mode is more suitable for
 

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.740
and immersive mode is more suitable for
things like games where you actually

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:13.750
things like games where you actually
 

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.750
things like games where you actually
need to interact with the screen or book

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760
need to interact with the screen or book
 

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.130
need to interact with the screen or book
readers where you're kind of flipping

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.140
readers where you're kind of flipping
 

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.460
readers where you're kind of flipping
between pages now the the reason that

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:20.470
between pages now the the reason that
 

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.760
between pages now the the reason that
the Leanback mode as soon as you touch

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:23.770
the Leanback mode as soon as you touch
 

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.320
the Leanback mode as soon as you touch
the screen you know it shows the bars

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:25.330
the screen you know it shows the bars
 

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.060
the screen you know it shows the bars
the reason for that is really because

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:27.070
the reason for that is really because
 

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.760
the reason for that is really because
you know those those bars are critical

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:29.770
you know those those bars are critical
 

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.410
you know those those bars are critical
you know not having access or losing

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:31.420
you know not having access or losing
 

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.440
you know not having access or losing
access to back home or recent it can

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:34.450
access to back home or recent it can
 

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.420
access to back home or recent it can
fundamentally break your experience or

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:36.430
fundamentally break your experience or
 

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.180
fundamentally break your experience or
your usage of the device and so that's

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:39.190
your usage of the device and so that's
 

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.860
your usage of the device and so that's
why I kind of consumes that first touch

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:40.870
why I kind of consumes that first touch
 

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.330
why I kind of consumes that first touch
and shows them automatically in

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:42.340
and shows them automatically in
 

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.210
and shows them automatically in
immersive mode the way in which a user

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:45.220
immersive mode the way in which a user
 

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.760
immersive mode the way in which a user
can show the bars is by swiping down

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:47.770
can show the bars is by swiping down
 

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.860
can show the bars is by swiping down
from the top of the screen or swiping up

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:49.870
from the top of the screen or swiping up
 

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.930
from the top of the screen or swiping up
from the bottom of the screen and every

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:51.940
from the bottom of the screen and every
 

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.150
from the bottom of the screen and every
time actually I guess we'll we'll look

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160
time actually I guess we'll we'll look
 

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.530
time actually I guess we'll we'll look
at this in a second

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:55.540
at this in a second
 

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.990
at this in a second
anytime you hide the bars in immersive

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000
anytime you hide the bars in immersive
 

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.440
anytime you hide the bars in immersive
mode you basically see this actually no

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:01.450
mode you basically see this actually no
 

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.870
mode you basically see this actually no
not anytime the first time in a single

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880
not anytime the first time in a single
 

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.190
not anytime the first time in a single
in a specific app the

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200
in a specific app the
 

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.290
in a specific app the
hide the bars they'll see this pop-up

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:07.300
hide the bars they'll see this pop-up
 

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.000
hide the bars they'll see this pop-up
overlay type thing and you'll basically

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.010
overlay type thing and you'll basically
 

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.920
overlay type thing and you'll basically
say swipe up or swipe down from the top

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:10.930
say swipe up or swipe down from the top
 

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.770
say swipe up or swipe down from the top
of the screen to show access to to your

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:13.780
of the screen to show access to to your
 

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.540
of the screen to show access to to your
back home in recent and stuff like that

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:15.550
back home in recent and stuff like that
 

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.520
back home in recent and stuff like that
so as soon as you swipe down you'll

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:17.530
so as soon as you swipe down you'll
 

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.590
so as soon as you swipe down you'll
you'll actually you know see your your

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600
you'll actually you know see your your
 

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.920
you'll actually you know see your your
bars again but the idea is that you know

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:22.930
bars again but the idea is that you know
 

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.010
bars again but the idea is that you know
now in this immersive mode you have you

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:26.020
now in this immersive mode you have you
 

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.170
now in this immersive mode you have you
can you know use touch events and

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:28.180
can you know use touch events and
 

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.160
can you know use touch events and
everything all in the middle of the

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.170
everything all in the middle of the
 

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.170
everything all in the middle of the
screen without you know showing the back

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:31.180
screen without you know showing the back
 

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.510
screen without you know showing the back
home in recents and it's really really

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:33.520
home in recents and it's really really
 

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.060
home in recents and it's really really
ideal for things like book readers and

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.070
ideal for things like book readers and
 

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.270
ideal for things like book readers and
games and things like that so we have a

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:39.280
games and things like that so we have a
 

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.850
games and things like that so we have a
full we're not talking into much more

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:41.860
full we're not talking into much more
 

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.390
full we're not talking into much more
detail on this it didn't it yeah yeah I

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:45.400
detail on this it didn't it yeah yeah I
 

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.180
detail on this it didn't it yeah yeah I
guess we could demo it so yeah we could

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.190
guess we could demo it so yeah we could
 

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.920
guess we could demo it so yeah we could
swipe that's not actually gonna work

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:49.930
swipe that's not actually gonna work
 

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.330
swipe that's not actually gonna work
because I think we're we're in a special

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:51.340
because I think we're we're in a special
 

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.140
because I think we're we're in a special
mode in our Nexus 10 but the the point

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.150
mode in our Nexus 10 but the the point
 

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.940
mode in our Nexus 10 but the the point
here is that we have so that this is a

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:56.950
here is that we have so that this is a
 

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.590
here is that we have so that this is a
new mode it's called immersive mode

00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600
new mode it's called immersive mode
 

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.780
new mode it's called immersive mode
we're gonna have a deaf byte released on

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:00.790
we're gonna have a deaf byte released on
 

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.060
we're gonna have a deaf byte released on
this very shortly and the dev byte is

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.070
this very shortly and the dev byte is
 

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.620
this very shortly and the dev byte is
basically gonna explain how you actually

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:04.630
basically gonna explain how you actually
 

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.080
basically gonna explain how you actually
use these api's it's actually very very

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.090
use these api's it's actually very very
 

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.030
use these api's it's actually very very
simple it's not a very complicated API

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040
simple it's not a very complicated API
 

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.400
simple it's not a very complicated API
to use but it's very very powerful so

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.410
to use but it's very very powerful so
 

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.410
to use but it's very very powerful so

padding on those controls so that if you

00:16:33.449 --> 00:16:33.459
padding on those controls so that if you
 

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:36.209

and despite your ever chrome on top of

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519
and despite your ever chrome on top of
 

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:48.359
and despite your ever chrome on top of
the map canvas yeah so I guess my two

00:16:48.359 --> 00:16:48.369
the map canvas yeah so I guess my two
 

00:16:48.369 --> 00:16:48.929
the map canvas yeah so I guess my two
points

00:16:48.929 --> 00:16:48.939
points
 

00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:50.159
points
turn into one point I want to make

00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:50.169
turn into one point I want to make
 

00:16:50.169 --> 00:16:51.329
turn into one point I want to make
because that was one of the points I

00:16:51.329 --> 00:16:51.339
because that was one of the points I
 

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:52.499
because that was one of the points I
want to make one of the points I wanted

00:16:52.499 --> 00:16:52.509
want to make one of the points I wanted
 

00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:54.959
want to make one of the points I wanted
to make was the background there will

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:54.969
to make was the background there will
 

00:16:54.969 --> 00:16:56.069
to make was the background there will
always be like II said there's always

00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079
always be like II said there's always
 

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:58.679
always be like II said there's always
some background protection I think in

00:16:58.679 --> 00:16:58.689
some background protection I think in
 

00:16:58.689 --> 00:17:00.749
some background protection I think in
this in this first iteration I guess

00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759
this in this first iteration I guess
 

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:03.959
this in this first iteration I guess
there will be a gradient so regardless

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:03.969
there will be a gradient so regardless
 

00:17:03.969 --> 00:17:05.519
there will be a gradient so regardless
of what's shown

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:05.529
of what's shown
 

00:17:05.529 --> 00:17:07.379
of what's shown
I guess regardless of what your app UI

00:17:07.379 --> 00:17:07.389
I guess regardless of what your app UI
 

00:17:07.389 --> 00:17:09.269
I guess regardless of what your app UI
is there will always be a gradient a

00:17:09.269 --> 00:17:09.279
is there will always be a gradient a
 

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.100
is there will always be a gradient a
subtle kind of black to transparent

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.110
subtle kind of black to transparent
 

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.980
subtle kind of black to transparent
gradient behind both the status bar and

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:13.990
gradient behind both the status bar and
 

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.079
gradient behind both the status bar and
the navigation bar so just keep that in

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:16.089
the navigation bar so just keep that in
 

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:17.069
the navigation bar so just keep that in
mind when you're if you're designing

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079
mind when you're if you're designing
 

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:21.929
mind when you're if you're designing
kind of screens like this okay and also

00:17:21.929 --> 00:17:21.939
kind of screens like this okay and also
 

00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:23.249
kind of screens like this okay and also
one thing I want to another thing I want

00:17:23.249 --> 00:17:23.259
one thing I want to another thing I want
 

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:24.689
one thing I want to another thing I want
to mention is we don't really have

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:24.699
to mention is we don't really have
 

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:26.220

guidance on exactly how you should use

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:26.230
guidance on exactly how you should use
 

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.109
guidance on exactly how you should use
this yet so this is still kind of I'd

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:28.119
this yet so this is still kind of I'd
 

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.629
this yet so this is still kind of I'd
say in an exploratory phase one of the

00:17:30.629 --> 00:17:30.639
say in an exploratory phase one of the
 

00:17:30.639 --> 00:17:31.110
say in an exploratory phase one of the
thing

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:33.750
that I know that one of the engineers
mentioned was that you should try to

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760
mentioned was that you should try to
 

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.450
mentioned was that you should try to
avoid using action bars in this case I

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:36.460
avoid using action bars in this case I
 

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.890
avoid using action bars in this case I
think that this is this translucent bars

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900
think that this is this translucent bars
 

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.240
think that this is this translucent bars
type of UI is really designed for more

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:42.250
type of UI is really designed for more
 

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.370
type of UI is really designed for more
for like wallpapers or or kind of

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:44.380
for like wallpapers or or kind of
 

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.070
for like wallpapers or or kind of
wallpaper type apps apps that really go

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080
wallpaper type apps apps that really go
 

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.100
wallpaper type apps apps that really go
full bleed with the content so it's not

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.110
full bleed with the content so it's not
 

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.950
full bleed with the content so it's not
really quite clear exactly how how you

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960
really quite clear exactly how how you
 

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.110
really quite clear exactly how how you
should use this yet with other UI chrome

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120
should use this yet with other UI chrome
 

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.000
should use this yet with other UI chrome
but W this is just one of our early

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.010
but W this is just one of our early
 

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.330
but W this is just one of our early
explorations all right let's move on to

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:00.340
explorations all right let's move on to
 

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.850
explorations all right let's move on to
launch right guys

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860
launch right guys
 

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.820
launch right guys
all right so for Launcher icons

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:04.830
all right so for Launcher icons
 

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.870
all right so for Launcher icons
hopefully already aware they're normally

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880
hopefully already aware they're normally
 

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.130
hopefully already aware they're normally
shown at 48 dips square of 48 dips now

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:11.140
shown at 48 dips square of 48 dips now
 

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.480
shown at 48 dips square of 48 dips now
on Nexus 5

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.490
on Nexus 5
 

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.370
on Nexus 5
due to the new launcher they're actually

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:14.380
due to the new launcher they're actually
 

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.270
due to the new launcher they're actually
showing larger actually about 25% larger

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280
showing larger actually about 25% larger
 

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.990
showing larger actually about 25% larger
60 dips and then because Nexus 5 is an

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000
60 dips and then because Nexus 5 is an
 

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.400
60 dips and then because Nexus 5 is an
xxhdpi device essentially in order for

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:26.410
xxhdpi device essentially in order for
 

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.380
xxhdpi device essentially in order for
the icons to show it that Crispus you

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:28.390
the icons to show it that Crispus you
 

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.790
the icons to show it that Crispus you
really need to include an X X X HT VI or

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:32.800
really need to include an X X X HT VI or
 

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.419
really need to include an X X X HT VI or
640 dpi icon yes we really just said

00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:36.429
640 dpi icon yes we really just said
 

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:40.770
640 dpi icon yes we really just said
that so so the actual pixel their pixel

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:40.780
that so so the actual pixel their pixel
 

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.250
that so so the actual pixel their pixel
size of that icon is is 192 pixels and

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:44.260
size of that icon is is 192 pixels and
 

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.130
size of that icon is is 192 pixels and
this is somewhat similar to how tablets

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.140
this is somewhat similar to how tablets
 

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.870
this is somewhat similar to how tablets
behave previously with their launcher

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880
behave previously with their launcher
 

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.940
behave previously with their launcher
they would actually show the icons

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:50.950
they would actually show the icons
 

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.680
they would actually show the icons
slightly larger and so it needed to sort

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:52.690
slightly larger and so it needed to sort
 

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.930
slightly larger and so it needed to sort
of dip into the the density bucket

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:54.940
of dip into the the density bucket
 

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.180
of dip into the the density bucket
that's one larger than the density of

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.190
that's one larger than the density of
 

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.660
that's one larger than the density of
the actual device and so I guess our

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:00.670
the actual device and so I guess our
 

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.360
the actual device and so I guess our
guidance here is you know - the icon is

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:03.370
guidance here is you know - the icon is
 

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.160
guidance here is you know - the icon is
just so important it's such an important

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.170
just so important it's such an important
 

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.540
just so important it's such an important
part of your application you should

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:06.550
part of your application you should
 

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.910
part of your application you should
really be including an asset that makes

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:08.920
really be including an asset that makes
 

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.610
really be including an asset that makes
it look its best on all devices and all

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:11.620
it look its best on all devices and all
 

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.590
it look its best on all devices and all
screen sizes and so that means in this

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600
screen sizes and so that means in this
 

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.290
screen sizes and so that means in this
case you need to provide xxx HTTP eye

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:16.300
case you need to provide xxx HTTP eye
 

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.049
case you need to provide xxx HTTP eye
icon for the launcher icon and so right

00:19:19.049 --> 00:19:19.059
icon for the launcher icon and so right
 

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:21.060
icon for the launcher icon and so right
now this applies to Nexus 5 since Nexus

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.070
now this applies to Nexus 5 since Nexus
 

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.310
now this applies to Nexus 5 since Nexus
5 has the this new kind of launcher

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320
5 has the this new kind of launcher
 

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.930
5 has the this new kind of launcher
buuuut imagine that other devices in the

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:24.940
buuuut imagine that other devices in the
 

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.730
buuuut imagine that other devices in the
future would potentially do something

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:26.740
future would potentially do something
 

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.860
future would potentially do something
like this so basically you know just

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:28.870
like this so basically you know just
 

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.450
like this so basically you know just
kind of get ahead of the game start

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:30.460
kind of get ahead of the game start
 

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.290
kind of get ahead of the game start
including the these 640 dpi icons and

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:34.300
including the these 640 dpi icons and
 

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.470
including the these 640 dpi icons and
also I mean just just to kind of I guess

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480
also I mean just just to kind of I guess
 

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.960
also I mean just just to kind of I guess
talk about how how this works with you

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:39.970
talk about how how this works with you
 

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.970
talk about how how this works with you
know tablets right if there was an X X

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:41.980
know tablets right if there was an X X
 

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.840

be i tablet then you'd have to do this

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:44.590
be i tablet then you'd have to do this
 

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.350
be i tablet then you'd have to do this
anyway it just happens to be that you

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360
anyway it just happens to be that you
 

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.690
anyway it just happens to be that you
know there's an xxhdpi phone that's now

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:48.700
know there's an xxhdpi phone that's now
 

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.050
know there's an xxhdpi phone that's now
using this this tablet scaling behavior

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:52.060
using this this tablet scaling behavior
 

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.830
using this this tablet scaling behavior
for Launcher icons okay let's let's move

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840
for Launcher icons okay let's let's move
 

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.800
for Launcher icons okay let's let's move
on to new gestures so these aren't

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:58.810
on to new gestures so these aren't
 

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.290
on to new gestures so these aren't
exactly I guess new gestures but we're

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:01.300
exactly I guess new gestures but we're
 

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.050
exactly I guess new gestures but we're
kind of formalizing two new gestures in

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:04.060
kind of formalizing two new gestures in
 

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.970
kind of formalizing two new gestures in
our design guidelines so if you've got a

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:05.980
our design guidelines so if you've got a
 

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.440
our design guidelines so if you've got a
developer that answered that comm slash

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:07.450
developer that answered that comm slash
 

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.360
developer that answered that comm slash
design I think it's on their patterns

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:09.370
design I think it's on their patterns
 

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.080
design I think it's on their patterns
gestures I forgot but you'll see two new

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.090
gestures I forgot but you'll see two new
 

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.720
gestures I forgot but you'll see two new
gestures the first is an expansion of

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:15.730
gestures the first is an expansion of
 

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.390
gestures the first is an expansion of
double touch and the second is I guess

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400
double touch and the second is I guess
 

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.790
double touch and the second is I guess
double touch to drag so the expansion on

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:20.800
double touch to drag so the expansion on
 

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.230
double touch to drag so the expansion on
double touch basically says if you're

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240
double touch basically says if you're
 

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.970
double touch basically says if you're
looking at a photo right I mean or

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:23.980
looking at a photo right I mean or
 

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.620
looking at a photo right I mean or
something that's that's just zoomable

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:25.630
something that's that's just zoomable
 

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.840
something that's that's just zoomable
double touch should zoom it in if you're

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:27.850
double touch should zoom it in if you're
 

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.730
double touch should zoom it in if you're
in something like Google Chrome I like

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:29.740
in something like Google Chrome I like
 

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.740
in something like Google Chrome I like
that right exactly if you're in

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:31.750
that right exactly if you're in
 

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.180
that right exactly if you're in
something like Google Chrome or

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.190
something like Google Chrome or
 

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.850
something like Google Chrome or
something else that has kind of bits and

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:35.860
something else that has kind of bits and
 

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.400
something else that has kind of bits and
pieces of information laid out and you

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:38.410
pieces of information laid out and you
 

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.600
pieces of information laid out and you
want to double touch on one of those

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:39.610
want to double touch on one of those
 

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.910
want to double touch on one of those
bits and pieces of information basically

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:41.920
bits and pieces of information basically
 

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.050
bits and pieces of information basically
what this is saying is that you should

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:43.060
what this is saying is that you should
 

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.530
what this is saying is that you should
zoom in to to that content so if you're

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:46.540
zoom in to to that content so if you're
 

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.140
zoom in to to that content so if you're
in chrome and you're you double touch on

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.150
in chrome and you're you double touch on
 

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.720
in chrome and you're you double touch on
a column of text on a web page it'll

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:51.730
a column of text on a web page it'll
 

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.180
a column of text on a web page it'll
actually zoom to fit that come you know

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:54.190
actually zoom to fit that come you know
 

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.120
actually zoom to fit that come you know
of text so this basically says if you

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.130
of text so this basically says if you
 

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.860
of text so this basically says if you
have any other types of or if you're

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:58.870
have any other types of or if you're
 

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.870
have any other types of or if you're
building an app that is similar in terms

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880
building an app that is similar in terms
 

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.460
building an app that is similar in terms
of what continent presents and the

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:02.470
of what continent presents and the
 

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.020
of what continent presents and the
layout in which it presents that content

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.030
layout in which it presents that content
 

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.450
layout in which it presents that content
this is something you should do so this

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:06.460
this is something you should do so this
 

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.040
this is something you should do so this
may apply to things like magazines or

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.050
may apply to things like magazines or
 

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.920
may apply to things like magazines or
books or things event the second and

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:10.930
books or things event the second and
 

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.870
books or things event the second and
this is a little more universally

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880
this is a little more universally
 

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.360
this is a little more universally
applicable I'd say is anytime you have

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.370
applicable I'd say is anytime you have
 

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.950
applicable I'd say is anytime you have
double touch you know double touch to

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960
double touch you know double touch to
 

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.610
double touch you know double touch to
zoom if you double touch and then drag

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:20.620
zoom if you double touch and then drag
 

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.980
zoom if you double touch and then drag
up or down with that same finger so it's

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:22.990
up or down with that same finger so it's
 

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.290
up or down with that same finger so it's
kind of like you know touch touch drag

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:25.300
kind of like you know touch touch drag
 

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.230
kind of like you know touch touch drag
up and down that should basically also

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240
up and down that should basically also
 

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.870
up and down that should basically also
be a zoom so rather than zooming in by

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880
be a zoom so rather than zooming in by
 

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.510
be a zoom so rather than zooming in by
fixed amount say you know 50 or a 2x or

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520
fixed amount say you know 50 or a 2x or
 

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.880
fixed amount say you know 50 or a 2x or
whatever it is double touch and drag up

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:35.890
whatever it is double touch and drag up
 

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.230
whatever it is double touch and drag up
and down it's kind of like a dynamic

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240
and down it's kind of like a dynamic
 

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.110
and down it's kind of like a dynamic
zoom so I think if you drag I forgot if

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.120
zoom so I think if you drag I forgot if
 

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.360
zoom so I think if you drag I forgot if
it's dragged up it's it's zoom in or

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:42.370
it's dragged up it's it's zoom in or
 

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.460
it's dragged up it's it's zoom in or
zoom out but an example of this is

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:44.470
zoom out but an example of this is
 

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.320
zoom out but an example of this is
Google Maps so if you open up Google

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:46.330
Google Maps so if you open up Google
 

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.580
Google Maps so if you open up Google
Maps right now and this has been around

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:47.590
Maps right now and this has been around
 

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.340
Maps right now and this has been around
for for quite some time if you open up

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:50.350
for for quite some time if you open up
 

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.440
for for quite some time if you open up
Google Maps right now double touch drag

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:52.450
Google Maps right now double touch drag
 

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.980
Google Maps right now double touch drag
up and down

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:52.990
up and down
 

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.610
up and down
I think up will zoom in

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620
I think up will zoom in
 

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.620
I think up will zoom in
it's in Chrome as well and it's a great

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:57.630
it's in Chrome as well and it's a great
 

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.700
it's in Chrome as well and it's a great
way because you can do it

00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:58.710
way because you can do it
 

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.560
way because you can do it
similar to a kind of like a pinching

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:00.570
similar to a kind of like a pinching
 

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.120
similar to a kind of like a pinching
gesture but you can do it one-handed

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.130
gesture but you can do it one-handed
 

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.310
gesture but you can do it one-handed
so it's great yeah so yeah that's that's

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320
so it's great yeah so yeah that's that's
 

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.320
so it's great yeah so yeah that's that's
actually how I discovered it i was i was

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:06.330
actually how I discovered it i was i was
 

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.240
actually how I discovered it i was i was
using maps with one hand and i was

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:08.250
using maps with one hand and i was
 

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.980
using maps with one hand and i was
double touching a lot and then i

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:09.990
double touching a lot and then i
 

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.300
double touching a lot and then i
accidentally stumbled upon and i was

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:11.310
accidentally stumbled upon and i was
 

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.590
accidentally stumbled upon and i was
like oh my god this is the best thing

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600
like oh my god this is the best thing
 

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.940
like oh my god this is the best thing
ever but yeah if you're building

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:13.950
ever but yeah if you're building
 

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.260
ever but yeah if you're building
something like this then then i

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:15.270
something like this then then i
 

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.690
something like this then then i
definitely use this i will say that we

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700
definitely use this i will say that we
 

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.340
definitely use this i will say that we
don't have sample code available just

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:19.350
don't have sample code available just
 

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.680
don't have sample code available just
yet but i'll probably do an update to

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:21.690
yet but i'll probably do an update to
 

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.950
yet but i'll probably do an update to
our gestures training class for this at

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960
our gestures training class for this at
 

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.400
our gestures training class for this at
some point

some point
 

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.710
some point
no gesture detector NIST's what

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720
no gesture detector NIST's what

excellent even better there you go

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:30.630
excellent even better there you go
 

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.600
excellent even better there you go
you've written the code for you awesome

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:32.610
you've written the code for you awesome
 

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.430
you've written the code for you awesome
awesome so my change to the training

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440
awesome so my change to the training
 

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.410
awesome so my change to the training
class will be like one line of code or

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:36.420
class will be like one line of code or
 

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.410
class will be like one line of code or
something that awesome okay let's move

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:39.420
something that awesome okay let's move
 

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.970
something that awesome okay let's move
on to screen recording so this is just a

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980
on to screen recording so this is just a
 

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.310

you know not nothing to change the way

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320
you know not nothing to change the way
 

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.750
you know not nothing to change the way
you have to design your applications but

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760
you have to design your applications but
 

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.430
you have to design your applications but
we've made it a lot easier to capture

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440
we've made it a lot easier to capture
 

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.170
we've made it a lot easier to capture
video from the device so I think in

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:51.180
video from the device so I think in
 

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.480
video from the device so I think in
previous shows we've moved talked about

system feature in android 4.4 called
 

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.630
system feature in android 4.4 called
screen recording will let you do this

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640
screen recording will let you do this
 

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.300
screen recording will let you do this
via a simple and command so there's no

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:11.310

this is kind of like a developer feature

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:14.610
this is kind of like a developer feature
 

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.880
this is kind of like a developer feature
and for producing these videos ahead of

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:16.890
and for producing these videos ahead of
 

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.740

feature as it were and so you simply

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:21.450
feature as it were and so you simply
 

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.330
feature as it were and so you simply
execute this command written on screen

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340
execute this command written on screen
 

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.020
execute this command written on screen
and this will record a 15-second up to

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.030
and this will record a 15-second up to
 

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.870
and this will record a 15-second up to
15 seconds of video in kind of them in

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880
15 seconds of video in kind of them in
 

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.220
15 seconds of video in kind of them in
full high-definition the full power

full high-definition the full power
screen resolution and and then you can

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:33.570
screen resolution and and then you can
 

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.590
screen resolution and and then you can
just pull the UVA to be pool commands in

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600
just pull the UVA to be pool commands in
 

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.900
just pull the UVA to be pool commands in
order to kind of get that video file off

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:38.910
order to kind of get that video file off
 

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.060
order to kind of get that video file off
of the device and onto your computer so

a really easy way to record kind of

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620
a really easy way to record kind of
 

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.800
a really easy way to record kind of
product videos as a little pro tip if

you enable if you go into the settings

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.090
you enable if you go into the settings
 

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.690
you enable if you go into the settings
and then developer settings section and

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700
and then developer settings section and
 

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.820
and then developer settings section and
enable show touches as we have on this

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:52.830
enable show touches as we have on this

tablet here you get these kind of like

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:54.330
tablet here you get these kind of like
 

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.170
tablet here you get these kind of like
white circles and which goes really well

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:57.180
white circles and which goes really well
 

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.910
white circles and which goes really well
with it and doing a screen recording so

00:23:58.910 --> 00:23:58.920
with it and doing a screen recording so
 

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.470
with it and doing a screen recording so
you can produce high-quality photo

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480
you can produce high-quality photo
 

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.150
you can produce high-quality photo
videos without having fingers in the way

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:02.160
videos without having fingers in the way
 

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.470
videos without having fingers in the way
and so forth

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480
and so forth
 

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.270
and so forth
I also think we of did it to three

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280
I also think we of did it to three
 

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.190
I also think we of did it to three
minutes or is it still 15 seconds I

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200
minutes or is it still 15 seconds I
 

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200
minutes or is it still 15 seconds I
think at some point we

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:08.210
think at some point we
 

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.240
think at some point we
I made a change to make it three minutes

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.250
I made a change to make it three minutes
 

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.950
I made a change to make it three minutes
but it's either three minutes or 15

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960
but it's either three minutes or 15
 

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.290
but it's either three minutes or 15
seconds what other thing we should I

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:14.300
seconds what other thing we should I
 

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.690
seconds what other thing we should I
guess one of the things we should we

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:16.700
guess one of the things we should we
 

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.760
guess one of the things we should we
should mention is that what we're doing

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:18.770
should mention is that what we're doing
 

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.710
should mention is that what we're doing
right here with our with our own setup

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720
right here with our with our own setup
 

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.330
right here with our with our own setup
here we're not using screen record

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:22.340
here we're not using screen record
 

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.770
here we're not using screen record
against screen record is not meant for

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:23.780
against screen record is not meant for
 

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.160
against screen record is not meant for
live screencasting it's really for for

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:27.170
live screencasting it's really for for
 

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.170
live screencasting it's really for for
recording video and then you know

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:29.180
recording video and then you know
 

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.940
recording video and then you know
post-processing are things like that so

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:30.950
post-processing are things like that so
 

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.020
post-processing are things like that so
it's really good for like things like

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:32.030
it's really good for like things like
 

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.550
it's really good for like things like
your promotional video and Google Play

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:33.560
your promotional video and Google Play
 

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.370
your promotional video and Google Play
if you want to show a video of your app

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:36.380
if you want to show a video of your app
 

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.190
if you want to show a video of your app
in use this will make it tons tons

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200
in use this will make it tons tons
 

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.060
in use this will make it tons tons
easier alright last but not least scenes

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:43.070
easier alright last but not least scenes
 

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.830
easier alright last but not least scenes
in transition yes those things in

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840
in transition yes those things in
 

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.530
in transition yes those things in
transitions so the animation framework

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:47.540
transitions so the animation framework
 

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.410
transitions so the animation framework
in Android gets some fantastic new

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:50.420
in Android gets some fantastic new
 

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.350
in Android gets some fantastic new
additions in Android 4.4 and we're

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360
additions in Android 4.4 and we're
 

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.990
additions in Android 4.4 and we're
calling them scenes and transitions so

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000
calling them scenes and transitions so
 

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.730
calling them scenes and transitions so
there's sort of two parts of this the

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:57.740
there's sort of two parts of this the
 

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.830
there's sort of two parts of this the
first is a where you can essentially

00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840
first is a where you can essentially
 

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.000
first is a where you can essentially
define scenes within your UI this is

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.010
define scenes within your UI this is
 

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.070
define scenes within your UI this is
sort of two different UI States for a

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080
sort of two different UI States for a
 

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.410
sort of two different UI States for a
particular screen and then you can have

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:08.420
particular screen and then you can have
 

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.000
particular screen and then you can have
the system actually calculate the

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.010
the system actually calculate the
 

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.310
the system actually calculate the
animation to get from the first scene to

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320
animation to get from the first scene to
 

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.710
animation to get from the first scene to
the second scene so this is a it's a

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720
the second scene so this is a it's a
 

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.130
the second scene so this is a it's a
really neat addition and the second part

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:18.140
really neat addition and the second part
 

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.110
really neat addition and the second part
to this is you can actually go and

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120
to this is you can actually go and
 

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.260
to this is you can actually go and
modify a particular view group so this

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:23.270
modify a particular view group so this
 

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.760
modify a particular view group so this
is sort of talking on the developer side

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:24.770
is sort of talking on the developer side
 

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.070
is sort of talking on the developer side
a view group is a collection of views

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080
a view group is a collection of views
 

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.800
a view group is a collection of views
within a particular screen and make

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:29.810
within a particular screen and make
 

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.390
within a particular screen and make
changes for those and have the system

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:31.400
changes for those and have the system
 

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.540
changes for those and have the system
animate those changes as well so it's

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:34.550
animate those changes as well so it's
 

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.970
animate those changes as well so it's
definitely something to look into you

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:36.980
definitely something to look into you
 

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.160
definitely something to look into you
know if you want to get more involved

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:39.170
know if you want to get more involved
 

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.980
know if you want to get more involved
inside the animation side of Android for

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:41.990
inside the animation side of Android for
 

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.360
inside the animation side of Android for
developers there's the Android

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:43.370
developers there's the Android
 

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.670
developers there's the Android
transition transit transaction

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:45.680
transition transit transaction
 

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.360
transition transit transaction
transition man transition manager that

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:49.370
transition man transition manager that
 

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.010
transition man transition manager that
you should go look at to get more

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:51.020
you should go look at to get more
 

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.230
you should go look at to get more
information about this and if you're

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240
information about this and if you're
 

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.240
information about this and if you're
familiar with keynotes sort of magic

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.250
familiar with keynotes sort of magic
 

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.090
familiar with keynotes sort of magic
move animation which sort of lets you

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:58.100
move animation which sort of lets you
 

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.100
move animation which sort of lets you
morph sort of an object from one portion

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:00.110
morph sort of an object from one portion
 

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.780
morph sort of an object from one portion
of the screen into another it's sort of

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:01.790
of the screen into another it's sort of
 

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.030
of the screen into another it's sort of
very similar to that so I'm just to sort

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:04.040
very similar to that so I'm just to sort
 

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.470
very similar to that so I'm just to sort
of give you an idea of how it works or

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480
of give you an idea of how it works or
 

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.870
of give you an idea of how it works or
how it looks yeah and I think that the

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880
how it looks yeah and I think that the
 

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.540
how it looks yeah and I think that the
the big thing here for designers is if

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:10.550
the big thing here for designers is if
 

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.490
the big thing here for designers is if
you're talking to a developer and you're

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:12.500
you're talking to a developer and you're
 

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.840
you're talking to a developer and you're
like hey I want these animations these

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:13.850
like hey I want these animations these
 

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.580
like hey I want these animations these
transitions to happen and they're like

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:15.590
transitions to happen and they're like
 

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.590
transitions to happen and they're like
oh you know I just can't do that it's

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600
oh you know I just can't do that it's
 

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.650
oh you know I just can't do that it's
going to take too long

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:19.660
going to take too long
 

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.030
going to take too long
you know for earlier versions of Android

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:21.040
you know for earlier versions of Android
 

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.130
you know for earlier versions of Android
you know it does require a bit of work

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:23.140
you know it does require a bit of work
 

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.530
you know it does require a bit of work
it's definitely still doable but if

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:25.540
it's definitely still doable but if
 

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.540
it's definitely still doable but if
you're running Android 4.4 or later I

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:27.550
you're running Android 4.4 or later I
 

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.580
you're running Android 4.4 or later I
don't think there's an excuse anymore to

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:29.590
don't think there's an excuse anymore to
 

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.080
don't think there's an excuse anymore to
not use this API the great thing about

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:31.090
not use this API the great thing about
 

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.180
not use this API the great thing about
this API is that it's so simple I mean

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:33.190
this API is that it's so simple I mean
 

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.160
this API is that it's so simple I mean
the easiest form of this is one line of

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:35.170
the easiest form of this is one line of
 

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.930
the easiest form of this is one line of
code is basically just kind of I think

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:36.940
code is basically just kind of I think
 

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.370
code is basically just kind of I think
it's begin delayed transition or

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:38.380
it's begin delayed transition or
 

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.320
it's begin delayed transition or
something like that and it basically

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:40.330
something like that and it basically
 

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:43.470
something like that and it basically
says any time you show or hide or or

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480
says any time you show or hide or or
 

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.590
says any time you show or hide or or
resize or move things automatically you

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600
resize or move things automatically you
 

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.720
resize or move things automatically you
know adjust their bounds or animate

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:48.730
know adjust their bounds or animate
 

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.370
know adjust their bounds or animate
their bounds or or fade them in and fade

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:50.380
their bounds or or fade them in and fade
 

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.680
their bounds or or fade them in and fade
them out it's it's really awesome so I

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:52.690
them out it's it's really awesome so I
 

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.300
them out it's it's really awesome so I
think that for designers make sure that

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.310
think that for designers make sure that
 

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.310
think that for designers make sure that
you kind of press your developers to to

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320
you kind of press your developers to to
 

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.410
you kind of press your developers to to
use this new API if they have any sort

00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:58.420
use this new API if they have any sort
 

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.450
use this new API if they have any sort
of concerns over the amount of time it

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:00.460
of concerns over the amount of time it
 

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.350
of concerns over the amount of time it
would take to implement certain

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360
would take to implement certain
 

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.660
would take to implement certain
transitions and lastly for developers

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:03.670
transitions and lastly for developers
 

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.330
transitions and lastly for developers
look for a dev pipe from our animation

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:06.340
look for a dev pipe from our animation
 

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.120
look for a dev pipe from our animation
expert chet haase which we live very

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.130
expert chet haase which we live very
 

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:13.830
expert chet haase which we live very
shortly as well yep okay so that's it

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840
shortly as well yep okay so that's it
 

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.770
shortly as well yep okay so that's it
for for what's new in Android 4.4 KitKat

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:16.780
for for what's new in Android 4.4 KitKat
 

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.830
for for what's new in Android 4.4 KitKat
from a design standpoint watch out for

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840
from a design standpoint watch out for
 

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.480
from a design standpoint watch out for
for all those dev bytes that we talked

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:21.490
for all those dev bytes that we talked
 

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.000
for all those dev bytes that we talked
about for developers and we're looking

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.010
about for developers and we're looking
 

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.130
about for developers and we're looking
to create a whole bunch of design bytes

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:26.140
to create a whole bunch of design bytes
 

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.290
to create a whole bunch of design bytes
on these topics as well over the you

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:28.300
on these topics as well over the you
