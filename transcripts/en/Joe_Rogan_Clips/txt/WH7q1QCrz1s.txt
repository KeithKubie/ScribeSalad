Speaker 1:          00:00          And all these things that we talked about, this, this word meaning that we used earlier that we all understand that account define is that a emergent property that that has to emerge. If you've got something that's intelligent enough to replicate itself and Lavan drives, you said be the, I don't know the answer, but it is worth considering that this thing, this what we, emotion meaning love and fear and all those things are just the things that happen when you are intelligent. Right? I don't know the answer to that, but it could possibly be and does consciousness have to have a local origin? Like it doesn't have to come from a thing. Like if you think about cellular communication, the, if you send me, if you're in England and you send me a video from your phone and it reaches my phone, it's getting to me through space.

Speaker 1:          00:55          It's going through the sky. It's like literally from a device not connected by any wires or anything. It's coming to me. If, if there's a possibility to create some sort of global intelligence through electronics, that's nonlocal. If one piece of it falls off this the same, is it just repairs itself or figures itself out? But it's the same consciousness existing on a global scale through some sort of an electronic network that instead of the idea that you and I have, that Brian and Joe are, you have your mind, I have my mind and we exist as intelligent, being separate from each other, but instead of that, that all of it is connected and that all of it is something that we can't even conceive of because our brains are too crude. Like trying to explain to, you know, Australia pithy kiss what a satellite is.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I, yes, I mean if you think of our brains, they are ultimately, what are they? They're just a distributed network of cells connected by neurons. And I mean, they're very complicated, but they are a colony of things that are autonomous in a sense and the communicating with each other. So, yeah, I don't, I don't see why you can't scale that up in principle. I mean, I should just add the caveat is always that we don't know about this. Yeah, it is. It's just not understood. Well, I think there's something weird has physical though. I'm damn sure it's physical. I'm damn sure that there's nothing going on in my head other than what is allowed by the laws of nature as we understand them. So eliminating show, you mean the idea of a soul being some sort of a divine thing that's inside the housing of the body? Yeah, I mean, I, I would say we can rule that. I actually, I've argued in the past, how do you rule it out? I've argued we can rule that out in the following manner. So, so, so here's my arm, right? So it's made of electrons and protons and neutrons. And, uh, if I, if I have a soul in there, something that we don't understand, but it's a different kind of energy or whatever it is

Speaker 2:          03:00          we don't have in physics at the moment, it interacts with matter because I'm moving my hand around. So whatever it is, it's something that interacts very strongly with matter. But if you look at the history of particle physics in particular, which is the study of matter, we spend, we spent decades making high precision measurements of how massive behaves and interacts and we look for, for example, for a fifth force of nature. So we know for forces the gravity, the two nuclear forces called the weak and strong nuclear forces and electromagnetism and that's what we know exist. And we look for another one with ultra high precision and we don't see any evidence of it. So I would claim that we know how matter interacts at these energies. So room temperature. Now these Ngo, we know how matter interacts very precisely and so if you want to suggest the something else that interacts with matter strongly, then I would say that it's ruled out.

Speaker 2:          04:02          I would go as far as say it's, he'd ruled out by experiment or at least he sees extremely subtle and you would have to jump through a lot of hoops to come up with a theory of some stuff that we wouldn't have seen when we've observed how matter interacts that is present in our bodies. And presumably we believe in the soul. You want it to exist outside. When you die, you still want the thing to be there and you might believe in ghosts and things like that. We look at ghosts. I mean it's, uh, it is something that carries the imprint of you. Presumably it looks like you, right? So that means that it interacts strongly with the matter that is you, because it carries a pattern. If it carries a pattern that carries information, if he carries information, there has to be an energy source that allows the information to be assisting the pattern to persist and so on.

Speaker 2:          04:47          So again, you end up with a, a theory that is postulating, something interacts with light. Because if you think a ghost is the soul, then it's something that people see sometimes. So that means interacts with light. But we know how light interacts and we ruled out anything but the most subtle, uh, further interaction that we haven't seen. So I would, I claim it, I started off as a joke. This, actually, I wrote it in an infinite monkey cage book, this radio show that I do, but he ended up, when I'd written it down, I thought actually that it makes sense. And I read some news similar actually, I think, um, Sean Carroll, he, I don't know if you've had Sean on the shareable times. He's said something in the same, I think in the book that he wrote the big picture. I think he has a similar argument actually. So it's occurred to him as well, is roughly the same argument. So if you,

Speaker 1:          05:41          so this energy that's interacting with matter, even if you are not moving at all, if you're just thinking it's interacting with the matter that encompasses your mind or your brain or your nerves or your neurons, it's something in there that's interacting with matter, whether you like it or not. So even just a simple thought process or a dream is still something it's interacting with Matt. Yeah. Well obviously cause it, you know, you, it's your will isn't it in that sense when you move, it's presumably, right. So you can, even, if you're not moving the idea, like the, you're, you're saying you're like your body's interacted with matter as you're moving your arm. But even if you're not moving, if you're just thinking and you're completely still, which is not totally possible because your heart's beating and your breathing and all that stuff. But if somehow or another you were able to isolate just the thought, the thoughts themselves are still interacting with matter because they're interacting with the brain itself. Yeah. So there's something in there. There's something that interacts with the physical structure of your body.

Speaker 2:          06:39          And, and, and I would say there isn't that we, so that's

Speaker 1:          06:45          the woo woo version is that the brain itself and the body, the physical. So this, this, this spiritual self, you are merely an antenna that's tuning in to the, the, the great consciousness of the universe.

Speaker 2:          07:01          But why? But then you have to answer what we know, what we're made of. So we know how those particles behave and interact. Right. So, so why did the particles not, uh, in any way interact with that stuff? Because we interact. We don't if that's true, we don't only just interact with it, so we interact extremely strongly with it. We're interacting with it now. Every movement I make is the interaction between that. Every man's where you have, yeah. Yes. What? Everything. If I moved my fingers or I, everything that I'm doing is an interaction between that stuff in me. So it's a very strong interaction with matter, but we don't see it in all our precision measurement. Well, that's the answer for that. The answer is because it's not there. The answer's Jesus and a, you can't measure God. That may be an answer, but the point is, as we talked about earlier, with absolute space, yeah, you can't measure it. It's not there. Right.

Speaker 1:          08:02          It's but for, for whatever reason, for people, there is some incredible motivation to find a divine something or another that's there's something greater than this physical being that there's something. What do you think that is? Like what is that compulsion? It we, we've already talked a bit about it. I think it goes to the,

Speaker 2:          08:26          the heart of this question of what it means to be human. So I would say that being human, the answer right to the, I don't know the answer to the meaning of it, but the answer would be, uh, we are small finite beings, right? Which are just clusters of atoms as we said before, the very rare, but we understand roughly how they, how they came to be and we have a limited amount of time, not actually unfortunately, but because of the laws of nature, the laws of nature for bidders to be immortal, that they, they, they in mortalities ruled out by the laws of physics. But also actually what was interesting about, if you look at the basic physics of the universe going from the big bangs where we are today, then the physics is driven by the fact that the universe began in an extremely old olded state because it was a very highly ordered system and it is tending towards a more disordered system or the moments.

Speaker 2:          09:34          And that's called the second law of thermodynamics. And it's that basic common sense thing that things go to shit. Basically it's the second law of thermodynamics. What we strongly suspect, and I would say no, uh, is that in that process of going from order to disorder, complexity emerges naturally for a brief period of time. So it's a natural part of the evolution of the universe that you get appeared in time when there's complexity in the universe. So Stars and planets and galaxies and life and civilizations, but they are, they exist because the universe is decaying, not in spite of the fact that the universe is decaying. So our existence in that sort of picture is necessarily finite, the necessarily time limited. And it is a remarkable thing that that complexity has got so far that there are things in the universe that can think and feel and explore it. And I think that is the answer. If you want an answer to the meaning of it all, it's that, that you are part of the universe because of the way the laws of nature work. You are allowed to exist, but you're allowed to exist for a temporary of, for a small amount of time in it, possibly infinite universe.
