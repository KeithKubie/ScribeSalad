00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.420
There's a particularly poignant way one can be a social disaster:

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.720
through over-friendliness.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.400
A pattern of behaviour driven by the very best of motives

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.820
which ends up feeling as irritating as outright rudeness.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.860
We meet the over-friendly at the office,

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.409
laughing at the jokes of the senior management;

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.440
behind the desk at the hotel,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.100
wishing Sir or Madam a highly enjoyable stay

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
and across the table on a first date,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.460
lavishly endorsing their would-be partner’s every opinion about recent books and films.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.020
The over-friendly are guilty of three large errors:

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.900
Firstly, they believe they must agree on everything.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.240
If the other says the world is going to the dogs,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.300
they immediately nod in consent.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.500
If a second later, there's a prediction of a utopian technological future,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.300
they'll agree just as much.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.520
When we say something clever, they're thrilled.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.260
When we say something equally daft,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.520
they like it no less.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.780
Their ritual approval may seem attentive.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.240
In truth, it's a version of not listening at all.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.140
Secondly, their praise is ill-targeted.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.860
Plenty of nice things are being said,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.340
but they're not the ones that we happen to value.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.200
They claim to love our umbrella,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.400
our credit card is from their favourite bank,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.140
our chairs are deeply beautiful,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.580
we apparently have a nice way of holding our fork…

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.400
but none of this counts for us

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.960
if it isn’t connected up with our own sense of meaning and achievement.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.180
Everyone loves being praised,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.440
but to be praised inaccurately is its own kind of insult.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.840
Thirdly, their friendliness is remorselessly upbeat.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.480
They point out how well we look, how impressive our job sounds,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.720
how perfect our family life seems.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.400
They want to make us feel good,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.500
but they dangerously raise the cost of revealing any of the lonelier, darker,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.080
more melancholic aspects of our characters.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.380
By contrast, the less ardently friendly

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.780
and therefore properly pleasing person

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.580
will keep three things closely in mind:

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.880
Firstly, that disagreement isn’t necessarily or always terrible,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.780
that it may be exhilarating to be contradicted

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.380
when we don't feel that our dignity is at stake

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.840
and that we're learning something valuable at the hands of a combative interlocutor.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.140
Secondly, that people only want to be complimented on things that they are actively proud of.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.680
The value of the currency of praise depends entirely on it not being spent too freely

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.540
and so the truly pleasing person knows they must pass over many things in discreet silence,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.340
so that when they eventually do bestow a blessing,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.040
their words can have a proper resonance.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.660
Thirdly, that we are cheered up not so much by people who say cheery things,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.500
as by people who appear to understand us,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.520
which usually means, sympathise with our sorrows

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.800
and show willingness to travel with us

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.300
to the anxious, hesitant or confused parts of our psyches.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.060
What enables the pleasing person to please is their capacity to hold on in social encounters,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.780
even with rather intimidating and alien-seeming people,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.960
to an intimate knowledge of what satisfies them.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.300
They instinctively use their own experience as a base for thinking about the needs of others.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.799
By contrast, the over-friendly person

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.179
allows themselves to forget their own likes and dislikes,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.720
under the pressure of an excessive humility

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.080
which suggests to them that anyone impressive

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.260
could not not possibly share in the principles that drive their own psychology.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.840
At the core of the pleasing person’s charm is a metaphysical insight:

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.300
that other people cannot, deep down, ever be very ‘other’

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.900
and therefore that, in core ways, what one knows about oneself

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.860
will be the master-key to understanding and getting along with strangers;

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.540
not in every case, but enough of the time to make the difference.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.940
Over-friendliness isn’t just a feature of one-to-one encounters;

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.200
it’s an entrenched flaw within modern consumer society more generally.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.380
This explains why the airline exuberantly wishes us a perfect day upon landing in a new city,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.500
or why the waiter hopes we’ll have a truly wonderful time around the first course

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.440
and why the attendant in a clothes shop

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.620
pulls such a large smile along with their suggestion that we try on a new pair of trousers.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.880
Here too, the cause of an asphyxiating friendliness is a sudden modesty and loss of confidence

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.300
around using oneself as a guide to the temperament and needs of a stranger.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.180
Companies become over-impressed by the apparent ‘otherness’ of their clients

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.500
and thereby overlook how many aspects of their own selves

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.600
are being trampled upon in a service context.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.220
They sidestep the knowledge that just after landing back home after a trip abroad,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.180
we may feel horrified at the thought of our responsibilities in the family;

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.000
or that moods of introversion and sadness can accompany us even inside a clothes boutiques.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.600
They behave as if they were cheerful Martians encountering broken,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.600
complex humans for the very first time.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:11.309
The fault of the excessively over-friendly person can, in the end, be traced back to a touching modesty.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.700
They are guilty of nothing more than a loss of confidence

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.700
in the validity of their own experiences as a guide to the pleasure of others.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.120
The failure of the over-friendly types teaches us that in order to succeed at pleasing anyone,

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.799
we must first accept the risk

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:31.959
that we might well displease them through a candid expression of our being.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.940
Successful charm relies on an initial secure sense that we could survive social failure.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.940
Rehearsing how it would in the end be OK

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.980
to make a hash of seducing someone

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.380
is perhaps the best way to seduce them properly and confidently.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.720
We must reconcile ourselves to the risk of not making friends

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.700
to stand any chance of actually making any.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.200
 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.940
