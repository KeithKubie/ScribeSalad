[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:09.120
ALEX CHAN: The digital content
space is changing rapidly.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.460
Developers must
constantly search for ways

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.090
to monetize their product,
while continuously

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.876
enriching the user experience.

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:18.960
At Viki, subscriptions have
helped us create a sustainable

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.250
business.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.390
We are almost tripling our
subscriber base every year,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.530
and going to subscription
was easier than we thought.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.010
My name is Alex Chan.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.910
I'm the Senior VP of
Product and Engineering

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.450
at Viki, part of
the Rakuten family.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.860
We are a global video
entertainment platform

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.310
with a heavy focus on Asian
content, both TV shows

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.750
and movies, powered by a
devoted community of fans.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.700
We launched more
than six years ago

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.220
with a business model that
relied on ads for monetization.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.500
We wanted a more
predictable revenue stream

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.080
and to offer better premium
experiences for our users.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.440
So we launched subscriptions
through Google Play

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.700
three years ago.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.810
It was really easy.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.990
Just a few lines of code,
and the payment APIs

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.180
took care of the rest.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.030
Our subscription
revenue has grown

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.430
over 200% in the past year.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.910
We are blown away by
other positive outcomes

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.570
from the rollout.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.050
MARILIAM SEMIDEY:
Android's [? growth ?]

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.820
in emerging markets
and open platforms

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.020
have really help us succeed.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.030
Credit card use is slower
in these countries.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.380
[? Committing ?] for some
payment from Google Play,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.600
like gift cards and
carrier billing,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.090
make payments
subscriptions easier

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.710
for users in these markets.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.660
Our subscribers from
emerging markets

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.490
like Latin America
and the Middle East

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.910
have been growing at
more than 700% each year.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.110
ALEX CHAN: Subscriptions
and Google Play billing

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.700
have helped us expand our paying
audience globally and opened up

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.000
a new stream of revenue
from emerging markets.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.530
Now, we are making our
own shows while supporting

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.720
an active community of millions,
watching in over 200 languages.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.780
Most important, our fans tell
us our product and content

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.970
has enriched their lives and
helped them learn new cultures.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.460
This kind of impact
is what makes

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.450
our work truly fulfilling.
