00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.200
Let's say we've
got a company here

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.930
that has exactly four shares
just to simplify things.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.910
Obviously, very few companies
have only four shares,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.610
but this will simplify
the explanation.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.750
And let's say that
each of those shares

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.195
right now they're
trading in the market,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.320
or I guess we could say
the last transaction that's

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.260
occurred in trading
in the shares,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.070
they're trading at $2 a share.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.470
So the market is saying
that each of those shares

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.620
are worth $2.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.642
There's four of these
shares in total.

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:37.600
And we're going to assume
that this company has

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.820
no liabilities.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.550
So the shareholders just
outright own the assets.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.060
So if there's four of
these shares times $2,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.810
the market is saying that
this company's assets are

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.750
worth exactly $8
right over here.

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.680
The market value of the
assets is the same thing

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.405
as a market cap in this case
because we have no liabilities.

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:03.780
Now what I want
to think about is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.130
what happens if the company
wants to raise some more money?

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.520
Let's say that they want
to issue some more shares

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.230
and sell them to raise
some money to buy a factory

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.860
or whatever.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.580
So what they literally
do is the board

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.535
approves for them to literally
create two more shares.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.900
So now they have a total
of six shares outstanding.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.350
And then the company goes,
they get an investment banker,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.140
and they do a secondary
offering in the public markets.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.799
And they sell these
incremental shares.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.340
And they're able to
sell them-- let's

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.275
just say for simplicity--
at $2 per share.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:40.400
Normally when you increase
the supply a little bit,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.460
you won't get quite what the
previous market value was,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.300
but you get roughly $2
a share for simplicity.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.550
And by selling two shares that
it just created for $2 a share,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.630
the company is able
to raise another $4.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.060
So the whole reason why I'm
going through this exercise

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.590
is to ask a question.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.165
Did dilution take place?

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:07.790
And there's different
ways to think it.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.870
When you think
about dilution, it's

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.160
like you could imagine
if you have a sweet syrup

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.690
and if you add water to
it, it becomes less sweet.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.540
Each kind of a cube of that
water, each drop of that water

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.720
has less sugar in it.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.940
You've diluted it.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.730
And so there seems to
be an analogy here.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.820
We now have more shares
for the same company.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.000
And it is true.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.960
If you are the
owner of this share

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.910
over here before the
share offering up here,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.810
you owned 25% of the company.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.470
After the share
offering, you own 1/6.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.230
So after, you own 1/6
or approximately 16%.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.110
So it looks like the percentage
that you own of the company

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.050
has been diluted.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.850
And that's true to some degree.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.230
But sometimes the dilution
takes on another meaning,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.950
that somehow because
more shares are

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.880
being used for the ownership
of the same company,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.745
that maybe these
shares are worth less.

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.620
And that's the one thing
I want to challenge.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.600
There is dilution in
the percentage you own,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.620
but there is not dilution in
what the shares are worth.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.920
Because before, if you had four
shares representing something

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.410
that is worth $8, now
you have six shares

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.047
representing
something that is $12.

00:03:22.047 --> 00:03:24.130
Because the company didn't
just issue these shares

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.760
and get nothing
in return for it.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.310
It got $4 of cash.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.070
You can't debate the value
of $4. $4 are worth $4.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.240
So now the assets of the
company are worth $12.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.240
So you have $12 of assets,
no liabilities, six shares,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.670
$12 divided by six shares
is still $2 a share.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.670
So the value per
share has not been

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.300
diluted, just the
percentage of the company

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.950
that you happen to own.
