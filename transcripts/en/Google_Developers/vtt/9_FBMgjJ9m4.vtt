00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.130
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.640
I'm Louis Gray here
from the Moscone

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.670
Center in San Francisco.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.550
I've got a great guest here
today, Bradley Horowitz, Vice

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.343
President of Product
on Google+.

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:19.210
Welcome, Bradley.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.030
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.550
LOUIS GRAY: This is an
incredible event here at

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.150
Google I/O. This is
my fourth time

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.970
attending, second as a Googler.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.620
I came twice as press,
if you recall.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.800
How many times have
you been here?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.220
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I guess
three that I can recall.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.150
I'm not sure I made
it the first year.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.470
LOUIS GRAY: We've got like 6,000
developers, and I swear

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.010
all of them are right
next to us.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.580
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah,
it's amazing.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.075
It's really exciting.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:42.880
LOUIS GRAY: It's just been,
I think, a really great

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.260
opportunity to connect to the
developers who interact with

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.220
our products, take a look at
each one of them, be it

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.900
Chrome, Android, Google+
obviously, YouTube, and really

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.670
get to talk directly
to the people who

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.500
are making this happen.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.570
That's part of what we're
trying to do with Google

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.690
Developers Live is get that
immediate, direct access.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.560
Now, there's a lot
of people who

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.560
watched the keynote yesterday.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.360
It was an incredible keynote,
three and a half hours, and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.020
just action packed.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.540
Let's talk a little bit about
what Google+ announced for

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.150
those people who could have
missed it or haven't gotten

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.005
deep to understand what
was introduced.

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:13.960
Can you take us through that?

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.990
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.700
So the keynote was epic.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.170
I mean, it was a huge day for
me personally, for our team,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.660
and I think for Google, too.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.900
And we had a section in there
where Vic, who is our rockstar

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.810
leader, got up and announced
really three major themes for

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.050
Google+ that all landed
on the same day.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.440
The first is one that is
basically a complete redesign

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.760
of the stream, and really a
rethinking of the stream.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.620
It's not simply a
visual design.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.090
It works and behaves in
new and exciting ways.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.130
That in itself was a
major undertaking.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.580
It touched every part of our
product, and it's almost a

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.480
relaunch of Google+ itself.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.240
LOUIS GRAY: It's dramatically
different.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.310
When we looked at it, they
talked about really adding

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.452
depth to Google+.

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:06.990
The discussion was many
different sites are often very

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.090
flat, and with the Google+
redesign, you can take me

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.380
through some of--

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.270
either the thinking about how do
you do the redesign in the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.710
first place, and then what were
some key elements you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.220
wanted to make sure
you delivered on

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.030
when this went live.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.880
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah, we could
spend an hour just on

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.550
that first element of
what we launched.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.480
LOUIS GRAY: Then you'll have to
come back when I get back

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.750
to Mountain View.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.710
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That's
fine, too.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.230
So as I said, it's more than
just a visual design.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.220
One of the things that
inspired this was our

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.490
development process.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.620
We are developing for
multiple platforms.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.700
We have been getting huge
accolades and praise from the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.920
press and our users around our
mobile and tablet designs, and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.370
we also felt some frustration
that the desktop experience

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.560
wasn't up to par, wasn't
consistent, wasn't inspiring

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.680
the same kinds of adjectives
that the mobile and tablet

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.510
experience were.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.220
So part of what inspired this
was the disparity between

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.080
those experiences, and what we
saw as an opportunity to

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.920
reconcile them.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.920
We started asking ourselves,
why are they different?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.610
Why wouldn't they converge in
terms of how they behave?

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.190
And so I think that is part of
the art of developing across

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.070
platforms is understanding and
having principles around where

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.920
things converge and where they
diverge, because it's not that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.250
you want the experience
on a mobile device

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.900
to simply be smaller.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.530
That's not the right answer
and we know that.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.260
So we put a lot of thought
into that.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.640
We came up with something
I think is beautiful.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.400
It is a multi-column card
interface that really brings

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.180
the content to the fore.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.710
And I think that's one of the
design principles was to allow

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.150
the content to shine, to be
the hero in the product.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.620
Things like menus recede
gracefully to the side when

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.130
you don't need them and appear
when you do, and that's one of

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.340
the other principles, is
emergent functionality.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.360
Stuff is there but it's
not cluttered.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.490
It's not attracting your
attention or detracting from

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.330
the content itself.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.579
LOUIS GRAY: We talked a few
times already at GDL talking

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.430
about that unification
of design.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.730
I think that was a big thing
that came out of the keynote,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.510
that you're essentially having
the same exact experience on a

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.780
smartphone, a tablet, or your
desktop, and you saw that with

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.140
the Google Play Store redesign,
you've seen that

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.040
with Chrome, you've seen
that with some of the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.300
Notification updates.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.500
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Google Now.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.840
LOUIS GRAY: --and Google
Now especially.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.530
And now Google+, I think, has
been one of those big pieces.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.950
So that was one of the
three things that

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.290
you announced yesterday.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.460
Let's talk about
the other two.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.110
One of them was obviously
the Hangouts app.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.560
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Well,
I didn't even

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.410
get through the first.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.380
I mean, we didn't talk about
auto hashtagging.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.080
We didn't talk about
the dimensionality.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.490
I mean, just to briefly touch
on that and then we'll talk

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.620
about Hangouts.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.650
Most streams are sort of like a
newspaper that moves through

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.370
a View Port in one dimension.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.190
It's really very flat.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.100
What we've done also
is introduced

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.250
depth to the stream.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.220
Part of that is literally
cinematographic kind of

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.270
animation so that you can flip
a card around and there's

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.490
information on the
back of the card.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.320
But more metaphorically, we've
introduced depth in the sense

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.270
that we are really leaning
on hashtags.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.440
Now, hashtags are great.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.450
Chris Messina, one of our own
Googlers, is credited with

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.630
having invented the concept.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.390
But in most social media, very
small fractions of the content

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.260
actually benefit from hashtags
and there's well known

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.710
problems with hashtags.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.940
There's race conditions, what is
the canonical hashtag for a

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.620
given topic for a news event?

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.810
We think we've solved
those in a way

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.920
that is a Google approach.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.700
So what we do is we
automatically hashtag content.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.190
We look at the words,
of course, the

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.480
semantics behind it.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.860
We look at the images so we can
actually do image analysis

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.790
and tag images based on the
content of the images.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.260
LOUIS GRAY: I saw in some of
those demos, there was an

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.300
example of an Eiffel Tower photo
where the person had no

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.890
hashtags inserted at all, didn't
even mention Eiffel

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.930
Tower in the post, and yet
Google knew, with the type of

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.210
analysis and algorithms that
we have, that this was the

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.370
Eiffel Tower and they hashtagged
it automatically,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.550
and that was nifty.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.450
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
It's incredible.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.560
And it works for landmarks,
it can work for

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.130
categories of images.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.230
It's something I hope
everyone can try.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.180
The cool thing about this
is that we have

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.030
the Knowledge Graph.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.590
We have knowledge of
clustering and

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.940
can apply these hashtags.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.750
So hashtags become these
doorways to explore content.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.890
If there's a particular thing
I'm interested in, I click on

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.930
the hashtag and on the back of
the card are more that I can

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.230
swipe through, and it's a way
to really dive through the

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.580
content in a new dimension.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.080
LOUIS GRAY: One of the things
that's really come up about

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.870
Google+ in the last few years
since you debuted is the

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.980
following of interests, going
beyond people and the

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.700
relationships you have
in real life to

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.720
having shared interests.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.860
And we've seen that with
Communities, which were

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.610
introduced earlier this year,
I believe, as well as this

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.500
kind of hashtag approach, where
you can find out more

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.150
people talking about the
same things that

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.950
you're interested in.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.550
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Exactly.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.190
LOUIS GRAY: How have you
looked at that from a

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.360
philosophical standpoint
where you have that--

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.740
not a dichotomy, but a different
way of looking at

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.840
how content flows through
between people and interests?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.880
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Yeah, I really

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.070
appreciate that use case.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.640
That's one of the advantages
of being here is you really

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.350
learn how people are
using the product.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.020
And as you point out, interests
are one of the main

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.730
success stories of Google+,
people discovering people with

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.490
common interests
or affinities.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.450
The truth is, I think we haven't
done enough to really

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.640
make that use case shine,
and I think this hashtag

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.690
opportunity gives people a new
vector to connect to other

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.960
people, to connect to content
that matters to them.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.130
And so this is really a
recognition of that use case

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.340
and doubling down in a way
that I think will really

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.630
promote that use case.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.560
People have sort of been doing
it around the product, and now

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.910
the product is leaning
into that trend and

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.120
facilitating this.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.600
So I really think this is
a major innovation.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.050
It's sort of a Google
kind of problem.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:16.020
The ability to do this automatic
hashtagging requires

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.310
lots of artificial intelligence,
machine

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.990
learning, across languages.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.120
It's very impressive
technology.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.310
The other thing I want to
mention is that we always put

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.740
the content owner first.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.340
So if you hashtag your own
content, that gets preferred

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.460
and those hashtags
will appear.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.240
We distinguish between user
entered hashtags and machine

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.240
algorithm generated hashtags.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.980
If you don't like the hashtags
we put there, you can x them

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.440
out on a per hashtag basis or
you can opt out entirely and

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.790
say, don't hashtag my content.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.140
LOUIS GRAY: And you're talking
about the stream.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.720
It's really interesting.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.100
There's so much content flowing
through Google+ right

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.650
now, especially depending how
many people you're following,

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.870
as you follow interests,
I've seen some

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.630
Communities just explode.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.230
And the interesting thing is
that not all posts are created

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.670
equal, and I think that gets
called out a little bit in the

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.790
new redesign, and you have
certain posts that can span

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.900
multiple columns.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.660
Tell us a little
bit about that.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.030
Is that just something, like if
I put a horizontal photo,

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.190
is it just going to expand
out like that, or

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.810
how does that work?

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.170
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: No, it's
actually intelligent about

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.520
how, as you said, all content's
not created equal.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.100
And pending the nature of the
content, as you mentioned,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.130
media content renders really
well and deserves this kind of

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.780
full screen treatment.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.050
Part of it is the affinity you
have to the content itself,

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.140
both the poster and the topic.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.080
And so we'll bring the right
content to you in the right

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.010
format, and this ability to have
these superposts which

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.440
get more screen real estate and
attention is one of the

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.120
big benefits of the
new redesign that

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.110
we're excited about.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.910
LOUIS GRAY: And superposting
works actually really well,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.350
going back to photos.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.740
Obviously, the photo
community has been

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.700
incredible on Google+.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.070
It's really been something where
I've seen a lot of focus

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.505
from the team, not only the
Photos Team explicitly, but

00:09:56.505 --> 00:09:58.700
from Vic all the way down,
really diving in,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.920
understanding how photos and a
visual design experience can

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.560
really differentiate Google+.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.541
And I know we're not going in
order, but I want to talk a

00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:07.450
little bit about photos.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.340
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That's fine.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.880
LOUIS GRAY: You've introduced,
you call it Auto Awesome and

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.330
some auto enhancements.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.580
And it seems like you're not
just accepting of photos,

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.620
you're embracing it and making
it a big part of that

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.520
experience.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.460
What is it about photography
that has exploded on Google+?

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.910
Why is it happening here?

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.430
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I think it's
back to that respect for the

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.380
content owner.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.400
What we're trying to do is get
out of the way and allow this

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.350
stuff to be presented in the
most beautiful form, and then

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.080
to connect up audiences with
content producers.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.480
So what's not to love in that
equation where we have no

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.170
agenda other than to help you
find and reach your audience

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.680
and put your content
in the best light?

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.250
So that has been noticed and
acclaimed, and we've gotten

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.170
into this very nice rhythm
with photographers where

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.210
they've come onto the service,
filled it up with great

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.250
content, and we're listening
to make the

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.300
service better and better.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.540
And as you pointed out,
the second big theme--

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.500
we're not going in Vic's order--
but the second big

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.520
theme of yesterday's
announcements was a slew of

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.620
new features and capabilities
on photos.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.300
And this was not necessarily
for the very top of the

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.880
pyramid, the Thomas Hawks
and Trey Ratcliffs.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.900
LOUIS GRAY: You mean for the
professional photographers.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.760
This is for everybody.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.590
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: This is for
everybody, and we're sort of

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.840
raising the bar.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.250
And the best way to think about
this-- the way that I

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.666
liked that Vic framed
in the keynote--

00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:33.330
Google has tremendous data
centers, bandwidth, computing

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.980
power, and we introduced a long
time ago this feature

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.710
that allows you to instantly
upload your content, your

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.410
photos, into our cloud,
and that's fantastic.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.840
LOUIS GRAY: With any device
that's connected, right?

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.900
So if I take a picture with my
Android device or my iPhone or

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.490
iPad if they're connected,
or even Glass, that'll be

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.920
instantly uploaded and available
for me, auto backup,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.210
to get to and retrieve.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.660
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: And it's
really self evident.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.610
I think once we did this,
it was widely

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.820
copied in the industry.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.400
And of course, my content
should not be

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.620
locked on an SD card.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.430
If you ask people, how many of
you have pictures on your

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.490
phone that you never got
around to sharing or

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.980
liberating or doing anything
with, everyone

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.200
raised their hands.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.030
And in this day and age, we're
all cycling through phones.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.300
You basically put it in a drawer
or hand it down to

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.460
generations, and so having
that content trapped on a

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.950
device, especially one that is
internet connected, is absurd.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.320
So that's widely
understood now.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.740
We introduced that feature
and people love it

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.720
and appreciate it.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.560
But that is the tip
of the iceberg.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.510
It's table stakes.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.160
It's the most modest thing we
could do with what Google

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.040
could offer to users, and what
we launched yesterday were

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.270
three more enhancements that I
really think speak to what a

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.790
cloud-based approach to
photography can do.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:54.490
The first one is auto curation
and the ability to highlight

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.420
your photos.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.590
So all of us are in a state now
where we go on vacation,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.680
we come home, and you've got
a folder full of photos--

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.980
hundreds, maybe even 1,000.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.230
I went to Morocco recently,
took about 1,000 pictures.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.150
The problem is you don't get a
second vacation to go through

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.360
your first vacation's
photos, right?

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.280
LOUIS GRAY: And even for those
of us who don't have the

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.860
luxury to go to Morocco, I've
got three kids four and under,

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.190
and so they're beautiful
and it's fun to

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.070
take photos of them.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.630
But I'm spending most of the
time trying to get them to go

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.400
to bed be obedient rather than
trying to add shadows here and

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.350
do texturing and find
the right ones.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.210
And so it really made sense
to me when Vic gave his

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.460
presentation about not only
looking at 600 photos and

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.660
taking it down to the top 40,
but also the fun ones where

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.650
you say, none of the kids are
looking at the right place at

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.170
the right time and you
kind of animate that.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.810
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So we
all feel this problem.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.510
I mean again, everyone raises
their hands and understands

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.540
the auto backup functionality.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.110
But if you say, how many of
you have taken more photos

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.840
than you know what to
do with, everyone

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.950
will raise their hand.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.540
And so some of what we're
doing to help with this

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.470
curation problem is sort
of self evident.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.730
We'll get rid of the
blurry ones.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.040
We'll get rid of the
overexposed ones or

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.760
underexposed ones when they're
beyond repair, and we'll get

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.980
to repair in a minute.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.190
But some of what we're doing
is really very clever.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.680
Were able to find people in the
photos, understand your

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.390
affinity to those people,
understand, are they smiling

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.560
in the photos.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.200
And what we're doing is we're
taking what is an intractable

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.090
problem-- going through
1,000 photos--

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:28.380
and coming up with a starting
set where here's the 25 we

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.580
think would be a great

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.620
representation of your vacation.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.560
Did we get it right?

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.260
And you can go in and actually
say, no, that one isn't what I

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:36.880
want to share.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.110
I prefer this one.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.730
And of course, every time you
do that, it's helping make

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.790
algorithms smarter.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.290
You're actually volunteering
a bit of information to the

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.530
global commons that will help
tune our algorithms.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.970
And ultimately, they'll
be individually tuned.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.090
If you prefer somber shots where
people aren't smiling,

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.410
we should offer you that.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.800
LOUIS GRAY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.060
this is my serious face.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.350
But you talk about helping the
algorithm get better, and I

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:04.720
want to touch on that a
little bit before we

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.320
jump back into Hangouts.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.140
When you look at Google+, it
really is kind of two pieces.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.980
You've not only got the
destination site, which is

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.240
incredible and has a beautiful
new look, and a lot of people

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.560
are talking and engaging and
sharing their interests, but

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.250
it's making other Google
products better.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.350
And you could see that yesterday
especially when you

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.240
talk about new maps, and
Google Play with

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.890
recommendations from your
friends, and all

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.250
these little pieces.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.040
How do you balance those two--

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.490
I don't want to say competing
interests,

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.160
but separate interests?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.690
You've got a team of people
who's got a lot of work to do,

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.530
a bug list a mile long, features
they want to get out.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.510
How do you go ahead and say,
we've really got to make a

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.750
better experience for
Google with Google+?

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.455
I want to talk about that
philosophy and how you're

00:15:43.455 --> 00:15:43.715
going to do that.

00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:45.590
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Well as you
know, it's been part of our

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:50.500
stated strategy for a long time
is to be not just a site,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.690
not just a new product, but a
horizontal, social spine, a

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.530
layer of infrastructure that
makes all products better.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.730
And ultimately, as you'll talk
to Seth, I think, after me, it

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.420
not just makes all Google
products better.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.670
It makes all products on the web
better, and it's something

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:12.040
we want to offer to publishers
and developers as well.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.430
How do we balance those?

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.600
As you point out, I don't think
they're competing, but

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.570
there are finite resources and
only so many hours in the day,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.830
and so we have to sort of
thread that needle.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.350
I think part of Vic's leadership
is to understand

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.200
that this is a journey, that
it's not something we ever

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.000
anticipated we'd be done
with in 20 months.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.490
And while we're delighted with
the usage and the uptake and

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.100
the progress that we're making,
we've got a roadmap

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.120
that will carry us for a very
long time and some very

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.320
exciting things ahead of us.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.350
As you point out, I can't think
of a product or team at

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.320
Google that isn't already
working with us and won't

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.000
revolutionize the functionality
of their own

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.880
product through better and
deeper integration.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.300
LOUIS GRAY: I think that's
something that you and I know

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.380
inherently because we've been
close to Google+ for a long

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.860
time, and I think some of the
challenge of bringing our

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.820
knowledge and our comfort level
with everything that

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.900
we're doing with Google+ to the
outside world, and I think

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.535
we have an opportunity now to
do that where people will

00:17:02.535 --> 00:17:04.599
really get what we're
thinking.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.630
People often talk
about success.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.839
How do you measure that success,
whether it's at a 12

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.359
month standpoint, a 24 month?

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.460
And you say, it is
a long vision.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.589
You how do you know you're
on the right

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.520
track and doing well?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.260
What kind of feedback
do you get?

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.290
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That's
a great question.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.970
Well the first, something we're
very attuned to as a

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.599
team, are the metrics.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:22.970
LOUIS GRAY: What kind
of metrics?

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.900
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Well, we
measure everything, so time

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.120
spent and engagement.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.250
These are health indexes for
our own products, and we're

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.700
very attuned to them, and we
strive to understand them,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.640
measure them, and improve
all of those metrics.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.680
So that's one way.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.730
In terms of what we share
publicly, obviously our

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.870
Dashboards are useful
internal tools.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:53.280
Our public numbers right now are
about 190 million monthly

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.520
actives on Google+ itself,
the mobile client

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.160
or the Google+ site.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.170
We're happy with that.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.630
It took other social companies
five years, seven years to get

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.940
to 200 million.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.960
200 million is right
in sight for us.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.140
And that's incredible usage,
incredibly engaged users.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.670
As you point out, there's
content that's exploding on

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.720
the system and we're just
getting started.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.000
So all of that is very
validating and a great way to

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.560
measure the success
of the product.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.650
I do think that we are
never satisfied.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.890
And so while all of those
trends are in the right

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.310
direction, there's
so much to do.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.610
People in the session I
just left were saying,

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.560
where's your analytics?

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.560
You need analytics for us to
take the platform seriously.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.370
They're right.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.300
Where's your API?

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:44.200
We want you to more fully open
the API and then continue down

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.030
the platform.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.000
LOUIS GRAY: Actually
earlier today, we

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.280
had the Google+ Sandbox.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.610
We did a walk through
and highlighted a

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:50.370
number of those partners.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.250
We're definitely going to have
a chance to talk with Seth.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.180
I think the interesting part
to me, having seen it from

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:55.900
both sides--

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.170
both first outside of Google
and now inside--

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.790
is externally, you have
people's expectations.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.070
They really want to
get to the code.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.330
They've been asking for certain
types of APIs and

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.660
actually, a different type of
write APIs and this and that.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.320
And that's something that Vic's
addressed a few times

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.040
and trying to do this
in the right way.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.450
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Exactly.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.110
LOUIS GRAY: And patience
is hard.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.750
It's hard to be taught and to
make sure you do it in an

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.990
excellent way that's good for
your users and developers.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.120
And what can we tell developers
right now who want

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.680
to know that Google+ is a place
that they should invest

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.510
their time?

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.070
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That's a great
question, and I think it

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:35.600
does require patience to grow a
network like we're growing,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.930
and we don't want to
inorganically sort

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.090
of pour users in.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.440
We want it to have a healthy
sort of trajectory.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.600
We think that growth
for its own sake--

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.730
we're not just looking
for spikes.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.430
We're looking for sustained,
organic, viral, exponential

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.590
growth, and that happens
over time.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.070
Now some of this, as I pointed
out, we've managed to compress

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.820
seven years into 20 months.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.385
That's awesome.

00:20:02.385 --> 00:20:07.040
But things have to happen in a
sequential order and as we

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.870
open up APIs--

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.230
Vic's talked a lot about this--
we want to ensure the

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.390
integrity of the system both
from a spam and abuse point,

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.490
from making sure the content
reached the right users in the

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.430
right moment in the right way.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.560
There's a lot of science behind
that and some of that

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.920
has to be learned
in the field.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.340
And so we've continued to
introduce new APIs, new

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.950
functionality, Google+ Sign In,
all of these things, in

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.400
disciplined, thoughtful ways
that have not impeded but

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.610
rather accreted value to our
growth trajectories and the

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:40.770
value of the network.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.810
LOUIS GRAY: And I think there's
also three pieces we

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.860
touched on a number of times in
the keynote, and touched on

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.280
a little bit with
spam and abuse.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.630
We talk about three things, and
that's speed, security,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.410
simplicity.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.210
And I think you touched a little
bit on security and

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.710
simplicity of getting photos up
there, simplicity of being

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.180
able to post.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.190
What about speed?

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.190
How do you measure
if something's

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.090
happening quick enough?

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:01.450
What is a good load time?

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.490
How does that impact you guys?

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.170
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: We care so
deeply about latency and

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.460
speed, and it's across
a number of levels.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.700
One is just page load time being
as efficient as we can,

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.840
making sure we're doing
things right.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.860
I know there's lots of sessions
here, but our

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.470
internal hygiene there is
rigorous and we care deeply

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.980
about that.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.150
It's everything from how the
system's architected to how

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.180
the page is rendering in
specific browsers.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.470
So that's one aspect of speed.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.000
Another is for things like--

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.850
I haven't even gone through the
features of autoenhancing

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.770
your images, but these are
compute intensive features,

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.100
and so thinking about how we
take advantage of Google's

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.710
Global Compute Infrastructure
to do that in a way that is

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.930
efficient is another aspect,
making sure the algorithms are

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.630
efficient, making sure that
users' expectations are in

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.530
line with what we can deliver,
all of these things.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.190
For instance, auto hashtagging,
one thing the

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.540
team struggled with is could
we do it in real time?

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.350
Could you post something and
have the post drop into your

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.960
stream with the hashtags
directly on it?

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.460
That was a big challenge because
what we wanted, again,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.970
in deference to the content
owner, we didn't want you to

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.610
have to come back tomorrow to
see how your post was tagged.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.610
We wanted that to
be real time.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.030
LOUIS GRAY: You don't want to
go back and fix it five

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.895
minutes later or five hours
later or any of that stuff.

00:22:16.895 --> 00:22:18.120
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: It had
to be interactive.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.200
And so speed is, throughout
our product, of foremost

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.370
concern and we think about it
deeply and in subtle ways and

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.130
in the forefront of what a lot
of our teams are working on.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.600
LOUIS GRAY: And one of the other
forefront pieces you've

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.195
got is Hangouts.

00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:37.410
I always used to say Hangouts
is kind of that hammer that

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.190
hits all the nails.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.650
It's just been an exciting thing
that Google+ had that

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.840
was a significant
differentiator, and it's been

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.960
there since day one.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.190
And Hangouts has really grown
into something else now.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.300
We have the On Air capability,
and the new app that launched

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.010
yesterday which really unifies
a lot of our messaging.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.070
So let's talk about that.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.500
I definitely don't want
to miss that.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.250
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.010
There's so many more photo
features I would love to talk

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.230
about but in the interest of
time, I'll take your lead and

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.610
we'll talk about Hangouts.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.940
Hangouts is an incredibly
beautiful,

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.820
simple and subtle product.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.960
I'm really proud of the team.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.030
It took a lot of craft and
discipline from a product

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.230
standpoint to build something
that just works.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.970
It's not the sort of wow factor
of, enhance your photos

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.360
or automatically hashtag
something.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.530
It is just a beautiful,
thoughtful, convenient product

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.350
experience that just works
like it should.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.790
One of the things Vic took you
through was a matrix, and

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.760
aren't there already products
that fulfill this?

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.220
And the truth is--

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.710
LOUIS GRAY: I've been able to
send you a chat before, I've

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.580
been able to send you photos
before, but I think that

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.950
matrix essentially shows photos,
videos, and text

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.740
across different devices--

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.860
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Single
user, multi-user.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.120
LOUIS GRAY: They're talking
about three

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.680
dimensions now, Bradley.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.190
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah,
it's a cube.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:56.800
There really is no product
that met all of those

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.630
requirements.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.380
And I really think we've nailed
it and we're going to

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.900
put something in everyone's
pocket, irrespective of

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.590
device, or in front
of everyone.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.760
Maybe it's not your pocket.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.130
Maybe it's on your face or
maybe it's on your desk.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.230
But we're going to put it
everywhere you need it.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.290
And it will be the simplest
way to really connect to

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:20.350
another person, whether that's
text, photos, emoji, or real

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.930
time, face-to-face interaction
between groups of people.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.930
We are going to span
that entire gamut.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.800
And for Google, I think
distribution has never been

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.620
our problem.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.990
If we had a great product, we
have an opportunity to get

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.940
that in people's hands, and I
don't think we've stepped up

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.400
and created the right product
until yesterday

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.090
and we now have that.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.000
LOUIS GRAY: Solving these
problems are hard.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.090
I think one of the behind the
scenes, I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.140
did a big run through of
the Hangouts creation.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.660
It's a challenge to take the
many different products that

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.400
we have and make a beautiful,
seamless user experience like

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.010
Larry often talks about, and
Vic often talks about.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.100
And so we've seen that with
Google+, we're seeing it again

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.080
with Hangouts.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.940
And one interesting thing about
Hangouts, because it's

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.880
such a shining star of Google+,
it's gotten a lot of

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.160
attention but it's also gotten
a lot of real world use that

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.680
kind of goes unspoken.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.400
When I was in Europe, I did a
Hangout with my kids and my

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.200
wife every single day.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.380
We were separated by what?

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.640
6,000 miles, give or take, eight
or nine hours, and every

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.380
day I spoke face to face
with my kids and

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.620
they just expect it.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.510
They've come to believe that
they can pick up a Nexus 7,

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.820
ask Google anything, get the
answer they want, connect with

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.290
anyone, anytime.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.050
I mean, just even simple things
like getting a movie on

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.110
Google Play on instant, it's
incredible what they believe.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.020
And you look at Hangouts--

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.560
even last night after we wrapped
up at seven o'clock, I

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.550
went to the hotel and my wife
sent me a message on Hangout

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.690
that says, can we do
a Hangout now?

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.730
I said sure, and got to talk to
my kids and tell them all

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.060
to go to bed and pick
up their toys.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.220
So how has Hangouts really
changed the way that you

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.570
collaborate, either at
work or at home?

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.070
Are you still having fun just
hitting the Hangout button and

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.140
waiting for people?

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.580
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: It's changed
it dramatically.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.980
I think as you're pointing
out, we have these high

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.310
profile Hangouts On Air.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.090
We have the President, and the
Dalai Lama and chiefs of

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:04.680
state, and--

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.980
LOUIS GRAY: All the way
down to my kids.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.740
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yes, right.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.870
So that stuff gets the attention
a lot of times.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.160
But what is more exciting to
me is people just using

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.130
Hangouts in this private,
important way to connect to

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:18.770
other people.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.100
So the use case you talked
about I experience

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.190
myself all the time.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.740
When I'm traveling, it's the
best way to connect face to

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.510
face with the family and have
an authentic, great

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.960
connection.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.200
It's so much better
than a call.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.690
You hand the phone to the
kids, and they don't

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.390
even want to talk.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.150
But if you can see them, and
I'm often using the Effects

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.480
and we're having fun.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.750
We're laughing, we're
interacting,

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.540
it's real, it's visceral.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.160
So I'm a fan of that use case.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.480
But you pointed out at work.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.340
One of our leaders, Shi Chu,
who was the VP under whom

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.470
Hangouts was built, mentioned
in the previous session that

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:02.420
Google itself conducts more than
20,000 Hangouts a day.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.190
So this has become an integral
piece of our own workflow.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:08.320
We can't get through the day
without using Hangouts to

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.620
connect to our distributed
offices and actually

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.830
get our jobs done.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.470
So it's not only for fun and
giggles and laughs and

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.980
connection with the family.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.920
It's for serious work.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.780
We actually use screen
sharing, we do our

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.240
presentations this way, we
interact as teams over

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.030
Hangouts, and it's really
spanning the gamut of

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.430
communication, everything from
the ridiculous to the sublime.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:34.380
And so it's a part of my daily
life every day of my life.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.350
LOUIS GRAY: So one of the things
we talked about, we

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.550
talked about Interests.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.790
How do people factor into
Google+ and Google at large?

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.980
I mean, I know there's a kind
of what would be called a

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.490
rallying cry or really the
genesis of Google+.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.130
It wasn't just that you
had a lot of people

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.050
who wanted some work.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:56.335
What has sparked that, and how
is that continuing today?

00:27:56.335 --> 00:27:58.900
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Well, I love
the way Vic put it yesterday

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.530
in his keynote.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:03.640
He said technology should get
out of the way so that we can

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.980
do what we're really here to
do-- live, learn, and love.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.220
Those are the things that are
important in people's lives

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.440
and technology should not be
a bright, shiny object that

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.500
detracts from that.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.620
On the contrary, it should
empower that and enable that,

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.990
and that's what we're trying
to do at Google writ large,

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.730
but also at Google+, is sort of
get the technology out of

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.900
the way and allow that
connection to happen.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.560
And it informs our design, it
informs our product direction,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.710
and it informs the thinking.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.340
One of the things I
loved yesterday--

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:41.020
it was a long keynote, but the
thread of people and of

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.490
living, learning, loving, and
the connection was present

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.340
throughout every presenter's
moment up there.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.440
LOUIS GRAY: Concluding
with Larry.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.150
I think one of the things we've
touched on a few times

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.680
with GDL at I/O is at Google,
we actually have an

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.050
opportunity to hear from Larry
about once a week,

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.540
some people even more.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.630
And the interesting thing about
Larry is he doesn't talk

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.550
about product, details,
and features and get

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:03.940
deep down in it.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.400
He talks about the way that it
can transform humanity, and

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.990
the opportunity that's available
through technology,

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.300
and the things that Google
should be doing.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.730
And I thought it was a real
pleasure to see that kind of

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.130
direct access to Larry by all
the developers who are here

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.520
and those who are watching on
the Live Stream as well.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.110
And I think the type of things
you're talking about, which

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.780
are very emotive and feeling
oriented, are something that

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.270
has been a key for Google+ from
the beginning and we're

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.980
really seeing comes
from the very top.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.080
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah,
it really does.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.580
And you said he doesn't
get into the details.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.280
He actually does, and he has got
fantastic insights at that

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.040
level, too.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.190
But I think you're right.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:47.260
What is thrilling is to be a
part of that vision, to think

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.740
about the way that Larry thinks
about the problems, to

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.710
catch some of that yesterday
when he was saying things

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.970
like, "we should be building
products that don't yet

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.620
exist."

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.920
It is so natural for us as
humans to gravitate to the

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.160
comfortable, the known, to think
of things in reference

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.170
to other things, and we don't
even realize how much that

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.000
inhibits our creativity.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.080
And Larry is just masterful
at breaking through those

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.170
constraints and barriers and
upleveling people's thinking

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.770
to greatness.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.480
He's a really great model
of that, but he

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.080
also inspires others.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.990
And so I was thrilled that he
had a chance to literally

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.630
inspire millions yesterday and
give people a taste of what

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.550
it's like to work with
him and for him.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.460
LOUIS GRAY: It was
exceptional.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.340
I'm glad you touched on that.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.170
The very first person I spoke to
at GDL at I/O yesterday was

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.610
Megan Smith, VP of Google X. We
talked about Moonshots, and

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.510
it's really an incredible
opportunity to change the

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.270
world at a big level.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.130
And so I definitely thank
you for coming on.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.570
We're just about out of time.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.480
And right up after this, we have
Seth Sternberg on Google+

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.440
as well talking about
Google+ Sign In.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.770
To we're going to lead with
you and cut over to Seth.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:03.590
So for those of you watching
on the stream, stay tuned.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.650
While we're getting Seth ready,
go ahead and make sure

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:07.630
to take the time to go to
YouTube and subscribe to

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.820
Google Developers.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.800
Thank you very much, Bradley.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.310
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.910
It was a pleasure.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.160
LOUIS GRAY: Appreciate it.
