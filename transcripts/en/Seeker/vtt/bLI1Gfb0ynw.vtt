00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.300
Gene therapy has the potential to save
millions of lives

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.300
if we can just figure out how to make it
work.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.990
Hey peeps, thanks for tuning in to Dnews. I'm Trace. Gene therapy sounds like

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.720
a nice easy treatment right that's
therapy. In some ways it is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.920
on the macro level, but in your cells
it's a little bit invasive.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.789
In gene therapy, doctors are basically
hacking the DNA of a living human.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.920
Using genetically engineered
retroviruses called vectors,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.210
scientists infect human cells. The
retrovirus can be programmed to carry a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.700
gene or a little bit of DNA that will
overwrite

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.250
the messed up mutation and make it work
properly. It was first tried on a young girl

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.070
in 1990 and despite some

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.120
early failures it has the potential to
revolutionize treatment of genetic

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.739
disorders.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.390
The Journal of Science describes one of the
recent successes that gene therapists say

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.629
was really exciting. A few children were
born with metachromatic leukodystrophy

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.660
which causes

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.760
a defective immune system and some brain
disorders and kids who have it usually

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.949
don't live past the age of five. Bone
marrow contains stem cells, the cells

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.379
normally produce red blood cells but
they can be reprogrammed using gene

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.760
therapy it's a little risky, but

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.869
it can work. Taking bone marrow from
these kids doctors were able to infect

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.130
the cells with a retrovirus and replace
the stem cells mutated gene with the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.950
repaired gene.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.820
Then they re-injected that back into
the patient and the fixed cells multiplied

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.850
and as of the time we filmed this, the
patients are all in good condition,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.009
and are heading to kindergarten at that
time that others with that disease can't

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:23.630
even speak.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.759
There maybe future side effects but they
seem pretty happy with the result at the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.189
moment

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.530
I mean I would be. Science just helped some
kids! Whoo!

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.150
It's not just useful in children. Scientists
have also used gene therapy on dogs to

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.840
cure them of Type 1 Diabetes with two
of their doggie patients still alive

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.399
years later. The treatment involved
injecting two things into dogs' muscles.

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.619
One gene to send glucose and an enzyme
to dictate glucose absorption. Scientists

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.399
don't have to target

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.520
our DNA, they can also use gene therapy
to target the DNA of cancer cells.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.829
It's like they gave cancer cancer. You've seen
this before if you've been following

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.549
Dnews. A protein called CD47 is like a
passport that tells your immune system

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.979
not to attack a cell.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.219
Normally cancer produces a ton of CD47.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.990
Using gene therapy on the cancer,
scientist turned off that cell

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.399
production and let the immune system
blow it out of the sky like a decloaked

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.390
Klingon bird of prey

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.930
Gene therapy is still in its infancy but
the promise of future cures for

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.739
everything from cancer to genetic
disorders is pretty incredible

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.890
And I for one cannot wait to see what
this brings. What do you think of gene

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.420
therapy?

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.190
How do you see it being used in the
future? Tell us your thoughts and keep

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.550
coming back for Dnews every day!
