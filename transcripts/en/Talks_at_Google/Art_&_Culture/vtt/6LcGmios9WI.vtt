[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.990
SPEAKER: I'm very excited to
have this guest here, Mr. Mike

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.980
Posner.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.300
Since 2009, he's been a
household name in music.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.540
"31 Minutes to Take Off," his
debut album, was incredible.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.206
"At Night, Alone" number 12
on the Billboard Top 200.

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:26.330
You might know him from
hits like "Cooler Than Me,"

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.410
"Please Don't Go," "I
Took a Pill in Ibiza,"

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.989
which got 1.5 billion
streams worldwide.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.530
You might not know
that he's actually

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.800
responsible for hits
like "Sugar" by Maroon 5

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.630
and "Boyfriend" by
Justin Bieber, as well.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.900
And then, what I want
to really focus on here

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.880
is his new podcast,
which is incredible.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.820
It's called, "What
Does This All Mean?"

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.600
And he asks really deep kind
of existential questions,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.516
meaningful questions.

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.390
He brings incredible
kind of spiritual people

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.090
like Deepak Chopra, like
Sharon Salzberg on his podcast.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.540
He talks about what the meaning
of life is, and meditation,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.690
and how to make yourself
feel good every day.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.400
And it's incredible.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.950
It's almost like a
modern "Meditations"

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.820
by Marcus Aurelius.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.490
Because this is a guy who's in
the arena, he's making music,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.900
he's making hits.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.450
But he's also talking about
the most important questions

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.480
in life.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.384
So I'm really excited to have
him here and get started.

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:23.550
Thank you, Mike, for coming.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.997
MIKE POSNER: Thank you
for that sweet intro.

00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:26.830
SPEAKER: No problem.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.150
MIKE POSNER: I'm excited too.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.760
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.740
So why don't you just
give us a little bit

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.960
of context, two
to three minutes,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.860
your childhood until now, just
so the audience kind of knows.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.040
MIKE POSNER: Dang,
two to three minutes?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.390
Let's see I was born
in Detroit, Michigan.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.100
I lived there until I was
2, when my family moved

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.780
to Southfield,
Michigan, which is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.620
a suburb that borders Detroit.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.860
And a lot of people are probably
familiar with the film "8

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.930
Mile," but they may not
know the significance

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.790
of the road, 8 Mile.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.870
8 Mile's a huge road.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.300
It's a main road,
and it's significant

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.800
because it is the border
between Detroit and the suburbs.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.970
So I lived right on the
other side of 8 mile--

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.040
12 Mile, in the city
called Southfield.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.430
Southfield's a special place.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.420
Demographically, it's
pretty similar to Detroit,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.780
though, I would say,
economically, it's a little--

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.230
people are a little more
well-off in Southfield.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.880
But it's a largely
African American city.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.990
And I grew up there and
got into hip hop music

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.540
when I was very young.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.140
And when I was in
middle school, I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.605
remember having a sleep over
at my buddy's house, Ronnie,

00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:57.480
and my other friend
Aaron Webster were there.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.250
And we all gathered up CDs
that had no words, only music,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.532
and we were all going
to try freestyling.

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:06.740
And we all were in the
basement, and we were rapping.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.820
And they were
like, that was fun.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.280
And I just knew I was not
going to stop doing that, ever.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.640
And I haven't really.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.557
SPEAKER: There you go.

00:03:15.557 --> 00:03:16.431
MIKE POSNER: So yeah.

00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:17.940
I went to finish
high school there,

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.380
and I went to college
at Duke University.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.880
Shout out.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.660
[LAUGHING] Go, Devils.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.130
And when I got to Duke, I
started to sing my raps.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.990
I had just rapped that whole
the time, and I also made beats.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.770
And I got a little
ahead of myself.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.270
But in Detroit,
right before I left,

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.370
I met this guy Sean who
I used to work with,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.810
who later became Big Sean.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.320
And I was part of his crew.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.200
And so I went to Duke, and I
would make beats for Big Sean.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.900
SPEAKER: How did
you meet Big Sean?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.350
MIKE POSNER: I met Big
Sean because my mom told me

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.400
I had to get a job
after senior year.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.830
And so I looked online.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.745
I found that one of the hip
hop stations in Detroit--

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:06.490
it was called
HOT102.7 at the time.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.540
I think it's changed names
and frequency since then--

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.840
was hiring interns.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.940
So I went in, did an interview.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.390
And there was line out the
door, and surprisingly, they

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.649
hired me.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.980
And one of the other interns
was this rapper named Pat Piff.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.340
And we worked together,
and we became really close.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.870
And we used to
like fold T-shirts

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.840
and get people coffee
and stuff like that.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.830
And Pat was in a group
with Sean at the time.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.790
They were a duo.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.490
And Sean had just
met Kanye, and, like,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.130
they were courting each other.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.830
And then I went to school.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.110
And you know, to make
a long story short,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.700
I started to sing my raps.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.857
I don't know why.

00:04:56.857 --> 00:04:58.190
Maybe it was the warmer weather.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.510
And I just thought--

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.550
I thought it would be
cool to hear someone

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.040
sing the way I wanted
to hear a singer sing,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.310
being a hip hop fan.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.660
Because that's like--
I just loved hip hop.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.960
So my first hit song, the
song, "Cooler Than Me"--

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.470
and it's got a sort of an
internal rhyme scheme, which

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.990
is atypical for a singer to do.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.741
But very typical
for a rapper to do.

00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:27.990
So what I'm talking about
is there's a line that goes,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.380
(singing) you got
designer shades just

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.060
to hide your face face.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.460
So not just-- it's not
just shades and face

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.580
that are rhyming, but
"designer" and "hide your"

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.390
are also rhyming.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.330
And I just thought that
was dope because I didn't

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.530
hear people sing like that.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.280
I heard people rap
like that, but I didn't

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.840
hear people sing like that.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.670
And so I made a mix
tape in my dorm room.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.350
That was one of the songs.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.620
And Sean gave me three
verses for my mixtape.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.700
A mixtape is like a free album.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.310
And it's not done legally.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.130
You just put it out for free.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:10.010
And I found this sort of
loophole in iTunes U. ITunes U,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.270
I believe it still exists.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.900
But it was set up for professors
to put their lectures up

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.640
online for free.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.800
And this was at the
height of pirating.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.320
There was a few years in
there where pirating really

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.300
got out of control
before iTunes really

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.620
rescued the music industry.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.221
And it was in that time.

00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:33.470
And I was stealing everything.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.162
I had the Duke internet.

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:36.120
SPEAKER: LimeWire and--

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.870
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.070
We used the BitTorrents.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.021
And so I remember we had--

00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:43.437
I remember getting--
we had Kanye,

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:44.660
"Graduation," a week early.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.120
You get everything a
week early because that's

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.560
when the record labels will send
the music to the actual plants

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.400
to make the CDs.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.930
So the plants had the music,
and they would leak it.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.354
Anyways, I knew, if I'm
stealing Kanye's album,

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.770
I know no one's going to pay
for mine because no one knows

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.860
who I am.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.120
So I found out who
ran iTunes U at Duke.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.470
And his name was Todd Stabley,
and he was from Southfield.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.420
So I was like, listen,
man, I'm a student.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.620
I got this album.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.500
And long story short, he let
me put my mix tape on iTunes U.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.740
So you could go on iTunes
and search Mike Posner.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.590
My mixtape would come up.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.930
But this is the important thing.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.420
It would come up,
and it was free.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.340
You just click it.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.290
It didn't have a price.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.051
And that was a huge
catalyst for me

00:07:40.051 --> 00:07:41.300
at the beginning of my career.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.930
That, on top of the fact
that Big Sean gave me

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.110
three verses on that mix tape.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.150
So people kind of
checked it out.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.190
And I think people liked it.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.966
That's a big part of it too.

00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:57.590
You can have all those things in
place, and if no one likes it,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.820
it doesn't really matter.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.630
But I think--

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.630
I'd been making music
12 years at that point.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.250
I think it was good.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.080
It was good music.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.420
And it took me 12 years to
make something like that.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.510
It was my own before--

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.330
I'd have my Dilla month
and my Just Blaze month

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.710
and my Timbaland month.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.010
And that definitely
had influences,

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.940
but it was
unmistakably my music.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.670
SPEAKER: Right.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.940
MIKE POSNER: And, yeah, that's
when my career got started.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.550
SPEAKER: Did you have kind
of an "I made it" moment?

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.740
You have a really
great podcast episode

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.711
where you talk about
meeting Kanye a few times.

00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:36.169
And you're very
nervous around him.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.575
Then you meet Jay, who
actually signs you.

00:08:38.575 --> 00:08:39.950
MIKE POSNER: Jay
did not sign me.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.620
SPEAKER: He didn't sign you?

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.610
MIKE POSNER: He
came close, though.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.000
SPEAKER: OK.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.340
MIKE POSNER: He
made me an offer.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:43.860
SPEAKER: OK.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.901
Oh, he made you an offer?

00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:45.590
OK.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.540
Got you.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.120
Was there a moment where
you were like, I made it.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.340
This is it-- maybe being
in the office with Jay-Z,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.000
or the release of "Cooler Than
Me" and it just blowing up.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
MIKE POSNER: Well, yeah.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.830
That's a funny thing.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:04.010
All those moments had their
thrill that went with them.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.770
But that's one of the things
I get into in the podcast,

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.040
is it seemed to really
be a moving target where

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.730
the thing that I thought
would be the "I made it"

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:19.130
moment felt good for
maybe an hour, maybe

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.860
a week, depending on
how big the thrill.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.980
But then I felt the same.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.420
My experience of
life felt the same.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.080
And it's not that
my life got worse

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.920
when I got popular or more
well known or made more money.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.730
It's that I thought it would
get better, and it was the same.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.770
And that was very
disillusioning to me.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.960
And I have a series of goals
and things I'm working on now.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:58.110
But I know they're not really
going to change my life.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.872
Like I want to win a Grammy.

00:09:59.872 --> 00:10:01.330
I know I'm going
to get the Grammy,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.930
and it'll feel cool
for a week or two.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.747
And I'll still be me.

00:10:08.747 --> 00:10:10.830
SPEAKER: If you have that
kind of broader outlook,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:16.200
and you understand the
meaninglessness of material

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.240
things and progress
like that, what

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.580
motivates you at this
point in your life

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.270
now that you're
more [? kind of-- ?]

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:21.750
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.958
It's an interesting question.

00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.400
And I'm not sure I have
the full answer to it.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.340
Because there is a part of me--
and one of the questions I ask

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.390
on the podcast I don't
have an answer to--

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.430
that, I don't know
if anything matters.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.420
I don't know if any--

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:45.720
people will say, like, well, we
have to solve global warming.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.420
We have to solve
global warming if we

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:56.310
want humans to continue being
a species that's alive, right?

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.090
But I'm unclear as to
why that matters if we're

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.410
a species that's alive or not.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.410
You see what I'm saying?

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.993
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:11:03.993 --> 00:11:06.810
MIKE POSNER: And how do we
know that's a good thing?

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.280
It could actually
be a bad thing.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.700
We might be in the
way of something else.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.890
And I think, if
I had the answer,

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.950
I would probably say
it's not good or bad.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.052
It just doesn't matter.

00:11:20.052 --> 00:11:25.390
So, yeah, it's interesting.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.970
It's like, how do you
organize your life

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:32.600
when is desire enough?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.670
It's like, I want to do this
thing or experience this thing.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.380
So is that how I
organize my life?

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.110
I'd go chase all the things
I desire, and organize,

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.720
and then it's over one day.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.100
I don't know.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.160
SPEAKER: Were you always
asking these questions?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.020
When you were on the
come-up and just trying

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.811
to make it in music,
were you also thinking

00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:57.440
about these larger existential
and spiritual questions?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.670
MIKE POSNER: Not so much.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:04.130
If anything, I feel I've had
the privilege to ask them now.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:10.460
Because people-- like, I'm
sure everyone in this room

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.550
has been told money doesn't
buy happiness, right?

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.540
If you haven't been told that
directly, you've heard that.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.180
And I was told that
directly by my parents.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.150
And when people would say
that to me, I would nod.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.530
But in my head, I
would think you just

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.922
didn't make enough money.

00:12:29.922 --> 00:12:31.505
You didn't make it
past the threshold.

00:12:31.505 --> 00:12:33.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.970
And I'm going to
make more than you.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.470
So fast forward to like age 22.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.640
I was a multimillionaire.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.270
And like I said, my experience
of life didn't change.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:54.940
So I got the privilege of
asking, if not that, then what?

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.580
And people have different
theories about "then what?"

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.866
I'm not here proselytizing
for any of them.

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:05.740
There's some things that
I do in my life that

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.900
seem to make me happier.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.150
But I don't think they're
the capital T Truth

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.050
or the only one,
the correct way,

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.360
because I don't
think there is one.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.380
I wish there were.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.820
It would be more simple, right?

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.445
SPEAKER: Right.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:21.310
MIKE POSNER: But it's
nuanced, you know?

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.120
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.245
MIKE POSNER: Unfortunately.

00:13:23.245 --> 00:13:24.500
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.360
It seems like you have a lot
of new, very interesting role

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.520
models that you bring
onto the podcast,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.500
or spiritual teachers--

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.370
people like Deepak Chopra
and Sharon Salzberg.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.720
Can you talk about maybe
two to three of those people

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.040
and what they mean to you?

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.445
MIKE POSNER: Deepak
to me means--

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.840
he's written something like 80
books or something like that.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.995
I haven't read any of them.

00:13:59.995 --> 00:14:01.620
I think I probably
will, at some point.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.370
But I haven't yet.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.350
I met him before
I got into his--

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.470
I listened to some of his is
YouTubes and stuff like that.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:15.190
But for me, he means someone
who is on their sadhana--

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.220
which means, like,
spiritual path--

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.725
while in the world, like
in the thick of things.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.830
I think he's done one of
these talks at Google.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.440
He's not in a cave
somewhere, but he

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:34.840
seems to be doing the cave
work while being in the world.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.960
So that's what he means to me.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:50.880
Sharon, to me, means someone who
just has really done the work,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:59.430
is doing the work, and
seems to live according

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:05.990
to her beliefs, which I respect
anyone who does that, even

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.000
when I don't agree with their--

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.020
I work with some artists that
are very sort of hardcore

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.890
Christians.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.950
And I may not agree
with all their beliefs.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.170
I actually agree
with some of them.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.630
But I have respect for when
they actually live that way.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.850
Like I know, OK, he
won't sing on a song

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.909
because I cursed in it.

00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:29.200
I want to have him on the song.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.580
But I really respect that
guy for actually saying no.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.410
So I think of her in that way.

00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:41.140
Yeah.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.860
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.951
So talk about your creative
process a little bit.

00:15:43.951 --> 00:15:44.950
We were talking earlier.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.830
And you were saying that you
just whip out the laptop,

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.240
and you just start
recording wherever you are.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.760
Do you think that there's a
way to generate creativity?

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.560
Do you ever get
stuck and feel like I

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.090
can't make music right now?

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.130
MIKE POSNER: Sure.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:07.760
I'm blessed I'm in a place where
I don't have to make any music.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.700
And I try to be careful to
not just make music just

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.320
to make music.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.590
I do because it's fun.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.296
But I won't put something
out in the world just

00:16:18.296 --> 00:16:19.670
to put something
out in the world

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.710
so people keep talking about me.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.150
I want to do
something when I feel

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.610
like I have something to say.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.380
So nowadays-- You know,
they talk about the Malcolm

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.620
Gladwell 10,000 hours?

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.990
I did that for music.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.800
I wish there was other things
I had 10,000 hours in on.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.170
But for writing songs, me in
the studio, I've done that.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.480
And for some years I
would do a song a day--

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.230
record, produce, write,
everything finished.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.560
And so I've gone through that.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.080
And now I just wait until
it comes through me.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:08.730
So I don't really
try to write anymore.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.980
I just wait until
writing happens.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.867
SPEAKER: What would you
say this new-- you're

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:14.950
making a new album, right?

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.824
MIKE POSNER: Correct.

00:17:15.824 --> 00:17:19.250
SPEAKER: What would
you say it's about?

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.700
Just talk about what it
means to you, what you're

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.440
trying to express by making it.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.240
MIKE POSNER: It's
trying to express

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:35.530
truth, the capital T Truth,
which is hard to do with words.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.700
Because words are
symbols of reality.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:46.810
So like the word water
is a symbol for that.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.950
Or the word two
is a symbol for--

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.660
it isn't actually that.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.650
It's a symbol for it.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.010
Or Ramdas says, your words
are all fingers pointing

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.660
at the moon, they
are not the moon.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.290
SPEAKER: Right.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.520
MIKE POSNER: And
I personally feel

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:10.510
like I can get closer
to the Truth with music.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.590
I think that's why I do it.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.600
I've been trying to
get better at speaking.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.460
But for a long time I felt--

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.920
I would hear myself
speak, like a recording,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.480
or I'd see an
interview of myself.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.150
And it felt like I was wearing
a costume, the way I spoke.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.630
It seemed like the only way
I could really express or get

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.722
close to the Truth
was with music.

00:18:36.722 --> 00:18:37.305
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:37.305 --> 00:18:38.960
Well, I think you're
doing great today.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.126
MIKE POSNER: Thank you, man.

00:18:40.126 --> 00:18:41.860
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.557
So you spent like seven
days alone in a cabin.

00:18:44.557 --> 00:18:46.640
And I think, like, day
five or six, you were like,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.570
what would a world
without language be?

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.000
Was that what you were referring
to when you were, like,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.350
it's a symbol for water.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.860
It's not actually water?

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.860
MIKE POSNER: Well, yeah.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.757
I think I went a little
further that day.

00:19:02.757 --> 00:19:04.090
It was an interesting week, man.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:10.550
So I had felt called to
solitude for a while.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.320
I don't know why.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.180
Part of me was just curious.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:19.600
Part of me wanted to be able
to sound deep and cool when

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.835
I do stuff like this.

00:19:22.835 --> 00:19:25.210
And part of me thought maybe
there was actually something

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.040
there for me to discover.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:33.100
So I spent a week this
summer, or this past summer,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:40.380
in a cabin on the property of a
Buddhist monastery in Colorado.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.310
And they had a main monastery,
but this was up there.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.260
It's set up for you
not to see anyone

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.930
and no one to see you for as
long as you want to be there.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.850
So, yeah, so on the
fifth day, I started

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.400
to think more about language.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.950
Because language is really
set up to differentiate.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.130
It's there so we can
tell the difference

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.760
between the notebook
and the jeans

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.390
and the shoes and the hand.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.530
That's what the words do.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.540
Otherwise, it might just
be one [? hutch-- ?]

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.030
It's just reality.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:18.010
So I realized, I'm sitting in
this cabin trying to experience

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.520
the oneness of the universe.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.760
But my thoughts are in English.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.480
So if I'm experiencing reality
through language, which

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.701
is set up to
differentiate, how could I

00:20:31.701 --> 00:20:32.700
ever experience oneness?

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.010
And that begs the question.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.650
Is there a way to think
outside of language?

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:42.720
Maybe you guys do.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.520
I don't know how anyone
else's brain works.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:51.530
But my thoughts, most of
them I think are in words.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.020
They're in language.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.780
So is there a way to
think outside of words?

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.955
I think there is.

00:20:58.955 --> 00:21:05.320
And I think that, maybe, is
the most powerful technology

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.697
we could create,
is a way to switch.

00:21:09.697 --> 00:21:11.280
Because there's no
doubt that language

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.170
is valuable for
other things, right?

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.590
But to experience unity,
maybe isn't so valuable.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.530
Is there a way that we
can flip back and forth

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.449
between those two modes?

00:21:21.449 --> 00:21:21.990
I don't know.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.930
You guys should figure that out.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.180
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:23.970
You're at Google.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.740
So we'll meet afterwards.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.490
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:21:28.884 --> 00:21:30.300
SPEAKER: "I Took
a Pill In Ibiza."

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.790
Can you take us through
the making of it,

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.920
what you were thinking
when you were writing it?

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.672
MIKE POSNER: Sure.

00:21:35.672 --> 00:21:37.880
SPEAKER: And then how it
got picked up with the remix

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.660
and everything like that?

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.410
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:46.190
So I was in the studio with a
country artist, a wonderful guy

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.210
named Jake Owen.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.175
You know Jake Owen?

00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:49.550
SPEAKER: I don't.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.930
MIKE POSNER: He's a
sick country singer.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.971
You should check him out.

00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:53.680
And he's popular right now.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.180
SPEAKER: OK.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.500
MIKE POSNER: He's one of
the bigger country artists

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.000
right now.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.910
I know you're a hip hop guy.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.743
SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:59.743 --> 00:22:01.786
MIKE POSNER: Like me.

00:22:01.786 --> 00:22:03.642
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:05.182 --> 00:22:09.650
So Jake, he used to cover
a song from my first album

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:10.889
on his tour.

00:22:10.889 --> 00:22:11.930
I guess he just liked it.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.950
So we tweeted, ended up
going to this-- he was in LA.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.320
He invited me come
to the studio.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.880
So I went to the
studio with him,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.800
and we're just hanging out.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.150
And we're doing what we
call past the guitar.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.260
I play a song for him,
pass the guitar to him,

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.250
he plays one, pass
it back, et cetera,

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.980
and just going back and forth.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.870
I played him and
old tune of mine.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.690
And he goes, I really
like this song.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.940
What inspired it?

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.630
I said, it's about a girl I
had a thing with in New York.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.323
And then some of it I
just kind of made up.

00:22:50.323 --> 00:22:51.710
[CHUCKLE]

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.670
And he looked at
me-- yeah, exactly.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:00.017
He looked at me, and he
goes, well, why don't you

00:23:00.017 --> 00:23:00.850
just tell the truth?

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.210
I guess I looked sort
of quizzical back.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.339
And he qualified it.

00:23:07.339 --> 00:23:09.130
He said, you know
there's writers out there

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.709
that just tell the truth.

00:23:11.709 --> 00:23:12.750
He goes, let me show you.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.410
And he played me a
Hank Williams Jr. Song.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.970
And he played me some old
Merle Haggard and these guys.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:24.370
It actually felt
really hip-hop to me.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.700
But in a lot of ways,
it connected with me

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.550
more because their stories--

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.710
well, it shared that
authenticity of hip hop.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.810
If you're a rapper and you lie,
and people find out you lied,

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.760
it's kind of a big deal.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.440
Like, If we find out Rihanna
doesn't write her songs,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.400
we know that.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.210
It's fine.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.805
She's Rhianna.

00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:49.585
She's an amazing artist.

00:23:49.585 --> 00:23:51.289
But remember when
that thing came out

00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:52.580
that Drake didn't write a song?

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.200
It's a huge deal, right?

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.060
It's like a scandal because
authenticity matters

00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.740
in hip-hop.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.410
It matters that you're
telling the truth.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.420
And the same is true in country.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.980
And so these guys, kind
of like Merle Haggard--

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.570
these guys will
tell these stories.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.459
But their stories
sounded like my story.

00:24:14.459 --> 00:24:16.500
Because it was like, oh,
I experienced this fame,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.240
I fell off, and no one
cares about me now.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.100
And it just blew my mind.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.160
It blew my mind.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.740
I left that studio,
and I was invited

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.081
to go with a friend to the
Winter Olympics in Russia.

00:24:31.081 --> 00:24:31.580
I left.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.470
I went on a plane.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.770
And Jake had recorded
some of these songs

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.819
of him singing all their songs.

00:24:38.819 --> 00:24:39.860
And I had the recordings.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.740
And I was just listening to
them over and over again.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.580
And this was on a plane that,
"I took a pill" just immediately

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.910
just kind of came out.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.550
I wrote it down.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.540
I think I meditated on the
plane, and some of the melodies

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.040
came.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.200
I landed in Russia,
and I put chords

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.730
to what was in my notebook.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:11.235
And then later, I thought
the song was done,

00:25:11.235 --> 00:25:13.390
but it didn't have
the chorus yet.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.090
So it didn't have-- (SINGING)
all I know besides--

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.740
wasn't in it yet.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.100
And I was ready for a tour.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.770
And I was going to play "I Took
a Pill in Ibiza" on the tour.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.900
And I was rehearsing it
just alone in my house.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.120
And I thought, man,
this song needs

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.094
a part the audience can
sing with me right away.

00:25:34.094 --> 00:25:36.010
And then obviously no
one knows this song yet.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.240
It's brand new.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.810
I haven't even recorded it yet.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:44.080
So while I was rehearsing for
the show, I made up that part--

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.240
(SINGING) all I know besides--

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.660
because I just wanted them to be
able to sing something with me.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.290
And then that's when the song--

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.150
the writing was complete.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:04.080
And you get a song that you
like, or a good recording--

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.130
I've written thousands
of songs in my life.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:11.130
Probably less than
5% of the songs

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:16.340
I write go out in
the world because I

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.630
don't think all them are good.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.710
SPEAKER: Do you just write
in a notebook all day?

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.126
MIKE POSNER: Yeah,
or some of them

00:26:21.126 --> 00:26:23.580
are full songs I
write on the guitar,

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.180
or sometimes you
write to a beat.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.290
So you make a beat first.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:31.400
So I'm 29, and I
started when I was 8.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.970
So it's 21 years of writing--

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.430
I've written all different ways.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.140
Sometimes people say, do
you write a lyric first

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.920
or music first?

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.680
I'm like, I've
done it every way.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.380
SPEAKER: Right.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.110
MIKE POSNER: So anyways,
you get a song you like,

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.680
you think it's good,
I'll spend as long

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.210
as I need to on the recording
til I think it's right.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.200
So it took a while to--

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.560
maybe five different versions,
productions of the song.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.900
And I put out the
version I liked,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.572
which I did in London
with Martin Terefe.

00:27:00.572 --> 00:27:02.720
And that's a little
interesting about music

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.480
is you get a sound in
your head that you hear

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.647
the way it's going to sound.

00:27:06.647 --> 00:27:08.938
And then you don't know where
that's going to take you.

00:27:08.938 --> 00:27:10.910
Sometimes there's a
guy that has that sound

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.790
in San Francisco, or
New York, or London,

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.675
or wherever, Atlanta.

00:27:15.675 --> 00:27:16.300
You don't know.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.700
You chase it.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.450
I ended up in London
because this guy,

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.520
he had the song I
heard in my head.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.040
And we did the track.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:31.530
And then I just went
back to practicing guitar

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.530
in my own world.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.840
And I have these great guys
I work with out at my label--

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.470
Zeke and Matt.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.220
And they called, and
they said, is it cool

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.350
if we get a remix done?

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.246
I said, of course.

00:27:42.246 --> 00:27:43.620
Because on my mix
tapes, I always

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.480
remixed other people's songs.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.330
And I was just doing my
thing, and I didn't really

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.550
pay attention to it.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.550
And I had a really long beard.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:01.190
I was living in my van
at the time in Utah.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.640
And then my manager called.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.330
He was like, that song, the
remix is number one in Norway.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.800
I was like, that's interesting.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:16.770
And it just kind of spread from
there and became this big song.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.299
And so yeah.

00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:18.840
I don't know.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.780
I think I'm kind of lucky.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:28.430
I write a lot of
songs, and my music I

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:35.540
make because that's the music
I want to exist in the world.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.310
That's my job.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.890
That's any artist's job.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.880
You're supposed to create
what you want to be created.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.260
And that's it-- not what I
think you would like to hear,

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.730
or you, or you.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.010
And it gets a little muddy.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.390
Create what I want,
and that's what I do.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.530
And it seems, every once in a
while, a lot of people like--

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.910
there will be just some
random piece I make.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.342
And it gets super popular.

00:29:01.342 --> 00:29:03.050
SPEAKER: Do you feel
like you could tell?

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:03.610
Do you know--

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:04.810
MIKE POSNER: No.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.750
I know when it's good to me.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.180
And when I wrote that
song, I was proud of that.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.050
But I'm proud of a
lot of stuff I make.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:16.320
So I didn't-- no, I didn't
think it would be on the radio.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.670
I put a drug reference
in the title.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.855
So I didn't think it
would be on the radio.

00:29:20.855 --> 00:29:21.775
SPEAKER: Right, right.

00:29:21.775 --> 00:29:26.050
Do you think maybe that was part
of it, the controversy element?

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.390
MIKE POSNER: It
probably didn't hurt.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.050
I knew that naming it that--

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.745
if I saw it, I felt like I
would want to click on that.

00:29:32.745 --> 00:29:33.370
SPEAKER: Right.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.660
MIKE POSNER: But I didn't think
it would play on pop radio

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.160
ever for that reason.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.105
SPEAKER: Right.

00:29:40.105 --> 00:29:42.980
Can you talk about some of your
musical influences in general?

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.760
We were talking about it
earlier, but from Detroit,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.780
and then in general
outside of Detroit as well.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.210
MIKE POSNER: Man,
there's so many.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.220
It's a really tough
question for me.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.930
And I don't want to dodge it.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:58.530
But what's going to happen
is there's just so many.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.560
SPEAKER: Could I
maybe confide to--

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.755
I'm a hip-hop guy, so hip hop?

00:30:03.755 --> 00:30:04.630
MIKE POSNER: Totally.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.850
We could do a top five.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.600
SPEAKER: Top five.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.840
Yeah, what's your top five?

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.940
MIKE POSNER: Dead or Alive?

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.080
SPEAKER: Dead or Alive.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.746
MIKE POSNER: OK.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:25.560
Nas, Three Stacks, Eminem.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.780
Oh, I'm running out.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:36.050
See, I want to say Pac,
and I want to say Biggie,

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.630
and I want to say Jay-Z. But
I only have two spots left.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:39.213
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:30:39.213 --> 00:30:43.145
So who's going to be in
[? the-- ?] you can't do six.

00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:46.465
MIKE POSNER: This is
always what happens, right?

00:30:46.465 --> 00:30:50.379
I'll do Pac and Hoba.

00:30:50.379 --> 00:30:50.920
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.290
So you left Biggie out?

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.998
MIKE POSNER: I left
Biggie out this time.

00:30:53.998 --> 00:30:55.810
My top five is kind of fluid--

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:56.780
SPEAKER: Yeah, OK.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.810
MIKE POSNER: --today.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.635
SPEAKER: Do you still
do any rapping, or--

00:30:59.635 --> 00:31:00.390
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:00.990
Yeah.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.737
SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:01.737 --> 00:31:03.320
MIKE POSNER: I still
rap, especially--

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:08.450
I have a band separate from
my music called Mansions.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.870
And Mansions is a duo.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.384
It's me and Blackbear.

00:31:11.384 --> 00:31:12.300
We have one album out.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.970
We put it out in March.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.030
I rap a lot on that album.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:22.020
And it's probably my best
record that I've been a part of.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:26.440
Just yeah-- it's a great record.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.150
I'm really proud of that one.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:32.400
SPEAKER: What are your top books
or philosophies or books that

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.040
have inspired you?

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:34.998
MIKE POSNER: Top books.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.370
Whenever someone's
going through something,

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.990
and they ask me a question,
I always say "Alchemist."

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.990
You can read it in a day.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:52.320
I know 99.9% of the people
that read it will like it.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.340
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.820
Do you believe in that concept
of manifesting your fate?

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.570
MIKE POSNER: I do.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.070
I do believe in the
law of attraction.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:05.510
I really do, which,
in essence, is

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:08.650
you get what you think about.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.010
But there's a subtlety
to it, which is--

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:17.750
for example, if I want to have
another hit song, if I think

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.110
about I'm going to have another
hit song, the law of attraction

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.240
says I'll get it.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.500
But if I think about--

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:29.340
I don't have it yet, when
is it coming, what's wrong,

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.720
why isn't it here yet--

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.914
I'll get more of what's wrong?

00:32:32.914 --> 00:32:33.830
Why isn't it here yet?

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.580
I'm manifesting that.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.440
So there's a subtlety to it.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.390
And I do believe in that.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.750
And it kind of makes
sense, like rationally,

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.090
without the woo woo of it.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:49.890
If I'm focused on what I want,
and these kind of opportunities

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.930
show up in my life, I'll be more
apt to notice them and chase

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:53.430
them.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.470
I see them as opportunities.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.620
Whereas, if I'm in a
pessimistic mindset,

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.915
I may not even walk through that
door because it doesn't matter.

00:33:05.915 --> 00:33:08.820
So I do believe in that.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.580
So some of the books that--

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:18.550
one, kind of my
story of believing

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:24.210
in more than I can see with
that goes back to Big Sean.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:28.830
So after we did a mixtape,
and a couple of years pass,

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:32.700
my career leapfrogs his.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.520
And he was stagnant for a while.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.090
And his music--
he'd been signed,

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:39.520
like, five years, nothing
was really happening,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.610
and then all of a sudden, boom.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:42.780
His career explodes.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.530
And I went to see him in the
studio one day in Hollywood.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.715
And he was just glowing.

00:33:49.715 --> 00:33:52.200
You ever around a
person, and you just

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.970
feel really good
around-- and they

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.860
make you feel good
just by being-- they're

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.760
not doing anything special.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.279
It was like that.

00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:02.070
And I went over to his
studio the next day.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.070
And I was like, what's
up with you, man?

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.570
What?

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.934
He's like, you got to
read these two books.

00:34:06.934 --> 00:34:08.350
The first one was
"The Alchemist."

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.010
The second one was
"Ask and It Is Given,"

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.810
by Esther and Jerry
Hicks, which is all

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.120
about the law of attraction.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.235
And those two books are--

00:34:17.235 --> 00:34:18.610
I don't know if
he still does it.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.279
But he used to carry
that, "Ask And it

00:34:20.279 --> 00:34:21.549
Is Given" with him everywhere.

00:34:21.549 --> 00:34:22.120
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.030
MIKE POSNER: He had on in his--
and it would all be worn out

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.699
and stuff.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:30.300
And I've seen it work.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:35.573
My career, after
my first album, I

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:38.261
put out my first single, which
was that song "Cooler Than Me,"

00:34:38.261 --> 00:34:39.469
which I talked about earlier.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:43.139
And it was his big hit
all over the world.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:47.129
And I thought that's what
happens when I put out singles.

00:34:47.129 --> 00:34:51.770
And so I put out another one.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.870
And everyone would tell
me, like, it's a rare thing

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:55.540
to happen.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.800
But I was one for one.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.320
I'm 100%.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.520
So I put out my next one.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.280
It was a little less popular.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.830
Than my next one was a little
less popular than that.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:13.710
And slowly, my popularity
started to wane.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.640
And at the time--

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.210
it was interesting.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.215
We were talking, like--

00:35:16.215 --> 00:35:21.420
my self-identity was really
wrapped up in being popular,

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.910
like, the guy.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.590
Well, then it
started to disappear.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.620
And so I was like, OK.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.480
I'm still alive.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:37.480
But how I think of myself,
who I am doesn't apply.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.430
I'm not popular really anymore.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.720
So who am I?

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.990
And I had to figure that out.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:51.810
And I started telling this story
because my artist's career was

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.040
really considered over.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.330
I was considered a one-hit
wonder, which I was.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.852
And I was what, we call it in
the music industry, shelved,

00:36:03.852 --> 00:36:06.060
which means you're on a
label, but they have no plans

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.332
of releasing your album.

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:08.415
You're just kind of stuck.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:15.030
And to everyone
else, it was fun.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.580
It was over.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.640
But I would meditate everyday,
and I'd visualize it.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.720
And somehow I tricked
myself into thinking no.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.480
I'm going to have
another big song.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.310
I'm going to play
on Jimmy Fallon.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.547
I'm going to win the
song of the year Grammy

00:36:31.547 --> 00:36:32.880
or the album of the year Grammy.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.150
It was like one of those two.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.040
And I would just
focus on seeing it.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.030
And my mom would call.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.488
She's like, you
off that label yet?

00:36:39.488 --> 00:36:41.990
I'm like, no, Mom, but
it's all going to work out.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:43.242
Every week she would call.

00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:44.200
You off that label yet?

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.850
No, Mom, but it's all
going to work out.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.121
You off that label yet?

00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:48.620
No, Mom.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.790
Did you call your lawyer?

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:50.860
Yeah, I called my lawyer.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.870
But it's all going to work out.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:37:01.900
And it took a year, two years,
a lot of practicing my guitar,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.930
and doing my music, but
I had another hit song.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.150
I played on Jimmy Fallon,
and I got nominated

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.430
for song of the year Grammy.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.430
All this stuff, I wrote it down.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:19.180
It all happened,
except I didn't win it.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.680
Lost it to Adele.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.571
SPEAKER: It's a good
person to lose it to.

00:37:22.571 --> 00:37:23.320
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.165
But it was like--

00:37:24.165 --> 00:37:25.040
you know what I mean?

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.030
So I do believe in that stuff.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:32.764
And I do believe I'll win one of
those at some point in my life.

00:37:32.764 --> 00:37:34.430
SPEAKER: Putting it
out in the universe.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.920
MIKE POSNER: Yeah, I believe it.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.680
SPEAKER: It sounds like
that kind of down period

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.750
made you more stoic as well.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.270
Like you talk about in your
podcast, you make songs now,

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.686
and you're just like, I don't
know what's going to happen,

00:37:45.686 --> 00:37:48.840
but it's just about the process,
and putting it out there,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.010
and you being into the song.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:50.760
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.500
It's an important distinction.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.290
When I was younger, I was in
high school, and I would rap,

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:58.650
and I would do battles.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.940
And I skipped over that
in my two or three minutes

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.880
because I only had two
or three minutes then.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.300
I would do battles,
you know like Eminem.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.710
Like during the football
games, I'd be battling.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.710
I was really small then.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:10.780
SPEAKER: Did you
ever battle Big Sean?

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.650
MIKE POSNER: I
never battled him,

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:12.880
but we'd freestyle
a lot together.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.379
We'd actually
freestyle on the radio

00:38:14.379 --> 00:38:18.220
together in Detroit every
Friday, Freestyle Fridays.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.256
SPEAKER: Do you think
you're better than him?

00:38:20.256 --> 00:38:21.130
MIKE POSNER: Not now.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.060
But then, yeah.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.780
I thought I was.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.330
And I'm bias.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.790
Because hip hop is competitive.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:36.140
So yeah, 2006 Mike
versus 2006 Sean--

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.860
I think 2006 Mike
was better for sure.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.411
But that's my hip hop side.

00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:43.160
And it's my brother,
you know what I mean?

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.159
I wouldn't be in the chair
if it wasn't for him.

00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:47.043
But yeah, now, I think
he's another level.

00:38:47.043 --> 00:38:49.126
I think he's one of the
best in the world, period.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.960
And I don't rap
that much anymore.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:01.530
So he's leapfrogged me
by a lot in that arena.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:13.470
But that bombastic mentality
helped me in that period

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.460
because Sean got
signed before me.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.090
And because I thought I
was better than him, when

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.720
he got signed by Kanye
and Island Def Jam,

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.890
I knew I was going
to get signed too.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.700
I was like, that's my buddy.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.410
He made it real.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.120
So I thank him all
the time because he

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.620
made it real for all of us.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.569
You know, that can be done.

00:39:36.569 --> 00:39:37.860
SPEAKER: That can happen, yeah.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.630
MIKE POSNER: That can happen.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:43.050
And if you believe
in law of attraction,

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.590
it couldn't have happened
unless I started to believe it.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.687
And I wouldn't have believed
it until I saw him do it.

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:50.270
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.980
Are there daily habits that
you do that get you going,

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.430
keep you inspired?

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.430
MIKE POSNER: My daily routine
looks something like--

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.880
if I'm really in the
zone, like I want to be,

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.530
I'll wake up at 5:30.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.930
Sometimes like 6:45.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:11.090
But I wake up at 5:30.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.130
The first thing I
do is drink a huge--

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.050
I always keep water
right next to my bed.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.620
I drink a huge thing of water.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.210
We always drink gallon--
and call them G's.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.447
We have a gallon of water,
and we sip on it all day.

00:40:22.447 --> 00:40:24.530
And hopefully you finish
it by the end of the day.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.200
So I'll drink a ton of water,
and go to the bathroom,

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.390
brush my teeth, and then
I meditate 20 minutes,

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.200
and then I exercise.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:42.196
And that all happens before I go
off airplane mode on my phone.

00:40:42.196 --> 00:40:45.217
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:40:45.217 --> 00:40:47.050
Is there a podcast that
you feel like you've

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.130
learned the most from or
that's your favorite podcast?

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.600
I know you mentioned the one
about the loss of your father

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.001
and then Alex Benign was talking
about the loss of his father.

00:40:56.001 --> 00:40:57.250
Is that your favorite podcast?

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.416
MIKE POSNER: Of my episodes?

00:40:58.416 --> 00:41:00.551
SPEAKER: Of your episodes, yeah.

00:41:00.551 --> 00:41:02.050
MIKE POSNER: I
really like that one.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:06.970
And I really like the one,
which is just me talking

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:10.870
about my week in solitude.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:14.200
Because I feel like I went
pretty deep in that one.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.560
SPEAKER: Can you talk about
how the loss of your father

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.850
has affected you
over this past year?

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:19.600
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.540
In a myriad of ways,
the first of which

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.930
was pretty obvious,
which, it just reminded me

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.940
something I already knew
intellectually, which was I'm

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.850
next.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:39.500
I'm going to die also,
and I don't know when.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:46.280
So most people in this
room, including myself--

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.150
it changes.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.660
But most of us have
a list of things

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:56.510
we want to do when we're done
doing what we have to do.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.200
Just curious.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.380
Raise of hands-- who has
one of those right now?

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.090
Don't be shy.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.960
Just be yeah, like, I have one.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.620
OK.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.020
It's well over a
half the room, right?

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.050
And probably some of
the people are just shy.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.270
I don't really believe you.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:22.870
Most of us have something
we're putting off for later.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.180
And I think that's
directly tied to the fact

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:33.850
that we are really
masterful in our culture

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.450
at pretending like we won't die.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:39.330
You hear people say,
like, if I die--

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:39.880
it's like no.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.340
It's not if, it's when.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.580
And I'll bring it up
sometimes, and people will say,

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.800
don't bring that up right now.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.629
I don't want to think
about that, which is fine.

00:42:50.629 --> 00:42:52.420
You don't have to think
about it right now.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.490
But if you never think
about it, what happens

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:58.450
is you live a life
where that list of later

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:00.670
gets longer and longer,
and it doesn't get done.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:01.820
And the reason it
doesn't get done

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.320
is because you've
convinced yourself

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.320
you're not going to die.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.850
Why would you do
it now if you're

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.620
going to live forever, right?

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.100
It makes sense you'd put it off.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.220
You have unlimited time.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.090
But that's not real.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.410
You don't.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.350
So the first way it
affected me was I just

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.230
started to do the things
off my list last year.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.740
That's why I spent
that week alone

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.050
because that was on my list.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.152
I had been wanting
to do that for years.

00:43:31.152 --> 00:43:33.610
But it's, like, well, I have
to finish being popular first,

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.510
and then I can
spend my week alone.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.820
SPEAKER: What else
is on the list?

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.278
MIKE POSNER: Some of the other
things that were on the list

00:43:40.278 --> 00:43:42.690
that I did was I wanted
to see the woman that

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.230
wrote "Ask and It Is Given"--

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.380
she does speaking engagements,
and I wanted to go to one.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.990
So I went to one of those.

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:52.760
I wanted to go back
to Burning Man.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.950
Because I'd gone once
before, and I just loved it.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.080
And I skipped a year
because I was on tour,

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.080
as being Mike Posner.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.200
And so I went back.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.274
There's a bunch more things.

00:44:07.274 --> 00:44:09.190
There's a couple of
things I haven't done yet.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:15.270
One is I want to spend
a month-long retreat

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:17.580
at a monastery somewhere.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.780
And I plan on doing that.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.280
Yeah.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:20.850
SPEAKER: I'm sure I will.

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:21.600
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.620
I'm sure I will too.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.245
SPEAKER: Do you feel
like doing these--

00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:25.690
MIKE POSNER: I'm a weirdo.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:28.680
SPEAKER: Do you feel
like doing these things--

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.210
you mentioned you put them off.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:33.237
And you wanted to make it
before you did those things.

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:35.070
Do you feel like doing
these things actually

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:38.459
helps you in your musical career
as well because you come back,

00:44:38.459 --> 00:44:40.500
and you're fresh, and
you're ready to make music.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.710
Or do you feel like it's
a totally separate thing?

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.470
MIKE POSNER: No,
they're definitely tied.

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.860
My piano teacher,
one of my mentors--

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.870
rest in peace-- his name
was Norman Henry Mamey.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.260
And he was telling me
a story about when he

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.720
used to work with his teacher.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.273
And he would say, sometimes
I would go to the lesson--

00:45:06.273 --> 00:45:10.500
and his teacher's
name was Edith Knox.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.110
It was a strong lineage.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.840
It's kind of important
in piano teaching.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.350
And he said, I'd sit on the
piano bench next to Edith,

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.677
and we'd talk.

00:45:20.677 --> 00:45:22.260
We have an hour
lesson, and we'd spend

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:27.814
50 minutes talking about
politics, sex, everything.

00:45:27.814 --> 00:45:29.480
And he said, I started
to get frustrated

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.690
because we weren't playing.

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.670
So I asked her why
do we never play.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:45.660
And she said, Norman, all
of that goes into this.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.440
And I believe that.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.850
Who you are as a human is
directly correlated to who

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.730
you are as an artist.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.410
And that's not to say,
if you're a great guy,

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.150
and you start
making music, you're

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:05.030
going to be an amazing artist.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.650
There's some skill involved.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:08.230
Yeah.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:09.860
You've got to practice.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:13.310
But when you do
both, it matters.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:15.000
I've been there.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.220
I've done the opposite where
I've been in the studio

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.060
for a year and not
really done anything

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.030
else-- like,
basketball and studio.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:29.500
And there have been points
where I just realized--

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.270
I'm writing songs.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.500
And I'm like, these are all
lies because I don't do anything

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.730
in my life.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:39.170
And there's no authenticity
in my music because all I do

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.360
is make music.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.740
And there's nothing for
me to really talk about

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.750
except for making music.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.130
So it's a balance.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:53.890
And I always feel like I have
this mandate, especially now.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.530
I shouldn't say always.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.310
I feel like in the
last five years,

00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:00.760
I have this mandate
from my audience.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.480
And my audience pays my bills.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.910
And they've paid me--

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:13.210
God bless them--
to a point where I

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:15.590
don't have to make more money.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:19.150
So-- and I bring that
up-- it's a sleazy thing

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:20.650
to talk about tied to art.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.330
But it actually
is important to me

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:27.870
because now I get to
ask the questions.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:29.730
I don't have to work.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.580
So what is life about if
you don't have to work?

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:37.950
And I feel like they're
paying me to ask that question

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:39.200
and report back.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:43.440
And that's my job.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.450
So I think that
stuff is important.

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:47.930
But also, the reporting
back is important.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:50.430
So I don't think--

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.450
whenever I go and do these
experiments out of curiosity,

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:58.710
I never feel like I'm not
going to come back, and talk

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.930
about it, and share about it.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.360
That's important to me too.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.790
And I realized that a
lot when I was alone.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:10.380
It's like, Mike, you
do these cool things

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.980
just so you can be the guy that
said you did the cool thing.

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.570
But you don't share
what you actually

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.810
got out of it with anyone.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:21.410
And so that's a big part of
it is sharing what I got.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:23.850
And I want to thank
you for allowing me--

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:25.517
I hope I've done a
little bit of that.

00:48:25.517 --> 00:48:26.100
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.060
Absolutely.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.040
It's been amazing.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.814
Final question is
Jordan Peterson--

00:48:30.814 --> 00:48:32.230
who we were talking
about earlier,

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:35.850
who you are a big fan
of, and I am as well--

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.250
talks about actually this
kind of future authoring

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:40.050
exercise where you
write about what you're

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.530
going to do in the future.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:44.880
And you talked about on your--

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.520
you had a podcast
about the new year,

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.190
and what are you going to
do in the next three, four,

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:53.260
or five years and
hold yourself to that.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.760
So what does Mike Posner look
like in five years from now?

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.330
MIKE POSNER: Oh, man, who knows?

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:07.880
But I know there's some things
I want to do or accomplish.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.610
I want to win one of those
Grammys still, for sure.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.845
I'm thinking about doing
a really long walk.

00:49:23.845 --> 00:49:24.720
SPEAKER: Just a walk.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.740
MIKE POSNER: I'm not sure yet.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:26.239
Yeah.

00:49:26.239 --> 00:49:29.800
Like maybe across America or--

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.150
like, a long one.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:32.160
SPEAKER: That's long.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.340
MIKE POSNER: Yeah,
it's 6 to 12 months

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.050
depending on how fast you go.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:38.700
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.930
Is that bad for your knees?

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:42.390
MIKE POSNER: I don't know.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.850
I think it's-- what I've heard,
it's really hard on your feet.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:49.770
So to get ready for
it, they recommend

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:51.527
wearing no shoes, make
you feel stronger.

00:49:51.527 --> 00:49:52.110
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.670
MIKE POSNER: Those
are maybe five years.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:05.050
And then on the shorter
term, like this year,

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:06.742
I'm reading every day.

00:50:06.742 --> 00:50:07.450
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.300
MIKE POSNER: I missed
reading novels or whatever.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.850
So yeah, I'm reading every day.

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:15.970
It can just be 10
minutes, five minutes.

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:17.590
But it ends up being more.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:22.190
But that's my shorter term
this year thing I'm doing.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.920
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.377
You guys want to do a
little audience Q&amp;A?

00:50:26.377 --> 00:50:27.460
MIKE POSNER: Don't be shy.

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.376
SPEAKER: Don't be shy.

00:50:28.376 --> 00:50:29.761
Anybody have any questions?

00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:34.550
MIKE POSNER: Damn,
whopping nothing.

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:35.050
Yay.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.595
SPEAKER: You just speak into it?

00:50:42.595 --> 00:50:44.160
Is that right, Justin?

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.890
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.054
Apologies in advance
if you've probably

00:50:49.054 --> 00:50:50.345
talked about this a lot online.

00:50:50.345 --> 00:50:51.219
MIKE POSNER: It's OK.

00:50:51.219 --> 00:50:54.330
AUDIENCE: But I never thought
to search, and now I get to ask.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.490
I was debating with
my sister recently

00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:01.904
about your song "Cooler
Than Me" because she

00:51:01.904 --> 00:51:04.320
came on to you recently, and
was like, oh, this is super--

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.570
MIKE POSNER: She came onto me.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:09.030
AUDIENCE: I've been
liking his music for ages.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:15.840
And we were disagreeing
about what the message was

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.040
or what it was about.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.040
And my interpretation
was, oh, it's really

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:23.610
about this guy's projection of
who he thinks this woman is,

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:26.580
and it's more about
his reactions to it

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.519
and his self versus a
portrait of this woman.

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:31.560
And so I was wondering,
when you were writing it,

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.893
what did you think it was about?

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:39.200
MIKE POSNER: No.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.240
I'm formulating my thoughts.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.800
Because it's
interesting the way you

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.280
phrased the question, is
when I was writing it,

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.240
what did I think.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.010
I didn't think that.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.220
I just thought the girls
weren't as nice to me

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.530
as they should be.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:52:01.520
But hearing what you
said so eloquently,

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.600
that's probably a little
closer to the truth, right?

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:10.550
And this woman, whoever she
is, has her own insecurity

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:12.020
going on.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:16.940
And, of course,
that's not who she is.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.520
There's definitely
more to her story

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:24.500
than I'm giving her the
time of day in that song.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:30.710
And a lot of my songs,
as I listen back to them,

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:34.850
are really pretty
embarrassingly sexist.

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.890
And I don't think it's funny.

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.010
People are requesting
something--

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:42.475
I have this song called "Bow
Chicka Wow Wow" with Lil Wayne.

00:52:42.475 --> 00:52:44.350
SPEAKER: Lil Wayne on it, yeah.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:46.993
MIKE POSNER: It's just
terribly misogynistic.

00:52:46.993 --> 00:52:48.993
And I don't think about
it because you write it,

00:52:48.993 --> 00:52:49.868
and then you move on.

00:52:49.868 --> 00:52:52.290
But I was at a show, and
someone requested it,

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:56.450
and I start singing it, and I
was like, whoa, I wrote this?

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:57.370
And yeah.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:58.790
I feel like a different guy.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:05.360
I'm proud that I'm changing
and growing to the point

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.570
where I would never
write that now.

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:11.270
But that's where I was then.

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:15.030
So you didn't really
ask about that.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:20.250
But I think what I was
thinking at the time was

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.990
different from what you said.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:25.670
But I think what you said
is probably more accurate.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:26.730
That was really going on.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.530
And Mike had a lot
of insecurities

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:30.281
at the time as well,
and still does.

00:53:30.281 --> 00:53:32.280
AUDIENCE: Well, it makes
it a more nuanced song,

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:38.024
if it's about the singer himself
than about that portrait.

00:53:38.024 --> 00:53:39.690
But either way, it's
a really cool song.

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:40.440
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.804
And there's no right answer.

00:53:41.804 --> 00:53:45.780
Kind of like the
obnoxious artist answer

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.780
is that's not my job.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:52.860
It's the audience's job to
figure out what it's about.

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.520
Just write it.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.561
AUDIENCE: It's a fun job.

00:53:54.561 --> 00:54:00.230
MIKE POSNER: But my first
answer still stands.

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:01.650
Yeah.

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.080
I think you can throw it, right?

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.670
It's soft?

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:05.395
I think so.

00:54:07.807 --> 00:54:09.140
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.700
You have a really cool
zen vibe about you

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.390
that I didn't fully
know or expect.

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:15.920
So it's very cool to--

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.220
MIKE POSNER: I appreciate that.

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:17.840
Don't worry.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.690
I have my moments.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:24.140
I have this neighbor that
I lived next door to.

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.584
I live close to
here in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:26.584 --> 00:54:29.090
And a lot of times I'll eat--

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:30.620
I have a little porch.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.700
And I'll go out there in
the sun, and I'll eat.

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:37.140
And every time I'm on that
porch, I'm chilling, you know.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.280
And she says, like,
I feel like you are--

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.290
you make me want to
be a better person.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:45.410
You're so angelic, and
you're always so relaxed.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.510
And I'm like, nah, that's
just my porch vibe.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.140
Don't worry.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.600
I have nervous
breakdowns sometimes.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.580
Sorry to interrupt you.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:55.280
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:55.779
It's cool.

00:54:55.779 --> 00:54:57.710
And you definitely brought
the porch vibe here

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:00.220
to this office, which I think
is a pretty cool vibe too.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:00.970
MIKE POSNER: Cool.

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:01.554
Yeah, I agree.

00:55:01.554 --> 00:55:03.428
AUDIENCE: Actually, I
have a question for you

00:55:03.428 --> 00:55:04.670
about misogyny in hip hop.

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:06.140
Because I'm a huge hip hop fan.

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.834
I grew up on Tupac.

00:55:07.834 --> 00:55:10.250
My brother was friends with
Lil Wayne down in New Orleans.

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:13.460
So we've been surrounded
by it my whole life.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.750
And maybe it's
because I'm a mom now.

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:17.720
But when I listen
to some of the songs

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.910
I used to listen to,
or even Big Sean,

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:22.460
or whoever's on
the radio, I wonder

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.779
if I'm betraying
sort of my feminism

00:55:26.779 --> 00:55:28.070
because of what they're saying.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:29.060
I might love the beat.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.560
I was listening to
G-Eazy yesterday.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.240
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.460
I can't-- I want
to like the song,

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.780
but I'm so mad at this song.

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:40.227
And I wonder if you struggle
with that yourself as someone

00:55:40.227 --> 00:55:41.810
who's evolving, or
if that's something

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:44.626
you talk about with these
amazing people you work with.

00:55:44.626 --> 00:55:46.250
Because there's a
lot of women in here,

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:48.410
that, if we just stopped
listening to the music,

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.372
I wonder what would
happen to the music.

00:55:50.372 --> 00:55:51.830
I wonder if we
could change things.

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:53.621
But I also wonder if
there's a conversation

00:55:53.621 --> 00:55:54.760
that you men are having.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.510
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:57.650
I haven't had it with
any of those guys.

00:55:57.650 --> 00:56:00.680
I probably should.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:06.050
And as you were speaking,
I'm reminded of--

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:08.210
I think it was Kanye
first said, I'm

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:11.690
not going to say gay or
fag in my songs anymore.

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:13.970
SPEAKER: I think he had
a cousin who was gay.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.020
And that-- yeah.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.910
MIKE POSNER: And then I
feel like-- maybe I'm wrong.

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.650
I don't listen as
closely to hip hop

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.720
as I used to-- not even close.

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.130
So maybe you could help me.

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:27.020
SPEAKER: I'll [INAUDIBLE]
on it, for sure.

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:27.770
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:32.880
But moving on, it seemed
like that rippled out.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:36.680
And from my
perspective, those words

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:42.680
got used less across the
whole genre after he did that.

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:49.490
And so to me, it's like someone
needs to step up like that

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:52.410
and just say I'm not
going to do that anymore.

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:55.490
And I feel like people
would follow it.

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:58.260
Because it doesn't
really make sense.

00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.682
It doesn't make--

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:01.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.780
Why are we still
talking about this?

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.655
MIKE POSNER: I'm sure
if you speak with them,

00:57:04.655 --> 00:57:06.230
they wouldn't speak that way.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:09.665
And to me, it's become this--

00:57:09.665 --> 00:57:10.340
what's the word?

00:57:13.437 --> 00:57:14.270
You can help me out.

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:15.089
I can't think of--

00:57:15.089 --> 00:57:15.880
SPEAKER: Contrived.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.640
Just for show.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.370
MIKE POSNER: Not
contrived, like a go-to,

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:20.960
almost, like,
crutch in the music.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.650
SPEAKER: The crut-- right.

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:23.275
MIKE POSNER: The
crutch isn't the word,

00:57:23.275 --> 00:57:25.220
but I think you know
what I'm trying to say.

00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.178
It's something people--

00:57:26.178 --> 00:57:27.130
SPEAKER: A gimmick.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:27.460
No.

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:27.700
MIKE POSNER: No.

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.390
The word isn't--
it doesn't matter.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:32.600
But it's something people
just have done in the music,

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.832
and people are doing it
just because it's been done.

00:57:35.832 --> 00:57:38.770
And I think that's as
deep as it goes, honestly.

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.440
It's like a tradition.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.630
AUDIENCE: It's ingrained.

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:45.715
MIKE POSNER: It's an ingrained
tradition that is outdated.

00:57:45.715 --> 00:57:47.170
It's antiquated.

00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:54.060
And still, even some of my
newer music that I've written I

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:55.530
find from--

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:58.410
stuff I wrote two years
ago, which [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:00.990
catching stuff.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.740
So I think, yeah.

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.760
Each artist has to take
that listener for sure.

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.450
But I think--

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:07.750
I don't know.

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.150
Maybe it's all the above.

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:12.760
But I think a big
artist stepping up

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.205
would make a difference.

00:58:14.205 --> 00:58:14.970
I do.

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:18.930
And as far as, do
I feel that tear?

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:21.270
Yeah, I do.

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:24.720
Because some of it's so good.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:29.700
Me and my buddy Nick, we were
listening to this guy XXX.

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.160
How do you say it [? Cancion? ?]

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.160
AUDIENCE: [? Cancion? ?]

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.710
MIKE POSNER: I can't say it.

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:37.295
But it's really good.

00:58:37.295 --> 00:58:40.690
It's amazing angry music.

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:45.660
It's the highest quality angry
music, but it makes me angry.

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:49.510
And so the book I'm reading
right now is Chuck Palahniuk.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:51.110
He wrote "Fight Club."

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:56.120
It's amazing-- the highest
quality dark novel.

00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:05.100
But I'm entertained, but is it
messing me up, consuming this?

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:05.820
I don't know.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:10.280
It's a question we have
to grapple with, I think,

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.760
individually.

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.837
Yeah?

00:59:14.837 --> 00:59:15.920
AUDIENCE: What's up, guys?

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.840
MIKE POSNER: What's up?

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.530
SPEAKER: How's it going?

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:19.010
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted
to say thanks for coming.

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:20.505
Thanks for spending
time with us.

00:59:20.505 --> 00:59:21.880
One of my favorite
songs of yours

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.364
is "Wonder Why" on the Wale
Back to the Future mixtape.

00:59:24.364 --> 00:59:25.280
MIKE POSNER: Oh, sick.

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:25.465
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:25.465 --> 00:59:25.880
That was dope.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.500
MIKE POSNER: Deep cut.

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:27.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah, man.

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:30.041
MIKE POSNER: Big Sean,
produced by 9th Wonder.

00:59:30.041 --> 00:59:30.666
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:32.350
That was hot, man.

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:34.787
And so earlier on, you talked
a little bit about truth.

00:59:34.787 --> 00:59:36.370
And then you guys
both mentioned to be

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:39.800
fans of Jordan Peterson, who is
amazing and just a fantastic--

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.550
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.000
I would say also, I don't
agree with everything

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.690
Jordan Peterson says.

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:48.130
But I'm a fan of--

00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:51.846
he brings up a discussion
and gets me to think.

00:59:51.846 --> 00:59:52.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.969
And so--

00:59:52.969 --> 00:59:54.150
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:56.495
Just wanted to say that.

00:59:56.495 --> 00:59:57.370
AUDIENCE: I hear you.

00:59:57.370 --> 01:00:02.110
I was just going to ask,
in Jordan's dialogue,

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:04.510
he talks a lot about the
strengthening of the individual

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:06.882
as opposed to the
weakening of society.

01:00:06.882 --> 01:00:09.340
If you want to make it, you
have to really work on yourself

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.200
as opposed to trying
to change others.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.670
And for me, that was a
really big profound truth.

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:13.900
There was something
that I'd never

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.108
really given much thought to.

01:00:15.108 --> 01:00:17.920
And so he so eloquently
talked about it.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.420
And so I was just
curious if you had

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.650
any similar takeaways
from Jordan's discussions

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:26.260
or dialogues.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.610
MIKE POSNER: Man, I think
I've probably had several.

01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:36.840
But yeah, that's definitely
one of them, which is like--

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.700
actually, there's another one.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.360
Instead of expounding
on yours, I'm

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.820
going to bring up
a separate thing

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:47.680
I've gotten from him, which
he was talking about marriage.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.820
And he said, if you think
you might leave your partner,

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.130
you're not really married.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:01:00.200
And he said, to play some
games, you have to be all in,

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.260
which is a really
interesting concept.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.630
And he says, the interesting
thing about life,

01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:09.460
for all of us, is we're all in.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:14.750
He says this is going to kill
us whether we like it or not.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:18.300
At the game of life, you're
going to die at the end.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.550
So what are you going
to do with your time?

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:25.240
How are you going to play?

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.936
That resonated with me a lot.

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:32.062
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:32.062 --> 01:01:33.470
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:34.620
Right there?

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.011
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:01:36.011 --> 01:01:36.510
Hi.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:37.240
MIKE POSNER: Hi.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.920
AUDIENCE: And thank you
for that picture earlier.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.970
MIKE POSNER: You're welcome.

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:40.690
What's your name?

01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:40.975
AUDIENCE: Liliana.

01:01:40.975 --> 01:01:41.510
MIKE POSNER: Liliana-- Mike.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:42.219
Nice to meet you.

01:01:42.219 --> 01:01:43.343
AUDIENCE: Nice to meet you.

01:01:43.343 --> 01:01:44.480
So I have two questions.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.720
One, because they posted
it on social media,

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.319
there's a question--

01:01:49.319 --> 01:01:51.860
I'll just ask it first because
that's what they want to know.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:56.440
But how much do you charge
when you create music,

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.570
like, Justin Bieber's
boyfriend, for example.

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:00.700
Not my question.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.100
MIKE POSNER: Is that the
new way of saying like, I

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.360
have a friend, you know--

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.316
AUDIENCE: No.

01:02:05.316 --> 01:02:06.470
No.

01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.970
Honest.

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:07.330
MIKE POSNER: No.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:08.000
I actually believe you.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.620
AUDIENCE: I'll ask
you my question after.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:10.286
MIKE POSNER: No.

01:02:10.286 --> 01:02:10.930
I believe you.

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.250
I really wanted to make a joke.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:17.790
But typically, how
that stuff works is

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:23.450
it's largely based on royalties.

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:27.940
So you get a percentage,
depending on how many people

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.230
wrote the song.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:33.340
I'm a big proponent of, if
there are four guys in the room,

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.230
you just split it even.

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:38.500
Sometimes people get into this
thing where, I wrote 30 lines,

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:43.120
and you wrote 29, so I
should get this much.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.370
That always gets icky to me.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.050
I like to just do it even.

01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:51.070
And so basically, you
get paid a percentage

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:54.816
of whatever money comes in.

01:02:54.816 --> 01:02:56.440
For producers, it's
a little different.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.760
A producer, depending
on who it is,

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.840
gets an advance,
which means they

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.720
get paid the money upfront.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.250
And then as the money
comes in, the other person

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:11.110
gets that advance paid
back, and then they

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:13.360
get the profits after that.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:19.210
So advance for
producers can range.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:23.770
If it's your first beat you're
ever selling, typically, going

01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:26.462
rate is, like, $5,000, I think.

01:03:26.462 --> 01:03:27.920
You'd probably know
better than me.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.580
But a new producer--

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.310
$5,000 to $10,000
would be an advance.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.000
And then I don't know
what the high end is now.

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:41.950
Back in the days when people
were buying more music,

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:43.160
like Scott Storch--

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.970
these guys sell a
track for $1 million.

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:48.967
But I think that's gone down
because people buy less music.

01:03:48.967 --> 01:03:49.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.914
Now, my question.

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:51.580
MIKE POSNER: OK.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.744
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:52.744 --> 01:03:53.410
MIKE POSNER: OK.

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:53.951
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:03:53.951 --> 01:03:56.050
So at the beginning
of the talk, you

01:03:56.050 --> 01:04:01.060
mentioned how maybe global
warming is something really

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.650
important, but maybe
it doesn't really

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:04.816
matter because we're getting
in the way of something

01:04:04.816 --> 01:04:05.410
much larger.

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:07.368
So then, when you think
about things like that,

01:04:07.368 --> 01:04:09.850
then how do you decide
what really matters?

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:10.600
MIKE POSNER: Yeah.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.330
I'm not sure anything does.

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:15.250
There are things definitely
that matter to me.

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:18.070
Like, my mom matters to me.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:19.720
But there is that
in the background,

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.350
like why does it matter that
your mom matters to you?

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:27.700
If I just cut her off,
which I never would do,

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:30.920
does that matter in the
great scheme of things?

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.880
And the answer is we don't know.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.940
We don't have perspective
enough to tell.

01:04:40.681 --> 01:04:41.180
Yeah.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.760
If we had, like, a God
perspective, we could see.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:51.650
The Bible says, that thou
shall not kill, right?

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:53.110
It sounds reasonable, right?

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.520
I don't kill people.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:59.450
But what if, like, the person
was about to kill two people?

01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:01.540
Then, is it OK?

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:06.087
So these things get
icky really quickly.

01:05:06.087 --> 01:05:07.170
And somebody would say no.

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:10.830
But what if they were about
to kill a million people?

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:13.445
I don't know.

01:05:13.445 --> 01:05:14.750
It's very nuanced.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.709
And we don't have the
perspective to see what--

01:05:17.709 --> 01:05:19.250
AUDIENCE: So does
that get in the way

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.564
of your happiness every day?

01:05:20.564 --> 01:05:21.980
If you're making
decisions, do you

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:23.150
think about it broadly like--

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:24.066
MIKE POSNER: At times.

01:05:24.066 --> 01:05:26.074
There's an EB White quote
that says, "I wake up

01:05:26.074 --> 01:05:28.490
in the morning, and I don't
know whether to save the world

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:29.600
or savor it.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.480
This makes it hard
to start the day."

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.170
And yeah.

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:34.790
I feel that sometimes.

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:36.940
But it's waves.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.450
Sometimes I go, well, I'm just
going to play my guitar a lot

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:41.150
today.

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.900
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:42.400
Thank you.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.384
MIKE POSNER: Thank you.

01:05:44.384 --> 01:05:45.300
SPEAKER: Anybody else?

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:48.570
All right.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:49.480
Thank you so much for coming.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:49.700
MIKE POSNER: Thank you, guys.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.700
SPEAKER: We really
appreciate it.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.300
MIKE POSNER: Thank you.

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:51.600
SPEAKER: Thank you, Mike.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.500
It was awesome.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.458
MIKE POSNER: Thank you.

01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.250
[APPLAUSE]
