CATHERINE LIANG: Hi, everyone,
I'm Catherine Liang, and I'm

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.740
with Google TV Marketing.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.610
And I'm here today at the Google
Developer Village at

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.230
South by Southwest with CTO
of Pandora Tom Conrad.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.149
And joining us remotely is Mario
Queiroz, VP of Google

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.455
TV. Tom, thank you for joining
us, and Mario as well.

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:21.380
TOM CONRAD: Hi, Mario.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.060
MARIO QUEIROZ: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.636
Hey, Tom.

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:26.610
CATHERINE LIANG: So I'd like
to start us off by doing a

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.860
little introduction.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.250
Tom, maybe you could start us
off with a brief introduction

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.320
to Pandora, just--

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.682
TOM CONRAD: Yeah, sure.

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:34.850
CATHERINE LIANG:
--for starters.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.230
TOM CONRAD: Yeah, sure, so I'm
the CTO of Pandora, and I run

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.450
the product organization
there.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.740
So that's all of engineering
and product design, and

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.010
technical operations, and from
product concepts through

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.450
delivering bits to listeners,
it's all kind of my fault.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.290
And I've been with the company
for almost eight years now, so

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.490
that goes all the way back
to the beginning,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.490
the creation of Pandora.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.800
And--

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.120
just trying to figure this out--
this is my sixth South

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.209
by Southwest.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:09.470
So Pandora is a personalized
radio service.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.060
You come to us on your mobile
phone or on your laptop, or

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.950
now on your television, and you
tell us about an artist or

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.650
a song that you love.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.210
And our goal is to create just
out of this unending stream of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.160
music that you'll love.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.090
Some old familiar songs you can
sing along with, but also

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.790
full of discovery and
personalization.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.040
And that's what we try
to do every day.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.980
CATHERINE LIANG: Fantastic.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.760
And Mario, can you also
give us a brief

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.092
introduction to Google TV?

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:40.380
MARIO QUEIROZ: Sure.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.000
Catherine, I'm sure you could
do a great job as well.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.270
I'm Mario Queiroz, and I'm the
VP of Products and the General

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.340
Manager of Google TV. I've been
with Google for about

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.490
seven years.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.120
And over the past year or so,
I've been heading up the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.010
Google TV operation.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.110
What we're trying to do with
Google TV is basically bring

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.010
as many entertainment options
into the living room as we can

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.320
through the browser, through
Android applications, and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.020
through Google services
for your TV.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.040
We work with a number of
different TV manufacturers so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.090
that you have an option in what
kind of product you want

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.610
to purchase, which is powered
by Google TV. We also work

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.950
with lots and lots of developers
bringing great apps

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.540
to Google TV.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.250
I'm really excited to be here
with Tom and with Pandora.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.540
I'm a huge fan and a huge user
and listener of Pandora on my

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.270
Android phone, on my
Google TV at home.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.060
And I know that I'm one of many,
many fans of Pandora.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.070
So I'm excited to exchange some
ideas with Tom and to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.852
answer some of the questions
from the world.

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:50.360
CATHERINE LIANG:
Awesome, great.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.940
So Tom, tell us what makes
Pandora unique from other

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.500
internet radio apps.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.095
What is the Music
Genome Project?

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.170
TOM CONRAD: Sure, sure.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.100
Well, I think what sets Pandora
apart from other music

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.610
services out there is that we're
the only service that's

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.240
focused entirely on you.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.200
We don't see it as our job to
tell you what kind of music

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.450
you should be listening to.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.650
It's our job to listen
to your feedback--

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.885
your thumbs up, your thumbs
down-- and create this

00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:22.980
experience that's entirely
tailored to what you love in

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.510
the music universe.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.220
And I think that that's pretty
unique in the music sphere.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.450
A lot of music is sort of about,
this is what's hot,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.930
this is what's emerging, this
is what's cool right now.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.270
And we set all of that aside,
and we just talk about, what

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.590
is the music that you love?

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.250
And if that's marching band
music, that's great by us.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.260
And what sits underneath all of
this personalization that

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.910
we do is this system we call
the Music Genome Project.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.840
And the kind of remarkable thing
about it is, the way

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.340
that it works fundamentally
is, we have a team of

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.000
professional musicians who come
to the office every day.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.410
They put headphones on, and they
listen to each and every

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.510
song that plays on Pandora.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.600
And they analyze those tracks
across hundreds of different

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.960
musicological dimensions.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.870
So not just are there guitars?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.830
What kind of guitars?

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.510
How are the guitars played?

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.940
What role does the guitar play
in the overall composition?

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.980
There's 40 different attributes
to describe the

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.730
vocal performance.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.649
How gravelly is it?

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.670
How breathy is it?

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.060
How much falsetto?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.990
All of these different
musicological traits, which

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.830
allows us to connect songs
together based on their

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.310
fundamental musical fingerprint,
which is where

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.650
the whole experience
starts from.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.340
You tell us that you love
a particular song.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.430
We go out in the music universe
and find other things

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.910
that are similar, and then take
you on this journey of

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.600
music discovery and
entertainment.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.870
CATHERINE LIANG:
That's amazing.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.830
That's exactly I think the
reason why it's caught on so

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.640
much and really makes
it unique.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.540
And Mario, can you give us a
brief understanding of what

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.460
Google TV--

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.500
what features of Google TV
make it unique from other

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.485
connected TV platforms?

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:04.700
MARIO QUEIROZ: Sure.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.010
So I think it's important to
think about what's happening

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.770
in this world of connected TVs
or the web coming into the

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.290
living room.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.940
It used to be 30 years ago that
people had three or four

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.510
TV stations.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.440
In this country, for example,
they had access

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.010
to the network stations.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.200
TV, with the advent of cable,
went from three or four

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.470
stations to 300 or
400 stations.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.180
What happened, and a lot of
people thought, oh, network

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.680
television will die and
cable will take over.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.060
That didn't happen.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.390
Today, people still love to
watch American Idol and Modern

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.450
Family and Glee, and some of
these great shows on network

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.970
television, but they also
love to watch ESPN and

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.190
then Fox and so forth.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.120
And what we're seeing 30 years
after the advent of cable,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.000
we're seeing the web coming
into the living room.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.105
And we're going from hundreds
of channels to millions of

00:05:55.105 --> 00:06:01.870
channels on TV. And we believe
that the web is not going to

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.122
replace traditional television,

00:06:04.122 --> 00:06:05.860
whether network or cable.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.820
It's complementary to it.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.300
And so what we believe is really
important and what

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.690
we're focused on is, first of
all, enabling a lot of these

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.420
new web channels to come to TV.
Web channels come to TV in

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.120
ways that people might expect,
which is more video on TV and

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.410
lots of that.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.790
For example, through Google TV
you can access more than

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:31.380
80,000 TV episodes and films
through the platform.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.420
But I think beyond video, and
what's wonderful about the web

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.900
on your TV in your living room
are things like Pandora.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.560
So not only are you watching
video on your TV, which is

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.430
what you traditionally think of
TV as, but you're doing a

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.080
lot of other things, too.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.720
Music is one of them.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.320
Most people's TVs are connected
to the best speakers

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.370
in the house.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.520
This is why, I think, users have
loved using Pandora on

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.870
Google TV. It's because
it goes beyond their

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.810
active video watching.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.910
It's really enhancing their
entertainment abilities.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.200
And so, we're focused on
enabling more and more web

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.370
content to come to TV through
video and other things.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.130
And also we're very focused
on helping users find the

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.490
entertainment that they
want to find.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.000
Because when you go to millions
of channels, the

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.435
discovery of content, whether it
be video or other forms of

00:07:25.435 --> 00:07:30.405
entertainment through apps, is
really, really important.

00:07:30.405 --> 00:07:31.410
CATHERINE LIANG: Great.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.230
So we've talked about Pandora.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.860
We've talked about Google TV.
I'd like to really bring this

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.720
together and ask you, Tom,
what excites you

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.800
about Google TV?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.040
And what makes the Pandora
experience on Google TV

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.930
different compared to your
smartphone, your computer, et

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.505
cetera, other products that you
might access Pandora from.

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.700
TOM CONRAD: Sure.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:59.380
Pandora started as a website
way back in 2005.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.210
But from the very beginning, we
understood that if we were

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.420
going to be successful in
redefining what radio is, we

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.250
had to break free from the
PC and bring the Pandora

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.140
experience to all the places
where people traditionally

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.670
consume radio.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.300
And of course, a big part of
that story is Pandora for the

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.300
mobile phone.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.080
Huge, huge, huge success
on Android.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.790
But about 35% of all radio
listening happens in the home.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.970
And so, for years and years
now, we've been making an

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.640
investment in bringing Pandora
into the living room, Blu-ray

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.760
players and televisions and
over-the-top boxes.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.000
I think we're on as many as
450 different consumer

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.580
electronics devices.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.550
And the challenge there is that
all of these platforms

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.520
are a little bit different.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.230
And so you end up with a
different implementation of

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.270
Pandora hundreds of times.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:04.030
And so when Google came to us
shortly before the launch of

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.180
the initial Google TV platform,
we were really

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.100
excited about this idea that we
could take the investment

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.330
that we've made in Android and
leverage that to deliver a

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.800
really, really great experience
in the living room.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.920
And thank God we could leverage
that investment,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.680
because I think you gave us
all of about four weeks to

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.420
develop for the platform to be
one of your launch partners.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.380
So we sprang into action and
took the Android application

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.770
that our users know and love,
and put an entirely new kind

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.360
of 10-foot user experience
on top of it.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.470
So you can sit on the couch and
with your remote control

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.360
interact with Pandora
very, very simply.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.570
You get big, beautiful album
art on the screen.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.390
And of course, gives your thumbs
up and thumbs down,

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.240
change stations, learn
more about the

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.150
music that's playing.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.375
It creates a really great kind
of listening environment.

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:56.500
Particularly, I love
it for a party.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.910
You can have it up and going.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.540
Everybody knows what
music is playing.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.290
It spurs all these great
conversations about music and

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.190
people grabbing the remote
control, making new stations

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.740
to entertain themselves.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.290
I love seeing people come
together around the experience

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:10.760
of Pandora.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.520
And I think the Google TV
application kind of does that

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.790
uniquely well.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.650
CATHERINE LIANG: So you touch
upon the fact that it's really

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:23.060
difficult to manage all these
different implementations.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.680
How challenging is that
for your team?

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.495
TOM CONRAD: It's a spectacular
challenge.

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:35.640
I'd say one of the big
accomplishments for Pandora is

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.550
that we have been able to build
a presence on all of

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.610
these different platforms
and devices.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:49.740
But I certainly dream of a day
where we could take hundreds

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.020
of implementations and narrow it
down to just the Google TV

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.670
platform, for example,
as a unifying factor.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.190
And the great thing that that
does for our listeners is, it

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.410
lets us innovate faster.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.840
It lets us bring new features
to the living room by

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.100
impacting just the same code
base that we use for the

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.040
Android application, we can
get those onto the 10-foot

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.070
experience just immediately.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.260
And it's much, much harder to do
that when you have hundreds

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.226
of different locations that all
have to be tweaked to add

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:20.915
new features.

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:22.740
CATHERINE LIANG: Absolutely.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.560
Mario, can you speak to your
strategic vision for Google TV

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.526
and what you see that tying into
the music platform as?

00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:34.460
MARIO QUEIROZ: OK.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.700
I mentioned a couple
of aspects of

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.830
our strategic vision.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.080
One is, we're going to continue
to find ways to make

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.280
it easy for developers to
bring their content,

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.560
entertainment, their information
to Google TV. So

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.810
we've chosen for the Google
TV Android, so that one

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:53.660
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.240
developers would be if the
developer has an Android,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.220
mobile application, phone or
tablet application, that

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.820
they're not starting from
scratch in bringing that

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.510
experience to television.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.750
In many cases, many, many
cases, we've seen that a

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.720
Google TV app has been developed
very quickly from an

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.500
existing Android application.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.530
And we've done that through--
and there are lots of

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.850
examples, but I'll just
name a couple.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.120
A lot of applications depend
on touch, of course, on the

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.720
phone and on a tablet.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.016
And we've built the platform in
a way that your application

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:35.110
is easily D-pad navigable on
TV, because TVs still don't

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.650
have touch screens.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.380
So we've done that.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.610
And a lot of applications on
the phone will work in

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.396
portrait mode.

00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:44.846
But a TV is not in
portrait mode.

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:45.630
It's in landscape mode.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.590
So we've done some things in the
platform so it becomes a

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.540
lot easier for developers
to bring the apps.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.890
So for example, the apps are
easily D-pad navigable, they

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.680
don't have to require touch,
and that they work in

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.410
landscape all the time
on your television.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.110
We'll continue to work
on those things.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.810
Android Market, now the Play
Store, re-branded, is

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.690
available on Google TV. It's
the same back end, the same

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.110
content that you find on your
tablet and on your phone.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.770
So bringing more content
to television.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.345
That includes the browser,
of course, as well.

00:13:20.345 --> 00:13:24.450
And everything we do, we're
not just taking the same

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.300
browser maybe that you
might see on your

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.270
phone or on your tablet.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.080
We're making it appropriate
for television.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.030
So you can play 10 ADP content
on Chrome on television.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:42.100
There's a lot of great
high-definition content that

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.120
owners of websites want
to play on television.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.630
And we're trying to bring live
TV and video closer together.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.880
An example is the YouTube
app we've built.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.820
A goal is for you to be watching
a TV show, and if you

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.780
want to switch to a YouTube
channel, you can switch to a

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.650
YouTube channel as easily as
you'd change channels on your

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.820
television.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:10.270
And again, that makes a good
video experience across TV and

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:15.040
web very, very seamless
in both directions.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.980
And I think that by having
an open platform--

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.020
I'll go back to what I
mentioned earlier--

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.110
we've opened the living room to
forms of entertainment that

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.130
you don't think of traditionally
for your

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.720
television.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.640
Television is primarily video.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.120
We've opened TV to other
forms of entertainment.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.260
What Tom and the
team at Pandora

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.360
has built is wonderful.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.900
There's a cute and very popular
app on Google TV

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.910
called Classy Fireplace.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.040
If you want to have a fireplace
in your living room,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.295
you download Classy Fireplace,
and it plays a fun screen

00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:51.820
saver type of application.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.070
And I think we're going to see
more and more applications

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:02.300
which are really targeting the
time and use of the television

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.700
beyond traditional video.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.580
And again, music is one of
the huge applications.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.795
And Pandora has been
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], and we see

00:15:08.795 --> 00:15:13.650
our user really taking advantage
of what Pandora has

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.212
brought to Google TV.

00:15:16.212 --> 00:15:17.780
CATHERINE LIANG: That's great.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.250
So going back to that decision
point, Tom, to when you

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.560
decided to build for the
Google TV platform,

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.140
can you tell us--

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.800
speaking especially to
developers out there that are

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.080
considering building for the
Google TV platform-- how and

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.380
why did you decide to be
an early developer?

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.080
TOM CONRAD: Sure.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:43.210
I think for us it's kind of an
imperative to make sure that

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.960
Pandora is available in all of
these kind of venues where

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.250
people traditionally
consume radio.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.800
So we're doing tons and tons of
work, for example, to bring

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.440
Pandora to the car.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.630
We have all kinds of automotive
partners that are

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.270
helping us integrate the Pandora
listening experience

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.566
into the driving experience.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.830
But really, second only to the
car, the most important venue

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.410
for us really is the
living room.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.630
As Mario said, it's the place
where you have the best

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.600
speakers in the house.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.510
It's a place where people
come together to

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.630
spend time as a family.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.340
And it's a place where
traditionally tons and tons

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.020
and tons of radio is consumed.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.750
And so, for us, it's a core
strategic kind of investment

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.707
that we make to make sure
that Pandora is

00:16:26.707 --> 00:16:30.990
available in the home.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.960
And the really appealing thing
about the Google TV platform

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.405
is that, again, we're able to
leverage all of the effort

00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:45.280
that goes into building our
Android application.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.540
And we're able to have complete
control over the user

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.510
experience on the television.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.680
So we can build this beautiful,
simple, elegant

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.300
user experience, and any time we
want to add new features or

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.450
enhance it, it's as simple as
submitting a new build to the

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.730
now Google Play Store.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.230
And just immediately then,
that's available to our users.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.109
So just being able to leverage
our existing investment in

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.250
Android, to have complete
control over the user

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.819
experience, to easily be able
to update it through Google

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.130
Play, it's kind of a combination
of all those

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.319
things that makes it just
a no-brainer for us.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.069
CATHERINE LIANG: So were there
any lessons learned along the

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:31.700
way that you would like to pass
on to other developers?

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.010
TOM CONRAD: I think probably
the most important thing is

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.400
just to make sure you really
spend time thinking about the

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.310
environment of the home, of
the living room, of the

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.590
10-foot UI, of the
characteristics of the remote

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.850
control and the way that people
want to interact with

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.370
the content.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:53.760
I think the only mistake you can
really make is to not pay

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.880
attention to the environment.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.010
Really think about your users,
think about their homes, think

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.080
about how they might interact
with your product, and step

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.725
away from some of the design
decisions you made when you

00:18:03.725 --> 00:18:05.880
were thinking about this tiny
little thing in the

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.470
plan of your hand.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.080
Think about this big beautiful
50-inch television and build

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.490
from there.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.640
CATHERINE LIANG: That's
great advice.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.240
And Mario, can you speak to some
of the features of the

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.286
Google TV platform that
developers should be aware of?

00:18:20.286 --> 00:18:21.020
MARIO QUEIROZ: Sure.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.450
I mentioned a couple
of them before.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.960
And let me go over some
of the things.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.685
I made a few notes for myself
so that I can be accurate in

00:18:30.685 --> 00:18:32.260
what we're talking about.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.285
So the one key thing is for--

00:18:35.285 --> 00:18:39.500
first of all, the developers
have access to go to a fully

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.700
capable browser.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.100
Web app developers can bring
their apps to Google TV

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.550
through the Chrome browser.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.890
And they, of course, have access
to the application

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.230
framework, the Android
application framework.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.470
You have, for example,
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.660
virtual machine.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:01.510
It's optimized for mobile
devices available

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.000
for Google TV apps.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.360
You have the optimized graphics
powered by our 3D

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.010
graphics library.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:13.980
And 3D graphics based on OpenGL
ES specifications.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.440
We have SQLite structured
data storage.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.260
We have media support for most
common audio, video and still

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.610
image formats.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.690
And we have a [INAUDIBLE]
development environment.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:32.970
So we've tried to bring the
richness of the mobile

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.830
platform to TV so that
developers have a lot of

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.630
flexibility to bring their
creativity to TV. And we've

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.650
seen that creativity come
to life in some really

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.980
interesting ways.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.140
We're talking about [INAUDIBLE]
here but sports,

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.670
of course, which is tremendously
popular on

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:52.610
television.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.060
So there are a number of
interesting sports apps that

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.660
are being built for TV which
take advantage, for example,

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.320
of the fact that the
applications, the Android

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:08.030
application on Google TV, have
access to a user's programming

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.250
information.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.970
And an application can also
change stations to a

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.060
particular channel.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.680
So you can imagine a sports
application that provides,

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.450
such as the application
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:27.050
which gives you a degree of
excitement of different

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.470
sporting events.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.170
And if you see a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] game or an

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.760
English [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.040
game, or a Major League Baseball
game, which is in a

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.240
really [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.160
you could say, oh, this game is
on live right now, and the

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.640
app can switch you right
to the station that's

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.910
playing that game.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.550
So we're trying to get
developers [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.600
the power of the mobile platform
through the browser

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.630
as well as through the Android
application framework.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.650
But we're also bringing some
TV-specific functionality.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.290
And we're at the very
beginning of that.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.630
We're finding some very
interesting things which we'd

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.960
expect to bring to market, and
that will give developers even

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.800
more access to television
features which enrich their

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.672
applications.

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:15.410
CATHERINE LIANG: Fantastic.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:18.380
And now I'm going to open it
up to the social channels.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.950
And we've collected quite
a few questions.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.090
And, Tom, the first
one goes to you.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:27.410
So in light of in the news,
a lot of the giant telco

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.240
companies have eliminated or
are planning to eliminate

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.240
unlimited data plans to curb
usage in overtaxed networks.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.100
Does this cause any concern
for Pandora?

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.530
And what is the average
bandwidth for a typical user

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.030
in a month of streaming music?

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.630
And this comes from
Eric James.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.820
TOM CONRAD: Hi, Eric.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.400
That's a good question.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:55.160
We get this a lot since this has
become a new story in the

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.350
news cycle around this.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:02.070
But it's been about two years
now since AT&amp;T started putting

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.320
caps on data plans and things.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.400
And we've seen no impact at
all to our business, our

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.970
growth, people's consumption
of Pandora.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.070
And I think that's because
Pandora is actually a

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.000
relatively lightweight
application with respect to

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.800
the amount of bandwidth
that it consumes.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.470
A typical user of Pandora in a
month would consume less than

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.740
10% of their data plan from
their Pandora listening.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.820
So I think Pandora consumes
less bandwidth

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.780
than you might imagine.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:42.790
And a typical user is in no
danger of impacting their data

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.680
cap, if you like, through
their use of Pandora.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.910
CATHERINE LIANG: Excellent.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.360
So they can continue enjoying
all the great music.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.146
TOM CONRAD: That's right.

00:22:50.146 --> 00:22:52.920
CATHERINE LIANG: The next one
comes from John Blossom.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.630
He says, question for
the Pandora team.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.220
I love Pandora on Google TV.
I listen to it all the time

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.510
through my home entertainment
speakers.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.220
However, one of the ongoing
frustrations I have is that

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.940
purchasing tracks that intrigue
me that I hear on

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.820
Pandora is not possible via
the Google TV interface.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.250
Moreover, Pandora doesn't yet
offer a purchasing interface

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.460
to Google Play Music or social
sharing options for Google+

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.220
via Google TV. Any thoughts as
to when we might see better

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.305
purchasing integration and
social integration?

00:23:24.305 --> 00:23:27.200
TOM CONRAD: Sure.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.200
We don't tend to talk about what
we're going to do next

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.710
before we actually do it, but
I can say that it's fun to

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.780
watch the Google Play ecosystem
sort of mature and

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.680
the great music purchase
products that have been

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.530
brought to market over the
course of the last

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.320
year or so by Google.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.690
Helping musicians sell music is
a big part of our charter

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.660
at Pandora.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.070
I hope to be able to enable
all those kinds

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.050
of things in time.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:58.720
CATHERINE LIANG: Great.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.470
We look forward to that.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.830
And the next question comes
from Tony Bosco.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.610
He says, while playing music in
the background, is there a

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.390
way to get thumbs up or thumbs
down without having to go back

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.506
to the native app to do that?

00:24:13.506 --> 00:24:15.440
TOM CONRAD: That's
a great question.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.290
There's not today, but I'm
excited to work with your

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.720
partners at places like LG to
get those thumbs up and thumbs

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.210
down buttons right on
the remote controls.

00:24:25.771 --> 00:24:27.920
CATHERINE LIANG: Sounds good.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.060
So William McKee asks, having
the option to choose to listen

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:38.630
to an entire album and make a
playlist of a given band that

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.360
is pushed to me in the free
version of Spotify.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.310
But does Pandora have any future
plans to implement this

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.870
option in their free product?

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:51.950
TOM CONRAD: So we think about
the music world as being kind

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:57.130
of split between radio
style listening.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.000
It's a really, really
simple experience.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.950
You press a button, we
personalize it to your tastes,

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.710
it takes no effort at all.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.560
We play old favorites you
can sing along with.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.580
We play new songs that you've
never heard before.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.810
And we really see ourselves
as the future of radio,

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.010
redefining what's possible with
radio in this connected

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.330
world we live in.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.620
The other mode of music
listening is this kind of this

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.140
on-demand thing.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.510
I want to listen to this entire
album right now, or I

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.210
want to hear the
song right now.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.250
And I think that's kind of like
the future of the record

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.230
store, if you like.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:38.240
And we're pretty content to
focus on reinventing radio and

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.360
to let others sort of
imagine what the

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.550
record store might become.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.570
And that's partially because,
when you look at the way

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.980
people consume music in this
country, about 80% of all

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.670
music listening hours are
in this radio format.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.780
It's a medium that hundreds
of millions of

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.680
people enjoy every day.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.410
And so we feel like we have a
lot of work to do there, a lot

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:02.450
of opportunity there.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.300
And we'll let others, like
Google with their great Google

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:12.046
Play Music service, till the
soil in the on-demand world

00:26:12.046 --> 00:26:13.950
CATHERINE LIANG: Sounds good.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.480
And now, Mario and Tom, I wanted
to open it up to see if

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.280
you guys had any questions
for each other.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.700
I know this is a great
opportunity for you guys as

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.170
leads of the respective
organizations

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.900
to share some ideas.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.150
So Tom, do you have any
questions for Mario?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.430
TOM CONRAD: Sure.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:32.600
I love some television.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.560
I watch a lot of TV. And I'm
really interested in this kind

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.250
of convergence of the connected
world and the

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:39.840
television.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.120
And one of the great things that
it's enabled, of course,

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.190
is that now, in addition to the
shows that are recorded on

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.540
my DVR or the shows that happen
to be being broadcast

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.290
right now, all these
great movie and

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.290
video streaming services.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.740
Of course, Netflix
is one example.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.380
Google has their own
on-demand movie

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.000
purchase and rental service.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
But one of the tricks as a
consumer is, it's pretty hard

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.350
to figure out what
content is where.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.100
I know that I want to
watch Breaking Bad.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.860
But I have to figure out, is
the season that I want to

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.860
watch available for streaming on
Netflix, or is it available

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.410
for rental, or is it available
for purchase?

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.980
And all these different services
on demand and my

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.470
cable box, does it actually
happen to be on right now,

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.940
live on television?

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.350
And I think one of the things
that I'm most excited about

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.730
where Google TV is concerned
is, it seems like with

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.030
Google's incredible expertise
in search, that you could

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.840
solve that problem for me.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.610
My interest is Breaking Bad,
not, I have to figure out what

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.170
services it's on.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.210
So can you talk a little bit
about how Google TV is

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.510
tackling content discovery
in this windowed,

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.042
multi-service world?

00:27:50.042 --> 00:27:52.320
MARIO QUEIROZ: Great
question, Tom.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.620
We've taken a pretty big step,
I think, with our last

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.660
software updating in
tackling this.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.840
But this is more of a marathon
than a sprint for sure.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:08.590
We have our TV &amp; Movies app on
Google TV, and we make sure

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.830
that we take you through that
app if you haven't seen it.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.650
And Catherine can do it
right there live.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.310
But we're basically
trying to do

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.090
exactly what you've described.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:22.750
TV &amp; Movies is an application
that basically allows you to

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.920
go in and, without having to
know what the sources of the

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.230
content are, whether it comes
from Netflix or Amazon or

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.950
YouTube or HBO GO, or live TV
or wherever that might be,

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.140
basically what you've before and
what you've rated in the

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:42.880
future, based on signals from
your Google+ and so forth.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.570
We are providing you
recommendations, if you're

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:51.870
looking for drama or comedy or a
rom-com, whatever that might

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.620
be, we're giving you

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.460
recommendations of films to watch.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.630
And then we can tell you if
these films are similar to

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.280
this particular film that
you've seen before.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.850
Our goal is to help you very
quickly find the content you

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.870
want to watch, the movie or the
TV show, and then to say,

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.327
oh, now that you know that you
want to watch this, here's a

00:29:11.327 --> 00:29:13.540
few different options for
watching this show.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.910
And you click on the different
options for watching.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.290
Well, it's going to be on live
TV on Sunday evening.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.120
And you're like, well, but I
don't really want to wait.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.230
I want to watch it now.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.430
OK, well, you can watch it.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.100
You can rent it now from
YouTube, or you can buy the

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.750
show from Amazon.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.160
Or, we know that you have a
Netflix subscription, and it

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.940
might be available on Netflix.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.090
So that is our approach,
pretty much what you're

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.940
describing is.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.920
Google knows how to aggregate
and index vast amounts of

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.590
information from many,
many sources.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.990
And then we're trying to
do that, and rank that

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.140
information in a way that's
relevant for you as a user.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.445
And then, we send you to
whatever the destination is

00:29:57.445 --> 00:30:01.690
which the content owner would
like for us to send you to.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.915
So we get the information on
what shows are available from

00:30:03.915 --> 00:30:05.040
the content owners.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.170
And if Netflix wants us to send
the users, then, to the

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.550
Netflix application on Google
TV, that's where they go.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:15.130
If Amazon wants us to send the
user to their website to view

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.940
the movie, then that's
where they go.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.870
But I think it's a
great question.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.350
In this world of millions of
channels, that's exactly what

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.776
we have to do, is to help them
find the content, regardless

00:30:26.776 --> 00:30:28.416
of the source.

00:30:28.416 --> 00:30:29.720
CATHERINE LIANG: And Mario,
do you have any

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.300
questions for Tom?

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.110
MARIO QUEIROZ: I do.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.440
I think one of the really
important things for all types

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.410
of apps coming to TV, but
certainly for music as well.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.400
And so a couple of questions
that you had I think would be

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:48.400
helpful, is to find or to bring
the multiple screen

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.640
experience closer together.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.590
Let's say that you launch
Pandora on your Google TV, and

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.900
it's running in the background,
you're doing

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:01.490
something else on Google TV.
And one person wanted to

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.010
thumbs up or thumbs
down the song.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:05.640
You should able to do
that on your phone.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:12.060
So Pandora on your phone should
know that Pandora is

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.242
running on Google TV so
that you can thumbs

00:31:14.242 --> 00:31:15.180
up and thumbs down.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:20.630
What ideas or thoughts
do you have for us?

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.880
Is it something that would
interest you guys, to work in

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.695
a more multi-screen type
of an environment?

00:31:26.695 --> 00:31:29.190
TOM CONRAD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:33.900
Just as a baseline, to remind
everybody, you have a Pandora

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.480
account, and that's a universal
account across all

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.920
of the places that you
enjoy Pandora.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.760
And so, the stations that
you're creating and

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.800
personalizing on the web or on
your phone are available when

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.600
you're connected in your car
or available on your

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.090
television.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.880
So we do have this kind of
universal experience today.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.990
But what Mario is getting at,
I think, is really the

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.240
exciting potential evolution of
that, which is, how can we

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.350
use the phone in your pocket
to control the television?

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.395
How can we bring people
together to let them

00:32:03.395 --> 00:32:04.695
collaborate around the
listening experience?

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.760
We've got a bunch of exciting
ideas in that area, and it's

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.450
another example where
the Google TV

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.210
platform is so powerful.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:18.460
When we have complete control
from our development

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.780
environment of both the
television and the phone,

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.230
there's suddenly so many things
that we can easily do,

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.070
make enhancements to both, to
allow them to cooperate.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.850
It's so much harder when you're
talking about this kind

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:34.260
of more heterogeneous world with
hundreds of differences

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.140
and limitations and things.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:43.160
So I'd love to see Pandora kind
of innovate around this

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.190
multi-screen listening
experience.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.500
And Google TV would be a really
great place to begin

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.820
those experiments.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.330
MARIO QUEIROZ: We're looking
forward to hearing from you

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.080
and your team and from other
developers on [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.466
for us and how we should
be doing that.

00:33:00.466 --> 00:33:02.990
CATHERINE LIANG: Do you guys
have any last comments before

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.390
we wrap up?

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:04.890
Tom?

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.960
TOM CONRAD: No, this is great.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.830
It's a shame you can't all
be here in Austin.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.280
The sun is finally coming out.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.580
And Google's taken over
an entire block.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.845
It's pretty exciting.

00:33:15.845 --> 00:33:17.240
CATHERINE LIANG: And Mario?

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.620
MARIO QUEIROZ: Well, I just want
to thank Tom again for

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.640
joining us.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.780
Like I said at the beginning,
I love Pandora and I think a

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.450
lot of our Google TV
users love Pandora.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:31.360
And I know that our OEM, LG,
Sony, Samsung are really

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.530
excited about working
with you guys.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:34.805
TOM CONRAD: Great.

00:33:34.805 --> 00:33:37.040
CATHERINE LIANG: Thank you both
for taking the time to

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.670
join us this morning.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.050
And thank you all for watching
and listening in.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.580
Signing off from South
by Southwest

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.640
MARIO QUEIROZ: Bye-bye.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.890
TOM CONRAD: Bye, everybody.
