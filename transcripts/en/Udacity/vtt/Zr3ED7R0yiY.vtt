Well, nearsightedness focuses the image somewhere around here in front of the

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:09.150
retina. I know it doesn't focus on the retina, because that's perfect vision.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.660
So, it has to be here, behind the retina.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.188
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly Lauren, and this happens when the retina doesn't bend the light far

00:00:15.188 --> 00:00:19.192
enough. So, we have a situation something like this. Of course the light

00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:22.970
doesn't actually go back behind the retina, gets collected here. But this is

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.719
where it would be focused.
