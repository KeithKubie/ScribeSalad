MARIO GALARRETA: OK.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.380
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.570
And welcome.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.510
Thank you for joining

at Google sponsored by gPause.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.170
My name is Mario
Galarreta, I work

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.380
in the Well-Being and
Learning Team that's

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.460
part of People Development.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.430
And we manage programs like
Search Inside Yourself, gPause,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.210
Sustaining, 10x, [INAUDIBLE],,
Fundamentals of Mindfulness,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.540
[? gCalm. ?]

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.540
And today, it's
my great pleasure

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.490
as a neuroscientist
to welcome to Google,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.720
introduce Dr. Amishi Jha.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.920
She is Associate Professor in
the Department of Psychology

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.350
at the University of Miami.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.920
She's also the Director of
Contemplative Neuroscience

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.850
for the Mindfulness Research
and Practice Initiative

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.800
also at the University of Miami.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.570
And she's a world-class
scientist studying

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.170
the neural basis of attention.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.520
And studying the
effect, the impact

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.980
of mindfulness and
mindfulness trainings

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.650
in different aspects of
cognition, emotion, and also

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.330
resilience.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.850
Actually, she's the
lead author in one

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.850
of the very early papers,
2007, 10 years ago,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.310
studying the impact of
mindfulness training

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.380
on attention.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.960
Over the years, she
has focused her work

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.620
in the impact of mindfulness
and mindfulness trainings

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.925
in different aspects, including
education, sports, military,

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:42.500
the business.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.170
Right now, her lab is currently
doing a number of studies

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.030
from working with active
military soldiers,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.320
with accountants,
with football players,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.840
with firefighters,
groups of people exposed

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.740
to high demands,
high-performance, high-stress

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.340
work environments.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580
So I think her work is very
relevant to our programs

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.740
and to us at Google.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.716
And please, help me welcome
warmly to Google, Dr. Amishi

00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:15.668
Jha.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:16.620
AMISHI JHA: Thank you.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.572
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:20.910
Thank you, Mario.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.750
All right.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.610
Hello, everyone.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.270
It's my great
pleasure to be here.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.440
And as you can see from
Mario's gracious introduction

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.570
and the title of
my talk, I'd like

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.610
to share with you today
work we've been doing

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.550
and that the broader field
of contemplative neuroscience

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.890
has been doing
around mindfulness.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.720
But I think that
before I jump right in,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.450
it might be helpful to
understand the perspective I

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.330
take in the work that
I do, to kind of frame

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.060
where I'm coming from in the
kind of research questions I

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.770
ask and the orientation I take.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.970
So as Mario mentioned,
my expertise

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.110
is in the topic of the human
brain's attention system.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.300
And the bulk of my research
over many years of my lab

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.540
has been on understanding the
brain mechanisms of attention.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.390
So we use a variety of cognitive
neuroscience techniques

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.400
to study attention.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.700
Things like functional
MRI, brain wave recordings,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.130
or Event-Related
Potentials, ERPs,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.660
as well as behavioral tasks that
are sort of like simple video

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.760
games that allow us to tax
attention in specific ways

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.520
that we can measure the impact.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.942
And through doing this,
we've learned a lot about how

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:31.150
attention works in the brain.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.190
And we basically have
learned that where

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.130
we direct our attention
biases the processing

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.799
of the rest of the brain.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.090
And in some ways, you can
think about this as attention

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.250
being the brain's boss.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.460
Wherever attention goes, the
rest of the brain will follow.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.070
Which means it has a powerful
responsibility with regard

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.495
to where we put our attention.

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:52.120
And through the course
of understanding

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.160
the basics of
attention, we've also

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.740
come to understand that
there are some things that

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.070
are essentially like
kryptonite for our brain's

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.970
system of attention.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.420
And those are listed here.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.940
We know that with high
stress, poor mood, and threat,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.270
our attention system will
become compromised and degraded.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.531
It won't function the
way we want it to,

00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:14.530
which is particularly
problematic because that's

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.100
probably-- those are the kinds
of circumstances in which we

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.980
want to be absolutely sure that
our attention is working well

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.510
because we'll lean on it.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.670
And after understanding
this for several years,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.150
it became sort of a
compelling question for me

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.110
to figure out what
we could do about it.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.110
So if we know there
are circumstances

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.070
in which attention
is compromised,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.790
how might we train the
brain's attention system

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.860
to be protected against this?

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.530
Because it's unlikely for
the kinds of professions

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.560
and personnel that we
involve in our research,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.440
it's unlikely that we can
avoid them ever having--

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.120
in fact, as human
beings, it's unlikely

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.190
that we can avoid
having experiences

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.140
in our lives of stress,
poor mood, and threat.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.150
I wish we could, but sorry.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.650
So that's where
mindfulness training

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.570
comes into my lab's work.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.300
And what I'll share with you
is the studies that we've

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.740
been up to, but also the state
of the field of this research.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.857
And of course, because
science is a team sport,

00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:09.440
but I'm the only one
up here speaking,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.040
I wanted to give a shout-out
to my wonderful team

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.420
of collaborators
and lab members.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.430
And one of them is here
today, Scott Rogers,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.180
who has been a real key
collaborator for me,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.330
because he's the one that
actually helps design and run

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.890
many of the training protocols.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.647
So I'm just very
grateful for this group

00:05:25.647 --> 00:05:27.730
of people that allow me
to actually have something

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.990
to tell you.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.490
All right.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.460
So let's jump right in.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.820
See this image here.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.970
100 years ago, if you told
people that you might willingly

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.940
get on a bike that's had
its back wheel removed,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.010
and pedal as hard and
fast as you possibly

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.190
can to get absolutely
nowhere, I mean,

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.540
you'd think that there were--

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.850
it was preposterous, right?

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.310
But that's exactly what so many
of us do on a regular basis.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.739
So my question is really,
what's going on here?

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:06.280
And I think that the answer to
the question on the next slide

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.613
gives us some insight into this.

00:06:07.613 --> 00:06:10.750
So answer this question,
does physical exercise

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.245
improve physical health?

00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:13.870
For people in the
room, raise your hand

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.640
if you think the answer is yes.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.471
OK.

00:06:16.471 --> 00:06:18.970
Let the record show that's every
single person in this room,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.469
right?

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.090
And I'm getting some strange
looks like, why are you asking

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.980
such a ridiculous question?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.780
And what I want
to suggest to you

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.490
is the reason we get
on exercise bikes

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.870
or we go for jogs is because we
have a cultural understanding

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.410
that this is true, that we need
to exercise our bodies to be

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.430
physically healthy.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.140
It's such a common
understanding that we

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.120
think it's a ridiculous
question to ask.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.495
But what I want to suggest to
you-- and actually, argue--

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:45.070
is that this understanding
didn't come out of thin air.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.330
It actually came through a
dedicated set of research

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.880
questions and science
that pursued understanding

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.250
the relationship with
regard to physical health

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.250
and physical exercise.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.860
And one of the key, really,
pioneers in this area

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.395
was actually an Air Force
captain, who wrote-- literally,

00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:05.770
wrote the book
called "Aerobics."

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.840
He was one of the
first people who put,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.720
maybe 27,000 or so
military service members

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.020
through lots of different tests
to come up with what we now

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.330
consider everyday knowledge.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.440
This notion of
10,000 steps a day,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.170
or the fact that our
cardiovascular health depends

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.030
on our ability to
engage in certain kinds

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.560
of aerobic exercise
comes from his work.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.760
And of course, many, many other
research studies followed.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.640
And the way in which
this field of research

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.100
has parsed the question
of physical health

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.320
and physical exercise
is as follows, right?

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.630
We know that we can
look at the physiology.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.610
We can actually
conduct research that

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.970
has people exercising and look
at their oxygen consumption,

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.900
or whatever it is.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.000
Carbon dioxide levels
in the blood, et cetera.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.210
And that gives us an
indication of their health.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.857
So while they're actually
performing the act of exercise,

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:55.690
we can look at them.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.065
We can look at
people that choose

00:07:57.065 --> 00:07:59.560
as a lifestyle to engage in
physical activity-- elite

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.460
athletes.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.010
And we can see what their
physiology looks like at rest,

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.200
to see if it differs from
those that don't actually

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.950
exercise on a regular basis.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.550
And that there are differences
in the direction of health.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.420
We can look at structural
changes or protein expression.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.950
There are so many
different ways we

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.490
can establish the
link between engaging

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.680
in particular
activities and health.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.750
And, finally performance.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.747
We can look at how people
do when they actually

00:08:25.747 --> 00:08:27.580
engage in activity in
terms of how well they

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.550
perform a challenge task, for
example, of running a marathon.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.240
So this type of research
has actually resulted in--

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.549
and this is an
underestimation, probably,

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:40.510
around 300,000 articles
since 1980 that

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.740
have been done on this topic.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.470
And that volume of
research is what I would

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.170
say is why we have the answer.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.070
So plainly, yes.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.260
That of course,
physical activity

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.400
is tied to physical health.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:52.900
OK.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.830
So I want to make that point.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.200
It seems trivial, but it
didn't come out of nowhere.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.420
And that now because
of this research,

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.210
we are at a point
in our culture--

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.930
and actually, around the
world, that our public health

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.500
officials can give us very
precise evidence-based guidance

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.460
on what to do.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.960
It's not just that
it's good for us,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.360
but here's what you
should do to optimize.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.440
All right.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.270
So I think I've made that point.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.030
And I want to switch gears to
a different kind of a question.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.491
Does mental exercise improve
psychological well-being?

00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:23.740
How many people would say yes?

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.744
Raise your hand.

00:09:25.744 --> 00:09:26.410
All right, fine.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.534
It's unanimous in the room.

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:29.740
But I always like to
think-- you didn't wander

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.050
in here accidentally, right?

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.050
So I think I was talking
to a warmer crowd anyway.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.270
But if I actually
probed you right now

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.350
and said exactly
what you should do,

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.109
I bet the diversity of
opinion would be quite high.

00:09:42.109 --> 00:09:43.900
And part of the reason
is because we're not

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.180
at the same level as we are
with regard to an evidence

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.810
base regarding what
you should do in order

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.240
to stay psychologically fit.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.767
And what mental
exercises you should do.

00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:56.350
And that's sort of
the project of what

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.620
we're talking about with regard
to the science of mindfulness.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.680
It's really to
systematically and rigorously

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.094
be able to ask this question to
see what role it has to play.

00:10:06.094 --> 00:10:07.510
Now, it's not only
scientists that

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.207
are interested in understanding
the answer to this question.

00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:12.040
Of course, the National
Institutes of Health

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.930
is very interested in
understanding the answer

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:14.350
to this question.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.030
And what they've
done now is surveyed

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.480
a broad group of US society.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.180
And what they found is
that many people engage--

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.780
willingly, on their own, engage
in certain mind-body practices

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.670
to benefit their
psychological well-being.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.270
And meditation, of which this
term mindfulness meditation

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.980
is a subset, is practiced by
about 8% of the US population

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.430
according to NIH's numbers.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.930
Right

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.170
So you might ask, well, what
is driving people to do this?

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.350
What is their
number 1 explanation

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.492
for what motivates them
to practice meditation?

00:10:49.492 --> 00:10:51.910
Well, it's this.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.140
And I mean, I don't really
like showing this slide.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.370
I think it's kind of stressful.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.950
But it does really
suggest to us that there's

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.930
a motivating factor
that most of us--

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.570
the bottom-line denominator
of what all of us

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.230
experience in our lives that
make us wanting to do something

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.420
to help ourselves.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.030
And when I give this
type of presentation

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.460
and I say stress, especially
to military audiences,

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.577
I usually get
immediate push-back,

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:18.910
like what are you talking about?

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.084
Stress allows me to
rise to the challenge.

00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:24.250
I'm at my peak because
there's something driving me.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.360
There's a deadline.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.580
There's a challenge before me.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.320
I have to be at my excellence,
at my best to achieve it.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.230
And my answer to
that is absolutely.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.020
So I want to describe
to you a very well, kind

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.450
of explored function
that describes

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.910
what a lot of these service
members are saying to me,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.500
which is the Yerkes-Dodson law.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.034
It may be familiar
to some of you.

00:11:46.034 --> 00:11:47.450
And what it's
saying, essentially,

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.380
is that there is a lawful
relationship between the amount

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.300
of stress or challenge
we experience,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.110
the amount of demand
we experience,

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.830
which is shown on the
x-axis, and our performance

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.750
on the y-axis.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.450
What it suggests is that,
sure, when our stress is low,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.620
when we have nothing
driving us, our performance

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.730
isn't that great--

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.690
back down at the
bottom near the origin.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.630
But as our stress
increases, we do actually

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.800
rise to the challenge.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.110
Our performance does
increase until we

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.740
reach that sweet spot, what
we might call "optimum stress,

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.790
optimal stress."

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.460
And everything on sort of
this side of that sweet spot,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.910
we'd call eustress,
or good stress.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.010
But when we pass
that tipping point,

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.290
that right amount of stress
to optimize performance,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.320
we're no longer going to
benefit from increasing stress.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.230
At that point, the
curve starts going down.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.325
And what we learn is that
performance actually declines.

00:12:44.325 --> 00:12:46.450
And we would no longer call
that beneficial stress.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.850
We'd call it distress.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.970
And this is what unfortunately
happens to many of us,

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.370
even if something
started out as eustress

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.220
because it was the right amount
of challenge and motivation,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.830
if you have to experience
that amount of stress

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.190
for a protracted period of
time, it doesn't let up,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.010
the chronic effects of that
are that they do result

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.799
in psychological distress.

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:10.590
So that's what I'm
talking about right now.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.370
I'm talking about
this notion that there

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.920
are levels of demand,
situational challenges,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.950
psychological challenges,
even physical challenges, that

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:23.236
put us at not allowing
optimal functioning.

00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:24.860
And of course, then
an obvious question

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.070
might be, what can
we do about it?

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.890
And as I mentioned,
there are populations

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.595
of people for whom
they don't have

00:13:29.595 --> 00:13:31.220
much of a choice in
the level of demand

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.050
that they may experience.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.170
So I like to share this
photo montage collage.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.630
Actually, it was a
part of a project that

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.920
was done to just capture
the faces of soldiers

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.330
as they're in
pre-deployment training,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.515
during deployment, and even
upon return from deployment.

00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:49.640
And if you just let your
eyes kind of rest on that,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.930
you'll see what I'm
talking about here.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.290
Right And I love
this St. Jerome quote

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.480
to sort of capture what
we see, "The face is

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.980
the mirror of the mind.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.960
The eyes without
speaking confess

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.480
the secrets of the heart."

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.320
And we see it.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.170
We see the costs of protracted
periods of high demand

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.760
in everything about us.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.460
So what has been a big
motivating factor for me

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.770
in the research
that I've taken on

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.170
is to see if there's
something we can do about it.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.240
Is there some way in
which we could actually

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.490
explore this
systematically, rigorously,

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.070
applying the tools of
contemplative practice

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.480
and mindfulness
training to be of help?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.570
So let me just describe to
you kind of the paradigm

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.850
that I'm thinking about.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.390
If the broad question
is, how can we

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:38.590
best protect individuals over
high stress periods of time?

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.080
And that is to think about
some constrained time point.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.250
We'll call it time
1 because that's

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.000
the beginning of when
we're going to start

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.700
evaluating the effects.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.300
And we've got some multi-week
or multi-month period of time

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.961
that we call the high-demand
or high-stress interval.

00:14:51.961 --> 00:14:53.960
And at the end of that,
we're going to call it--

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.670
or not even the end.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.003
At some period of time, we're
going to call that time 2.

00:14:57.003 --> 00:14:59.650
And time 1 and time 2 are
really just the evaluation time

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.483
points, where we're
going to probe something

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:03.160
about the participants
or the people

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.830
experiencing the stress to
see what the effects are

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.560
of high-demand intervals.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.380
So what we know is, if we don't
have a high-demand interval,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.240
if we're in sort of
normative civilian life.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.770
You don't have a
big project due.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.500
You have no special events
coming up in your life.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.000
There might be
little fluctuations

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.790
around our level of
well-being, which this cartoon

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.540
graph is sort of describing.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.146
But it's pretty
much staying stable.

00:15:25.146 --> 00:15:26.770
That's what this
dotted line is saying,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.520
that we have some normative
amount of psychological health.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.300
And the prediction is--

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.257
and if we just talked about
this sort of more ordinarily,

00:15:36.257 --> 00:15:37.840
we'd say yeah, of
course, I feel worse

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.339
at the end of a
high-demand interval

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:40.780
than I did at the
beginning of it.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.154
But the prediction
is that we can

00:15:42.154 --> 00:15:43.780
track that well-being
will be worse

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.170
at the end of a high-demand
period than before.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.570
And if this is a
knowable trajectory

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.060
of what will happen to
people's state of mind

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.430
as they enter high stress,
and we can know what

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.920
those high-stress
periods of time are,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.087
let's do something about it.

00:15:58.087 --> 00:16:00.336
So I want to switch gears
now, because as I mentioned,

00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:02.110
I'm an attention researcher.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.405
I'm not actually a clinician.

00:16:04.405 --> 00:16:06.280
Of course, I'm interested
in well-being also,

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.990
my own and those of others.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.280
But what I study is attention.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.980
So I wanted to I wanted to talk
a little bit about attention,

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.400
and how it relates to what I'm
describing as the consequences

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.720
of high stress.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.660
What I'm showing you
here is basically

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.630
two metaphors for two important
brain systems that are-- we

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.960
could call them close
cousins of each other.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.080
The attention system, I use
the metaphor of a flashlight.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.990
So attention allows you to
direct your mental resources

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.210
at will to a particular
part of space

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.430
or the internal
landscape, for example.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.740
And wherever that
attention is directed

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.845
will benefit from
preferential processing.

00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:44.800
If you're in a darkened room
and you direct a flashlight,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.550
you're going to see what's going
on in that location better.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.730
So as a psychological system,
attention does the same thing.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.010
Working memory, is its,
sort of like I said,

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.820
close cousin system in the sense
that whatever is selected then

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.900
in working memory is maintained
and manipulated for use.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.761
So I like to give the example,
I use the white board here as--

00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:06.760
you can think of it as
the mental scratch space.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.180
Whatever we need to have ready
access to, we put up there.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.530
But it's a mental scratch space.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.050
It's a white board
with disappearing ink.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.425
It doesn't stay
on there forever.

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:17.049
So think of the last
time, for example,

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:19.000
you were having a
conversation with somebody.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.440
And they were talking
and you had an idea.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.760
And you wanted to express it.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.390
But you're not going to be rude.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.181
You're going to hold
that idea in your mind

00:17:25.181 --> 00:17:28.030
till there's a good break in
what they're saying to speak.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.022
That's an example of just having
taxed your working memory.

00:17:31.022 --> 00:17:32.230
You had to hold that in mind.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.790
Not forever, but
just long enough

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.831
to be able to deliver it.

00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:37.962
Or, think about-- it's
happening to me more and more

00:17:37.962 --> 00:17:38.920
than I'd care to admit.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.870
But walking into a
room on a mission

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.030
to get something from
that room, getting there,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.490
and having no idea what you
were looking for, right?

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.394
That's a failure
of working memory.

00:17:47.394 --> 00:17:49.060
That that scratch
space didn't serve you

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.350
because you're looking
at that white board

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.433
and there's nothing there.

00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:52.540
You have no idea.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.980
The point is both
of these systems

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.582
are critical for literally
everything we do.

00:17:56.582 --> 00:17:58.540
And I'm listing some of
the important functions

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.600
of attention and working memory.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.870
This ability to select
and maintain information.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.950
From planning, communicating,
learning, even our ability

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.280
to regulate our own
emotions requires intact

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.256
working memory and attention.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.630
And of course, bigger things,
like the decisions we make.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.510
And finally, the actions
that we produce in the world.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:21.347
All of these require our
intact systems functioning.

00:18:21.347 --> 00:18:22.930
So now, let's talk
about what we think

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.980
would happen to attention over
high-demand periods of time.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.270
Same prediction.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.120
Whereas, normal life
might, where there's not

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.550
a lot of major stressors
happening-- the demand

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.710
levels are pretty up and
down, but pretty normal.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.960
Normative levels of attention.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.000
But under high
stress, we predict

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.750
a systematic linear
decline in the availability

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.640
and functioning of attention.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.090
Now as I said, for many of
the people that we work with,

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.740
this is very important.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.740
And I would say, probably
everybody in this room as well.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.680
Because if we are experiencing
a period of high demand,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.020
typically that
means that we have

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.902
to be functioning
at a high level.

00:19:00.902 --> 00:19:02.860
And we may actually be
experiencing high demand

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.900
because we are
required to function

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.730
at a high level for a
long period of time.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.290
And what this is
suggesting to us

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.310
is that the very thing you need
to function well and perform

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.990
well may actually
be getting depleted

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.770
as a result of the high demand
that you're experiencing.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.570
So at the end of
that period of time,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.028
you may have to do something
big, like give a presentation,

00:19:25.028 --> 00:19:27.570
or have a new product release,
or go to war in the case

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.851
of some of our participants.

00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:30.600
It's at that moment
that you may have less

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.410
of what you need to do well.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.600
OK.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.280
And you know, of
course, as I mentioned,

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.910
we work with groups like
soldiers, or firefighters,

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.730
or high-stress,
high-demand groups.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.850
And when we think about
service members in particular,

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.620
it may seem like kind
of not relatable.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.530
But just remember
that for all of us,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.380
there is a sense of what a
mental war zone feels like.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.230
Our consequences may not be life
or death in a literal sense.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.720
But many times, the
stresses we face

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.040
feel like they have life
or death consequences.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.100
And in some sense, our
physiology and our brain

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.950
don't care what the reality is.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.290
We get hijacked in the same way
and the costs, unfortunately,

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.150
are the same.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.160
So I hope that helps
relate a lot of this work

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.810
to our kind of
everyday experience,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.730
for those of us that aren't
preparing for a war zone.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:21.300
All right.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.950
So what this brings
up is this notion

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.540
of how we would
protect our attention.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.750
And I use this phrase
"cognitive resilience."

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.059
I mean, resilience
is a broad term

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:32.100
that has to do with bouncing
back from challenge.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.808
Cognitive resilience
I'm going to unpack.

00:20:33.808 --> 00:20:36.630
And apologies in advance for
the very academic-sounding

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.140
description.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.120
"The ability to
maintain or regain

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.630
cognitive capacities at risk
for degradation, depletion,

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.850
or failure in the face
of situational challenges

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.850
experienced over
protracted time periods."

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.860
So basically, it's
sort of this desire

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.810
to hold steady with
our functioning,

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.532
even though the
challenges are increasing.

00:20:57.532 --> 00:20:59.490
And if we can do this,
we have the best chances

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.670
of performing well under those
circumstances that bring it

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.880
about as high challenge.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.380
All right.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.630
So the question
really is, can we

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.880
provide some kind
of mental training

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.460
in which we can keep
this line steady,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.410
even though the people
that we're working with

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.510
are experiencing high demand?

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.960
And I want to now connect
the dots between everything

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.500
I've said.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.120
I'm an attention researcher.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.340
I'm talking about stress
and the costs of stress.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.280
And I'm interested
in mindfulness.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.460
So this image should help
you hopefully understand

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.424
where I'm coming from.

00:21:30.424 --> 00:21:31.590
Everybody know what this is?

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.690
It's a music player.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.780
And essentially, my
proposal is that the mind is

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.460
very much like a music player.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.970
It is an exquisite mental
time-traveling machine.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.910
We can very easily
rewind our mind

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.140
to the past to reflect on
events that have happened.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.130
And we can very easily
fast forward the mind

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.420
to plan for the future.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.570
And that ability to go in
reverse or fast forward

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.400
is essentially the
ability to control when

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.500
in time our attention lives.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.830
So even if we're obviously
in the present moment,

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.179
if our mind is on
the past, we're

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:06.470
actually missing what's
happening in the present moment

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:10.470
because we have been hijacked
to the past or the future.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.710
And this relates to stress,
because most of the time

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.272
when we're stuck in this
mental time-travel mode,

00:22:16.272 --> 00:22:17.730
it's not just a
pleasant reflection

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.340
of events that have gone
by or a wonderful visioning

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.840
of positive outcomes
for the future.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.000
It's usually not that
way for most of us.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.770
It's actually stress.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.600
And what we know is
that a stressed mind

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.980
is more prone to this type
of mental time travel.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.930
And most studies now
say that the amount

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.100
of time we spend not
in the present moment,

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.730
but actually in mind
wandering is about 50--

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.280
about 30% to 50% of
our waking moments.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.890
30% to 50% of our
waking moments we're not

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.730
actually in the present moment.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.860
And when we aren't in
the present moment,

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.980
it's tied to things like
ruminating, reliving,

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.230
or regretting
experiences in the past.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.980
Anybody ever experience that?

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.480
Right.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.370
Or when we're in
fast forward, we

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.420
are actually not just
productively planning.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.050
But sometimes, worst-case
scenario planning,

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.270
catastrophizing, or
worrying about events

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.910
that not only haven't
happened yet, but may never,

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.860
ever happen.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.500
So I hope this helps understand
why as an attention researcher,

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.700
I care about mind wandering.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.270
And why I powerfully
understand that stress

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:20.640
can promote mind wandering and
this hijacking of attention.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.110
So what I'd like
to suggest to you,

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.560
at least based on our research,
is that at least theoretically,

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.330
we could think
about the antidote

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.260
to a stressed wandering
mind as a mindful one.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.020
And this helps highlight
the way that I think

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.786
about what mindfulness is.

00:23:35.786 --> 00:23:38.160
So mindfulness, I would say,
is keeping that button right

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.390
on play.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:43.500
It is about having this kind
of mental mode, this mindset

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.130
in which we are attending to
our present moment experience.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.690
We're in the here and the now.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.630
And to read this definition--
again, kind of more formal,

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.520
"A mental mode
characterized by attention

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.140
to present moment experience
without conceptual elaboration

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.150
or emotional reactivity."

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:01.980
Or to put it more
plainly, it's about being

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.500
in the here and the now
without a story about it.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.200
And this ability to be
in the here and the now

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.580
may sound like a great idea.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.250
It's like, yeah, I
want to be present.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.330
It doesn't always
come easily for us,

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.080
which is why training
programs that really allow

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.450
us to exercise the
muscle of attention,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.172
to put it in this perspective
is important for us

00:24:23.172 --> 00:24:24.380
to really be able to do this.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.540
Because unfortunately,
as I said a moment ago,

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.540
when we're stressed, we're
less likely to be in the now.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.960
We're more likely to be
ruminating about the past

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.400
or worrying about the future.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.000
So it's almost like we have
to have this strengthened

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.950
before we go into a
high-demand scenario,

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.205
so we're protected against
what the mind will, left

00:24:43.205 --> 00:24:45.360
to its own devices, do.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:45.860
OK.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.810
So I'm going to unpack
a little bit about what

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.960
I mean by mindfulness, by giving
you kind of an under the hood.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.690
And I'm sure this is
familiar to many of you

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.450
who practice
mindfulness, but this

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.350
is a foundational
mindfulness exercise.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.270
And I think of it as
really circuit training

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.140
for the brain's
attention system.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.476
So let me break down the kind
of key components of what

00:25:04.476 --> 00:25:06.350
we do in a mindfulness
of breathing exercise.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.010
And this is one intended to
cultivate focused attention.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.900
So what we'd ask our
participants to do

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.720
is for some dedicated period
of time, let's say 10 minutes,

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.960
you're going to sit in a
comfortable, upright, alert

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.180
posture, focus all
of your attention

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.824
to the sensations of breathing.

00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:23.240
So you're going
to constrain where

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.335
that flashlight is focused now.

00:25:25.335 --> 00:25:27.210
And you're going to be
even more constrained.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.770
You're going to select a
very specific sensation tied

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.800
to the breath,
whatever's most prominent

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800
for that period of time.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.460
It could be coolness of
air moving in and out

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.670
of your nostrils, or your
abdomen moving in and out.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.646
Whatever it is, you're
going to select it.

00:25:39.646 --> 00:25:41.270
And then, that's
essentially the target

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.930
for your attention for the
period of formal practice.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.090
Then, the instruction
is essentially, OK.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.030
You've got the focus,
now maintain it there.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:54.080
And as any of you that have
tried it certainly know,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.390
we don't always do what
we're told, our mind is told,

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.765
even if we are
telling ourselves.

00:25:57.765 --> 00:25:59.960
And attention
doesn't stay stably

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.869
on this breath-focused
sensation, it will wander.

00:26:02.869 --> 00:26:05.410
So in anticipation of that, the
third part of the instruction

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.470
is when you notice your mind
has wandered-- not if you've

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.930
noticed your mind has wandered,
when because it will wander.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.000
The first key is notice.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.990
So keep this kind of
watchful perspective

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.300
to see, where is the
contents of consciousness?

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.300
Is it on the breath or
is it somewhere else?

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.370
When you notice your
mind has wandered,

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.350
gently return it back.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.120
Right So nothing
big to do about it,

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.700
just be aware of
where attention is.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.024
And when it's not where you'd
like it to be, redirect it.

00:26:32.024 --> 00:26:34.190
So the reason I've highlighted
these words "select,"

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.590
"maintain," "notice"
and "mind wander,"

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.300
is because those
are the key features

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.560
from a cognitive training
perspective that we hypothesize

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.560
are being trained by
repeated engagement.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.140
And what we want to do in the
kind of program of research

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.260
that I've been involved in is
to see if our hunch is correct.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.400
If we're training these
particular systems,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.810
we might expect that the
strength of our ability

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.640
to select, maintain, and
control our mind wandering

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.570
may be improved.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.630
So that's what
we're looking for.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:03.130
All right.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.463
And I want to just take a
moment to say what mindfulness

00:27:05.463 --> 00:27:07.230
practice isn't.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.242
And again, for those of
you who practice this,

00:27:09.242 --> 00:27:10.200
it will sound familiar.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.310
But I do think it's important.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.726
And as I mentioned,
a lot of times

00:27:12.726 --> 00:27:15.420
I'm briefing audiences
who not only don't

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.577
know about mindfulness, but
don't care and are highly

00:27:18.577 --> 00:27:20.910
skeptical of the fact that
this Indian woman has decided

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.840
to give them a talk on a topic.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.490
So it's sort of like
protecting myself to say, look,

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.072
I'm a neuroscientist,
and what I'm

00:27:28.072 --> 00:27:30.030
trying to tell you is
very specific with regard

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.920
to the way I'm talking
about mindfulness.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.650
And it's not a way to
shut down all thoughts.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.854
That's not the project
of mindfulness.

00:27:36.854 --> 00:27:39.270
There is no mention of trying
to do anything with thoughts

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.300
other than when the focus is
not on the intended object

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.770
to redirect it back.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.640
It's actually not
about deep breathing.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.640
You know, yoga is
now very popular.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.106
And a lot of people
conflate what

00:27:49.106 --> 00:27:51.480
we're trying to do with a
yogic breathing exercise, which

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.970
is very powerful, but that's not
what we're talking about here.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.590
We're not talking
about manipulating

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.820
present-moment experience.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.520
We're talking about observing
what is happening right now.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.230
It's actually not a
relaxation technique,

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.440
though many times people
engaging in these practices

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.920
can feel much more kind
of calm and relaxed.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.610
Because remember, the
main instruction is alert.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.240
Sort of tranquil and alert
may be the good pairing.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.520
The other thing is that it's
not esoteric or mystical

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.020
in any way.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.950
It's not a special
state of being.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.590
And that these practices really
come from the world's wisdom

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.150
traditions.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.490
Almost every major religious
or spiritual tradition

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.370
around the world has some
aspect of contemplative practice

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.130
in it.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.880
And what we're doing
from the science side

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.057
is trying to draw
upon that world wisdom

00:28:34.057 --> 00:28:35.640
to see if there's
mental training that

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.500
could be helpful, and
strengthen the brain,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.150
and make it more fit.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.949
Also-- I wanted to
mention this because I

00:28:40.949 --> 00:28:42.990
think this is important--
you don't need to do it

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.951
for hours on end, days
on end, years on end

00:28:45.951 --> 00:28:46.950
for it to be beneficial.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.730
And some of the work
that we're doing now

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.030
in collaboration with my
colleague Scott Rogers is

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.130
we're trying to see,
what's the lower limit?

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.920
What is sort of the least
amount of time in our efficient,

00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.030
high-demand, high-performance
workplace environments

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.310
that we can do
this in a way that

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:06.220
is beneficial, but doesn't take
a second more than is required.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.374
All right.

00:29:08.374 --> 00:29:10.540
So it's no surprise also
that mindfulness is getting

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.090
a lot of popular attention.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.020
It's everywhere.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.460
It's kind of surprising to me.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.539
When I was starting this work,
it was actually ill-advised.

00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:20.080
People thought nobody
would ever care

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.060
at all what I'm talking about
with mindfulness training.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.018
And you want to study
the mindfulness in brain?

00:29:24.018 --> 00:29:24.847
You're crazy.

00:29:24.847 --> 00:29:26.680
But it's kind of
heartening to me that there

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.880
is a popular interest.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.160
And as you know, one
of the reasons for this

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.010
is organizations like
this one, that see

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.690
the benefits for its employees.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.790
And many other-- we
have sports figures,

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.280
military personnel,
members of Congress,

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.910
major corporations that embrace
mindfulness as something

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.070
that could be of value
for the people that are

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.870
part of those organizations.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.730
And on par, like matching
the popular interest,

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.042
has been the research.

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:55.750
So what this is showing
you is the number

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.720
of research
publications from 1980

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.130
to last year, 2016 which
the term "mindfulness"

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.420
in the search.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.400
And what you can see is obvious.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.780
There's a meteoric rise, there's
this exponential increase

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:11.600
in the interest.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.560
But if you can't see the
numbers very clearly,

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.670
last year there were 667 studies
published that had this term.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.600
Impressive right?

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.230
Much better than 1980, where
there were 0 studies published.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.110
But I'm mentioning this to you
because even though there's

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.190
a popular rise, there's
a scientific interest.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:33.635
We're nowhere near
300,000 articles.

00:30:33.635 --> 00:30:36.010
So everything I'm going to
share with you now with regard

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.551
to the state of this
research, I want

00:30:37.551 --> 00:30:39.460
you to really hold a great--

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.847
take it with a grain of salt.

00:30:41.847 --> 00:30:43.930
And I'm coming to you as
a mindfulness researcher.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:47.260
I'm obviously very
committed to this topic.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.329
But I think more important
to me than you understanding

00:30:50.329 --> 00:30:52.870
the benefits of mindfulness or
the science that suggests that

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.830
it's beneficial is really
coming from a place--

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.590
my own intention as a scientist
to say, I want you to be--

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.530
as you go out into the world
and consume popular media

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.990
around mindfulness, I want you
to be responsible consumers

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.970
of the science that o see.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.890
And the only way to be
responsible consumers

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.470
of the science is to actually
have an understanding of where

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.970
we're at and where we're not.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.230
So that's going to
be the flavor of what

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.854
I want to share with you today,
but it is absolutely compelling

00:31:16.854 --> 00:31:18.850
that we have this growing
rise in the science.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.010
And I think it's
important to understand

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.090
what that means about what we
know now about mindfulness.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.790
And as I go around to many
different organizations, most

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.860
recently-- last October,
it was at the Pentagon

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.330
I got asked this question.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:32.647
You know, great.

00:31:32.647 --> 00:31:34.230
You're here to talk
about mindfulness.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.720
OK.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.428
Cut to the chase.

00:31:35.428 --> 00:31:38.030
Does it work?

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.780
And you know, it's like,
that's a big question.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.970
But I actually think it's
absolutely a fair question

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.480
to ask.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.350
Any leader wants to make sure
that what they have anybody

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.810
in their organization
do is worth the time

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.634
of these individuals.

00:31:52.634 --> 00:31:54.800
But even though it's a
straightforward and important

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.890
question, I actually think
it's a bit of a complicated

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:58.785
question.

00:31:58.785 --> 00:32:00.660
And I want to break down
what I mean by that.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.470
So the first is
really this term "it."

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.180
Does "it" work?

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.400
Well, what the heck
do we mean by "it?"

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.940
"It" in our current day and
age is a world of options.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.340
Imagine that, a
world of options.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.089
You can think of acquiring
mindfulness, familiarity

00:32:16.089 --> 00:32:18.380
with mindfulness or learning
about mindfulness training

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.665
through a book, a lecture, an
app, a retreat, a workshop.

00:32:21.665 --> 00:32:23.040
There's so many
different things.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.331
So when we want to determine
if something is effective,

00:32:25.331 --> 00:32:27.530
if it works, we need to be
very specific about what

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.360
it is that we're evaluating.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.340
And that's where, with
regard to the science,

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.790
one key aspect has been to
have manualized programs.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.420
These are programs in which the
delivery of the program itself

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.560
is constrained in a
very specific way,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.180
so that every time
it's delivered,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.260
there are standards
that are upheld.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.760
And that it's happening in the
same order and same sequence,

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.560
same duration, et cetera.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.140
But I think it's
important to say upfront

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.140
that to know if something
works or not, you

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.770
need to be very precise
about what you're looking at.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:04.550
And two of the most well-studied
and well-manualized programs

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.760
are Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction, MBSR,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.760
developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn
at the UMass Medical School.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.497
And another program related
to that, Mindfulness-Based

00:33:13.497 --> 00:33:15.080
Cognitive Therapy,
which was developed

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.820
at the University of Toronto.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.920
Both of these are about
eight-hour-- sorry,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.400
eight weeks of training.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.180
Eight consecutive weeks
where the participants

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:28.340
meet with the group, with a
qualified trainer for about two

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.810
to three hours a week.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:32.300
And they're assigned daily
homework of about 45 minutes.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.610
And we know exactly the
sequence of the program.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.170
And we know what's done, right?

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.870
And this is a great way in
which we, as scientists,

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.120
can approach understanding
if it's effective.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.650
Because now we at least know
what the container of "it"

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.590
is in this, does it work?

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.420
And now, there have
been enough studies

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.480
done investigating
this type of training

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.120
that we can aggregate the
results across multiple studies

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.994
and do what's called formally
meta-analyses, where we're

00:33:55.994 --> 00:33:57.410
putting together
and statistically

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:02.030
testing how strong the effects
are across not just one or two

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.850
studies, but dozens of studies.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.800
That gives us more
weight to the rigor

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.330
of what we're talking about.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.239
But I think that with
regard to the weight

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:13.400
of what we're talking
about, well, what is it?

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.650
When you ask somebody, does
it work, well, what do you

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.179
mean by "work?"

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.850
What does it actually mean
for something to work?

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.100
And from my point
of view, it really

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.900
is in the spirit of asking
this very broad question, does

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.969
it reduce suffering?

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:32.690
Does it actually have a
beneficial impact on people?

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.670
And the field of research
around mindfulness

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.070
has actually thought
of it similarly.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.780
Suffering, though,
is instantiated

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.570
in very specific sort
of silos of interest.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.389
There are people interested
in understanding and exploring

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.940
ways in which we can reduce
suffering in the body.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.900
Things like chronic
pain, or hypertension,

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.739
or psoriasis, or other
stress-related physiologic

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.270
ailments.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.239
Or, suffering in the mind
with psychological disorders

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.780
from depression,
anxiety, PTSD, ADHD.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.490
The names go on and on.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.680
And the third kind
of area of research

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.100
has been the utility
of mindfulness training

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.684
with regard to suffering when
it comes to our relationships

00:35:09.684 --> 00:35:10.350
with each other.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:12.890
And I think this is where
workplace settings have a lot

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.710
to offer, because this
is when we can actually

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.609
see the impact of certain
members of a community learning

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:20.150
about and engaging
in these practices

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.620
and how it changes the
dynamics that exist.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.120
So some of the
studies in this area,

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.828
which I would say is
really a newer area,

00:35:25.828 --> 00:35:28.340
is looking at things like
marital relationships,

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.714
parent-child relationships.

00:35:29.714 --> 00:35:31.130
And of course,
starting to be done

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.990
has been workplace settings.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.260
So in asking about
whether something works,

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.960
we can go more deeply
into the particular areas.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.340
And I'm listing some of these.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.020
But of course, we
could go on and on

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.715
about all the different topics
that have been investigated.

00:35:44.715 --> 00:35:47.090
Now we're at the point with
regard to these meta-analysis

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:48.590
where we can say, OK.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.860
Across a variety of programs
that have been manualized

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.640
and are investigated
in a vigorous way,

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.810
what's the impact on
certain kinds of measures?

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.630
In this case, looking at
psychological and physical

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:03.720
measures.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.230
So this was a study that
was a few years back now,

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.260
really in the premier journal
of the medical establishment

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.590
in this country, "The Journal of
American Medical Association."

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.660
And they had 47 studies
that they looked at,

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.336
3,500 participants.

00:36:16.336 --> 00:36:17.960
And I want to make
a point here to say,

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.820
they did not conclude
that mindfulness

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:24.200
is some kind of magic answer
to all of life's woes.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.550
Their conclusions were actually
that the effects are moderate--

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.920
10% to 20%.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.060
This gives me a sense that this
is a realistic and solidly-done

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.180
study because probably it is
the case with the current state

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.756
of research with
such a few numbers

00:36:38.756 --> 00:36:39.880
that that would make sense.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.520
But I do want to point out what
they said that translates into,

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.917
because that I think
is quite compelling.

00:36:44.917 --> 00:36:46.750
They said even though
it's moderate evidence

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.740
with 10% to 20% for these
things like depression and pain,

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.990
the effects are comparable
with what would be expected

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.880
from the use of
an anti-depressant

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.120
in a primary care population,
but without associated

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.950
toxicities.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.780
And that, to me,
has the potential

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.000
to be some kind
of a game-changer.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.330
If we can engage in
regular mental exercise

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:10.000
to have the effects comparable
to psychopharmacologic

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.900
solutions that are widely used,
that's pretty powerful stuff.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.240
So I see this as a very
kind of promising beginning

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.340
of an endeavor.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.760
And more studies have
gone on to do this where--

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.430
2 years ago, there was 115
randomized control trials.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.070
And again, finding
similar benefits

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.380
with psychological illness
and physical functioning.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.057
I want to make the point about
randomized controlled trials,

00:37:35.057 --> 00:37:37.140
because that's sort of the
methodology of science.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.030
That's the gold standard of
how we conduct our research.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.252
We have people in a
randomized trial that

00:37:42.252 --> 00:37:43.960
are enrolled into a
study without knowing

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.850
what condition, what
training program they're

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.230
going to be enrolled in.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.190
And then they're
randomly assigned

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.273
to either get, let's say,
mindfulness-based stress

00:37:50.273 --> 00:37:52.690
reduction, or nothing, or
some other program that's

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.700
matched along those dimensions.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.920
And because they're
randomly assigned,

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.900
and because these programs
have been matched,

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.200
now if you find that one
group outperforms another,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.920
you have more confidence that
it's because of the training

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.240
that they did.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.110
So that's also very important.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.110
When we look at studies
and their effectiveness,

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.650
are they holding the
highest standard of science

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:17.410
as they look at results?

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:18.880
So does it work?

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.970
Yes.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.160
Right now, as I said
before, I'd love

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.030
to be able to consider
that this is where we're at

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.040
and happily go away now and
you're done for the afternoon.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.087
But unfortunately,
that's not quite it.

00:38:31.087 --> 00:38:32.670
And one of the things
that's coming up

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.170
is though the
evidence is quite--

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:40.290
is amassing at a very
fast pace, which is great,

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:43.920
there's actually been a lot
of upheaval in our field

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.335
as researchers in mindfulness.

00:38:45.335 --> 00:38:47.460
One of the things that's
come up with regard to all

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.190
of these positive benefits
is that the field itself

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.500
may be biased in its reporting.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.960
I love this one, "The power
of positive thinking skews

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.920
mindfulness studies."

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.890
I mean, I think it's
cute, but it's also

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.745
important to realize what the
costs of doing this might be.

00:39:01.745 --> 00:39:03.120
And what does this
actually mean?

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.782
What does this mean that
there's a positive bias?

00:39:05.782 --> 00:39:07.740
What it's saying is that
out of all the studies

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.920
that are done, out of all the
research studies that have been

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.490
funded from federal
agencies, like the NIH,

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:18.060
on mindfulness
training, far fewer

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.610
are reporting than should.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:21.655
That's the first point.

00:39:21.655 --> 00:39:24.030
There are fewer studies that
are actually being published

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.800
based on these funded projects.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.000
And those that are reporting
are disproportionately positive.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.644
So this raises a
lot of red flags

00:39:31.644 --> 00:39:33.060
because it suggests
that there may

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.000
be a lot of studies that are
finding nothing, or finding

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.376
opposite or unexpected effects.

00:39:37.376 --> 00:39:39.000
And people are
essentially leaving them

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.060
in their file drawers.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.560
Right

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.393
And this, to me, is
sort of a call to action

00:39:42.393 --> 00:39:43.950
for other scientists as well.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.480
Publish those null results.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.850
Publish studies in which
you find nothing or even

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.939
unexpectedly different things.

00:39:49.939 --> 00:39:51.480
And why do I think
this is important?

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.040
Well, part of it
is because that's

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.630
the only way we're
going to understand

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.700
what best practices are.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.490
If you do a mindfulness
training study

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:03.030
where your intervention is
five minutes over three days.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.280
And you find that five minutes
of mindfulness practice

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.770
over three days has no
benefits, and you never

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.400
publish that, we'll never
know that that low of a dose

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.720
has no effect.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.090
And it's important so
that we know at what level

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.640
we start seeing benefits.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.950
Again, look at the
physical fitness analogy.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.140
The number is not 3 steps a day.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.620
It's 10,000 steps a day.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.180
So where did that come from?

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.510
It came from knowing how
low you can go to still have

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.800
tractable benefits.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.290
So that's my sort of
plea to other scientists

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:33.710
is that you have to
be more rigorous.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:34.710
Publish null results.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.670
A lot of efforts
now in the science

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.180
are to pre-register trials,
so that the moment you

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.513
get the funding, you actually
write the paper that says,

00:40:41.513 --> 00:40:42.910
this is all what
I'm going to do.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.743
And no matter what, no
matter what you find,

00:40:44.743 --> 00:40:46.120
your study will be published.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.130
So that if you
find nothing, it's

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:47.950
still going to get published.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.491
And that helps put the load off
of the researcher, who that's

00:40:50.491 --> 00:40:52.710
their main fear, is
like, if I find nothing,

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.044
nobody is going to publish this.

00:40:54.044 --> 00:40:55.793
And I think that this
is a great direction

00:40:55.793 --> 00:40:56.760
that science is going.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.718
But from the point of
view of our conversation,

00:40:58.718 --> 00:41:01.770
I just wanted to say, I'd
love to say the answer is yes,

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.510
but I won't say
the answer is yes.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.430
Because it's actually not yes.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.010
It's a highly provisional yes.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.650
And if I could, I'd make the
font even smaller for the word

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.490
"yes."

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.650
Because I think so much
more research is needed.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:18.060
We're nowhere near the numbers
regarding physical fitness.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.819
And that's the only
way this is going

00:41:19.819 --> 00:41:21.360
to be a sustainable
enterprise that's

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.190
beneficial for all of us.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.870
All right.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.580
But I wanted to
basically say this.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.120
Does it work is important.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.680
But as a neuroscientist, my
interest was not in that alone.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.970
It was how.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:37.625
How is it that the randomized
control trials that

00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:39.750
have been done suggest that
mindfulness training is

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.660
beneficial for something like
psoriasis, having a better

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.260
marriage, and curing some
kind of psychological illness?

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.400
How is it even possible?

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.490
What is happening under the
hood, which is what drives us

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.870
and interests us in
looking at the brain.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.050
So let's talk a little
bit about the brain

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:59.550
and what we know about the brain
with regard to mindfulness.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.890
And I wanted to just
bring up this term that

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:03.540
is actually a pretty new term.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.260
When I was in graduate school,
this notion of neuroplasticity

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.630
was not well-understood at all.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.330
And a similar term,
actually a related term,

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.160
called neurogenesis--

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.320
the birth of new
neurons in the brain--

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.300
was not even probably coined
when I started my undergrad.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.480
So what is neurogenesis?

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.930
What does that even mean?

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:24.850
Well, when I was
in graduate school,

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:27.150
the notion was that we were
born with a certain number

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.290
of neurons.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.439
They developed into
early adulthood.

00:42:30.439 --> 00:42:32.480
And then whatever we were
left with at that point

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.820
is the number of neurons we
had until the slow decline

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.850
and their death through
the course of our lives.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.280
Not a very hopeful
scenario, right?

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.330
It's like, you have something
and then it'll just decline.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.250
While I was in graduate
school-- actually,

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.520
toward the end of my time
in the mid-'90s, this term

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.397
"neurogenesis" in the
adult brain came about,

00:42:53.397 --> 00:42:54.480
which was pretty exciting.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.850
That means that adults
can grow new neurons.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:01.200
And neuroplasticity, the brain
can actually reorganize itself

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.610
in a way that could actually
promote its better health.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.320
We knew a lot about
neuroplasticity

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.730
from the stroke recovery side.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.570
We know that people can get
better if they've been injured.

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:12.790
But this is suggesting,
even in a healthy brain,

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.887
you can get healthier through
the kinds of mental exercises

00:43:15.887 --> 00:43:16.470
you engage in.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.540
Why am I showing this
crumpled up piece of paper?

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.410
It's really just to kind
of demystify the brain.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.020
The brain is essentially--

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.810
think of a sheet of tissue,
kind of sheets of tissue,

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.030
layered one on
top of each other.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.850
So you got a stack of tissue
now crumpled up as tightly

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.180
as you possibly can, and then
put inside this handy container

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.230
called a skull.

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:36.580
And that's our brain.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.000
And this crumpling up,
this tightly-packed nature

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.720
of those cell layers allows
for the efficient communication

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.520
between cells.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.520
Now, it ends up that as
we age, as we have stress,

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.980
that crumpling diminishes.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.500
The brains gets
smoother as we age.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.810
And that suggests a
lack of efficiency

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:57.561
in our brain function.

00:43:57.561 --> 00:43:58.810
So why am I'm mentioning this?

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.100
Because this is the
kind of thing people

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.891
are looking at with
regard to brain changes

00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:04.750
that may be beneficial
with mindfulness training.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.860
And I want to just
mention that, again,

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.680
when we look at the
brain, we're going

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.450
to look at it with
a very specific eye

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:12.100
to the kind of
cognitive training

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.260
we think that we're engaging in.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.160
So this is, again, reminding you
of what that basic mindfulness

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.420
practice is, right?

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:25.720
Select, maintain, notice,
and control your mind wander.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.304
And through the field of sort of
basic cognitive neuroscience--

00:44:29.304 --> 00:44:31.720
nothing to do with the field
of contemplative neuroscience

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.420
or mindfulness, just basic
cognitive neuroscience,

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:38.590
we know a lot about how
the brain is activated

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:40.460
as a function of
selecting-- potentially

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.599
selecting and maintaining,
noticing, and mind wandering.

00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:44.890
And that's shown in this slide.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.848
This is a study done by,
actually, a researcher

00:44:46.848 --> 00:44:48.400
at Stanford a few years back.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.110
And what it's showing
you is that these

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:55.210
are identifiable brain networks
that exist in all of us

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.490
and that get activated
as a function of what

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.667
particular process, functional
process, we're engaged in.

00:45:00.667 --> 00:45:01.750
So a couple of key things.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.670
The particular regions
don't actually matter.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:05.878
To me, it doesn't matter so
much that you know those.

00:45:05.878 --> 00:45:08.080
But what it is important
to me that you know

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:13.450
is that these different
networks are basically,

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.280
for the most part,
non-overlapping.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.590
Meaning that they're
taxing and activating

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:19.900
different parts of the brain.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.690
And that they're
mutually inhibitory.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:24.200
What do I mean by that?

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.800
Well, what that means is
if a brain network that

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.020
is involved in selecting and
maintaining is activated,

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.570
another network,
let's say having

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:35.270
to do with mind wandering,
is going to be deactivated.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.500
And vice-versa.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.200
If you are mind
wandering, the chances

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.280
of you being able to
fully activate the select

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.790
and maintain network
are reduced because

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:47.360
of this anti-correlation issue.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.000
Now, I think that this is
important because not only does

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.980
it tell us about the nature
of how these processes work

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.813
in relationship to each
other, but they also

00:45:53.813 --> 00:45:55.940
give us great
hypotheses of where

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.320
we think mindfulness
training may

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.780
have its structural
and functional effects.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.150
Because these are
the processes that we

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.310
know from the
training program are

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.560
key to what's being exercised.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.700
Does that make sense?

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.300
OK.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.020
So what I wanted to
just tell you again,

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.300
sort of the state of
the field right now,

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.460
is that there have been
many functional studies.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.550
There was a recent
meta-analysis of 78 studies.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.500
What I'm showing you
here is a meta-analysis

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.940
of structural studies.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.460
So this is just looking
at the brains of people

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.942
across multiple studies.

00:46:23.942 --> 00:46:25.400
And the point I
want to make again,

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.816
the particular
regions aren't key.

00:46:26.816 --> 00:46:29.420
But what's key is
that it's not random.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.790
And that some of those
same nodes with regard

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:35.000
to selecting, maintaining,
and controlling mind wandering

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.787
are the ones that we are seeing
structural changes within,

00:46:38.787 --> 00:46:41.120
suggesting-- and the nature
of those structural changes,

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.670
by the way, is this
improved gyrofication.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:47.550
So it's like the
de-crumpling may

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:50.930
be happening as we kind of age
or as we experience stress.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:55.220
But with practices like
daily mindfulness exercises,

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.980
there are certain nodes
that remain intact,

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.260
that don't show
that degradation.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.880
And what's important
here, though.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.430
I think this is very
interesting, that we see

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:05.930
tractable structural changes.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:07.304
But there is
something I want to,

00:47:07.304 --> 00:47:10.580
again, mention to you as being
honest brokers of the science.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.860
These are not randomized
controlled trials.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.560
These are studies done in people
that have chosen on their own

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:20.540
to practice mindfulness training
for, let's say, 5 to 20 years.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.400
So when we see
changes like this,

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.185
it could be because
of the mindfulness,

00:47:24.185 --> 00:47:26.810
but it could be that people that
decide to practice mindfulness

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.030
had other dietary choices,
different social networks,

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.270
different professional
choices that they make.

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:34.144
Or they may just be
different to begin with.

00:47:34.144 --> 00:47:35.810
Their brains may--
even before they ever

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:38.030
started doing anything
having to do with meditation,

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.790
may have been different.

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.206
So what we don't
know from studies

00:47:40.206 --> 00:47:42.740
like this is what's driving
the nature of the change, which

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.320
means that to actually be
rigorous in what we do,

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.440
we'd have to assign people to
different types of practices

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.660
and compare the structure
and function of their brain

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.300
after they engage in those
practices for a period of time.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.200
But that's where the
science is headed.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.030
That's what we want to do next.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.100
Or we are doing, I should say.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:47:59.600
OK.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.610
So just to kind of
catch us up to speed,

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.587
you remember this figure
and the number of studies?

00:48:04.587 --> 00:48:06.170
I want to just tell
you that we're now

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.760
at a very similar
point with regard

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.470
to the scientific
strategies we're

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.260
taking to examine mindfulness.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.150
That we now know
what the brain looks

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:17.450
like when people are actively
engaging in practice.

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:21.157
Or what it looks like at rest
or the structural changes.

00:48:21.157 --> 00:48:23.240
The growing area of research
from my point of view

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.550
that is still in need
of more bolstering

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:26.870
is looking at the impact.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.932
Because I actually, frankly,
think this is the bottom line.

00:48:29.932 --> 00:48:31.390
It's great that
your brain changes,

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:33.440
but if it has no impact
on your performance,

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.309
it's not worth a lot in
our day-to-day lives.

00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:38.600
So one of the key questions
I've been interested in is,

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.600
how does engaging in a
formal mindfulness program,

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.730
for example, alter performance?

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.370
And our predictions there
are straightforward as well.

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:48.110
We would expect
and, in fact, this

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:50.390
is showing you a
subset of studies

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:51.860
that are showing
that people that

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.900
engage in a multi-week
mindfulness training

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.820
program compared to
those who don't or do

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.770
some other kind of
program, improve

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:01.160
their performance on
selective attention tasks,

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.920
working memory tasks, and
they reduce the amount of mind

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.820
wandering that
they're reporting.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.490
And I think this
is very exciting

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:09.440
because it suggests that
you can functionally

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.260
improve people in
their performance

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.180
as a function of this training.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.880
And I just wanted to now end
by saying that in the work

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.630
that we're doing, as
I said at the outset,

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:20.314
our interest isn't so much--

00:49:20.314 --> 00:49:21.980
we want people to get
better, of course.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.230
But we want to see if we
can use mindfulness training

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.810
in a strategic way
to build resilience

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:28.940
in groups that are really
vulnerable to having

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.685
degradation in these processes.

00:49:30.685 --> 00:49:32.810
And one of the programs
that we've developed called

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:34.351
Mindfulness-Based
Attention Training,

00:49:34.351 --> 00:49:35.900
as you can see the
military look--

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.710
MBAT.

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:42.420
It's intended for soldiers and
for military family members.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:46.100
It allows us to see if
it's the case that offering

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:49.910
people mindfulness
training before they begin

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:52.580
that intensive period of
pre-deployment training

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.950
or even deploying,
to see if we can

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.830
protect against the
declines that might come.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:49:59.330
All right.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:00.800
I think I'm going to
have to wrap up now,

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.383
but I wanted to just
end on this note.

00:50:02.383 --> 00:50:04.490
And basically, share
with you that where

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:06.470
are we in the
state of the field?

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.690
Where we're at in the
state of the field

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:11.630
is this understanding that
we have now identified

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:13.550
a problem space with
regard to the science

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.410
that we can actually pursue.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:18.530
We can pursue in a
systematic and rigorous way

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:19.901
to answer more questions.

00:50:19.901 --> 00:50:21.650
And we are finding
that there are benefits

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:24.260
to physical well-being,
to psychological health,

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.800
to relationships, and stress
protective effects to things

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.800
like degradation and
attention, and working memory,

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.150
and mind wandering.

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.860
But I also want to say that
there's a lot more science

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:35.520
to be done.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.870
And we're nowhere
near the threshold

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.960
we need to reach to produce
a cultural understanding

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.550
that the mind,
just like the body,

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:48.180
needs to be exercised
daily for optimum wellness.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.140
And I hope that through
our continued efforts,

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.692
we'll be able to do so.

00:50:51.692 --> 00:50:54.150
So I'll just end by thanking
all of you for your attention.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.941
Thank you.

00:50:54.941 --> 00:50:59.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.650
MARIO GALARRETA:
Thank you so much.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:02.940
It was a fantastic talk.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:03.330
AMISHI JHA: Thank you.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.560
MARIO GALARRETA: We are going
to have time for a couple--

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.370
three questions.

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:10.444
So if anybody in the
room has a question.

00:51:10.444 --> 00:51:11.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:16.240
You mentioned that public
knowledge and interest

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.910
in mindfulness training
and mindfulness in general

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:22.240
has become exponentially
more popular in recent years.

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.120
I was wondering how the
pop culture understanding

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.210
of mindfulness affects
the perception of the work

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.216
that you do?

00:51:29.216 --> 00:51:31.090
AMISHI JHA: Well, it
leads me to giving talks

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.250
like the one I
just gave, which is

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.700
that I think that the
public interest is outpacing

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.110
what the science can deliver.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:40.630
And I think that
part of it means

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:42.910
that as scientists who are
actively doing this work,

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.520
we have to say where
we're really at.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.410
Because it's not a cure-all.

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.330
Its effects aren't
lasting if you just

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:51.220
read a book on mindfulness.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.220
And that type of
notion can actually

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.960
be problematic for people.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.150
And probably, would
result in them disengaging

00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:59.983
from practicing altogether
because they have

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:01.510
an unrealistic view
of what it takes

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.322
to actually see benefits and
change in their own life.

00:52:04.322 --> 00:52:05.280
So that's where I'm at.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.330
I'm at trying to course
correct a little bit

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:09.989
and have the hype
kind of dwindle

00:52:09.989 --> 00:52:11.530
and the rigor of
the science increase

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:14.492
to get it to a better place.

00:52:14.492 --> 00:52:15.390
MARIO GALARRETA: OK.

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:16.570
More questions?

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.390
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for your talk.

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.910
I had a question about
the emotional side.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:28.240
So have there been
research published

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.770
on the effect of the emotions
while either being mindful

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:35.980
or in the moment of stress,
like how has that been handled?

00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.150
Whether it's a flight or fight
or fear, anger, or anything

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.792
like that.

00:52:40.792 --> 00:52:42.000
AMISHI JHA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.670
So I think that that
is a very important--

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:47.710
and it may seem
unrelated to attention,

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.500
but it's actually
deeply intertwined

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.590
with the attentional
work that I was sharing.

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:56.680
Because it ends up
that these aspects

00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:01.990
of our emotional response to an
experience tend to be the thing

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:05.230
that can hijack our attention
away from the moment.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:07.220
So if you're having
a fear response

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.480
or you're having
anger, that content

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.280
consumes the
attentional resources

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.780
available in the moment.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.840
So part of what we're seeing
actually in some of our work

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.180
is that when we increase
the capacity of working

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:21.010
memory and attention,
we can actually

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.180
improve emotion regulation.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.120
So for example, in
pre-deployment Marines,

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.210
what we found is that
if we do nothing at all,

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:28.450
their negative mood--

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:30.910
as you can imagine,
their negative mood

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:33.220
increased in the
eight-week period

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.650
as they approached
pre-deployment.

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:37.210
Got more negative.

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:39.910
And stress, the same way.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:40.900
Anxiety, the same way.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.002
Everything gets more profound.

00:53:43.002 --> 00:53:44.710
But when we offered
mindfulness training,

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:48.610
those that actually practiced
did not get that increase,

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:51.400
but only if they actually showed
improvements in their working

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.760
memory.

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.390
So what we think is happening
is that that ability to hold

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:57.880
and grow this
mental white space,

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.392
this internal
capacity to control

00:54:00.392 --> 00:54:02.350
the contents of your
present moment experience,

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:04.930
can give you a better
ability to handle

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.300
and deal with those
negative emotions.

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.611
Does that answer your question?

00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:09.111
OK.

00:54:13.177 --> 00:54:14.510
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:16.385
So you mentioned there
is different trainings

00:54:16.385 --> 00:54:17.970
in different studies.

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.100
From a practical
perspective, what

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.675
is the threshold you are looking
right now when, I guess--

00:54:22.675 --> 00:54:23.800
AMISHI JHA: Great question.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.860
AUDIENCE: --meditation
actually seems to matter?

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:26.690
AMISHI JHA: Yeah.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:27.660
AUDIENCE: What's
the minimum number?

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.110
AMISHI JHA: Thank you.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:30.090
So the question was
regarding threshold, right?

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:32.760
So it's kind of one of those
cut to the chase things.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.340
Do I have to go on a three-month
intensive silent retreat

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.614
to have any benefit or can
I do five minutes a day?

00:54:37.614 --> 00:54:39.780
Is that kind of what you
mean, like where are we at?

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.530
So that's actually
what I've been spending

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:45.910
the last five or so years in
my lab doing across four DOD

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:47.372
grants.

00:54:47.372 --> 00:54:49.080
Because they want to
know the same thing.

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.700
It's like, how much
is enough, but not

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.658
more than we need to
actually produce benefits?

00:54:52.658 --> 00:54:54.210
Now, enough, what
we need, I mean,

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.250
all those are fluid, right?

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.150
I mean, nobody's
promising that you're

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:00.570
going to have fully enlightened,
never disregulate person

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:01.620
going through these programs.

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.270
You're going to have people
that have better attention

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.699
and better mood, for example.

00:55:04.699 --> 00:55:06.240
And what we've done
is we started out

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:10.170
with using this 8-week model
of MBSR, which is around 8

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:12.602
weeks and 40 hours or more.

00:55:12.602 --> 00:55:15.060
And what we did in our studies
with active-duty military is

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.680
we said, we're going to
still hold this 8 week

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.200
period of time, but we're
going to actually cut the time

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.120
to 24 hours in 1 program.

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.830
So that would be 3 hours a week.

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.080
In another group, we'd
do 2 hours a week.

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.160
So 16.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.130
In another group, we did
1 hour a week, 8 hours.

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:31.290
And what we looked to see
is what the differences

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:32.952
were in their mood,
in their attention,

00:55:32.952 --> 00:55:34.410
in their working
memory, et cetera.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:37.170
And what we found is that we
could go as low as 8 hours

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:42.270
and still see benefits, but
only if those 8 hours actually

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:45.390
included an emphasis
on practice.

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.440
So we had a comparison
8-hour program

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.440
where the same trainer
talked about mindfulness,

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.720
but only really talked
about mindfulness,

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.390
wasn't spending as much time in
class practicing mindfulness.

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:56.400
That was the equivalent
of doing nothing at all.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.430
So as you shorten the
duration of the training,

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:03.420
the proportion of time spent
actually practicing in class

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.380
is key.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.360
So now through my work
with Scott Rogers,

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.390
we've gone on to see if 4
weeks or 2 weeks with 8 hours

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:10.412
is beneficial.

00:56:10.412 --> 00:56:12.120
And what we're finding
is that we can now

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.620
see in 4 weeks and 8
hours, the benefit.

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.650
But that's more than half
the class being practice.

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:21.523
So that's the nature
of how it's looking.

00:56:21.523 --> 00:56:22.356
MARIO GALARRETA: OK.

00:56:22.356 --> 00:56:23.466
So our time is up.

00:56:23.466 --> 00:56:24.840
And I just want
to say, thank you

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.760
so much for doing this work.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.172
And thank you for coming
here to share it with us.

00:56:29.172 --> 00:56:30.630
AMISHI JHA: It's
my great pleasure.

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.670
Thank you.

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:36.020
