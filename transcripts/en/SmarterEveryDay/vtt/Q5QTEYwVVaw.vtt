00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.090
Hey it's me Destin. 
Welcome back to

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.120
Smarter Every Day. So today I'm laying tile in my house 
and in order to do so I have to make

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.300
all these intricate cuts to lay the proper foundation. 
Now, it's pretty

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.510
challenging but many people have done this over the years 
and I'm just the next one to come along,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.700
much like helicopter physics. 
Now helicopter physics as you've

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.870
learned over the last few videos is pretty complicated. 
But what you haven't thought about is how these

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.070
principles were learned in the first place. 
So today what I'm gonna do is start a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.250
playlist called the deep dive. Now the deep dive is pretty simple. All you have to do is

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.430
click this playlist and you're gonna start on a journey that's about the length of a normal TV show.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.560
The difference on the deep dive is that you're gonna learn things at an incredible rate.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.710
So all you have to do is start the playlist, sit back,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.890
and absorb all this knowledge. Now we're gonna go back through the physics

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.060
of helicopters that we've learned here, but we're also gonna learn how these principles were

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.090
learned. It's often pretty interesting. 
So while I get back to laying the foundation

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.130
you go ahead and take the deep dive. 
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.210
( power saw )

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.380
Oh, One thing I forgot to tell you.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.550
If you're a mobile user you might not be able to click the annotation so you have to click the link in the description

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.730
below. I'll see you after the jump.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.910
( power saw )

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:55.890
     

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.090
