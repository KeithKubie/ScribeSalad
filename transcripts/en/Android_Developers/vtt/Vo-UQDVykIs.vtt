SHALINI GOVIL-PAI:
So I'm Shalini.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.387
I head up Android TV.

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:10.470
Thank you very much for
joining us in this session

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.670
around developing
for Android TV.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.410
So as Rick alluded to in
the keynote this morning,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.460
the home is really undergoing
some major disruptions,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
starting with broadband getting
better to the homes leading

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.710
to more connected devices.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.790
OTT services really becoming
mainstream in the home.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.760
And voice technologies
creating very simple

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.240
interfaces with which to
connect to different devices

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.270
within your home.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.720
Having said that, we still find
that people's favorite place

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.190
to come home to is still the TV.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.400
People are watching TV
more than they have ever

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.400
done before, more than
phones, more than tablets.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.360
It is TVs that people
come back home to,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.390
and more and more these
TVs are your gateway

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.410
into the connected home.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.050
In addition, as I
mentioned, OTT services

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.120
are one of the ways people are
watching content on their TVs.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.960
And in fact, this
data is US data

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.490
but this is actually true
worldwide, 64% of users

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.460
have at least one
subscription that they

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.370
are consuming on their TVs.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.530
And I would say
probably in this room,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.930
you have at least more than two.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.050
And like I said, this
is a global phenomenon.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.830
That is really the
beauty of Android TV.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.600
It provides one place for
users to watch content,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.690
whether it's coming
from their live TV,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.740
or whether it's coming
from an OTT app,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.680
And one place to play their
favorite games powered

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.170
by the Play Store.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.000
And that is really the momentum
that Android TV is creating.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.970
Many of you may
know-- or may not--

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.140
that we have two tiers that
we offer to our partners.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.110
The retail tier is what
we offer to our OEMs,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.860
including Sony TV and
streaming devices.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.090
And this is powered by a Android
Forward user experience that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.990
showcases Assistant, Cast,
and the Play Store, as well

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.060
as YouTube.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.440
The second tier is what we
offer to our operators, which

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.560
in addition to the
beauty of what we provide

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.490
on the retail tier, also offers
them an experience that they

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.030
can provide to their subscribers
in what we call the operator

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.160
mode.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.590
Because of this phenomenal
flexibility and, of course,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.500
the power of Android--

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.630
which is what Android
TV resides on--

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.130
we are seeing phenomenal
success in the market.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.000
And I'm really happy to announce
six of the top 10 smart TV OEMs

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.600
have signed up with Android TV.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:21.820
And worldwide we have signed
up 140 plus operator partners.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.600
Because of this momentum--

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.790
and thanks to you and
all of your support--

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.460
we are also happy to announce
1,000 plus streaming content

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.730
providers, including
Amazon Prime, which

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.010
is now available broadly on
all Android TV platforms--

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.220
So we have really leaned
in to our app developers--

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.080
and 5,000 plus Android
TV apps that are

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.720
prevalent in the TV app store.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.778
And so with that success, I'm
going to hand it over to Anwar,

00:04:03.778 --> 00:04:05.320
who's going to talk
a little bit more

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.040
about all the exciting things
that are coming in Android TV

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.320
and how you can use them
for your own success.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.240
ANWAR HANEEF:
Thank you, Shalini.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.860
Hi, my name is Anwar Haneef.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.250
I lead product for Android TV
ecosystem and integrations.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.230
I want to share a memorable
personal, professional, moment

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.000
that I had a couple
of months ago.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.700
I had my 70-year-old
father visit,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.040
and I explained to him how
he could control his Android

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.360
TV using his voice using
a Google Home device.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.840
For the first time in his life--

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.260
I won't ever forget
the expression

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.660
that he had-- for the
first time in his life

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.950
he felt like technology
understood him as opposed

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.620
to the other way around.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.630
Without the need for
a remote control,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.840
he could control his TV, he
could control his lights,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.820
all with the simplicity
of his voice.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.710
Now on the other hand, for my
adorable but mildly annoying

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.040
seven-year-old daughter,
voice control TV and lights

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.670
creates a whole different story.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.520
That's a story for another time.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.960
At Google, whether you're 70
or seven-year-old or somewhere

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.390
in between, at Google,
we're committed

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.830
to making the lives of our
users better with technology.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.430
One way we're doing this is
by using the Google Assistant

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.520
to become a helpful
backdrop to your lives,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.850
helping connect you with the
other technology in your lives.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.370
And in this new world
of connected devices

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.160
and technology at
home, Android TV

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.980
is the platform that
Google is developing

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.020
for the biggest and most
important screen at home.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.610
Ever since TV was invented, it
served one key purpose, which

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.790
is helping us watch media.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.480
With the Google Assistant,
we have the opportunity

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.870
to change and evolve the
role of TV in our lives,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.120
to make it more
helpful and help us

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.410
become a conduit to accessing
other technologies at home.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.120
This is the direction that
we want to take Android TV.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.090
And this vision can
only become successful

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.260
if it's shared by our
partners in our ecosystem.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.400
Only with your help can
we make this reality true.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.990
We heard your feedback.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.330
We've spoken to several of you.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.570
And we started to
act on that feedback.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.780
Number one, we
heard that you want

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.860
us to help make it easier
for you to develop apps

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.630
on Android TV.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.790
At the same time, you
wanted to make it easier

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.950
for you to participate in the
Google Assistant ecosystem.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.590
You want to make opportunity--
you want us to help you

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.360
with opportunities to make your
content shine in our platform.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.810
And you want us to help
you fuel your innovation

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.810
by helping you commercialize
and make commerce

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.520
easier on Android TV.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.480
I'm excited to share with
you a couple of examples

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.850
of the things that we've
done in the past year,

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.680
as well as new initiatives
and new features

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.420
that we're launching
coming soon.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.890
Android TV's strength is
in the range and breadth

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.360
of devices, and form factors,
and devices at different price

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.790
points that's available today.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.480
But we've also heard
that, as a developer,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.050
the variability in devices
can make it a little bit more

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.310
challenging in terms of being
able to address these devices.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.090
Earlier this year, we
launched Reference +.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.090
This is a program by which
we simplify and reduce

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.270
the variability in hardware
so that, as a developer,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.990
you can more easily address
the target devices that you're

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.690
addressing on Android TV.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.400
Reference + devices are
also Google Assistant ready.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.940
This ensures a consistent
performance and behavior

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.450
across devices from
multiple manufacturers.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.610
Today, we're working
with 10 TV manufacturers,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.911
and we'll be working
with more over time.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.650
With the proliferation
of streaming content,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.250
creating a great media
discovery experience

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.590
is something that we found
to be extremely critical

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.610
for our users as well
as for our developers.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.390
Earlier, Android TV
launched a user experience

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.940
which gave users multiple
options by which they

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.120
can access their content,
including the ability

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.270
to jump in right into their
favorite content from the home

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.150
screen.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:05.000
Many partners have embraced the
channels and have built their--

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.540
and are starting to see
great engagement and response

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.900
and impact because of
embracing channels.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.690
Some of our partners
are seeing up to 70%

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.960
increase in watch
time and up to 78%

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.820
increase in views by
embracing channels.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.900
Users are staying more engaged
and create more opportunities

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.210
for our media
partners to monetize

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.740
through this engagement.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.500
But we're not stopping there.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.000
What I'd like to talk about
next is some of the new features

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.750
that we're introducing
in the coming year.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.790
The Google Assistant is
built into Android TV.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.680
And we've enabled users to
control their on-demand content

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.640
using voice.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.190
Today, we're lending our voice
to more of our media partners.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.340
Coming soon, Assistant
knows what's on live TV

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.820
and will allow you to use your
voice to instantly switch over

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.480
to live content that you
have playing on your TV.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.490
Philo is one of
the first partners

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.870
that are working with us.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.840
And I would invite you to
stop over at our Sandbox

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.950
to see a live demo.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.560
As the media and app ecosystem
for Android TV grows,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.770
we know it's important for
us to create opportunities

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.460
for you, our ecosystem partners,
to drive discovery of the app

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.920
and content that
you're developing.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.560
To help with that, we're
developing new ways

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.850
by which we can curate and
highlight high-quality content

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.380
on the home screen.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.930
And this is supported by our
editorial team at Google Play.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.425
Expect to see more coming
out soon in this space.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.400
Our user insights indicate that
users are a lot more engaged

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.120
in the app search, discovery,
and browsing process

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.210
when they really understand
the content experience

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.080
and media within the apps
that are available on the Play

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.460
Store.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.040
That's why, today, I'm
excited to announce

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.000
that we're launching a complete
refresh of the Play Store

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.870
on Android TV.

00:11:17.768 --> 00:11:21.149
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.500
Coming later this year,
the new Play Store

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.560
offers a much more immersive
discovery experience,

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.880
where the media and content
experiences are highlighted

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.170
more prominently and creates
a much more engaged discovery

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.350
experience for our users.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.620
Lastly, we heard from you.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:48.000
You're driving innovation and
your investing in content.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.390
And sustaining that innovation
and investment requires fuel.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.180
This is one of the
most popular requests

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.240
that we received
from our ecosystem.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.930
We need to make it easier for
users to buy and subscribe

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.910
on Android TV.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.940
Later this year, we'll be
rolling out an updated user

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.670
experience that brings the
best of Google Play billing

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.410
onto Android TV.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.830
This includes a
simplified user experience

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.940
that simplifies commerce on
TV, including functionality

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.010
such as subscribe and install.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.620
This will allow your users
to not only install an app,

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:34.220
but also subscribe to your
service or from the Play Store.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.880
Secondly, we're introducing
PIN functionality.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.360
This will further streamline the
purchasing process on Android

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.600
TV and make it much more
easier without the need

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.970
for a password.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.095
Purchases on Android TV will
now be smoother, faster,

00:12:51.095 --> 00:12:51.845
and more seamless.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.260
So what I spoke about today--

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.090
I spoke about a couple
of different things.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.470
One, we're tying in and leaning
into the Google Assistant

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.790
ecosystem.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.460
Number two, we're
highlighting and creating

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.610
opportunities to highlight the
content that you're creating

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.550
within from our ecosystem.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:19.050
And lastly, we're simplifying
commerce on Android TV.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.180
These are just a few of
the ways by which we're

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.720
bringing the best of
Google onto Android TV.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.010
As we move towards richer
Google Assistant experiences

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.480
in the home, Android TV as
the largest screen at home

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.610
is a critical pillar of Google's
strategy in the living room.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.490
Getting here has been
an incredible effort.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.240
And I thank you for all that
effort and all the commitment

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.070
that you've had to
help us getting here.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.420
I'm really excited about what we
are introducing today, and all

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.270
of the innovations that we
have baking in the labs.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.310
I really look forward
to working with you

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.020
and look forward
to seeing what we

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.720
can innovate with you together.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.310
With that, I'll
hand it over to Ben,

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.580
who will help us walk through
how some of these innovations

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.990
can be used in your apps.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.490
Thank you.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.710
BENJAMIN BAXTER: Thanks, Anwar.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:13.890
Hello, everyone.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.380
I'm Benjamin Baxter.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.020
I was on developer
relations as a developer

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.520
advocate for Android TV.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.480
I recently joined as an
engineer on the Android TV team.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.270
I want to talk about all
the things Anwar just said,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.610
but how you can do
them in your app today.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.200
But first, I'm really pleased to
announce some adoption numbers

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.510
for Android OS.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.570
We now have over 80%
of Android TV devices

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.220
running Nougat and above.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.360
By the end of the year, we
should see 60% running Oreo.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.500
This is amazing.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.280
With Oreo, we decoupled
the launcher from the OS.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.130
This enables us to update
faster and give users

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.810
better experiences much easier.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.320
You don't have to wait for the
next Android operating system

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.570
just to get the newest features.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.240
Let's dive into these features.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.070
The three things
Anwar talked about

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.860
were the Assistant, how to
bring your content forward

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.408
on the home screen, and
how to make your app easier

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:09.950
for commerce.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.510
Let's start with the Assistant.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.170
I'm really proud to
announce three main things.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:26.140
One, watch actions, live
TV, and playback controls.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.600
Watch actions are a way
for you to say, "Hey,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.800
Google I want to watch 'Avengers
Infinity War.'" Across all

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.190
of our surfaces-- web,
mobile, and especially TV--

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.800
we're able to showcase
your app as a platform

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.210
to watch that content.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.390
All you have to do as an
app developer is supply

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.710
your content to
Google, and we can say,

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.540
hey, this app has your content.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.820
We've updated that
to support live TV.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.120
So now if you have a complex
electronic programming

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.340
guide and EPG, you
can submit that

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.170
as part of your
Content Catalog, and we

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.280
can surface this live TV content
across all of our surfaces.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.887
In addition, we've updated
all of our documentation

00:16:05.887 --> 00:16:06.970
about these watch actions.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.240
Next, with search, we've also
added operator integrations.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.910
So if you're a TV
operator, you can

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.260
have custom actions presented
to the user, such as DVR

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.480
and record now.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.480
As a user, they can
still select more options

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.110
and see your app that has
that content in search.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.350
Lastly, I want to talk
about playback controls.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.820
We've made them even
easier with ExoPlayer.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.810
For playback controls, you
need to have a media session.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.040
What you're able to do now
is listen for callbacks

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.940
from the user, such
as when they say,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.467
"Hey, Google, skip
forward five minutes."

00:16:46.467 --> 00:16:48.550
You end up getting these
callbacks through a media

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.740
session callback.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.840
With ExoPlayer, we made
this easier by connecting

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.930
those two together.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.660
Let's dive further.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.880
Here, we're making a
media session, which just

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.670
takes in a context in a tag.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.390
And then we set it to active.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.890
And if you have other things
you need to set, like the media

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.910
session state or what
your player is doing,

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.740
set that at this time as well.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.069
Once you have an instance
to your media session,

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.010
go ahead and find your
ExoPlayer instance.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.859
With those two, you can create
a MediaSession connector.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.420
This is a new
classroom and extension

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.573
library from ExoPlayer.

00:17:22.573 --> 00:17:24.490
Here we create a media
MediaSession connector,

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.470
and we pass in that
media session instance.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.920
Later, we just call set
player, and we give it

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.840
the ExoPlayer instance.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.670
The MediaSession
connector handles

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.180
all of those playback controls
and all the callbacks for you.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.053
If you do need to customize
it, it's super simple.

00:17:40.053 --> 00:17:42.220
You can add in all the extra
customization you need.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.803
Say you have a music
playlist, and you

00:17:43.803 --> 00:17:45.880
want to customize
the queuing system,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.700
you can do that super
simple with this.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.760
So to wrap that up, we've
implemented new live TV

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.977
integrations.

00:17:54.977 --> 00:17:57.060
We've updated our documentation
and watch actions.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.805
And we made playback controls
even easier with ExoPlayer.

00:18:01.805 --> 00:18:03.180
Let's talk about
the home screen.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.013
This is where your
content can really shine.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.960
The first thing you notice
as a user is the app.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.860
The app shows up and represents
your branding and your content

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.720
with a banner.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.490
We've discovered
some best practices,

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.520
and we just want to
go over them quickly.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.680
Here we have this
beautiful app Banner Best

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.500
Practice, my new favorite app.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.780
However, the banner matters.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.780
In this case, we're
reusing the mobile icon,

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.550
and we notice that
the app icon becomes

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.100
very scrunched and hard to see.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.780
This could lead to a
bad user experience

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.300
and not represent
your branding well.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.920
On the opposite side
of the spectrum,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.690
here we have an image
that's too large,

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.690
and gets scaled,
and might be blurry.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.570
You really want to have a
banner that's 320 by 180.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.560
You also want to put that
banner in the XHDPI folder.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.180
If you put it in
just drawable, it's

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.190
going to be recognized
as an MDPI folder,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.595
and this could lead to scaling
and blurriness with your image.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.613
Also note, we do reuse your
banner in certain contexts.

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:08.030
Depending where
the user is and we

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.680
need to represent
your branding, we

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.540
reuse that banner
across the home screen.

00:19:15.502 --> 00:19:17.960
So the home screen-- real fast
time to tie in to what Anwar

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.040
talked about earlier--

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.900
really comprises
of three things.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.570
Channels-- these are
rows that you can

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.490
surface content to the user.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.968
In addition, there's also a play
next row that's system managed,

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:31.760
and you can add content
there for the users

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.620
to quickly hop back in.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.870
Finally, you can
have video previews.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.880
For example, here we
have an immersive preview

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.840
from Red Bull.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.910
And we've seen increased
engagement from apps

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.030
that support video previews.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.010
How does this work
under the covers?

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.930
Your app is going to
talk to the launcher

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.430
through a content provider.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.400
You can send over any
data, games, music, video

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.210
that your app has,
and the launcher

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.885
is going to store that in
the TV provider database.

00:19:57.885 --> 00:19:59.510
Since we're using
the content provider,

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.520
we're able to do some
optimizations that

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.890
are pretty cool.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.910
If you used the content
provider before,

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.810
you may be use to content
provider operations.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.940
We can optimize all
of these operations

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.160
when we go to update the
home screen by doing this

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.030
all in bulk.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.480
So for example, we make
a call to our back end,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.980
and we get a list
of content that we

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.330
need to add to the home screen.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.700
We can look through that
content and look through what's

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.460
in our channel and say, hey,
here's a bunch of new content

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.210
that we need to add and
create a new operation to add

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.710
that content.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.390
This creates an
operation that we can

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.670
add to our list of operations.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.760
Or vice versa, we can also say
these pieces of content need

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.630
to be removed and create
delete operations.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.180
Finally, whatever is left, we
should just update and make

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.150
a bunch of update operations.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.800
When we're done, we can
apply all of these in batch.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.497
This allows us to
have one transaction

00:20:52.497 --> 00:20:54.580
and optimize the performance
with the home screen.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.350
I'm also happy to announce
that with AndroidX, we

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.662
made this easier for you.

00:21:00.662 --> 00:21:02.620
You don't have to worry
about content providers

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.210
when using AndroidX.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.680
Let's take a look.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.320
Here we have a preview
channel helper.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.680
And in this helper, you can
add all the metadata you need.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.560
And lastly, you
can add the logo.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.320
The logo should be
an 80 by 80 picture.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.057
And as the system, we're
going to apply a mask

00:21:20.057 --> 00:21:22.390
and show a final image that
might be different then what

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.530
you supplied.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.540
Think of it like adaptive
icons for a mobile,

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.190
but not quite the same.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.070
What matters most is that you
supply an 80 by 80 image for us

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.910
to use.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.640
Once you have your channel,
you just add publish channel,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.980
and this does everything as
one transaction for you--

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.277
no more content provider.

00:21:40.277 --> 00:21:42.360
Once you get the channel
ID, you should store this

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.740
for synchronizing
later where you

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.032
might want to use those batch
operations from a content

00:21:46.032 --> 00:21:48.380
provider.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.360
Next, I want to talk
about the play next row.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.943
Over the past couple of years,
I've worked with a lot of apps,

00:21:52.943 --> 00:21:54.950
and TV shows really shine
on the play next row.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.680
This is an example
from the DC universe

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.960
app, where they have
strong indications

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.080
to watch "Young Justice."

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.210
As a user, you could be
halfway through a show.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.685
Here we're 10 minutes
into a 21-minute episode,

00:22:09.685 --> 00:22:10.923
and then you leave.

00:22:10.923 --> 00:22:12.340
And when you leave,
as an app, you

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.580
can add strong notes
and UI indicators, "Hey,

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.600
you're halfway through."

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.770
In addition, you can add this
content to the play next row.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.130
One thing we noticed
is that there's

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.050
a piece of metadata called
last engagement time.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.180
This sounds pretty trivial.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.120
It represents the last
timestamp a user or an app

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.870
has interacted with
that piece of content.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.690
Here for example, when
the user pauses the show,

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.920
that should be the timestamp
for last engagement time.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.800
When the user goes back in and
they finish watching the show

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.290
and they see the credits,
this is a great time

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.320
to add a next episode
to the play next row.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.510
Here DC adds the next episode.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.345
We're able to give strong
visual indicators to the user,

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:01.470
"This' is the next episode.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.310
Here's where you left off."

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.210
But the timestamp for last
engagement time should change.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.580
This should be the time
the credits came up.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.260
This is technically
the last time

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.510
the user has interacted
with that season.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.310
If you think of
that as a season,

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.900
last engagement time
makes more sense

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.440
since they haven't interacted
with the next episode.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.730
The last part of the lifecycle
of a TV show is new episode.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.400
So a new piece of content
for "Young Justice"

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.560
hasn't come out yet.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.590
It'll be aired at a later date.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.130
So user has not
interacted with that yet.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.500
You can still add that
to the home screen

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.080
and set the last
engagement time to the time

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.240
when the episode is aired.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.580
The launcher sees that
that time is in the future

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.200
and will handle the
content accordingly.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.790
There's a bunch of pros and
cons and dos and don'ts.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.590
The key rule of
thumb is if a user

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.600
interacts with a piece
of content, that's

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.920
fair game for the home screen.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.320
Lastly, I want to talk about how
to make your app more friendly

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.240
and be prepared for
when these changes come

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.483
for commerce later, such
as Anwar talked about.

00:24:06.483 --> 00:24:08.400
Mainly, it comes down
to distributing your app

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.760
in the Play Store.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.360
You need to do a few things.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.320
One, in your manifest
file, declare that you

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.000
use the lean back feature.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.430
Two, make sure you have
the lean back intent

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.990
to filter for your
main activity.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.890
The last thing you need to do is
when you're in your Play Store

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.530
listing, go to pricing
and distribution

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.750
and select this check box.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.900
What this does is this enables
a process that sends your app

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.525
to the Play Store review team.

00:24:32.525 --> 00:24:34.650
They're going to review
your app for simple things,

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.105
like D-pad support, app
crashes, and gives you a report

00:24:39.105 --> 00:24:40.830
if it doesn't support this.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.140
This helps ensure that we
have a basic bar of quality

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.030
for the Android TV apps.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.710
We have documented
what those checks

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.810
are on developer.Android.com.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.710
By having your app on
the Play Store, when

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.420
we support features
like subscriber

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.858
install later this year, you're
already ahead of the game

00:24:58.858 --> 00:25:00.275
and can start
making money faster.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.470
So in conclusion then, the three
things we've been focusing on

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.180
are making your app
easier to integrate

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.620
with the Assistant, such as
with live TV and watch actions.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.560
Having your content really shine
on the home screen requires

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.890
a little effort with your banner
and making channels easier--

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.440
channels and play next
easier for your app.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.200
And lastly with the Play
Store, making sure you opt in

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.272
will enable your app to be
discovered on Android TVs.

00:25:28.272 --> 00:25:30.230
With that, Lilian's is
going to talk about some

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.813
of the cool things
they've been doing.

00:25:31.813 --> 00:25:32.407
Thank you.

00:25:32.407 --> 00:25:35.389
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.371
LILIAN KATIC: Thank
you, Benjamin.

00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:41.710
So hi, I'm Lilian from Canal+.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.160
I'm one of the founder of
the Android team in Canada.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.620
And today I'm going
to show you what

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.230
we have achieved with
our application myCanal

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.400
on the Android TV platform.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.380
So Canal+ is a paid
TV leader in France.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.970
But we are also present on
many parts of the world.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.880
So especially in Europe,
like in Switzerland, Poland,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.490
but also in many
places in Africa,

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.130
and also in Asia, like in
Myanmar and in Vietnam.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:17.480
myCanal is a Canal+
over-the-top platform,

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.870
and it's all video hub services.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:26.820
We provide live TV channels with
our feature called StartOver.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.390
It's a way to let our users
seek in the past of what

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.810
has been broadcasted on
our live TV channels.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.930
We have also VOD content
from our partner networks.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:44.690
Also, we have our
own SVOD service.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:45.810
Sorry.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:51.260
And a TVOD service to bring
the news content for all users,

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.960
and let them buy or rent them.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.580
So our application
is video centric,

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:09.270
and we needed a great
platform to build them.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.800
And Android TV supports all
the standards of the industry,

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.240
starting from the support
of H.264 media codecs

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.180
and formats--

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.660
H.265s.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:25.740
And we were thrilled to know
that in the new Q release,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.530
the open source AV1
codecs is made available,

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.610
and we can build upon it now.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.870
Also, HDR10+ is on the way.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.700
So video contents
will be even better

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.070
on the platform
for less bandwidth.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.340
We are also pleased
today to announce

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.240
that we provide
for the first time

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.660
4K contents inside myCanal
in exclusivity for Sony TV

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.980
sets for now.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.025
So it's really a great time
to build a video application

00:27:57.025 --> 00:27:58.150
on the Android TV platform.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.230
So as I said, we are a
video centric application,

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.690
and we needed to build
upon a great player.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:15.430
And we chose to use ExoPlayer,
and I will tell you why.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.810
So it's the heart of the
experience of our services,

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:23.870
and we needed to handle
many technologies

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.810
inside the application.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.680
And as you can
see on this slide,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.770
ExoPlayer handles many, many
features and capabilities,

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:37.050
from the management of DRM,
timelines, media composition,

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.710
the support of the standards
of the adaptive streamings.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.100
There is a lot of
containers available.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.830
There is a lot of
captioning technologies.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:51.540
And also, ExoPlayer
gives you nice extensions

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.790
to make your work easier--

00:28:53.790 --> 00:29:01.800
for example, MediaSession to
plug Assistant to the player--

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.570
and some other one.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.500
So here are some
highlights of what

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.840
we have used inside myCanal.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.740
So it makes sense
to use ExoPlayer

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.410
inside the application.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:23.360
So I will describe four use
cases of the use of ExoPlayer.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.260
So to start off, media
sources is the entry point

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.000
of your video playback.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.870
And it will handle all the
transport streams you need.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:40.440
In myCanal, we used dash
media sources, [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.490
sources and HLS media sources.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:49.590
So each media sources have
a factory with ExoPlayer,

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.280
and it's really easy
to instantiate them.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.992
And everything is rooted
with the URI of the manifest

00:29:56.992 --> 00:29:57.700
you want to play.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.230
The factories of the media
sources from ExoPlayer

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:07.280
is very be powerful because
you can customize it.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.240
For example, you may want to
have a custom manifest parser

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.510
to handle the feature
that is not handled

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.330
by default by ExoPlayer.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:22.910
You can also adjust your
position of your live streams

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.170
on the live TV channels.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:31.370
And you have also a load error
policy that you can customize.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.930
And here it's a great
feature to handle the load

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.000
errors that you may encounter
during your playback.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.840
For example, your
manifest can describe

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.570
video chunks that
are not completely

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.760
available on your server.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.290
And you may get, for
example, some 412 HTTP error.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:56.370
And you don't want to make your
playback showing some errors,

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.810
so you have to keep in
mind you may need to retry

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.640
the loading of your chunks.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.700
So customizing your load error
policy solves this problem.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.960
OK, one other powerful
feature of ExoPlayer

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.650
is media composition and the
interactive media ad extension

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:22.050
from ExoPlayer use it
and it's really useful

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:26.790
to concatenate your content
with the ads and video

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.438
content in a single timeline.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.460
How you use the IMA extension.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.240
Of course you need the player.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.340
And also you have to
[INAUDIBLE] IMA Ads

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:48.000
Loader, where you will put the
vast ads URI needed to retrieve

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.190
all the ad's content.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:55.140
And also all the ad's
impression you have to handle

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.450
gave to the IMA ads and
all the other player

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.960
because during the playback,
the IMA ads extension

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.550
will handle all the
ad's impression for you.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:11.790
Then the build media source,
the content you want to play.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:16.350
And next, just instantiate
your ad media source

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.490
and give it to it your
content media source.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.960
And also you need
to give it to it

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.420
player view because the
IMA ad extension will

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.690
provide for you the
interactive URI for your ads.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.090
Prepare your player and
you're ready to have

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:43.160
a nice playback of
[INAUDIBLE] inside your video.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.660
And everything is
handled nicely.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.090
You will not have
any buffering time

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.760
between the transition
of each videos thanks

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.490
to some magic of
ExoPlayer caching.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.810
OK, let's talk about DRM.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:03.590
Android TV platform supports
the two main DRM agents

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.710
that the content
owners industry trusts.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:11.290
It's Google Widevine
and Microsoft PlayReady.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.910
And thanks to these
two DRM agent,

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.060
we are able to
provide 4K contents.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.550
ExoPlayer gives you great
tools to manage DRMs.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.840
So you have a
media DRM interface

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.440
which is exposed by ExoPlayer.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.620
And you have a callback to
execute the key request, which

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.030
would be triggered by
the DRM session which

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:43.220
is in the work during
the video decoding.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.880
And when it's triggered,
you just have to route which

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.360
of the two DRM [INAUDIBLE]
for example, if you

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.580
get a Widevine unique idea.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.840
You may want to request your
Widevine license server.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.930
And the same thing
for the PlayReady one.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.060
You may want to
root your license

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.580
request to the good server.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.140
Depending on the
scenario, you may

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.565
want to use one or
another DRM arrangement.

00:34:10.565 --> 00:34:11.190
It's up to you.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.469
So how do we start the
playback with their DRM?

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:20.960
So as you saw, we
need our DRM callback.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.840
Then we have to inject it
to a DRM session manager.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.690
The DRM session manager will
handle all the DRM session

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.810
that's the playback we need and
will handle all the requests

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.290
of license you need.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.980
Instantiate your
player and inject it

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.820
in the context of ExoPlayer.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.719
And that's it.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.760
Your playback is ready.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.639
If you want to find out
more about ExoPlayer,

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.010
just follow this link.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:55.489
And I'd recommend you to watch
IU17 session of the ExoPlayer

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.700
player, where all the
architecture is really

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.913
well described.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.370
OK, in myCanal, we
have also embraced

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:09.610
all the features the Android
TV platform offers to us.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.770
And first, we embrace
the home screen.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.780
We've added a lot of TV
channels inside myCanal.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.870
And it's really, really powerful
because it give us the freedom

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:27.490
to let our user customize
their experience as they want.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.440
And it gives the
ability to our user

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.210
to find their content just by
one click on the home screen.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.170
We use also the nice and smooth
transition of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.780
show and video previews.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:50.750
So as you see, even if your
picture contents are not

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:55.990
to the same ratio as the
video, the launcher of Android

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.591
handles it with a nice
and smooth animation.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.310
Of course, myCanal
is Assistant ready,

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:11.862
and we use it to essentially
handle the playback controls

00:36:11.862 --> 00:36:16.000
of the player of myCanal.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.580
We use it to launch
any playback we want.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.870
For example, if we want to watch
the newest movies on myCanal,

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:26.650
we just have to ask
Assistant, and we play it

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:27.790
automatically for you.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.410
But one of the
powerful feature is

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.690
the combination of
the power of Assistant

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.400
and our live TV streams.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.390
As I said earlier, we have
the StartOver feature.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.670
And for any live TV
channels on myCanal,

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:45.160
we can seek into the
past up to eight hours.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.680
That means we can ask
the Assistant to start

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.740
from the beginning of
any content we want.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:55.840
And if you have your great TV
shows, which is already on air

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.290
you can ask Assistant to
start from the beginning.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.340
Or you may want also
to ask Assistant

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.670
to bring back to
the first episode,

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.950
in this case, if you want.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.620
That's not it.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.510
We wanted to push the Android
TV platform to it's limits.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:21.380
And I will show you two great
feature we did inside myCanal.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.600
The first one is what
we call the expert mode.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.970
It's a service for
all live events--

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:35.030
especially for sports-- where
we bring real-time statistic

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.790
for all users.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:42.500
So it's available for
soccer, rugby, golf, and also

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.130
for Formula 1 and
Moto Grand Prix.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.560
We've also added
for Moto Grand Prix

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.770
a new feature which
we provide, a 360 dash

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.080
cam behind any backs of racers.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.800
And you can, inside your
myCanal phone or TV,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.210
watch the progress of
race driver at any angle.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:06.010
It is very immersive and
very, very interesting.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.310
OK, so next one is Multi-Live.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:15.630
Multi-Live is pushing the limits
of the Android TV platform.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.830
So in this example, you have
four instances of ExoPlayer,

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.670
and we have to tweak
a lot of things

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.165
to make the playback
very seamlessly.

00:38:25.165 --> 00:38:28.910
These animation are powered
by the control set animation.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:32.415
We also have to synchronize
all the other [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:32.415 --> 00:38:35.420
of all the [INAUDIBLE]
player at the same time.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:40.100
And we have to know where the
adaption of the player which

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.490
are not in front of the users.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:47.105
And higher up, the
one which is at the--

00:38:47.105 --> 00:38:47.980
which is [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.220
Sorry.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:55.610
So the caveat is that not any
devices can handle Multi-Live,

00:38:55.610 --> 00:39:00.350
and we had to determine
which one is capable or not.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:09.230
So ExoPlayer gives you a little
tool on the media [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:15.350
to give you how many
instances a device can handle.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:20.120
But do not trust it at 100%
because, first, a device

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.770
can lie to you.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:26.930
And also you may have another
application using any codecs

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.800
behind your application.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.830
So it's a bit
confusing, but it's also

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:39.350
a nice way to the determine
how many instances a device can

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:41.240
handle.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.190
So that's it.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.324
Thank you, everybody.

00:39:44.324 --> 00:39:45.018
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:45.018 --> 00:39:46.560
BENJAMIN BAXTER:
Hey, thanks, Lilian.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.640
Well, thank you all
for coming today.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.950
We've covered a lot of stuff.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.700
Shalini started talking
about the momentum

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.320
and how we keep growing year
over year as Android TV.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.250
Anwar came in and talked
about where we're investing,

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.080
making your content
more discoverable,

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.440
how were doubling down on Google
Play billing in the Play Store.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.180
I talked about some
best practices.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.450
And Lilian talked about how
we apply them in his own app.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.390
So I'm sure you have
tons of questions.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.980
Please come next
door to the Sandbox.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.640
We'll happily answer them.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.790
If you have an app and you
want it to be reviewed,

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.820
and you've talked to engineers
on the UX team from Android TV,

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.950
come over to App Reviews.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.430
We're right across the way.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.630
And sign up and
it's easy coming in.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.660
So thank you very
much for coming today.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.350
This would not be
possible without you.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:30.850
Thank you.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.700
