00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:03.487
- [Voiceover] "Goku wants
to get over 9000 comments

00:00:03.487 --> 00:00:05.008
"on his YouTube videos.

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:06.831
"He gets to the same number of comments

00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:09.025
"for each cat video that he uploads,

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:10.533
"and he gets the same number of comments

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.589
"for each dog video that he uploads."

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.040
That's somewhat amazing.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.627
The exact same number of
comments for each cat video

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:20.808
and the exact same number
for each dog video.

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:23.431
But we'll just assume
what they're telling us.

00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.651
"In the following inequality, C represents

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.631
"the number of cat videos, C for cat,

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:31.739
"and D represents the
number of dog videos,

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.826
"D for dog, dog videos
that Goku should upload

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:37.567
"to achieve his goal."

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:40.551
So 750 times the number of cat videos

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:43.891
plus 450 times the number of dog videos

00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.307
needs to be greater than 9000.

00:00:47.307 --> 00:00:48.665
"According to the inequality,

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.800
"how many comments does each cat video get

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.974
"and how many comments
does each dog video get?"

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:57.604
So let's see if we understand
what's going over here,

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.518
what's going on in this inequality
to answer their question.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.956
So he wants to get over 9000 comments

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:04.082
and we see that right over here.

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:07.623
He wants to get over 9000 comments.

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:09.658
So this we could view as a number

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:12.508
of comments that he actually gets.

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:15.796
Since we have some number times C,

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:17.430
we can assume that, well C,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.606
well we know that C is
a number of cat videos

00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:21.614
and so the number times C,

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:22.791
that's the number of comments

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.934
that he gets from cat videos.

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.291
And on a per cat video bases,

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.969
he's going to get 750 comments.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:30.805
Because if I say, "Hey, look.

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:32.852
"I have C cat videos and on each of them,

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:35.456
"I have exactly 750 comments."

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:39.097
Well, I'm gonna have 750 times C comments

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:41.651
on all of my cat videos combined.

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:46.631
So each cat video gets 750 comments.

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.093
And similarly, I can never say that,

00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:50.853
each dog video gets,

00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:54.758
well this is the total number
of comments from dog videos.

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:56.035
You add all of these together.

00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:57.695
Your total number of comments w

00:01:57.695 --> 00:01:59.459
to be greater than 9000.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.972
Well, if the total from
dog videos is 450 D,

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:07.163
then we see he's getting
450 comments per dog video.

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:10.599
450 comments per video times
the number of dog videos

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.757
gets the total comments from dog videos.

00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:18.262
So he gets 450 comments per dog video.

00:02:18.262 --> 00:02:22.278
"Can Goku achieve this goal
by uploading eight cat videos

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:24.414
"and seven dog videos?"

00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:25.710
So let's think about this.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.721
Eight cat videos, seven dog videos.

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:29.441
So let's see.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:33.095
If we have 750, let me
do those in same colors,

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:37.910
if we have 750 times eight,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.500
times eight

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.138
plus 450

00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:47.035
times seven, is this greater than,

00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:49.182
I'm writing the question
mark so we don't know,

00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:51.174
is this going to be greater

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:54.744
than 9000?

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:56.564
Well, we just have to evaluate this.

00:02:56.564 --> 00:02:58.438
What is this going to be?

00:02:58.438 --> 00:02:59.314
Let's see.

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:04.314
700 times eight is 5600.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.211
It's going to be 5600

00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:10.228
plus another 50 times eight is 400.

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:14.709
So 5600 plus 400 is 60 hundred or 6000.

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.203
So this is 6000 right over here.

00:03:18.203 --> 00:03:20.711
So that would be, if he
has eight cat videos,

00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.845
he gets 750 comments per video

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:25.777
so he's going to have a
total of 6000 comments

00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:28.525
on all of the eight cat videos combined.

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:31.664
And then 450 times seven,

00:03:31.664 --> 00:03:34.142
let's see, 400 times seven is 2800

00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:37.940
plus another 30, plus another 350,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.497
that's going to be, what?

00:03:39.497 --> 00:03:43.455
3150, is that right?

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:44.625
Let's see, that would be,

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:45.483
let me show you to this right,

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:49.308
2800 plus 400

00:03:49.308 --> 00:03:51.348
times seven is 2800.

00:03:51.348 --> 00:03:54.379
50 times seven is 350.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.507
Yep, I think that is right.

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:59.630
It all, all works out, 3150.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.186
So 6000 plus 3150 is
indeed greater than 9000.

00:04:04.186 --> 00:04:06.108
It is indeed greater than 9000.

00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:08.302
This over here is 9150

00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:11.286
which is indeed greater than 9000.

00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:13.085
So yes, he can achieve his goal

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:17.921
by uploading eight cat
videos and seven dog videos.
