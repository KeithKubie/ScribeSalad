Good evening everyone and welcome to the fourth Luskin Lecture for

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.280
Thought Leadership. The goal of the speaker series is to give you firsthand exposure

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.139
to the thinkers who are helping to shape
the national conversation. We hope that

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.830
you will glean insights into their
thinking and strategy to understand how

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.640
our public leaders approach the
challenges and controversies of our time

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.830
As mayor of the country's third largest
city Rahm Emanuel is in a unique

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.369
position to share with us the
relationship between the prospects for

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.350
our cities and the prospects for our
country. Please join me in welcoming

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.040
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.160
You live in a period of time where you earn what you learn.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
A high school degree no longer
cuts it in the 21st century we have to make

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
sure every child in the city of Chicago
has an educational plan that can take

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.600
them where they need to go because
that's your passport in the 21st century

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.120
it has to be universal for every child

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.580
This is from one of our MBA students...

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.240
for decades the south side of Chicago has been plagued by poverty and gun violence so what's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.120
driving this and what do you do about it?
Look last year we were down 22 percent

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.880
on shootings it's only February but
we're down 34 percent this year

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.850
One is policing it has had an impact in
reducing the shootings

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.560
I think you've got to help create a
positive role model system for young men

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.290
Economic opportunity in a neighborhood...
you know I firmly believe kids cannot be

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.600
what they cannot see. Lastly is access to
guns.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:50.220
So my view is it's part policing, mentoring, economic opportunity and access to guns.
