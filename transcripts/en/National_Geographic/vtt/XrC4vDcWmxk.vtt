00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.200
[suspenseful music]

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:19.767
I am going to tell you about
the most incredible place.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:20.867
And you know what?

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:26.467
You're walking on it.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.100
Our planet is literally
bursting with life.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.066

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.500
[rhythmic vibrations]

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:56.533
There's so much
activity, and our planet

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.834
is right in the middle of it.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:03.600
I really wish that everyone
could see the world the way

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.834
that I've had a
chance to see it.

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:11.400
The strangest place
in the whole universe

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.533
might just be right here.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.300
