00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
In the field, I feel so
connected to everything,

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:06.706
but then I'd come home and I
would feel so disconnected

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:09.442
and I started to
hate coming home

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.977
because I wasn't stimulated.

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:15.181
I'd have to sit in this
quietness and feel this pain

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.850
and I didn't know where
it was coming from

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.785
and I felt myself
withdrawing further,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:22.956
and I had a beautiful wife
who genuinely loved me,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.860
but you know, in the field,
I felt like I was in a tribe.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.796
I felt like I was together.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.432
It was egalitarian, we
cared for each other,

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:36.635
there was responsibility,
we took care of one another,

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:40.340
and then I'd come home and
I'd feel completely alone,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.511
and I'd feel a nothingness,
and I think those elements

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.013
of tribalism are really
important in our lives.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:49.848
We are better when we are with

00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:51.851
people who hold us accountable.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.519
We are better together.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.954
Not just with one person.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.123
As a group, we are
better together.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.959
And I literally
couldn't reconcile

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.296
the noise of this urban
life that I'd come back to,

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.531
going to Whole Foods
and have literal...

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.700
I could have anything I want.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.934
What kind of chocolate?

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.171
What kind of organic
whatever do you want?

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.073
And having just come
home from a place

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.676
where people are out
farming every day.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:20.079
I couldn't get over the
noise that I was hearing.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.749
It was a very distracting
hum and I'd think,

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.150
I'd get up in the
morning and I'd go,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.819
I can get through the
day today, I got this.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.757
I don't have to drink
tonight, I can just...

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.928
And by noon, it was so much
that that's when I would,

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.131
you know, have my first drink,

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.200
and I never drank to get drunk.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.371
I just drank to calm it down
because I was screaming inside

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.808
and I didn't know
how to stop it,

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:52.111
because the only places
that helped me were

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.381
the places where
I was distracted,

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.751
I was in the field, and
I was part of a tribe,

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.554
and I couldn't be
disassociated out there.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.490
I had a singular focus,

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:08.628
and I think it was more to the
point that I felt cared for.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.167
I'd come home and we'd
gloss over everything

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.735
and there's this
event, this avalanche,

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:20.640
going back to it started
to appear as the event

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:24.677
that sparked this great
divide in my life,

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.246
because it had shot me
in one direction upwards.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.483
My career had taken
off, and yet inside,

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.552
I was completely
nosediving towards

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:37.156
some sort of vacuous rock
bottom that I couldn't define.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:39.191
The reason I put this
up here is because

00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:41.560
my wife and I were not
communicating about it.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.095
We weren't talking about it.

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:45.364
There was such a
space between us,

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:49.536
and I love this shot because
it's so typical of us.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.474
It's trying to get the
camera above all the (bleep),

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.610
just to get the pretty stuff,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.745
and that's not what
human relationships are.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.415
That's not what life
is; life is the (bleep).

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:04.584
It's not just the skyline,

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.320
and there was too much
distance between us to sustain,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.324
and I found myself
completely alone.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:18.131
Oftentimes surrounded by
people, but completely alone.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.932
But the best part is, in my
job, there's always a way

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:23.702
to go distract yourself, so
the next assignment came.

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:27.073
It was to northern
Burma or Myanmar.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.274
It's changing at
a very rapid pace.

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:31.177
My life was changing
at a rapid pace

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.878
and I felt like this
was a perfect way

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.713
to reconcile all
those differences.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:36.649
I was gonna solve
all the problems.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:40.019
This country is steeped
in mystery and antiquity.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.821
It's one of the most beautiful
landscapes I'd ever seen,

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:47.493
but the northern regions,
specifically, are...

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:50.429
They've just emerged from
decades of bloody civil war.

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:52.365
It's a very impoverished nation.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:55.601
The northern reaches have
been, the Kachin State has been

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.437
off limits to
outsiders for decades,

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:02.341
so our access was incredible,
and that's actually

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:06.178
something we do very well
here, is we get access,

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:08.581
and that is a very
huge privilege.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.850
It makes the stories richer.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.151
It gets us into places

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:16.422
that we would not
otherwise be able to go.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.992
But it's interesting too,
when I look at my photography

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.894
on this trip, specifically
in urban environments,

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.929
it was changing as well.

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:28.101
I was running so hard from
everything that was happening

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:32.638
in my life, it was pushing me
outward with my photography,

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:34.740
and I was trying to get closer

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.209
and I was trying to be more bold

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.545
and I was getting more
and more in people's faces,

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.981
and I thought it was
because I was able

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.283
to get away from all
that pain, and in fact,

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:46.251
I think it was because I
was carrying it with me

00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:48.787
and they recognized,
I think, when we bring

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:51.891
our baggage with us,
people recognize that.

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.626
It's a non-verbal
thing, but people say,

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:56.562
okay, this person's
human and they let you

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:59.064
into your space in a
much more profound way.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:02.768
When you are equal, when
you are not a different guy,

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:05.337
you know, you're not the white
dude with the big camera,

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:09.475
you're the broken guy
who hurts all day,

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:12.044
they're like, oh,
give him a shot.

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:13.980
We'll let him go there.

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:17.749
The point of the trip
was to go overland

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.118
for 60 days through the jungle

00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:23.288
to measure the highest
point in southeast Asia.

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:26.692
We were trying to solve this
big geographical mystery

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:28.661
that had been
created by the war.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.663
The war creates
holes in the map.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.499
If you can't go there and
modern science hasn't gone there

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.836
for decades, how are we
gonna know what exists there?

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.271
So we were actually mapping
and trying to measure

00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:42.741
the highest point
in southeast Asia.

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.543
Like I said, it was
an overland journey

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:48.147
and we were going first
by overnight buses.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.417
It was great, like
it was amazing.

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:56.689
First, the bus barely starts,
then all the seats are full,

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.323
and then you're like,
oh, that's pretty packed.

00:05:58.323 --> 00:06:00.793
Like, three people to two seats,

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:04.530
and then they start bringing
in the little chairs

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.299
that you put your kids
in at the kids' table

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:10.236
and they just put 'em down the
aisle, right in the middle,

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:12.705
and they get full grown
men to sit down in those.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.440
It's a really great scene.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.177
Don't try to go to the
bathroom; it doesn't work.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:22.348
Then we took a 24 hour
boat up the Irrawaddy River

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:25.517
We took what's called
the death train.

00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:27.119
You guys should YouTube it.

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.321
It's a train that
hasn't been cared for

00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:32.657
since the British left,
so you're literally,

00:06:32.657 --> 00:06:35.161
you're just waiting to derail.

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:39.898
It's like 24 hours
of waiting for death,

00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:42.868
so if the avalanche
didn't traumatize me,
I'm sure that did.

00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:44.737
At least my back
was almost broken.

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.440
I had about 50 spider
bites on my leg

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.609
when I got off
the train somehow,

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:54.781
and finally, planes, and then
the last form of movement

00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:59.184
that we were taking
were motorbikes,

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:01.921
and we were gonna
take motorbikes 80
miles into the jungle

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.089
before we started our walk,
and these guys were awesome.

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:08.794
As the rider called them,
the Baby's Hell's Angels,

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:10.863
well actually, because
their bikes are tiny

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.599
but they were pretty
awesome, they were legit.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.667
One morning, I
remember waking up

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.837
and the bikes are loaded,
overloaded, really,

00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:20.839
and this one guy grabs a beer.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:23.342
It's like seven; it's
fine, no judgment.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.510
I've done it, you know,
we're talking about this.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.448
Let's be honest,
and cracks his beer

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:32.218
and then he pours some out.

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:36.355
I'm like, that's cool,
some for the homies, good.

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:39.525
No, then he takes a
little bottle of whiskey

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.194
and just fills it back up.

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:43.796
I'm like, I'm riding
with that dude

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:46.032
'cause that's gonna be fun.

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.535
Anyway, I did ride
with that dude that day

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.737
and as soon as his bike
fell over with me on it,

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.039
I was trying to take pictures
falling off the side,

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:56.875
but then we decided, well,
now that we're done with this,

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:59.811
let's walk into the
jungle for 150 miles.

00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:02.647
For those of you who haven't
walked through a jungle,

00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:04.049
you don't need to, it's fine.

00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:06.986
Stay home, don't
do it, it's awful.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:10.990
It's like walking inside
a green ping pong ball,

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:15.861
which is cool, you can get
some neat images, kind of,

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.429
but it's very monotonous
and it provides you

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:20.366
with a lot of time to think,
and what do I do when I think?

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:24.069
I get super uncomfortable
because I have to focus

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:27.339
on what's happening in my life.

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:29.609
It was a long, long walk,

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:33.779
and I started to think about
some real serious things.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.582
But sometimes I could get
distracted by crossing

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:40.253
bamboo bridges that
have zero metal on them.

00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:43.922
That's just all lashed together.

00:08:43.922 --> 00:08:45.391
Three people could
cross at a time

00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:47.560
over these incredibly
beautiful rivers.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.261
We couldn't see anything.

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:52.331
We couldn't see the
mountains at all.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.502
It was one of the craziest
walks I've ever done

00:08:57.502 --> 00:08:59.005
'cause you'd come
into these washes

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:02.174
and literally, if you fall
here, you're just gonna die.

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:05.277
It's like the most dangerous
walking you've ever done,

00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:10.215
which feels so silly, but
there's still no mountains.

00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:12.051
We can't see anything.

00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:18.224
We'd get to these villages
and I was so amazed.

00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:22.928
I was taken back to one of the
very first photos I showed,

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:25.998
of the woman sleeping
on the bench.

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:30.302
We think of that life as so
wrong, and yet these people,

00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:34.072
that is their life, every
day, and yet they've managed

00:09:34.072 --> 00:09:36.075
to deal with it in a
much different way.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.009
This place is untouched,
except by war.

00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:40.045
It's completely
subsistence living.

00:09:40.045 --> 00:09:42.781
There's no roads here,
there's no helicopters.

00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:44.916
There's no medical,
no dentist, no store.

00:09:44.916 --> 00:09:48.120
You need food? You kill
it or you harvest it.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.257
You need medical? You
pray or you figure it out

00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:54.493
or you get sick or you die.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:59.532
I mean, there is no help,
and I was taken by that.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.170
The self reliance is
something we've lost.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.342
And then after 30 days of
walking, 150 miles of walking,

00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:12.745
this mountain sort of erupts.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:15.781
We'd walked through the
thick, dense rainforest

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.284
and then we got to the deciduous
trees and then the pines

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.252
and then all of a sudden,
we're into the rhododendrons

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:23.188
and we can't see anything,
and then all of a sudden,

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:26.525
the day before the
mountain, it just pops up,

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:29.728
and it's right on the edge
of the Tibetan plateau.

00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:32.197
It sort of rose out of mystery.

00:10:32.197 --> 00:10:36.936
We were kinda like, is there
really a mountain here?

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.104
Climbing a mountain by a
new route is interesting

00:10:39.104 --> 00:10:41.439
because there is no path.

00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:43.709
People are like, well,
you just go to the top,

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.211
but it's actually
very technical.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.813
Getting to the top
is not a clear thing

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:50.282
and I love that because
that is just like life.

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:52.284
I talked about
that as I started.

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:54.219
There is no path.

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:58.423
We think of things
as very linear, but
things aren't linear,

00:10:58.423 --> 00:11:01.093
and when we put ourselves
in that linear box,

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.895
we tend to lose focus.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:05.064
We made all sorts
of wrong turns.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.232
We'd climb up, we'd realize
we were cliffed out.

00:11:07.232 --> 00:11:09.534
We'd have to go down.

00:11:09.534 --> 00:11:12.872
We blew hours trying
to figure things out,

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:15.340
and you know, it's
those ups and downs

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.010
that actually makes the
climbing somewhat worth it,

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.811
because you're
learning as you go.

00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:21.446
Every time you make a mistake,

00:11:21.446 --> 00:11:23.749
hopefully, as in life,
you learn from it.

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:28.687
Finally, we got to our high
point where we had to decide

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.221
who was gonna go for the summit

00:11:30.221 --> 00:11:31.790
because we were a team of five

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.493
and only three could
really climb above this,

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:38.363
and we made the decision
and it splintered our team.

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:40.065
It was very, very emotional.

00:11:40.065 --> 00:11:42.968
It was very high stakes at
this point, but we had to make

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:45.537
a decision of the most
suited climbers to go,

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:48.907
because the climbing
above is like this,

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:51.644
and that's actually
pretty mellow

00:11:53.178 --> 00:11:55.547
compared to some of the other
stuff that we were doing,

00:11:55.547 --> 00:11:58.050
which is interesting because
you see the rope there.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.952
That just makes sure
you don't die alone,

00:12:00.952 --> 00:12:03.622
so let that sit in for a second.

00:12:07.392 --> 00:12:09.128
Took a minute, right?

00:12:10.328 --> 00:12:12.264
That's just there
to kill everybody

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:15.501
because if you fall,
nothing's gonna...

00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:18.437
We were worried about frostbite.

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:20.138
We were on the north side.

00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:22.240
Renan was losing
feeling in his toes.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.144
Finally, after 40
days of climbing,

00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:28.513
we popped over into the sun

00:12:28.513 --> 00:12:31.649
and we saw the summit
for the first time.

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:34.053
40 days, Renan is that tired.

00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:39.892
He's not just chilling in
the sun; he's that tired,

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:43.195
and I was elated to see
that ridge ahead of us,

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:46.364
until I realized
there was no way

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:48.133
that we were gonna climb that.

00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:52.004
We kept going, 'cause you
have to try, you have to try,

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:55.374
but in my brain, it
was so convoluted.

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:59.044
It was so confusing, and
I just didn't think we had

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:02.548
the power to make it, and
sure enough, we turned around.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:04.750
We turned around at
that point of snow

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.320
just behind Renan's
left shoulder,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.255
so we were very
close to the top,

00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:12.357
but the idea was,
well, is this worth it?

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:14.659
Because if we keep going,
we're likely gonna die,

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:16.328
and if we die, that's not gonna

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.363
make anybody back
home very happy.

00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:19.565
We were too depleted.

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:22.501
We were too tired,
and we failed.

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:24.269
This is us returning
to high camp,

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:26.338
letting it sink in
that we had just failed

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:30.042
on this huge expedition
for National Geographic

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:31.276
and trying to evaluate,

00:13:31.276 --> 00:13:33.845
is there actual value
in this failure?

00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:38.017
I think there is; I think
there's value in all failure.

00:13:39.517 --> 00:13:42.888
Only when you surrender to
it can you learn from it.

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:45.089
Only when you give
yourself over to it

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:47.359
can you learn for the next time.

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:51.530
We failed to bring enough
rolling papers for the tobacco,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.100
so we started rolling cigarettes

00:13:56.501 --> 00:14:00.806
out of a book called Finding
George Orwell in Burma,

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:04.076
and that's what Renan
is smoking there.

00:14:05.243 --> 00:14:07.045
That's actually a
map of the exact

00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:09.014
region we were in,
which is great.

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:13.185
We're just like, we're done
with this, burn it down.

00:14:15.353 --> 00:14:17.622
But I also knew that coming out,

00:14:17.622 --> 00:14:19.291
this was the trip
where I realized,

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.793
with all that time to think,

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:23.094
that there were a lot
more failures ahead of me.

00:14:23.094 --> 00:14:26.097
I was just beginning that, and
it was the trip where I knew

00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:29.201
that, you know, my
marriage was over.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.174
There was no way to
reconcile what had happened.

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.578
My despondence had
pulled us apart.

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:43.749
My confusion, my aloneness,
my unwillingness to engage,

00:14:46.117 --> 00:14:49.254
my inability to engage
had pulled us apart.

00:14:49.254 --> 00:14:52.624
I was so disconnected, and that
disconnectedness had created

00:14:52.624 --> 00:14:56.528
a void, and a void that I had
filled with anything I could,

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:58.696
whether on assignment
or at home,

00:14:58.696 --> 00:15:01.367
whether it was alcohol or women.

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:05.070
I'm just gonna be
honest with you guys.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:09.274
I cheated and I lied
and I was a bad husband.

00:15:09.274 --> 00:15:11.176
I was a terrible person,

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:15.347
and I was trying so hard to
figure out, how could I be

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.717
a good person and a bad
person at the same time

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:22.788
and I was ripped apart and
I did all the things wrong,

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:25.858
and those actions,
they have consequences,

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:30.595
and those consequences can
hurt, and it really, really hurt

00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:34.699
because I destroyed
something beautiful,

00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:38.636
and that put me in a
very strange place.

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:41.140
That's a pretty strange place.

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:45.710
But I also started seeing
differently with my photography.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.547
I was looking for different
things, because I wanted to find

00:15:49.547 --> 00:15:52.851
a way out of what I was
feeling, and yet I felt like

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:55.387
I was getting further
and further sucked in

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:59.992
because this was how I left
the house the last time,

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:03.762
and that's a really, really
hard image to look at.

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.564
It's not something
I like to remember,

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:07.299
but it's something that's
important to talk about.
