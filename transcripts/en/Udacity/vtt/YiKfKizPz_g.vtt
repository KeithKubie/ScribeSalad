00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.230
One problem with Q learning is that
it takes many experienced tuples to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.540
converge.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.290
This is expensive in terms of
interacting with the world,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.290
because you have to take a real step,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.850
in other words execute a trade,
in order to gather information.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.180
To address this problem,
Rich Sutton invented Dyna.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.260
Dyna works by building models of T,
the transition matrix and

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.130
R the reward matrix.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.470
Then after each real
interaction with the world,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.330
we hallucinate many additional
interactions, usually a few hundred.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.620
That are used then to
update the Q table.
