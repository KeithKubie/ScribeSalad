DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.290
Welcome to Talks at Google,
My name is Dana Han-Klein.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.160
And today it's my pleasure to
welcome award-winning author

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.212
Wesley Chu.

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:09.962
WESLEY CHU: Hello.

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:11.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.507
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So
Wesley, take it away.

00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:14.590
WESLEY CHU: Oh, that's it?

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.390
Not even an intro?

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.022
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Yeah, that's it, yes.

00:00:16.022 --> 00:00:17.124
WESLEY CHU: Oh, all right.

00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:18.040
How far we got so far?

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.040
We got my name is Wesley Chu.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.960
I am the author best
known for the Tao series

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.630
by Angry Robot Books, starting
with "The Lives of Tao,"

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.200
"The Deaths of Tao," and
"The Rebirths of Tao."

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.280
And I had a new book
come out just 10 days

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.280
you go from Tor-Macmillan
called "Time Salvager."

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.480
So today I'm going to do a
quick reading, just five minutes

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.805
a book and do a quick
scheme from "Lives

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:51.160
of Tao" and a quick scene
from "Time Salvager II."

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.780
So here we go.

00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:57.640
In "The Lives of Tao,"
my main character,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.110
a guy named Roen Tan, has
been inhabited by an alien.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.610
He doesn't know it yet.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.934
So in this scene is the
first time they actually met.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.100
And this scene is actually
very near and dear to me,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.840
because this actually
happened to me in real life,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.360
minus the alien part.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240
OK.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.480
"It was well past 10:00 PM by
the time Roen left the office.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.040
Heels dragging, he trudged
out of the building

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.430
toward the parking garage,
continued south on Wabash,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.120
and crossed the street, hearing
the rumblings of the train

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.410
as it passed nearby.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.460
Suddenly, his highly attuned
sense of self-preservation

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.930
began to let them know
that it wasn't happy.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.820
Something didn't
feel right, and he

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.156
fidgeted, as his eyes darted
up and down this street.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:47.280
It was deserted, except
for a homeless guy crossing

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.170
the intersection
toward his side,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.230
and there was no one
behind him, either.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.996
This part of the loop was
poorly lit and a little rougher

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:59.370
than the business district
just a few blocks north.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.040
Then the homeless guy changed
directions and moved on

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.430
to an intercept course.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.679
Roen sighed.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.970
He had learned to always keep
a few dollar bills on him

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.150
to give ti beggars.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.870
It was the easiest way
to get rid of them.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.270
He handed a buck over before the
homeless guy even said a word.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.300
'Here you go,' Roen said
hastily and tried to pass him.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.250
'Thanks boss,'
homeless guy replied,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.080
shifting to his left
to block Roen's path.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.550
"Look, man, I'm hungry.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.370
$1 ain't gonna buy much.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.120
Let me get a few more for a
meal.' He stepped in really

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.846
close.

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:37.220
Roen could smell
the faint traces

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.370
of liquor in and the stale
aroma of unwashed clothing.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.220
'Sorry,' Roen mumbled, and
tried to pass him again.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.120
The homeless guy continued
to block his path

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.210
and gave him a hard shove.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.950
'I'm just asking for a
couple bucks to eat.' Not one

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.770
for confrontation, Roen
turned into a side alley,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.920
and he immediately
regretted his decision.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.295
Allies were where
bad things happen,

00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:04.380
and he just did the
exact thing that idiots

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.190
from 'Travel Guide to the
City' would tell him not to do.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.140
It was a dead end.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.290
Roen turned around and
faced the homeless guy,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.410
slowly retreating.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.710
'All right, how much
you need for a meal?'

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.480
Homeless guy grinned.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.260
'Price just went up, boss.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.880
You gone and hurt
my feelings.' Then,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.850
he became a mugger as
he pulled out a knife.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.470
'It's gonna cost you your
cash, your train pass,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.510
that bag you're carrying--
oh, hell, everything you got.'

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.030
Roen felt the rising panic
climbing up his throat

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.480
as he stumbled backward.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.350
How did he get himself
into these situations?

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.190
'Look,' he stammered, barely
getting the words out.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.940
'Let's talk this over.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.900
I can give you my money,
but this is my work bag.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.890
I need the stuff in it.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.726
I'll get in trouble.'

00:03:55.726 --> 00:03:57.350
'You don't think
you're in trouble now?

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.390
This ain't no
negotiations, asshole.'

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.890
'Tell him he can have the
money, but you are keeping

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.580
your bag.' Roen looked confused.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.092
'What did you say?'

00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:14.300
'What's wrong with you, boss?

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.450
God, you're dumb.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.008
Give me your stuff before I
stick you.' Roen retreated

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:20.924
until his back bumped
up against the dumpster,

00:04:20.924 --> 00:04:22.215
and he began to hyperventilate.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.750
'What kind of a
mugger uses a knife?

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.230
It is almost insulting.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.460
Listen carefully.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.980
There are some wine
bottles at your feet.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.130
Pick them up.'

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.310
'Who is this?

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.190
What's going on?' Roen cried.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.800
'Your feet.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.890
Bottles.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.850
Pick them up.' The
mugger advanced.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.765
'I'm losing my patience
with you, Tubby.

00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:51.450
You're gonna be a fat dead
man any minute.' Roen looked

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.240
at the ground and saw
several empty wine bottles.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.414
He picked up one in each
hand, and he raised them

00:04:56.414 --> 00:04:57.080
in front of him.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.580
'Hold them by the
neck-- the neck,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.570
the skinny part.' Roen
hastily switched his grip.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.940
'Stay back!' he warned.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.020
The mugger paid him no attention
and continued to advance.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.870
He was no further than
a few feet away now.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.665
'Break the bottles and wield
them in front of you.' For

00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:25.100
a split second, Roen saw
an image of a black-armored

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.210
gladiator standing in an
arena holding two swords,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.650
one held high over his head
and the other in front of his

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.860
chest.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.040
Now, he didn't know what was
going on or who was talking,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.570
but he was so
scared right now he

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.100
did whatever this voice said.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.090
He took the two bottles, and
he smashed them together.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.370
Thunk!

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.205
They didn't break.

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:50.570
'What the--?' Roen looked
down, and he tried it again.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.460
Thunk!

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.230
Thunk!

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.870
The damn bottles wouldn't break.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.370
'Oh, for the love of--"
Roen gritted his teeth,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.660
and he tried once more.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.160
Thunk!

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.660
Thunk!

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.055
They finally shattered
into two jagged shards,

00:06:07.055 --> 00:06:08.430
and he waved them
in front of him

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.622
triumphantly, trying to imitate
that already-fading image

00:06:11.622 --> 00:06:12.330
of the gladiator.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.490
'Good.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.918
Say something mean.'

00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:22.900
'What?'

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.580
'Threaten him.'

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.360
'You give me all your
money!' Roen yelled.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.480
'That is not what I meant.'

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.920
The mugger did a double take.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.940
'What?

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.290
I'm robbing you!

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.310
You give me all your money!'

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.030
'Not anymore,' Roen cried.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.150
'I'm robbing you.'

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.370
'You can't Rob. me.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.715
That's not how it works.' The
mugger no longer seemed so sure

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:48.890
of himself and
retreated a few steps.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.450
Now the two of them stood really
far apart, both harmlessly

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.330
waving their respective weapons.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.640
Every time Roen advanced,
the mugger retreated.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.730
And every time the
mugger moved forward,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.550
Roen scampered backward.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.860
They began swearing
at each other.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.862
'Come on, you fat asshole!'
the mugger snarled.

00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:09.250
'You're such a goddamn
jerk!' Roen yelled.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.680
'Attack.' Roen's eyes
started around the alley.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.170
'Is my brain trying
to get me killed?'

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.160
'Bullies are cowards.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.690
Attack.' Nearly a minute
into their standoff,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.840
after a lot of
bravado on both sides,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.900
something in Roen snapped.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.390
With a burst of
momentary courage

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.180
and a really
high-pitched squeal,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.650
he swung the broken bottle
over his head, and he charged.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.080
The mugger no longer
seemed so sure of himself

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.140
and finally fled.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.020
Roen chased him
for about 20 feet

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.020
before the physical
exertion wore him out.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.820
He stopped, and he
bent over panting.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.820
'Let him go.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.540
You did well.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.170
Go home.'

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.060
'Who is this?' Roen
said in between gaps.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.790
But by then, the
voice was silent."

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.030
Thank you.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.920
So that was a scene
from "The Lies of Tao."

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.300
And it actually happened
to me in real life.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.456
I think I was like
25 at the time.

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:15.330
I was taking bartending
class, because that's

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.430
what you do when you're
25, take bartending class.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.610
And some guy tried to rob me.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.980
And one thing I learned
from this experience

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.090
is that wine bottles are
really, really hard to break.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:27.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.091
I don't if you've ever
tried to break a wine

00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:31.340
bottle on purpose-- if
you knock it off a shelf,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.110
it will fucking break.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.049
But if you go like this,
it takes a lot of effort.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.390
And it's funny, because
another thing I learned

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.993
is I spent several years
learning Chinese straight sword

00:08:40.993 --> 00:08:41.659
and broad sword.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.549
I took martial arts
for a long time.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.810
And it's one thing to get
really good at something

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.740
when you're like in
a nice, safe school.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.750
And it's another
thing when the guy's

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.650
got a knife sticking at you,
and basically everything

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.810
goes out the window.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.790
So I spent, whatever,
5, 10 years learning

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.500
how to use a sword, and
the one the time in my life

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.771
I get to stab somebody,
I do one of these.

00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:05.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.800
So I don't know what
the lesson is, actually.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.334
But the lesson is, if
you're gonna stab somebody,

00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:14.250
make sure you put yourself
in a real situation

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.320
where you actually
might be able to.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.170
So the next thing I'm
going to read for you

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.060
is a scene from my new
series, "Time Salvager."

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.740
So "Time Salvager"
came out July 7.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.600
And I'm going to give you a
little bit of background on it.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.390
"Time Salvager" is
about the future.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.080
Humanity has colonized
the solar system.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.670
And it's the 26th century, and
we're running out of resources.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.670
So there are these time
travelers called chronmen

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.790
who go back in time to what
they call dead-end timeline,

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.820
say a moment before a
disaster or an explosion

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.910
or some kind of tragedy.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.100
So these guys go
back in time, say,

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.370
right before a ship explodes.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.010
And they grab the resources, the
technology, the power sources,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.110
the relics, all these things.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.950
And they jump out right as the
bad thing is about to happen.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.460
And the reason why
they do this is

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:14.420
because the number-one rule
of time traveling is you

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.260
don't change the timeline.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.150
So when the explosion
or disaster happens,

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.930
it covers their tracks,
and they are good to go.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.840
The problem with this
job is they experience

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.710
the last terrible moments
of all the victims,

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.980
and they can't do
anything about it.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.554
I got this idea-- I
was reading an article

00:10:34.554 --> 00:10:36.470
about this South African
photojournalist named

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.260
Kevin Carter.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.020
And he was involved
with a Sudan family.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.030
He was taking pictures
and journaling

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.330
everything that was going on.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.170
He took a very iconic
picture of this kid--

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.520
this is a really sad story,
sorry-- about this kid crawling

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.600
toward an aid station,
and there was this vulture

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.340
hopping behind him.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.970
And at the time, Kevin took
the picture and was like,

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.660
it's my job to
journal everything,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.570
not to get involved.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.470
So he left the kid there.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.200
And he won a Pulitzer
for that picture,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.826
and then he committed
suicide 11 months later.

00:11:11.826 --> 00:11:14.120
A few weeks later,
I was on Chantix

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.170
trying to quit smoking--
and great drug, by the way.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.670
I probably shouldn't
have said that.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.170
I'm sorry.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.880
Is that a licensing thing now.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.980
Chantix is awesome.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.230
No, but so Chantix gives
you very lucid dreams.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.140
At one point, I had a dream
that I was on the Titanic.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.080
I was a time traveler
on the Titanic.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.830
I went back to steal
the Hope Diamond,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.954
because when you go to
Titanic, that's what you do.

00:11:34.954 --> 00:11:36.100
You steal the Hope Diamond.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.170
And during the time I was
there, I befriended all the crew

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.620
and the passengers, and I
knew they were all gonna die,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.170
but it wasn't my
job to get involved.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.130
So right as the ship
was sinking, I woke up.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.192
And I'm not sure if I actually
ever got that Hope Diamond,

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:55.150
but I remember when I
woke up, I was like, this

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.610
is the best use of time travel.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.010
Because everybody talks about
like if you go back in time,

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:05.699
you did you kill Hitler or do
you become like Biff Tannen?

00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:07.240
Does anybody know
who Biff Tannen is?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.650
AUDIENCE: It's "Back
to the Future," man.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.120
WESLEY CHU: All right, see,
I just dated all of you guys.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.775
I know how old you are now.

00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:11.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.300
But so like do you
either kill Hitler, or do

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.654
you use this great sports
almanac and win a lot of money?

00:12:19.654 --> 00:12:21.070
And my problem
with time traveling

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.289
in a lot of time travel stories
is they always change history.

00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:26.080
And we all know about
the butterfly effect.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.570
But my thing is, let's say
somebody does end up time

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.340
traveling, and he kills Hitler.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.470
What happens next?

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.720
For all we know, the Third Reich
could have happened anyway,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.640
and instead of Hitler, who was
like all obsessed about St.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.130
Petersburg, the new Third
Reich Fuhrer or whatever

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.850
looks at the map
and goes-- maybe he

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.420
read some Napoleonic
history and goes,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.670
that's a lot of land to cover.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.880
Maybe we shouldn't go east.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.610
Let's go west instead.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.170
So the number one rule
of time traveling is

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.960
don't mess with the future.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.880
So the scene I'm going to
read for you is from the "Time

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.540
Traveler" series.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.915
I will give you no context.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.860
By the way, I only
have like one voice,

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.290
so if all my guys sound
the same, I'm sorry.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.290
"'Are you sure you weren't sent
by the boys from the society

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.530
who gave Old Titus one tug of
his beard before he goes off

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.480
on his final Light
Burst?' Titus 2.3,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.600
Grandeur of Dark Side Prime,
having lived 155 Venutian

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.990
years, was the oldest
man on all of Venus.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.370
He was the foremost
inventor of his generation

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.770
and once considered the
second-brightest mind

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:46.050
of the century-- once meaning
he had just recently been bumped

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.580
down to third by some upstart
19-year-old girl named

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.630
Priestley.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.752
That was fine with Titus.

00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:53.960
He was tired of being the
smartest guy at every party

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.460
anyway.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.290
The stranger blocking his path
to his honorary Light Burst

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.400
craned his head and looked
up at the Needle Shapes

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.930
rocket, scheduled to take
off in the next 10 minutes.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.505
'I assure you, Grandeur, as
great of an honor as it is

00:14:08.505 --> 00:14:10.640
being granted
Light Burst voyage,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.220
flying into the sun is probably
one of the worst ways a person

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.415
could die.'

00:14:15.415 --> 00:14:16.790
'As soon as your
light shields--'

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.160
'I know what happens, boy!

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.230
I designed this
flaming contraption!

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.510
It's tradition here to send
these old ships off this way,

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.770
blaze of fucking
glory.' Titus huffed.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.170
'I've taken four life
extensions already.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.410
That's the record, by the way,
most granted any Venutian,

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.740
and frankly, my damn back's too
tired to hold me up anymore.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.690
I've done more than
anyone in three lifetimes.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.100
And if those jerk-offs want
to push me out now, well,

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.150
I don't have the
energy to argue.'

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.470
The two men stood at an
impasse on the platform,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.980
even as the Light Burst
thrusters smoked and began

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.910
its pre-ignition sequence.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.220
Titus really should
be buckled in by now.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.350
Five kilometers
away, watching safely

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.100
in their observation tower,
his family, friends, and peers

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.820
were all waiting for
him to commit suicide.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.230
'Your mind is as sharp as
ever, Titus,' said a stranger.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.870
'Address me as Grandeur, boy.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.660
I've earned this title.'

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:26.040
'I assure you,
Grandeur, I am here

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.980
to offer you an opportunity
to continue work.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.840
If you do not believe
me, then by all means,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.360
step into the Light
Burst and be on your way.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.830
I won't stop you.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.160
However, my scans have
confirmed that you

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.360
are still healthy and may
live for several more years.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.670
If you wish you put
those to good use,

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.690
then you should come with me.'

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.660
Titus hesitated.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.480
He had already said goodbye to
his husband and his two wives,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.360
and he had held court
for his grandchildren

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.570
and played with this
great-grandchildren one

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.200
last time, making sure they
all realized that he wasn't

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.010
coming back from this voyage.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.930
The boys at the society
had thrown him a nice party

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.580
and even given him a prostitute.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.610
Everything fell pretty final.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:12.060
Sometimes an old guy just had
to recognize when to hang it up.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.730
Still, the opportunity
the stranger presented

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:15.930
was interesting.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.640
After all, a few more years
was nothing to sneeze at.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.970
But there was the
matter of tradition.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.070
Isn't this what he was
supposed to do as an elder,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.000
honored citizen of Venus?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.530
What if word got out that he
skipped out on his own Light

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.820
Burst It would be a scandal.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.164
'Excuse me, Grandeur, but
your time is running out.

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:38.830
The Light Burst is
scheduled to take off

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.510
in the next six minutes.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.660
I need to be away
from the blast radius

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.410
when it takes off regardless.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.650
You need to be on
that ship or with me.'

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.820
'Don't rush me,
boy!' Titus snapped.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.910
'Do you know who I am?'

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.290
'Yes, Grandeur, you are--'

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.730
'I was being rhetorical.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.230
This is a big decision to make.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.130
I don't like being rushed.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.610
Where are we going anyway?'

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.170
'A place that needs your
skill and intelligence,

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.230
a place where we can
continue to do good.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.170
So can I assume you will come?'

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.890
'Assume all you want.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.650
I'm still thinking.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.410
How did you get past
security, anyway?

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.220
You know, I designed
this entire launch bay.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.099
Call it professional
curiosity so in my next life

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.599
I can build a better system to
keep creepy assholes like you

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:25.290
out.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:29.190
This is a private
party, after all.'

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.260
'Your two honor guards at the
door do not know that I am

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.300
here.'

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.470
'Really?

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.460
Guards, get your
lazy asses in here!'

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.220
The stranger sighed.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.470
'I really wish you didn't do
that.' The two red honor guards

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.000
came running into the room,
both carrying their battery

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.880
tridents.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.780
Their insect-like armor, more
ceremonial than functional,

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.280
were modeled after a type
of old Earth beetle that

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.040
used to be worshipped as a god.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.010
The two men, however, were
elite warriors specifically

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.700
chosen to honor Titus
2.3's Light Burst.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.520
'Stand aside, Grandeur,'
one of the guards said,

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.870
leveling his battery
trident at the stranger.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.940
For a second, Titus feared
that the stranger would use him

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.300
as a human shield
and that he would

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.210
die at the base of his
own Light Burst ship

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.170
before even getting the chance
to kill himself properly.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.940
That would have been
the final indignation.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.120
To his pleasant surprise,
though, the stranger

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.740
did not stop Titus from waddling
off to the side of safety.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.540
The honor guard that had spoken
aimed his battery trident

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.511
and fired a lightning
arc at the stranger.

00:18:35.511 --> 00:18:37.660
The stranger tilted
his head just a couple

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.680
of centimeters to his left and
let the arch shoot harmlessly

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.610
past his head.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.190
'You have really good
reflexes,' Titus observed,

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.160
admittedly entertained.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.660
The second guard
charged in closer

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.750
and fired his trident as well.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.720
Titus' chest puffed
up a little bit.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.640
He recognized one
of his inventions.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.380
It was a kinesis spear, one
of his latter inventions

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.940
that could wrap a kinetic
field around an object

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.370
and manipulate it.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.910
He watched as the blue
field shot out and enveloped

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.830
the stranger.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.862
Then, to his surprise,
nothing happened.

00:19:10.862 --> 00:19:12.820
The field that was supposed
to surround the guy

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.150
just popped like a bubble.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.750
'You must have a defective
spear,' Titus commented,

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.010
his face turning a little red.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.030
Then his mouth dropped when
a strange, yellow crackle

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.640
of energy leaked
out of the stranger.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.350
At first, it looked
like the battery trident

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.849
malfunctioned and was
causing some energy feedback.

00:19:33.849 --> 00:19:35.390
Then Titus realized
that the stranger

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.700
was surrounded by this
nearly translucent field

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.360
of yellow light.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.870
The kinesis spear exploded
in the honor guard's hand,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.340
and the stranger seemed to have
somehow teleported or moved

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.210
really, really fast
next to the guard.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.961
There was a clumsy
exchange of fists,

00:19:49.961 --> 00:19:51.710
and then the honor
guard flew into the air

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:55.240
and slammed into the wall
on the far side of the silo.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.400
The remaining guard fired again.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.110
This time his lightning
arc hit the stranger square

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.240
in the chest.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.140
But the blue arc
fragmented harmlessly

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.810
off the stranger's yellow field.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.840
A similar yellow surge
followed, and an invisible force

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.090
struck the honor guard, cracking
his chest plate in half.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.980
The impact slammed the guard
into one of the railings.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.220
The stranger turned to Titus.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.390
I'm sorry that hat
to happen, Grandeur.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.470
If you do not wish to come
with me, I will not force you.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.560
Titus, a lifelong
pacifist, harumphed.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.340
'You young men, always thinking
with your dicks and biceps!

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.180
All right, now you
piqued my curiosity.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.340
If I go with you, what's my
guarantee what you're offering

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.760
is true?'

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.370
'Would you like a cyanide
pill before we leave?

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.230
If you change your mind, you're
free to take the pill and still

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:49.450
commit suicide.' Titus look at
the Light Burst as it began its

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.070
final sequence, 60 seconds
before they were both burned

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.910
to a crisp.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.400
It was too late to get away and
too late to get in the rocket.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.680
It was kind of the story
of his life, always

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.030
taking too long
to make decisions.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.840
'Oh, fine,' he grumbled. 'Though
I think it's too late.' In

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.010
a split second, the stranger
grabbed Titus and cradled him

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.360
close to his body.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.230
Just as the rocket ignited,
the stranger and Titus

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.280
launched up the tube as if they
had their own invisible rocket

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.680
strapped to their asses.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.660
They shot straight
through the launch opening

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.790
and cleared the planet.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.730
A few minutes later in
the black depths of space,

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.930
Titus and the stranger
watched as a spark of light

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.800
erupted from Venus' surface,
leaving a thin, yellow trail.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.630
They floated for
about 20 minutes,

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.690
watching his coffin
disappear into the sun.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.120
'Like watching my own damn
funeral,' Titus grumbed.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.160
'Now what?

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.590
Why are we still floating here?

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.070
It's making me dizzy, making
me want to shit my pants.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.850
Where are we going
next?' He paused.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.150
'How are you doing all this?'

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.770
The stranger smile
for the first time.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.260
'Please stand by.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.940
You will need to wait until
we are cleared to jump back.'

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.990
'Go figure.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.220
You hurry me up, and
then you make me wait.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.740
How ride.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.320
What do you mean
jump back, anyway?'

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.360
'To the future.'

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.200
Titus wasn't surprised.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.900
He had surmised as much
when the stranger wielded

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.760
all those strange powers.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.320
'Holy hell.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.550
I knew it.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.450
Talk about burying the lead.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.886
You know, boy, you should
have opened with that line.

00:22:26.886 --> 00:22:28.510
I'd hop in your sack
right away instead

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.030
of beating around the bush.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.510
By the way, do you frumps
from the future have the cures

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.925
for all my maladies?'

00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:37.780
'Apologies, Grandeur.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.730
There isn't a cure for old age.'

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.950
'Fuck,' Titus paused.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:47.222
'Is the future nice at least,
like a utopian paradise?'

00:22:47.222 --> 00:22:50.030
The stranger shook his head.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.310
'I hate to disappoint you.'

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.560
'Fucking fuck.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.790
I might as well have
stayed in the rocket then.'

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.920
'Would you like your cyanide
pill now or when get there?'"

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.936
Thank you.

00:23:03.936 --> 00:23:05.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.370
So that was my two readings.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.827
Are there any questions, for
all you people in the audience?

00:23:10.827 --> 00:23:12.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think
my biggest question to you

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.680
is what was the different
processes about writing

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.180
these books?

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.540
Because like James
from "Time Salvager"

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:23.440
seems this kind of
more mild, less--

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.795
I couldn't imagine him having
that exchange with like

00:23:25.795 --> 00:23:28.270
a homeless person who's
trying to rob him,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.310
as opposed to like 'The
Lives of Tao" where--

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.240
WESLEY CHU: I mean, I wrote "The
Lives of Tao" a long time ago.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.160
I write it 7 years ago.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.020
So I was in a different
place back then.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.200
And it was because
my second book.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.471
You always write
your first book,

00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:45.845
and unless you're
super talented,

00:23:45.845 --> 00:23:47.636
you'll usually trump
that book, because you

00:23:47.636 --> 00:23:49.560
make all the mistakes
in that first book.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.632
So then I wrote "Lives
of Tao," and at the time,

00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:53.340
I was going though
like a midlife crisis.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.780
Because everybody in their 20s
goes through a midlife crisis.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.700
That's right before
you play "War Craft."

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:07.530
So when I was 16, I told my dad,
I'm going to be a writer, Dad.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.744
I'm going to be an English
major just like you.

00:24:09.744 --> 00:24:11.160
And my dad's an
English professor.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.380
And at the time, he
was like, no, son.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.430
Your life will suffer.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:17.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.264
So I didn't.

00:24:18.264 --> 00:24:19.680
I became a computer
science major.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.513
I did the whole corporate
thing for a while.

00:24:21.513 --> 00:24:24.330
And it was never my calling.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.569
So I wrote "The Lives of
Tao" with that kind of space.

00:24:28.569 --> 00:24:30.860
Because "Lives of Tao" is
kind of a late coming of age,

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.380
kind of a self-improvement
kind of story.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.000
So it was a very
personal story for me.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.290
I wrote the book.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.370
Then I played three years
of Warcraft, as you do.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.000
And then I sold it in 2011.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.730
So then "Time Salvager"
is my fourth book.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.952
And by then, I'm writing
more complex characters.

00:24:48.952 --> 00:24:50.410
I'm adding a lot
more things to it.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:55.690
So they're very different,
but I think they

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:56.960
both come from the same place.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.501
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Did
you find yourself

00:24:58.501 --> 00:25:01.030
like maybe more rigidly
sticking to a writing schedule?

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.170
Or was it just kind of
like whenever inspiration

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.550
struck you'd write?

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.640
WESLEY CHU: Before you
get your first book deal,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.598
you write when you can.

00:25:06.598 --> 00:25:07.830
You work a job.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.430
You go to the gym.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.500
Around like 8:00 to 10:00 you
go and you write at a cafe.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.300
I live in Chicago.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.430
And I used to go from
like cafe to cafe,

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.205
like just abusing the hell
out of those bottomless cup

00:25:21.205 --> 00:25:22.350
of coffee policies.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.285
DANA HAN-KLEIN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:24.285 --> 00:25:25.910
WESLEY CHU: I went
full time last year.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.160
And once you go full
time, I am contractually

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.920
obligated to be creative.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.164
So inspiration be damned.

00:25:33.164 --> 00:25:34.330
I mean, inspiration's great.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.288
I would love to be inspired
every time I write.

00:25:36.288 --> 00:25:37.810
But that's your job.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.000
And sometimes you just
got to muscle through it.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.440
And that's what
my new process it.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.020
I worked corporate
for many years.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.630
And when you work
corporate, you have

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.410
a lot of metrics you stand by.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.085
So even with writing
now, everything for me

00:25:52.085 --> 00:25:53.005
is based on metrics.

00:25:53.005 --> 00:25:54.505
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So
how much research

00:25:54.505 --> 00:25:58.700
did you into the-- speaking of
"Time Salvagers," since that's

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.160
what I read most recently.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.290
How much research did
you do into the time eras

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.710
that you had him jump into?

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.490
Was there a temptation
to kind of stick

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.870
to this fictionalized history
of events that happen past 2015?

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:10.910
Or were you like.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.020
I really want to have him
go-- Nazi Germany is obviously

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.230
a kind go-to jump.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.110
The Titanic you mentioned
was an inspiration.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.651
Did you do a lot of
research on that?

00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:20.281
Or were you just
like, he's going back.

00:26:20.281 --> 00:26:22.030
WESLEY CHU: I did some
research on what he

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.262
was after in the Nazi period.

00:26:23.262 --> 00:26:24.220
I mean, I'll be honest.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.220
I just wanted to kill some
Nazis, because we all do.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.100
But the majority
of "Time Salvager"

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.520
is actually where he
just jumps back in time

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.830
to moments after the present.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:39.680
So I think I have two scenes
that are-- by timeline-wise,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.360
they're realistic enough,
but besides that, I barely

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.500
jumped back into the past.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.900
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Right.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.430
Did you did you that just
easier in terms of-- obviously

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:49.971
there's a lot of
technology that they

00:26:49.971 --> 00:26:52.220
needed in the book that
hasn't been invented yet.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.170
WESLEY CHU: Here's the thing.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.910
I wanted to show
an arc of what's

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.150
happening to humanity
and the planet

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.550
without actually telling stuff.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.290
So the way I showed
them was to have

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.360
them go to different
moments, important moment

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.490
in the future that was
the path of their present.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.684
Does that make any sense?

00:27:10.684 --> 00:27:11.350
All right, good.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.560
So you should go back
there, and you kind of

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.830
get a broad picture of
humanity is doing really well,

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.790
and we're working together, and
then shit really bad happens.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.610
And then we go to war
and then now we're

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.850
squabbling over resources.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.220
And we already know what
happens in our past.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.940
So I wanted to basically
paint a picture of what's

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.920
happening in our future that,
without actually saying,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.850
all right, things are
really, really bad,

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.501
and this is why, I was
able to show them by having

00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:39.500
his jumps go back there.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.130
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Right, by
having him kind of re-experience

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.340
these horrible things.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.280
So if you personally
could go back to any era,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.170
what would it be?

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.040
WESLEY CHU: Oh, man.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.660
Can I bring a like a Gray's
Sports Almanac with me?

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.627
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Sure.

00:27:53.627 --> 00:27:54.960
You'd change the future, though.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.950
I think you're violating your
own first time laws. [LAUGHS]

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.090
But if wanna go full "Back to
the Future II," like go for it.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.340
WESLEY CHU: So "The Lives
of Tao" had a lot of history

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:05.869
in it.

00:28:05.869 --> 00:28:08.410
I mean, these aliens have been
on the planet for a long time.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.840
So I did a lot of
research from Genghis Khan

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.160
to like the 30 Years' War.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.540
And basically no matter how bad
we think things are right now,

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.140
it's actually pretty damn good.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.750
You go back there, you
get the Spanish flu,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.280
we're drinking muddy water.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.390
There's no sewer systems.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.652
So I mean, I'm pretty happy
with the way things are.

00:28:27.652 --> 00:28:29.360
And if I could change,
I would go through

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.780
and put a lot of money down
on the Patriots in like 2000.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.320
Because at the end of the day,
it's all about fat stacks.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.670
DANA HAN-KLEIN: [LAUGHS]
Sure, yes, yeah.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.079
WESLEY CHU: So I'm very--

00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:42.245
DANA HAN-KLEIN: As a player?

00:28:42.245 --> 00:28:43.530
Yeah, it's the way
the world works.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.210
WESLEY CHU: You either kill
Hitler, or you make money.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.419
We can't kill Hitler, so we
might as well make money.

00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:49.168
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's
very true. [LAUGHS]

00:28:49.168 --> 00:28:50.010
WESLEY CHU: Sorry.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.885
I'm like the worse like
technology inspiration.

00:28:56.257 --> 00:28:57.090
Anyway, let's go on.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.673
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well,
my next question

00:28:58.673 --> 00:29:01.350
was going to be what technology
from the future would

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.240
you hope that's realized
in our lifetime,

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.030
aside from time travel?

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.690
WESLEY CHU: I guess I'd like
to colonize other planets.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:10.900
That's the one thing,
especially more recently,

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.000
we got this awesome
footage of Pluto.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.900
And did you know
Pluto was brown?

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.099
Yeah, I was like, Pluto's brown.

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:19.390
And I'd never think about that.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.147
And then recently I've read
a lot of like Andy Weir's

00:29:22.147 --> 00:29:22.730
"The Martian."

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.726
And we had that
thing a few years ago

00:29:25.726 --> 00:29:27.350
where they were going
to colonize Mars.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.546
That's a scam, right?

00:29:28.546 --> 00:29:29.880
DANA HAN-KLEIN: They're
working on it, right?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.850
WESLEY CHU: Are they really
actually working on it?

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:31.090
Anyways, I mean--

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:31.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
It's a slow process.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:32.720
AUDIENCE: It's
still [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.570
WESLEY CHU: Is it still going?

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.415
Is it still going?

00:29:34.415 --> 00:29:36.220
OK, I want to sign up for that.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.540
But so the thing is like I am
all about colonizing something.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.550
Now let's show our
Earth imperialism

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.900
and colonize a planet.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:45.660
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
The you'd sign up.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.055
You'd sign up for that.

00:29:46.055 --> 00:29:47.554
WESLEY CHU: Yeah,
I think I'd do it.

00:29:47.554 --> 00:29:49.800
DANA HAN-KLEIN: All
right, the one-way ticket.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.680
Your background
more-- do you feel--

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.244
like colonizing is a thing.

00:29:55.244 --> 00:29:56.160
Colonizing is a thing?

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.450
Yes, that's the most
self-explanatory sentence ever.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.670
[LAUGHS] I was gonna ask
about your background

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.004
and kind of the sense of--
you grew up in Taiwan, right?

00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:04.669
WESLEY CHU: Yes.

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:06.190
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
And so coming here

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.120
is probably-- it's
not a colony, but it

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.950
is a different
cultural experience.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.750
And how has that kind of
played into your writing

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.550
and the experiences
that led to your books?

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.580
WESLEY CHU: I came
when I was five.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.090
I grew up in Nebraska.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.340
Back in Nebraska
in the '80s, there

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.350
was like five Asian
people in the state.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.280
I think four of them
were in my family.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.770
So I mean, I'm not gonna lie.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.180
My Mandarin is terrible.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.220
I have the listening
comprehension

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.470
of like a five-year-old.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.261
I'm actually hoping my
dad never sees this.

00:30:40.261 --> 00:30:41.182
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:41.182 --> 00:30:43.640
My dad was the principal of
the [INAUDIBLE] Chinese school.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.650
I think I flunked it.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:51.080
So I'm very Americanized.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.980
Obviously you always
experience things

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:57.250
when you look like one
of five people in a state

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.017
full of white people people.

00:30:59.017 --> 00:31:01.350
But it's one of the things
you've got to learn to adapt.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.300
And if anything,
because I had to learn

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.574
to adapt so early in
that kind of environment,

00:31:06.574 --> 00:31:07.990
I have a lot thicker
skin about it

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.380
than I would say most
other minorities.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.170
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah, I come
from a family that is also

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.595
immigrants, and there is
that kind of sense of like,

00:31:15.595 --> 00:31:16.570
but we're American.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.845
But actually also for
me, I think, a big thing

00:31:18.845 --> 00:31:21.920
was like the development
something like Taiwan has seen

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.299
and then going back to kind
of like the rural days.

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:26.090
And then there's this
kind of future Earth,

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.750
and it's just this kind of sad,
rural like reverse progression

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:30.250
of--

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.958
WESLEY CHU: You've
been to Taiwan, right?

00:31:31.958 --> 00:31:32.470
Have you?

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.870
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Not in
a long time, but it's--

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.240
WESLEY CHU: I mean, when I left.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.114
I think it was
like '81, '82, all

00:31:39.114 --> 00:31:40.780
I remember as a kid
was like big jungle.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.705
And like I think I lost a dog
because he jumped in the river

00:31:43.705 --> 00:31:46.090
and a bunch of leeches ate
him or something like that.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.570
I could be actually wrong.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.369
I'm probably wrong.

00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:51.160
I was like four years
old when it happened.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.690
But I went back recently,
and it's like really nice.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.760
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah, no,
that's what I'm saying.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.420
It's just kind of like
seeing this culture build up.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.270
And it's everywhere.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.240
It's not just Taiwan.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:31:59.890
WESLEY CHU: Is it everywhere?

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.375
Because--

00:32:00.375 --> 00:32:01.170
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
It's not everywhere,

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.795
but a lot of places
are going through--

00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:05.210
WESLEY CHU: Chicago's
train system sucks.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.480
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Have you ever tried

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.780
to take BART late at night here?

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.488
WESLEY CHU: I don't
know what that means.

00:32:08.488 --> 00:32:10.210
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's
out like L train.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:10.860
WESLEY CHU: Does it suck?

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.484
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah,
at night it does.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.850
So I'll switch gears again.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.265
What are some non-literary
influences for this book?

00:32:21.265 --> 00:32:22.890
WESLEY CHU: The main
literary influence

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.450
would probably be Kevin
Carter, the photojournalist.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.097
I mean, I read that article,
and it kind of blew my mind.

00:32:29.097 --> 00:32:31.680
At the same time, I'm like, how
could you leave the kid there?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.917
But at the same time, I kind of
got where he was coming from.

00:32:35.917 --> 00:32:38.000
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's a
little bit Prime Directive,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.520
like from "Star Trek," where
it's like can't interfere

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.500
because like--

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.120
WESLEY CHU: I don't know why
I never though about that.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.242
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's the first
thing I thought of. [LAUGHS]

00:32:45.242 --> 00:32:46.280
WESLEY CHU: I'm the
biggest freaking Trekkie,

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.382
and I didn't even
think about that.

00:32:48.382 --> 00:32:49.340
I'm a terrible Trekkie.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.160
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It was
like Prime Directive met

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.118
like Sanderson's laws,
where everything kind of

00:32:53.118 --> 00:32:54.950
has to have like an
equal ramification

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:55.800
and stuff like that.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.690
WESLEY CHU: OK, now you're
taking it to another deep level

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.570
I am not ready for.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:32:59.940
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I'm sorry.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.990
This is Google.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.865
WESLEY CHU: You guys
aren't a bunch of geeks.

00:33:02.865 --> 00:33:08.020
I always thought if the tech
world was like a high school,

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.230
Facebook would be
like the drama club.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.370
All the geeks work at Yahoo.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.972
You guys would be the cool kids.

00:33:14.972 --> 00:33:16.430
You guys would be
the jocks, right?

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.346
That's kind of how I--

00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:18.850
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Sure, I'll take it.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:19.560
Yeah.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.830
WESLEY CHU: Am I wrong?

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.788
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah, I
don't know if any of us

00:33:22.788 --> 00:33:25.590
were that-- some of us were
that growing up, but you know.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.320
So what were some of your
literary influences then?

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.400
WESLEY CHU: When I was a
kid, I wrote a short story,

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.980
I think in like second grade.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.879
And my dad read it.

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:36.670
And he's an English
teacher, so he read it.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.530
And obviously it's a
stupid kid's story.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.260
It was actually about
the solar system.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:46.879
And he read it, and he was
like, son, this doesn't suck.

00:33:46.879 --> 00:33:48.170
It's a very Asian thing to say.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.110
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I was gonna
say that's the highest

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.720
type of compliment
you would ever get.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.360
WESLEY CHU: It's the
highest compliment

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.870
an Asian parent can give you.

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.930
And so actually took
me to a bookstore.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.970
And he's like, buy
whatever you want.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.380
I will buy you books.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.650
And he basically like steered
me toward like "Beowulf"

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:05.657
or "Othello" or
some shit like that.

00:34:05.657 --> 00:34:06.490
I love the classics.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.080
But at the time, I
was in second grade.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:14.130
So I ran to all the books
with all the pretty pictures.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.670
And I'm going to say, I
don't know how this happened,

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:21.020
but I grabbed the Piers Anthony.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.050
He wrote--

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.315
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:23.315 --> 00:34:24.440
WESLEY CHU: No, no, no, no.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.773
That would be his better series.

00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:30.692
He wrote "A Spell for
Chameleon," which is

00:34:30.692 --> 00:34:31.900
the first of his Xanth books.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they're all
like planned [? words. ?]

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:35.710
WESLEY CHU: Yeah, and
that whole series gets

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.800
really weird as time went on.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.198
But I think it got to 18 books.

00:34:40.198 --> 00:34:41.989
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's
like "Wheel of Time"

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:42.852
bubbles of like--

00:34:42.852 --> 00:34:44.060
WESLEY CHU: He's still alive.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.606
He's got like 50 books, right?

00:34:45.606 --> 00:34:46.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.916
WESLEY CHU: He's got like 48
books or something like that.

00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:50.239
So he's still going at it.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:54.460
So yeah, I was fed on a steady
diet of like L. Frank Baum

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.965
and like Piers Anthony
books as a kid.

00:34:56.965 --> 00:34:57.840
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Nice.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.100
That's awesome.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.320
What to you kind of
makes a good sci-fi book?

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.041
Just say, one I wrote. [LAUGHS]

00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:05.790
WESLEY CHU: Let me
know when you find out.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:06.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.960
I mean, I'm a
relationship kind of guy.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.840
Sci-fi is really broad.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.920
I hung out with a friend of
mine, Remez Naam, who wrote

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.490
a great book called "Nexus."

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.940
And for him, he woke
a near-future sci-fi

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:27.070
about what happens
when-- in his book,

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.560
there's OS that you can
install in somebody's brain.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.200
And that's like how
does that biotech

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.990
affect into your future?

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.940
And then you have somebody
like Ann Leckie, who

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:41.550
writes about these thousand-year
empires, and there's no gender.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.190
There's gender but
there's no pronouns.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.600
Everybody's a she.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.530
So she's actually kind of--
there's so many things you

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.480
can do with sci-fi.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.605
Personally, I like
the whole-- I like

00:35:53.605 --> 00:35:57.010
to say that "Time
Salvager" is a love story.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:00.400
And there is time traveling,
but time traveling is not

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.420
the main focus of the story.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.980
I mean, I don't do paradoxes.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.243
I don't do the whole
Groundhog Day or the "Back

00:36:08.243 --> 00:36:10.050
to the Future" thing.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.170
Time traveling is a tool
that I used to bring

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.960
these people together and to--

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.560
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Right, it's
not the crux of the story.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.660
They treat it as a tool.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.730
Like companies in the future
treat as just like it's

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.772
a regular resource to them.

00:36:24.772 --> 00:36:26.105
No, it definitely read as like--

00:36:26.105 --> 00:36:28.590
WESLEY CHU: And obviously
every resource has rules.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:33.360
I talk to a lot about
environmentalism in that book.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.180
The socialist in me
comes out a little bit

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.110
when I talk about corporations.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.330
So it's a combination
of those things.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.720
And I would say time traveling
is the least important

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.864
of all of them.

00:36:42.864 --> 00:36:45.530
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It read almost a
little bit as a cautionary tale

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.502
for me of like where
we could be headed,

00:36:47.502 --> 00:36:49.460
where we want to kind of
avoid heading and like

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.080
the hopefulness of the people
in it trying to correct

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.970
the wrongs, like
eventually realizing, oh,

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.030
let's do something about it
instead of just letting this--

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.985
WESLEY CHU: People are
our ultimate resource.

00:36:58.985 --> 00:37:01.570
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
[LAUGHS] Exactly.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.670
Well, so what are you
reading right now?

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.250
WESLEY CHU: I'm reading
Andy Weir's "The Martian."

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.891
I just finished Robert Jackson
Bennett's "City of Blades."

00:37:08.891 --> 00:37:09.890
That book's not out yet.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.730
It's awesome.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:15.780
I just started "Armada"
by Ernest Cline.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.660
That just came out.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.550
And what was that fourth
book that I'm reading?

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.250
I switch between a
lot of books now.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.910
So what was my last book?

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.967
I just finished
"Uprooted" nu Naomi Novik.

00:37:27.967 --> 00:37:30.050
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Oh, we
just did the talk with her.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.260
WESLEY CHU: Oh, did you?

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.487
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes. [LAUGHS]

00:37:31.487 --> 00:37:33.070
WESLEY CHU: Did it
go much better than

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:33.575
how this one is going?

00:37:33.575 --> 00:37:34.090
DANA HAN-KLEIN: This
one is going great.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:34.680
I don't understand that.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.550
WESLEY CHU: All
right, all right, OK.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.966
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Well, OK, speaking

00:37:36.966 --> 00:37:39.480
of "The Martian," "The Martian"
is being made into a movie.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.780
"Time Salvager" is being made
into a movie, hopefully, yes.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.400
It's on track to be.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.460
Which character from
the book would you

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.509
play if you could
be in the film?

00:37:51.509 --> 00:37:53.050
WESLEY CHU: Who
would I be if I was--

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.549
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah, if you
could be one of the characters.

00:37:55.549 --> 00:37:57.780
WESLEY CHU: I've done some
stunt work in the past.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.554
And I was always like the guy
that gets beat up or killed.

00:38:02.554 --> 00:38:03.970
So I'd be like
assault team number

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.040
five, gang banger number three.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.550
I would run.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.140
I'd shoot.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.410
I'd get shot.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.720
So I think I would just
be like a redshirt.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.340
DANA HAN-KLEIN: OK.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.005
An XO redshirt?

00:38:15.005 --> 00:38:17.654
WESLEY CHU: Because if there
was something being made,

00:38:17.654 --> 00:38:20.070
I would like somebody much
better than me to actually play

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.290
a role, play an important role.

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.194
I will be a throwaway character.

00:38:24.194 --> 00:38:25.860
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You
made a great comment

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.430
earlier about being a
Phillips head screwdriver.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.160
Can you talk more about that?

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.760
WESLEY CHU: I've been asked--
I'm a full-time writer,

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.880
so there's actually many
avenues that a writer can

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.730
do to make a living.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:38.400
They can write novellas.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.941
They can write
novels, short stories.

00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:43.350
They can write articles.

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:46.550
Or they could actually do
screenplays or adaptations

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.620
and everything.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.590
And I've been asked that before.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:53.910
And I'm like, well, I am
a Phillips screwdriver.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.350
I am a single-purpose machine.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.290
I can only do one
thing really well.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:38:59.365
It's OK-well, I guess.

00:38:59.365 --> 00:39:00.490
I can do one thing in life.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:01.880
That's the only
thing I want to do.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.254
I don't want to
do anything else.

00:39:03.254 --> 00:39:04.660
I've been asked
in the past to do

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.990
a pilot for "The Lives of Tao."

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.130
And I give it a shot.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.171
And then I realized that
it's a different medium,

00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:13.689
different skill set.

00:39:13.689 --> 00:39:15.230
Back from my corporate
days, I am all

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.850
about subject-matter experts.

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.250
So instead of me trying to
play the different medium

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:23.140
and risk making
the product worse,

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.040
I'd rather not swallow my ego
and have somebody else do it.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.190
So all I want to do in live
is write novels and stab

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.302
somebody once.

00:39:32.302 --> 00:39:34.260
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So if
you were hosting a dinner

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.634
and you could invite three
characters throughout history,

00:39:36.634 --> 00:39:38.620
who would you invite?

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.774
They can be literary or real.

00:39:40.774 --> 00:39:43.190
WESLEY CHU: I just want to
have drinks with like Hemingway

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.240
or like all those guys.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:44.840
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
That's fine, yeah.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.840
WESLEY CHU: Because he
seems like a cool dude

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.548
to hang out with.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.860
I like reading about
eccentric writers.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.554
Because I never got
why they were eccentric

00:39:54.554 --> 00:39:55.970
until I became a
writer and then I

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.594
started hanging out
with other writers.

00:39:57.594 --> 00:40:01.130
And I can't tell if
it's because writers

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.030
are naturally
eccentric or writing

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.900
makes somebody eccentric.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.620
So I read about all
these guys, and I

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.360
have a bunch of writer
friends, and I could kind of

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.940
see how their gears work.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.650
And so I would like to hang
out with the really big guys

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.950
in the past and figure
out what makes them tick.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.158
DANA HAN-KLEIN: If you could
go back in time 10 years

00:40:19.158 --> 00:40:21.610
and give yourself some
advice, what would it be?

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:23.400
WESLEY CHU: You know what?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.490
If you go back 15 years, I would
tell me to get over myself.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.440
Back in your 20s,
as we all are, I

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.610
was very like insecure
and kind of a dick.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.470
I probably drank too much.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:38.070
So if I go back 15
years, I would probably

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.709
tell myself to chill out.

00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:40.875
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Good advice.

00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:42.710
WESLEY CHU: And quit my job.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.870
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Also,
depending on the situation,

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.490
very good advice.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.781
WESLEY CHU: And make that move.

00:40:45.781 --> 00:40:48.150
Make that move out of Chicago
like you were supposed to.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.000
Now you can't leave.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.700
Sorry, that was a bit too much.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:57.250
AUDIENCE: So to go back to your
Phillips screw head moment.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:01.870
What would be some things
as a professional writer

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:06.000
you would give advice to
your first book as a writer?

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.790
Like what are some
steps you would

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.930
avoid at the very beginning
if you could go back in time,

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:11.650
I guess?

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:16.240
What fascinates me about
books is the journey of it.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.600
It takes years.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.500
It could take months.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.040
I just don't know how you
came from your original idea,

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.560
then to your manuscript,
and then once you were done,

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.130
you're like, what do
I do with this now?

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.820
Like where are some
of the things you

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.200
did at the very beginning
that you know now is not

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.660
something you should do?

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.820
WESLEY CHU: Oh,
man, I mean, there's

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.880
no right way to write a book.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.060
First time I did it, I just sat
down and I just did an outline,

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.110
and I just wrote.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:50.575
And then 15,000
words in, I realized

00:41:50.575 --> 00:41:52.116
that this is complete
garbage, and we

00:41:52.116 --> 00:41:53.616
had to go back and
do it over again.

00:41:53.616 --> 00:41:58.950
And then over time, I've develop
a process that's great for me.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.880
I mean, there's no right
way to get the book done.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.660
But I will say the
one common mistake

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.300
that a lot of
beginning writers make

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:11.770
is they start trying to
sell it before it's ready.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.200
And when you refinish
your very first book,

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.440
we all think it's awesome.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.400
We're like, hey,
I just gave birth,

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.710
and this thing is gonna rock on.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.640
But chances are, it's not.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.350
And the editing process--
when you write a book,

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.010
you made a piece of turd.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.290
Now you've got to polish the
shit out of it until it shines.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.000
And that's a really
long process,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.875
especially if you're
writing your first book.

00:42:33.875 --> 00:42:37.140
You need to edit it
many, many times.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.550
You need to get as many
eyes as you can on it.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:44.040
And I would honestly
say if you can,

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.040
if you can copy edit
yourself, great, fantastic.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.030
If you can't, get a copy editor,
because that stuff really

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:51.620
matters, especially if
you're just starting out.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.400
But yeah, there's
no real process.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.150
You just gotta sit
down and write.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.760
And you'll find your
own natural process.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.475
AUDIENCE: If you have
the polished product,

00:43:01.475 --> 00:43:07.800
if you could give advice to a
new writer, would you query?

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.160
What would be your next step?

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.690
WESLEY CHU: If you want to go
the traditional route, which

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:17.230
is what I do, I queried an
agent, and then I got a deal.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:18.640
Actually, that's not true.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.860
I lied.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:24.180
So the way I got published
is a little bit weirder.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.220
In 2011, my first
publisher, Angry Robot,

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.650
had a one-month open submission.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.750
So for one month, anybody
can submit to them.

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:36.660
And at the time, 955 people
submitted books to them.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.250
And then they went through
like an eight-month weeding-out

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:39.750
process.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.600
It was like
Thunderdome publishing.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.930
And then at the
very end, I think

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.090
25 people made it
to acquisitions,

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:48.550
and five people got deals.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:49.720
So I was one of those five.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.720
And by then, I gotten
an agent and go

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.100
on to your next
future book deals.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.654
If you want, and it's a very
legitimate path to take,

00:43:58.654 --> 00:44:00.820
you can self-publish,
Self-publishing is a big thing

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.590
now.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.730
And if you don't want to
deal with that aspect,

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:05.380
and you're great at
marketing and being

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.890
your own little
business, then you

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.960
can definitely self-publish
and go down that route, too.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.460
AUDIENCE: Like what's the best
typing instrument that you've

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.170
found, or software, whatever?

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.400
WESLEY CHU: I use a took
called Scrivener which is

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.860
a fantastic novel-writing tool.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.820
It's am application
that you can use

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.350
that will help you organize
your entire process.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:27.390
Like my first couple
books were on Word.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:32.520
And Word's great, but once
you have 130,000 words there,

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.860
and then you've got to
make a change in something,

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:40.760
how are you going to
basically debug your novel?

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.600
And what Scrivener does is it
helps you organize everything.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.830
You get multiple screens.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:45.530
You have notes.

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:47.740
You can insert pictures
or whatever you need,

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.000
whatever it takes to help
you kind of like project

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.340
manage your book.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.925
So that's the main tool I use.

00:44:52.925 --> 00:44:54.800
There's another one that
helps with timelines

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.580
called Aeon Timeline.

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.586
It's supposed to be
a fantastic tool.

00:44:58.586 --> 00:44:59.710
I don't know how to use it.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:01.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.627
Whoever makes Aeon
Timeline, it's a great app.

00:45:03.627 --> 00:45:04.710
You need better tutorials.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.592
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Do you
tend to outline your books

00:45:08.592 --> 00:45:09.800
in a very detailed way first?

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.170
Or do you just kind of
give like story beats

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:12.610
and then go in and fill it in?

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.450
Or do you find yourself
going back later?

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:18.840
Or is it you have the idea to
start and then stick with it?

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.590
WESLEY CHU: I'm a
pretty high-concept guy.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:23.080
So I'll get an idea first,
and then I get the characters.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.180
And then I get the world.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.910
And what I usually do is I'll
write two to three chapters

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.210
just to kind of get the
feel of the narrative,

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.400
get a feel of the characters.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.990
And then once I kind
of have an idea,

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:35.110
once I'm confident that
this is a good idea

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.380
and I can go with it,
then I'll step back,

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.690
and I'll write an exhaustive
like 15,000 word outline.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:47.150
And then 90% of the time, I will
jump the rails about 60% in.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:52.630
So what I'm doing now is I write
an exhaustive up to about 70%.

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:56.000
Because 70% is kind of like
the tilting point for a novel.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.280
The first 70%, you're
asking questions.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.540
The last 30%, you're
answering questions.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.712
And that's where a lot of
outlines get tripped up.

00:46:05.712 --> 00:46:07.920
Because you're asking
questions, but sometimes you're

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.870
not always connecting
everything at that point.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:13.900
So right now, I'll write
an exhaustive outline up

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.770
to 70% of the book.

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:19.952
And as I'm writing, I'm always
readjusting, readjusting

00:46:19.952 --> 00:46:20.660
and adding notes.

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.230
I don't edit while I draft.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.390
I highly recommend
not editing while you

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:28.420
draft, because if you do that,
you will be doing that forever.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.900
So get that draft done first.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.610
But as you're drafting,
leave little notes,

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:33.739
like a debug sheet.

00:46:33.739 --> 00:46:36.030
And then once you've finish
the draft, then you go back

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.250
and you do your outline.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.500
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Who are some
of the people you turn to

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.795
or trust like as a
second set of eyes?

00:46:41.795 --> 00:46:43.920
Or do you just kind of want
to get it all out first

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.520
and then send it to people?

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.060
Because I know like artists
and writers and anything that's

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.518
like your creative
baby, people are

00:46:49.518 --> 00:46:52.960
very hesitant to
receive feedback on,

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.860
WESLEY CHU: Nobody
reads my first draft.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.900
Nobody reads my third draft.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.630
I think by the time I'm
in like my fourth draft,

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:01.780
my wife will read it.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.390
And if she hates it, I
will just kill myself.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:09.710
But then I have like a small
group of betas that I rely on.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.800
The thing about betas is
you need to trust them.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.610
You can't let some
dude off the street

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:15.120
who wants to read a book.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.540
Because you don't know if his
opinion is any good or not.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.040
So I have a very
small group of guys

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.170
that I trust that will
give me good feedback.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:25.492
And once I get their input,
then I put their notes in,

00:47:25.492 --> 00:47:26.700
and then it goes to my agent.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.400
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Do
you tend to send it

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.610
to people who are also kind of
involved in the literary world?

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.942
Or do you also include fans
or people who like reading?

00:47:33.942 --> 00:47:35.650
WESLEY CHU: They're
all friends that I've

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.560
known for a long time.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.110
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That you trust,
like that they'd tell you

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:39.140
the truth about--

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.600
WESLEY CHU: I'm too
self-conscious to give

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.750
a draft to another author.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.152
Because then they'll
find out I'm a fraud.

00:47:47.152 --> 00:47:48.610
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
don't think that,

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:53.050
but like I get it's like showing
your work to any other person

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.360
in this world is always a
terrifying thing, be it code

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.690
or a book or a
picture you've taken.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.296
So it's a very human thing.

00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:03.920
WESLEY CHU: The whole
beta process also

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.144
is about self-confidence.

00:48:05.144 --> 00:48:07.560
And once you get these people
that you trust, and they go,

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.400
hey, this book
doesn't suck-- that's

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.270
so my dad when I just
said that-- then I'm

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.430
ready to say after
a while, OK, I

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:18.060
know this book is a
solid piece of work.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.559
I can show somebody that
I'm not as close with.

00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:22.850
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Thank you so
much for joining us today.

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:23.450
WESLEY CHU: All right,
guys, thanks for having me.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:23.750
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.208
Let's give him a
round of applause.

00:48:25.208 --> 00:48:25.900
[APPLAUSE]
