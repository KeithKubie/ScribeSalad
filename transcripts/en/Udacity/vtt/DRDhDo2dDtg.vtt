00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.860
Now I just wanted to add a quick note about hypotheses and theories. The

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.240
hypothesis is a testable question. It's like an if then statement. For example,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.910
if someone drinks caffeine, then their reaction time will decrease. A theory,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.720
on the other hand, is a well substantiated and unifying explanation for a set

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.420
of proven hypotheses. So if you take all of the research in one area, you put

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
it together, you come up with a theory. Now theories can change with developing

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.999
research. But in general, a theory is our current view of a topic.
