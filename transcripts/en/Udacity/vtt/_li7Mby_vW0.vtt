00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.110
I'm getting the same amount of pizza.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.027
Even though the fraction one-fourth
looks different than the fraction

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:11.140
two-eighths, they are actually
equivalent fractions.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.710
I'm still getting one-fourth
of the pizza, but

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.700
my portion of the pizza has been
cut into two slices instead of one.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.800
I can show that they're equivalent by
finding a common factor in the numerator

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.210
and the denominator.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.417
The factors of 2 are 1 and 2.

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:30.628
The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:34.729
The greatest common factor
that they share is 2.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:39.428
We usually don't consider 1 when
finding the greatest common factor.

00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:41.622
Because 2 and 8 have factors in common,

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:44.079
we can write two-eighths
in a different way.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.630
2 can also be written as 2 x 1.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:55.630
And 8 can be written as 2 x 4
because 2 x 4 is 8 and 2 x 1 is 2.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.380
If I divide out the 2
in the numerator and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.564
the 2 in the denominator,
I am left with one-fourth.
