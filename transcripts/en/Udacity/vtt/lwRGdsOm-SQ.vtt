00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:10.732
It's the final one, because E to the power of pi equals E to the power of pi divided by 10,000 times 10,000.

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:20.399
And now we take this apart into a power of a power. E to the power of pi divided by 10,000 to the power of 10,000.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.366
And then we use our approximation again. E to a number that's close to zero is one plus that number,

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:33.466
which leaves us with this final expression. The funny thing about this is that we can compute such a weird expression--

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:41.532
E to the power of pi, with just basic arithmetics. We're adding numbers--one plus something--

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:48.532
We're dividing numbers, and we're multiplying 10,000 numbers. That's it. You could do that on the cheapest

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.800
pocket calculator.
