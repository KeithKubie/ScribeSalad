and you speak with people basically they

00:34:14.379 --> 00:34:14.389
and you speak with people basically they
 

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.990
and you speak with people basically they

of climate change access to water has

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:19.609
of climate change access to water has
 

00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:22.269
of climate change access to water has
decreased so they have seen the real

00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:22.279
decreased so they have seen the real
 

00:34:22.279 --> 00:34:25.269
decreased so they have seen the real
pattern so as a result the investment in

00:34:25.269 --> 00:34:25.279
pattern so as a result the investment in
 

00:34:25.279 --> 00:34:27.759
pattern so as a result the investment in
agriculture is less productive so the

00:34:27.759 --> 00:34:27.769
agriculture is less productive so the
 

00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:29.409
agriculture is less productive so the
chances for purnima is much more

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:29.419
chances for purnima is much more
 

00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:32.379
chances for purnima is much more
stronger so basically the driver what

00:34:32.379 --> 00:34:32.389
stronger so basically the driver what
 

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.889
stronger so basically the driver what

more efficient it's a part of the know

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:47.600
more efficient it's a part of the know
 

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.920

so i would say the drive will come from

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:50.930
so i would say the drive will come from
 

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.840
so i would say the drive will come from
the most poorest countries because they

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:52.850
the most poorest countries because they
 

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.820
the most poorest countries because they
are most exposed to the climate change

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:54.830
are most exposed to the climate change
 

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.609
are most exposed to the climate change

they will be very very upset and angry

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:08.600
they will be very very upset and angry
 

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.140
they will be very very upset and angry

and you visit systems in place would

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359
and you visit systems in place would
 

00:36:14.359 --> 00:36:16.780
and you visit systems in place would
demonstrate that nothing happens very

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:23.390
transformation and my experience is that
 

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.710
transformation and my experience is that
well basically every opposition to

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720
well basically every opposition to
 

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.150

would like to have a transformation so

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:51.350
would like to have a transformation so
 

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.040

think that developing countries do not
have this so the reason is to get

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240
have this so the reason is to get

have windmills you need to make a study

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:30.550
have windmills you need to make a study
 

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:33.540
have windmills you need to make a study
how it will affect make environment but

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:33.550
how it will affect make environment but
 

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:35.520
how it will affect make environment but
if you'd only make a new one mill mill

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:35.530
if you'd only make a new one mill mill
 

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:38.250
if you'd only make a new one mill mill
bill then the next investor will need

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:38.260
bill then the next investor will need
 

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.140
bill then the next investor will need
again to make the study because this one

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:40.150
again to make the study because this one
 

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.030

min mill perhaps influenced the whole

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040
min mill perhaps influenced the whole
 

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.240

thing so you come huge and mr. burden

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:45.250

that's why I would say for the start

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:47.820
that's why I would say for the start
 

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:51.060
that's why I would say for the start
still these strong regular measures are

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:51.070
still these strong regular measures are
 

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.880
still these strong regular measures are
very very helpful because in energy

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:53.890
very very helpful because in energy
 

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:56.340
very very helpful because in energy

oil prices I would say it has served us

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:17.890
oil prices I would say it has served us
 

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.370

and it is global so people complain

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:34.840
and it is global so people complain
 

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.600
and it is global so people complain
about it that it doesn't take some

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:36.610
about it that it doesn't take some
 

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.100
about it that it doesn't take some
elements but it is global and it's

sound and out of suddenly they had to
 

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.800
sound and out of suddenly they had to
pull back because maybe it was just too

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:18.810
pull back because maybe it was just too
 

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:20.870

funds and I think the best ways to use

00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460
funds and I think the best ways to use
 

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.180
funds and I think the best ways to use
is to use in energy sector Greece has a

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:44.190
is to use in energy sector Greece has a
 

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:47.780
is to use in energy sector Greece has a
lot of energy challenge and I think the

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:47.790
lot of energy challenge and I think the
 

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:50.510
lot of energy challenge and I think the
