00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.180
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.530
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: It's
my distinct pleasure

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.780
to introduce you our next speaker.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.150
Admiral Stavridis is a retired Navy
Admiral who is currently the Dean

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.150
of the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.870
He has commanded at all levels of
the military to include; Commander,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.280
European Command, and as
Supreme Allied Commander Europe.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.500
I could provide you with a long
list of his military assignments,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.680
but you have probably already
looked them up on the internet.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.950 position:56%
So instead I will share some nuggets
that provide a better understanding

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.870
of how his career places him
at the Book Festival today.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.650
He is no stranger to books.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.840
He started his love of books
while his family was stationed

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.630
in Greece in the early 60s.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.050
Because there was no Armed Forces
network television he sent his time

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.930
at the post library.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.150
Now I can totally relate to this.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.960
My family was in France at that
same time and my whole family,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.290
all seven kids, were over
at the post library too.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.900
What is striking to book lovers is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.020
that throughout his Naval career
Admiral Stavridis published either

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.200 position:56%
articles or books at each successive
rank to include midshipman.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.160
I suggest he would tell you his
favorite assignment was command

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.700
of destroyer USS Fary.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.550
[phonetic] It came about as a
result of his daily journaling,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.840
using a typewriter of all
things, during his two

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.210
and a half years onboard ship.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.330
The result was a compilation of a
sense of wondering and mistakes,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.220
all of which were intended
to convey, while his time

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.120 position:56%
in command was successful, not every
day was fabulous and the real point

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.970
of life is not what you accomplish,
but rather what you overcome.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.350
In his most recent
book, "Sea Power,"

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.900
Admiral Stavridis uses his Naval
experience to guide us on a journey

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.750
through the seas of the world.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.100
He asks us to consider the value
and the challenge the seas,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.080
from both a personal and an
international economic system.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.970
He helps us understand
the significance

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.020 position:56%
of sea control and power projection.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.200
He asks that we be mindful of
the geopolitics of the ocean,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.600
while warning us not to
over imagine the importance

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.370
of our own small voyages on earth.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.820
Please join me in welcoming
a great friend of the Library

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.510
of Congress; Admiral
James Stavridis.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:35.910
[ Applause ]

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.210
&gt;&gt; Admiral James Stavridis:
Thank you.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.530
Thank you and I very much
appreciate everybody coming

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.500
out on this drizzly day.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.060
It's kind of a mariner's
day out there I would say.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.380
Normally when people hear that
marvelous biography introduction --

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.800
thank you Karen [assumed
spelling] --

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.620
the first thing they say when they
actually see me is, "You know,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.630
I thought you'd be taller
than you appear to be."

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.340 position:56%
[laughter] Well, what I'd like to do
today is just show you a few images,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.430
and we can go to the
first slide please.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.790
We're just going to talk about
the oceans and we're going to take

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.830
about 15 minutes and kind of walk
through the oceans of the world.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.550
And then we'll consider,
in the second 15 minutes,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.080
what we ought to do about it

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.990
and what are the importance
of these oceans.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.680
So let me begin with a line
the British Royal Navy uses,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.860
which is that the sea is one.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.130 position:56%
The sea is one, meaning it connects.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.940
And most who don't spend a
lot of time on the oceans --

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.640 position:56%
and I spent 37 years in the Navy, 11
years day for day on the deep ocean

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.950
in that time -- don't consider that
70 percent of the world is water.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.230
And by the way, 70 percent of
your body is water and 70 percent

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.850 position:56%
of the oxygen that you breathe comes
from photosynthesis in the oceans.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:20.280
And -- next slide please -- 95
percent of the world's trade --

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.050 position:56%
the lifeblood of the earth's economy
-- passes across those oceans.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.600
On any given day 50,000
ships at sea,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.400
three to five million
mariners at sea.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.290
This is an extraordinary,
complex ecosystem,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.650
both in the ecological sense
and the economic sense.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.470
And to give you one last image to
hold in your head about the size

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.040
of the oceans, consider this;
you could take all of the land

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.560
in the world and it would fit
quite nicely inside the Pacific

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.660
Ocean alone.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.090
So the seas are in many ways
fundamental to the earth.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.310
Well, let's get underway.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.630
Let's start in the Pacific.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.000
This is a 1589 antiquarian
chart made

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.300
by Ortelius, a Dutch cartographer.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.420
And you see the discontinuities
and the misunderstandings

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.960
of the outline of the Pacific.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.350
But I'd invite you to go back 4,000
years before that chart was made,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.180
bottom right, the voyages of the
Polynesians who traversed six,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.380
seven, 8,000 nautical miles,
three, 4,000 years ago.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:57.200
These are ancient seas and none
is more ancient than the Pacific.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.890
In the American mental map

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.280
of the Pacific this is
what we tend to see, right?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.890
It's the second World War

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.730
when a vast American armada
sails across it by 1945.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.260 position:56%
In this period we have more aircraft
carriers than we have ships today.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.260
The sea is covered by the
United States and we still sort

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.110
of see ourselves as a
preeminent Pacific maritime power.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.120
But let's look back at
China's history in these seas.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.600
Here are two vessels.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.290
The little one on the left,

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.160
you'll recall from your grade
school studies, the Nina,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.070
the Pinta, and the Santa Maria.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.510
The little one is a
model of the Santa Maria

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.990
that Christopher Columbus
sailed in 1492.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:56.940
That massive ship behind it, built
in roughly the same time period,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.750
was the flagship of
Chinese Admiral Jang Hi.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.800
[assumed spelling] It was, as
you can see, 10 times the size

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.530
of these caravels of discovery
that sailed from European waters.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.760
China has a deep and abiding
history in the Pacific

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.660
and that relationship, the maritime
reach of the United States balanced

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.810
with China's ancient sense
of itself as a Pacific power,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.280
is truly the light motif that plays

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.300
in the geopolitics
of the Pacific today.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.180
And we see the Chinese Navy rising.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.480
It is reaching out.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.780
It is deploying.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.340
Here's a Chinese Corvette arriving

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.730
for a port call in
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:52.960 position:56%
China is also brining its allies and
coalition partners into the Pacific.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.780
This is a Chinese destroyer
operating with a Russian destroyer.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.420
Now, the United States has
terrific allies in the Pacific.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.780
This is also part of
our relationship set.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.720
This is Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.430
[assumed spelling]
a reliable partner

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:19.120
in the Japanese Navy is incredibly
professional and capable.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.630
We also have excellent partners on
the Korean peninsula, South Korea.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:31.350
Together we have a challenge
that is, in many ways, maritime.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.780
It's from North Korea.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.390
This of course is Kim Jung Un,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.690
[assumed spelling]
and he is well named.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.780
He is unpredictable.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.580
He's unstable.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.130
He's not irrational.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.000
He's got a really bad haircut.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.520
[laughter] And the bad news is
he is developing intercontinental

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.440
ballistic missiles.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.410 position:56%
This will be, at least in part, a
maritime challenge that we will face

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:04.480
with our allies and partners --
Japan, South Korea, and others --

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.570
in potentially a place where the
US and China could work together

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.520
to solve a significant
geopolitical challenge.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:21.870 position:56%
So I'll close on the Pacific by just
saying; North Korea -- upper left --

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.930
the rise of China -- these
are Chinese ballistic missiles

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.120
submarines -- 80 percent of the
world's trade -- bottom right --

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.680
flows through that South China Sea.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.760
China's construction of artificial
islands in the Pacific today --

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.160
the Western Pacific --

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.740
we see significant
geopolitical competition.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.980
Let's keep moving.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.170
Let's go to the Atlantic,
which for centuries has been,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.980
in many ways, a transit zone.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.560
And nobody from the United States
thinks of that North Atlantic

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:03.230 position:56%
without recalling World War I and
World War II, the convoy operations.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.730
But again, if you step back
in history it's the Europeans,

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.260
and particularly the
Iberian Peninsula,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.110
who has given us Christopher
Columbus,

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.410
Prince Henry the Navigator.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.820
Upper left is Magellan, who
circumnavigated the world.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.580
Bottom left, one less known,
Bartolomeu Dias, the first European

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.850
to sail into the Indian Ocean.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.900
These mariners from the Iberian
Peninsula launched enormous voyages

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.450
of discovery.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:40.910
And in that Atlantic today the
geopolitical challenge comes

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.420
from Russia.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.380
Vladimir Putin is increasing
the scope and scale

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:53.000
of the Russian maritime forces and
we'll continue to see challenges

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.920
across that North Atlantic
even as we do in the Pacific.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.670
Not insurmountable, not
leading to another war,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.150
but tension that will play
out in this maritime sphere

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:11.440
as we see Russian frontline
ships operating as here

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.030
in the Caribbean off our coast.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.330
Let's move on.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:22.470
The third largest ocean, after the
Pacific and the Atlantic, is this;

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.910
the Indian Ocean, which begins
to hit the world's stage

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.820
as a spice route -- bottom left.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.950 position:56%
Today is increasingly a zone for
everything from piracy off the coast

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.840
of East Africa, hydrocarbons,
and here we see the interplay

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.580
of India -- our rising superpower
in this century -- with Pakistan.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.410
That will, over the
course of this century,

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.350
drive geopolitics in
the Indian Ocean.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:57.910
We see it today tactically in
Yemen, in the northern reaches

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:03.680
of the Indian Ocean, and up into
the Persian Gulf, where the overlay

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:10.160
of Shia -- that's the Iranian
flag, upper right -- Sunni --

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.980
that's the Saudi flag,
bottom left --

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.330
plays out in the waters
around that Arabian Peninsula

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.810
with our greatest ally
in the region, Israel,

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.990
parked in the middle of that zone.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.710
So the geopolitical
challenges here will continue.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:33.940
And of course we need to recall
that Iran is an Indian Ocean power.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.130
On the right you see
the modern flag of Iran,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.000
the two on the upper
left are the battle flags

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.740
of Cyrus the Magnificent [assumed
spelling] and Darius the Great.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.400
The green on the lower chart
was the Persian Empire,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.030
the Iranian Empire at
its greatest extent.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.090
Note all of the coastline here.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.180
Again, we will see
geopolitics playing out in

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.670
that Indian Ocean as well.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.550
Let's go to the Mediterranean
Sea, where many of you have sailed

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.420
on very benign cruises I
imagine, in the summer.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.030
My wife and I did a
wonderful one two summers ago.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.050
But let me tell you something very
somber about the Mediterranean Sea.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.190
If I could snap my fingers
[snap] and bring back

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:25.810
to life every sunken warship
and every mariner who died

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.690
in maritime combat in
the Mediterranean Sea,

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.630
you could walk across that ocean.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.450
It is an enormous zone of war.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.870 position:56%
A highlight battle, if you will, if
there's such a thing, was the Battle

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:47.940
of Lepanto, the high-water mark of
Islamic drive in the seas off Italy

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.930
against the Holy Roman
Empire in the 1570s.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.010
What's the situation today?

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:59.610 position:56%
It's the Eastern Mediterranean where
we see geopolitics most at play.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.220
We see great powers, the
United States and Russia,

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.090
on opposite sides in
the conflicted Syria.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.280
We see enormous turbulence
throughout the Levant and it leads

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.990
to this, a maritime
challenge; two million refugees

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.850
over the last three years.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:23.220
This Eastern Mediterranean
will be a zone of challenge,

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.480
if not conflict --
and also because under

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.380
that Eastern Mediterranean
is an enormous treasure trove

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.570
of hydrocarbons --
oil, natural gas --

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.860
disputed among the
nations in that region.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.120
So the Mediterranean will
challenge us as well.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.730
Let's come a little closer to home.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:47.190
The Caribbean Sea was
once the vast waterway

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:52.620 position:56%
across which the Spanish galleons
moved the treasures of the Americas.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.230
Today, bottom left, the Panama
Canal is the beating heart

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.200
of the US economy as trade
goods flow back and forth.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.460
And it's challenged, it's not
geopolitical challenged --

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.990
nation on nation -- but
it's narcotics, it's gangs,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:16.460
it's natural disasters,
it's refugees here as well.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.430
All of it leads to
significant maritime activity

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.800
by our Coastguard working together
with the Navy, law enforcement

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.650
of course taking the lead.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.350
Let's go to the top of
the world; the Arctic.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.730
This is USS Jeanette, it was
the ship sent to the Arctic

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:42.950
in the 1870s, when many
cartographers/geographers still had

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:48.120
a theory that the top of the world
had a hidden temperate zone in it.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.700
This is just over a
hundred years ago.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.890
The Jeanette tried to
get through the ice,

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.150
was frozen in place,
many of its crew died.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:03.350
Today the Arctic is
a little less icy.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.690
Here's a news flash;
global warming is real.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.430
[laughter] The ice is
melting and it's going to open

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:16.490
that northern trade route,
increase geopolitical competition,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.660
uncover hydrocarbons.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.210
On one side is Russia.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.000
On the other side are
five NATO nations.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.810
The Arctic has never seen war.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:31.870
It will be our challenge to
ensure that we can continue to say

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.590
that as the century unfolds.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.730
If we are able to say it, it will
be the result of organizations

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:43.060 position:56%
like this; the Arctic Council, which
brings together Russia and NATO,

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:48.370 position:56%
one of the few places we have a
coherent conversation at the moment.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.130
The United States needs
to up its game.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:56.670
I'm showing a picture of the one
operational icebreaker the US has.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:02.180
Denmark, a nation of five
million, operates six icebreakers.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.250
We need to improve
ourselves in this zone.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.540
So those are the oceans.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.350
And now if I could for one moment,

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.060
I'll just address the
challenges broadly

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.950
on all the oceans because
the sea is one.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.360
Fishing; illegal fishing.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.590 position:56%
One fish in five caught on the ocean
of the world is caught illegally.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:31.710
Fish stocks declining; probably
50 percent over the last 40 years.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.410
This is a multi, multi-billion
dollar business

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.280
and it is exacerbated by
piracy and illegality.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.120
Additionally, again global warming
is going to change the oceans

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.620
and attack the ability to
conduct the photosynthesis

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.510
for the oxygen we breathe.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.530
With apologies to former
Vice President Al Gore,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.580
who has often said, "The lungs

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.880
of the earth are the
Amazon," they contribute.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.480
The lungs of the earth
are the oceans.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.310
So that's a quick, a very
quick, voyage around the world.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.280
And so, right about now
you ought to be saying,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.830
[laughing] "Okay, Admiral.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.510
You know, a lot of
challenges out there.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.870
What do you think?

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.570
What should we do about it?

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.990
What can we do about it?

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.230
What are the opportunities to
engage in this maritime world?"

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.170
And this is really what the
book, "Sea Power" is about.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:37.170 position:56%
What are the strategic ideas for the
twenty first century, for our nation

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.740
and for the world, in engaging?

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:45.240
Well, let me bring you a quick
shot from "Game of Thrones."

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.930
If you really want a maritime
strategist it's Euron Greyjoy,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:56.700 position:56%
who said, "Build me a thousand ships
and I will give you this world."

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.150
We do need to be capable
mariners, but how do we do that?

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.220
I'm going to start with this.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.120
We've got to listen better.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.030
We've got to listen more to the
oceans themselves, to their health.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.540
We've got to listen to
our allies and partners.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.180
We've got to listen
to our opponents.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.300
This, by the way, is
not photo shopped.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:25.530
This is a Belgian air defense
system from about 80 years ago.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.100
It's not still in operation.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.030
He's [laughter] listening
for incoming aircraft.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.830
It's quite innovative, but I
put it here for us as metaphor.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.470
We need to listen more.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.920
We need to do exactly
what you're doing here

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.970
at this marvelous book festival.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.280
Come, listen to ideas,
challenge ideas.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.620
This is the Naval War College
in Newport, Rhode Island,

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.680
the center where we take a
break from the day to day,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.960
not only listening, but studying,
reading, writing, publishing.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.710
What else can we do for the oceans?

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.910
We can hold on to our values.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.720
We can hold on to our values.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.750
They come to us from the
Ancient Greeks -- Socrates --

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.620
from the Ancient Eastern
Asians -- that's the Buddha --

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.050
through our founding fathers --
upper left -- the Enlightenment --

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.660
Voltaire -- to principal
leaders -- like Angela Merkel.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.770
We need to work together
with democracy,

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.250
liberty, freedom of speech.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.340
Those values will help
us in the oceans.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.760
We need to work with partners.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.900
The United States should not become
the world's maritime policemen.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.620 position:56%
We should be in maritime coalitions.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:45.230
These are French Special Forces
capturing Somali pirates.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.520
They have flown from
a Danish warship,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.500
they refueled from
an Italian frigate,

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.030
they operate under the surveillance

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.930
of a Portuguese maritime
patrol aircraft,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.990
US intelligence from satellites.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.760
These kind of multi-national
coalitions to create security

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.890
and environmental improvement are
vital; alliances and coalitions.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.700
Our allies can help us
in things like freedom

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.890
of navigation challenges.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.480
We need to do more of
this as well from the sea.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.820
As I look at the tragedy
unfolding in Houston I'm so proud

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.510
of the US Navy sending
two massive ships --

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.580
a big deck amphibious carrier,

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.260
a large landing ship
dock right behind,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.230
and potentially we could
send a hospital ship.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.680
When I was commander
of Southern Command,

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.990
before being the NATO Commander,

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.960
I deployed these hospital ships
routinely throughout the Caribbean,

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.300
Latin America.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.190
My counterpart in the
Pacific does the same.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:56.360 position:56%
This kind of humanitarian work,
from the sea, is part of our ability

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.390
to leverage the strategy
of the ocean.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.370
We need new partners.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.830
I would focus in this
century on India,

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.080
which will be a rising
maritime power.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.720 position:56%
We have exercises every year with
India, Japan, and the United States.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.880
And we need to work jointly,
within our own military --

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.700
our Marines, our Coastguard,
our Navy working together

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.240
within the context that I've
laid out here of international,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:32.640
interagency, private/public, all
of that allows us to interact,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.950
for example, with the International
Maritime Organization to work

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.050
with private sector
maritime entities.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:48.490
Blue Water Metrics, a small company
that uses commercial shipping

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.820
to measure the ocean's health;

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.510
it's a powerful private/public
connective idea.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:02.470
We need conversations at all
levels about the oceans and we need

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.310
to read more about the sea.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.610
And that's why I'm so happy
to see so many people turn

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.900
out to a talk about the oceans.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.120
And it can be fiction.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.200
If you've never read Nicholas
Monsarrat, "The Cruel Sea,"

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.290
get up now, leave and go read it.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.720
It's such a fabulous book.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.100
We should understand the maritime
thinkers like Chester Nimitz.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:31.090 position:56%
We should understand the battles,
the hinges of history, like Jutland:

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:35.560
"The Rules of the Game," and
understand that as we look back

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:43.290
through the history of the world,
so often big, big doors swing

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:49.980 position:56%
on small hinges and so often those
small hinges are maritime battles --

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:57.750
Solomos saves Greece from Persia,
Actium divides the Roman Empire,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:03.490
Trafalgar saves the Brits,
Lepantos stops Islam,

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.700
Jutland preserves the
British fleet in World War I,

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.140
Midway is the resurgence
for America.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.630
These maritime battles
matter and we need

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.850
to understand their
impact on the oceans.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:22.130 position:56%
I'll wrap up now and I'd love to
take a couple questions or comments.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.170
I've talked a lot about the
oceans and you'll also find

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:29.440
in this book a very
personal story of my time

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.980
at sea, many, many years at sea.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:39.610
And the seas can be terrible and
challenging and things go wrong.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:47.600
And over the last 60 days we've
seen two US Navy destroyers

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.270
in terrible collisions,
17 sailors dead.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.660
To put that in perspective
for you, tragically we've lost

00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.450
in Afghanistan this
year 11 soldiers.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:05.510 position:56%
In the last couple months we've lost
17 of our finest sailors at sea.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.990
The oceans will challenge us and
that's part of "Sea Power" as well.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.120
But I will say this; I
loved being a sailor.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.910
I loved my time on the ocean.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.160
It's the ultimate office
with a view.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.850
[laughter] I hope you take some
time to dip into "Sea Power"

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.200
and learn more about the
history, the geopolitics,

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.180
and what it's like
to sail these oceans.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.520
Thank you very, very much.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.820
Thank you for coming out.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.120
Thank you.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.420
[applause] Thanks.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.720
Thank you.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.520
Thank you.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.040
[ Applause ]

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.660
Thanks. We'll just I think
kind of go back and forth.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.960
So we'll start over here.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you sir.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.050
My name's [inaudible] I'm actually
a Navy Federal Executive fellow

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.350
this year.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.880
So I appreciate getting the chance
to hear you speak today sir.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.980 position:56%
But I'm actually working on a
project on how illegal, unregulated,

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.750 position:56%
unreported fishing leads to regional
destabilization and eventually,

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.370
potentially conflict
and radicalization.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.960
So you talked a little bit about
fishing in regards to ocean health.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.340
I wonder if you'd comment a
little bit sir on how you see --

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.630
&gt;&gt; I can. I have a piece
coming out in Op Ed called

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.480
"The Coming War for Fish."

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.640
And it sounds absurd doesn't it?

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.410
That that would kind of
get in a war about fish,

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:24.500
but as Ben [assumed spelling]
knows, the conflict is growing --

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.360
a point particularly
to the South China Sea

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.760
where China had a massive
fishing fleet that is encroaching.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.350
We can look in the North Atlantic.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:38.310
We see partners that are
traditionally very close come

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.480
to violent ends over
fishing violations.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.220
We see Indonesia blowing
up illegal fishing craft.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.910
More and more we are going
to see wars over fish,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:58.870
just as in the past we've seen
wars over land, water, oil.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:04.400 position:56%
This is a war over protein and it
is increasingly the principle source

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.040
of protein around the world.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.410
So think of it in the context of
oil or water or another resource.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:16.130 position:56%
It will -- to counter it we need
international, interagency, private,

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.170
public -- the things
I've talked about --

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.840
but we are going to need
robust cooperation between,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.300
not just the Navies
of the world Ben,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.640
but the Coast Guards
of the world as well.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.940
It's a big topic.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.240
Thanks for raising it.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.540
Yes sir.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.840
&gt;&gt; Jim Baling.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.230
[assumed spelling] I served a
couple years in the active Navy.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.530
&gt;&gt; Terrific.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:38.360
&gt;&gt; But what I'm wondering
about has to do

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.780
with these accidents, so called.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.080
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:47.170
&gt;&gt; About the people getting killed
and ships getting hit in the side.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.850
I mean it doesn't seem
to me that the people

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.600
who are commanding these ships
don't know what they're doing.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.970
I don't believe that.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.350
&gt;&gt; So can you give us some idea
of why these things are happening?

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:04.460
&gt;&gt; I can. First of all, Jim I
had the same reaction you did,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:09.360
that it just seems beyond
a possible coincidence

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.490
that two Navy destroyers would
be hit and have that kind

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:16.870
of tragic loss of life over
such a short period of time.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.330
The Navy is conducting
incredibly thorough investigations

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:25.050
and they will look at any
possibility for a [inaudible].

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.200
I'll give you five things and
I'm going to do them fast.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.760
Bad leadership on the
individual ship;

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.280
the captain might be
a terrific mariner,

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.380
but he or she might be someone that
his officer of the deck is afraid

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.030
to call, got a temper,
bad environment

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.370
on the bridge possibility.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.350
Number two; equipment.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.870
Are those radars accurately
working, the early warning systems

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.200
that are built into them?

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.000
Number three; training.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.370
Are we pushing our people too
fast to hit career wickets

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.050
and not giving them
enough time in the basics

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.160
of seamanship and navigation?

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.990
Number four; op-tempo
-- operational tempo.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:08.150
Were those particular
ships driven too hard?

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.070
Were people not getting rest?

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.340
You would never want an
airline captain driving you

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.780
who had not received his or
her mandatory eight hour rest.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.240
Unfortunately I can assure you

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.710
that those bridge watch
scanners are not getting

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.010
that eight hours of rest.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.310
So op-tempo.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:31.470 position:56%
And fifth and finally Jim, I would
say; number of ships in the US Navy.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.530
We need 350.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.700
Every responsible analyst
agrees on that.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.560
We have 270.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.220
Those ships are being pushed hard.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.340
It won't be any one of those,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.210
but my bet is it'll be
a combination of them.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.510
Thank you.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.810
Yes sir.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.110
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.410
My name is Daniel Dagliono
[phonetic] and I read

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.410
in your chapter on the Indian Ocean
about how you see the Middle East

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.710
as a currently embroiled Cold War.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.850
So why do you consider it cold and
what would it take to turn that?

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.150
[laughter]

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I -- great question Daniel.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.090 position:56%
I think -- as I was writing the book

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:08.820
about a year ago it seemed a
little cooler than it does now.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.690
[laughter] The Cold War
analogy in the book Daniel,

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:18.410
comes from the Shia-Sunni tension,
which is religious of course

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:23.320
in character, under laid
by a geopolitical tension

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.070
between Persian and Arab.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.830
Those of you -- most of
you -- are Christian.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.250
So we've seen this movie
before in the Christian faith.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:38.210
It was called "The Wars of the
Reformation: the 1500s, Catholics

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:43.610
and Protestants with an overlay
of geopolitics, Spanish Empire,

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.650
British, Netherlands
become ground zero,

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.670
one third of Europe's'
population is killed."

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.800
It lasted 100 to 150 years.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:00.610
No historical analogy is perfect,
but that one kind of rings the bell

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.040
and the war is getting
hotter, not cooler.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.030
Thanks. Yes sir.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.510
&gt;&gt; My name's Jack.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.670
[assumed spelling] I recently
was recommended a book

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.860
by a former sub Commander
in the US Navy.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.380
It's called "Blind Man's Bluff."

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.680
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.980
Sure.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.280
&gt;&gt; Is -- I found it a great read.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.580
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.940
&gt;&gt; Question is; is there a
chapter still to be written

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:29.310 position:56%
under your scenario for the American
submarine forces and as a part

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:34.210
of our triangular strategy
of national defense?

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:40.310
&gt;&gt; The sub-surface world will
continue to be absolutely crucial

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:44.860
and the tension there
is whether or not

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.230
at some point there'll
be a technology

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:53.820
that effectively renders the oceans
transparent to overhead sensors.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:58.450
Thus far submarines are able to
continue to be very well hidden.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.910
As long as that is the case I
think they will be, in the end,

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.710
the preeminent platform of war.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.300
And that hurts me to say
that as a destroyer officer.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.310
And if I were an aviator
it would really hurt me

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.670
to say it, about the carriers.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:18.600
But submarines, because of
their cloak of invisibility,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.040
until that is pierced they will
be at the center of our strategy.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.390
That's why it's important
that we build them,

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.580
invest in those technologies,
and secondly and final point,

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:35.920
our allies operate
submarines affectively as well

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.170
as we do on diesels in close.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.130
So when you can marry
-- which we don't do --

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:46.090
so when you can marry up
the allied diesel capability

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:52.220
to the US nuclear capability
that's a very potent ability

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.080
to control the seas
and project power.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.380
Yes sir.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.680
&gt;&gt; My name is Zack.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.980
[assumed spelling] My
father is in the Army

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.280
but I still appreciated
hearing you speak.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.580
[laughter]

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.880
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Thank you.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.180
&gt;&gt; In a lot of what
we've been reading

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.390
and hearing North Korea is said
to be an Air Force and more

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.470
of a land based conflict, but you
described it as a maritime one.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:12.800
I was wondering if you
could expand on that.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:18.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I can. It's particularly maritime
from the defensive perspective

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.350 position:56%
of the United States and our allies.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.900
As you may have just
seen over the weekend,

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.410
North Korea launched
a missile over Japan.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.540
The ability to knock down
those long range missiles,

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.490
which is really what we're
worried about with North Korea

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:38.770
in the macro sense, much of it will
be based on destroyers operating

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:41.220
at sea with the Aegis System.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.390
Secondly, if -- and I
don't advocate this.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.650
I don't think it's -- I don't think
there's a good military option

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.760
against North Korea, but if
we're forced to take one,

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.210
the ability to control those
ocean approaches to North Korea

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.500 position:56%
and to cut off their ability to come

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.350
out after our aircraft
carriers will be crucial

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.810
because our land-based air

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.880
on the Korean Peninsula
will be highly at risk.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.340
Those aircraft carriers
can move 1,000 miles a day,

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.800
operate 75 attack aircraft,
are nuclear powered,

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.380
don't need to be refueled.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.790
That kind of capability
and its mobility

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.020
around that peninsula
will be crucial.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.530
I don't mean to say that
the efforts of the Army

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.960
and the Airforce are not
going to be critical as well.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.610
Again, big door swinging
on small hinges.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:37.030
I think the maritime piece of this,
both defensively and offensively

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.150
from the carriers, will be crucial.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.450
Thanks Zack.

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:42.190
Yes sir. Hey, Master and Chief.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:46.400
&gt;&gt; Yes, Dave Mattingly, and I'm a
contributor to "Strategy to Bridge"

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.050
and "Divergent Options" and
I've written quite a bit

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:52.720
on the South China Sea,
especially as it applies

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.790
with the UN convention
of the law of the seas.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.090
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.460
&gt;&gt; Which, if you could touch
on the US's [inaudible].

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I can. So -- get everyone on the
same sheet -- the South China Sea --

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:07.720
big body of water,
think Gulf of Mexico.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.700
China claims it as
a territorial sea.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.110
They say that "we own the
entire body of water."

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.410
They show us a dashed line.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.960
"We own everything inside it.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.000
We own all the hydrocarbons.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.350
Their territorial seas so
we will control the shipping

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.380
and we will simply annex it."

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.240
It will be as though the United
States simply declared the Gulf

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.780 position:56%
of Mexico were a US Territorial Sea.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.260
It is a preposterous claim.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.300
It has gone to the
International Court.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.700
It's been soundly rejected.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.840
China continues to front this
claim and they support it

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.530
by building artificial islands and
saying, "That's Chinese territory.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:54.830
That's Chinese territory.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.310
That's Chinese territory."

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.570
They are playing a long game,
Master Chief, and their hope is

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.910
that over time we'll simply
become tired of the challenge.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.410
If I were a Chinese strategist
I'd do exactly the same thing.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:14.930
Why? Because what China does
not have are hydrocarbons.

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.380
China needs those.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.050
It's part of their long range plan.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.650
So I don't think we're going
to go to war about this.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.680
I think we're going to
challenge them on the high seas.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.750
We're going to fly our airplanes
over their artificial islands.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:32.080
We're going to steam our ships
through their territorial sea

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.550
and we're going to continue to make
the case under international law

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.540
in the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:44.660
that we are observing and enforcing
customary international law

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.080
as described by the
International Courts.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.750
I think if we stay in the game

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:54.290
and stay serious we will
avoid a real confrontation.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:56.840
If we back down we will regret

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.160
that in the long throw
of our nation's history.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.460
Yes sir.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.760
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon sir.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.060
My name's Michael Minerva.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.360
[assumed spelling]

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.660
&gt;&gt; Mike.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.960
&gt;&gt; It seems like, even amongst
Naval Officers, the awareness

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:12.600
or general understanding of
sea power and Naval power comes

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.950
and goes whenever a major book
is written by Mike Crotches,

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.650
[assumed spelling] or Mahon,
[assumed spelling] or yourself.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:18.950
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Yeah.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.980
&gt;&gt; Or something tragic happens.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.580
&gt;&gt; Recently.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.680
What can we do to maintain a
common awareness consistently

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.310
about sea power and its importance?

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.720
That way we're constantly
developing it and the numbers

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.220
of our ships aren't
rollercoastering.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great question from someone
named Minerva, which of course picks

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.340 position:56%
up on Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.330
And I do want to stipulate
that Grotius --

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:45.970
the world's preeminent
international lawyer --

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.980
probably up here in history.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.510
Mahon, up here.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:54.610
The great strategist,
Stavridis, about down here.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:59.320
[laughter] But I'll take your
point of how do we maintain a level

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.140
of knowledge and understanding?

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:06.530
And the answer is; the old
fashioned way, which is education.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.910
It means in our ROTC
programs, at the Naval Academy,

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:13.860
even at Officer Candidate
school where we take graduates

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.670
of universities, we need to ensure

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:21.780
that we're not only covering
administration and inspections

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.070
and all the important things we
want a young officer to know,

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:30.610
but also our history and
why strategy matters.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:37.280
That plug into the educational
process for a Naval Officer needs

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.180
to occur really at every step
and certainly when you go

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.050
through war college in
your late 30s and even

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:50.000
in executive education programs,
like we run up at Tufts,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.570
the Fletcher School, or
over at the Kennedy School.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:59.330
There's no simple, easy way to
do this other than education.

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.630
Yes sir.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.480
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] I have a PHD
from the Fletcher School of Law,

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.430
a Master's so I've had
everything that was [inaudible].

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:05.730
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.160
&gt;&gt; My grandfather, when the Great
War was in the US Navy as well.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.650
&gt;&gt; And he used to say, "If you
want to fight, join the Army."

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.230
[laughter] My question to you, and
this is open-source, are two points

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.520
of really Chinese provocative
issues.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.170
First of all, they have built
-- again, open-source --

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:26.240
these kind of ports that we
see in Japan for the US fleet

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.360
and they do mock attacks on
them, which kind of shades of,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.480
you know the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.630
And secondly they seem to be
building ports all over the world,

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.780
especially for example in Pakistan.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.340
Karachi's port is at
like 50 percent capacity.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.640
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.940
&gt;&gt; Yet they're building
one right next door.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.940
And of course the Indians
are thinking from,

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.080
you know the Indian Navy; this is
going to be a direct [inaudible]

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.380
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.130
&gt;&gt; How do you deal with
these kinds of issues?

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.220
&gt;&gt; And let me add one to your
litany, which is a very good one,

00:39:54.220 --> 00:40:01.300
China's also building a massive
overseas military base in Djibouti.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.600
And that second chart I
showed you, with choke points,

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.220
you will find very
much this program.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.500
In fact, they are using
Mahan's [assumed spelling] right

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.160
in front of us.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.450
So the answer is; when you want
to deal with the network you have

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.550
to have a strong network.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:22.460
So we need to leverage our
strongest comparative advantage,

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.530
which is our allies,
partners, and friends.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:30.480 position:56%
This is why India -- particularly
this alignment of the United States,

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.580
India and Japan --
is so very powerful.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.330
So the short answer is they're
going to build a network.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.410
We need to maintain and
strengthen our network

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.200
and I would argue back to values.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.770
Our democratic alignment
with NATO, with Japan,

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.700
with Australia gives
us a much bigger pool

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.350
of partners than China will enjoy.

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:57.530
Think we have time for one
more here and one more there.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:58.830
Sir.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.780
&gt;&gt; Sir, thank you very much.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.120
Sir, I'm Mick Miquen, [phonetic]
retired Airforce Officer.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.520
And I first wanted to thank you
for your amazing contribution

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.880
to your service to this country.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.180
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And your comments on Maureen Joe.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.780
[assumed spelling] [laughter]

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.080
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Sure.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.010
&gt;&gt; But my real question is
you served and that had to do

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.610
with your perception of
strategy, vis a vi the Chinese

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.410
in the South Chinese Sea.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.780
Two observations if I may sir.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.470
As an Airforce guy, the picture
just before your Naval war college

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:32.020
photograph -- back just before
the Naval war college photograph,

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.270
that was in fact the National
War College in the background?

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.570
&gt;&gt; You know, it looks like it.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:37.870
It's actually not.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:39.610
I've done serious research on this.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.960
Go ahead and ask a question sir.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.260
[laughing]

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.150
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] brilliance of
statement and that is that the word

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.800
around town sir is that you
married about three levels

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.300
above your authorized pay grade.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.600
&gt;&gt; Don't we all?

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.900
[laughing]

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.340
&gt;&gt; And I mention that because
your wonderful wife, Laura,

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.080
[assumed spelling] taught
our children in preschool

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.470
at Saint Aiden's [assumed
spelling] in the morning.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:59.040
So we thank Laura for that.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.340
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's so kind Mick.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.640
Thank you very much sir.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.940
[applause] Thank you.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.860
Young lady, you have
the last question.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.160
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.830
I heard that you said that
NATO countries and Russia need

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.280
to work together to
combat global warming,

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.920
is NATO hurting us in this respect?

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.080
&gt;&gt; I think -- that's a
terrific question, by the way --

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:23.440 position:56%
I think that NATO is helping because
it creates an alignment of nations

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.770
who share fundamental
values, as we've talked about.

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:32.720
Secondly, NATO helps us because
the NATO nations together have 52

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.290
percent of the world's GDP.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.120
So they have enormous
economic capability

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.640
to address these kinds
of challenges.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.510
Thirdly, NATO provides a forum.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:47.790 position:56%
It's a place where these nations can
gather and discuss crucial issues

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:51.070
to include the security
challenges that come

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.990
from environmental degradation.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:57.300
So I would argue NATO
is a force for good.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.810
A multiplier effect would be

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:04.820
if we could convince our Russian
counterparts, if you will, to join,

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.110
at least in that conversation.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.590
We may continue to
disagree with Russia

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.960
on Syria and Ukraine and Cyborg.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.310
But can we not agree
on the challenges

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.080 position:56%
to the environment and to the ocean?

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.960
I think there's at least
a chance of that and in

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.700
that sense I think NATO
is a force for good.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:28.760
Let me close by saying, thank
you all for coming out today,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.930
for thinking about the oceans,

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:34.760
and for supporting this
incredible festival,

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.680
the National Book Festival.
