Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Today, we are going to do something different from what's happened so far in that we are going to study the dynamics of more than one body. Or you might say, look, we already did this last week when I studied the solar system where there are planners moving around the sun. So that makes up these two bodies, the sign in the planet, but actually the son was not doing anything interesting in our analysis. Son Just stood there as the source of the gravitational force is a planet that did all the orbiting and that was a problem in two dimensions. But I've only one body. So now we're going to enlarge over domain to more than one body or being Newton's laws. So let me start with the simplest possible case. Two bodies and I will again started simplest case of they're moving in one dimension. Then we'll put in more. So here is the one dimensional world in these bodies are going to move and this is my origin. X equals zero. And I'm going to imagine one point mass and one located at x one other point. Bass m two located at x two.

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       Oh

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       No. We know everything that is to know about these masses from the likes of Newton, which I'm going to write down. The first mass obeys does equation m the two x one over d t square. That's Mia, right? But I'm going to write this in a notation that's more succinct. Um, prior to writing the second day they would have this fashion. I'm going to write it as follows. M One x one with two dots in it. The two dots telling you is to derivatives. If there's one daughters, one day they would have $3 to three data centers. Of course at some point there's notation becomes unwieldy, but you never deal with more than two derivatives. So this works. This is Amy, so don't forget the docs, okay? This is not some foreign alphabet. every.is it did have it. You should remember that when I do the subsequent manipulation, that's Amy. And that's equal to force on body one.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       No, look at the body one. And ask what are the forces acting on it that it could be the whole universe but we going to divide that into two parts. The first part is going to be the force on body one due to body to which I'm going to denote by f one two f southern rotation. You and I agree that's the forest in one duty to then that's the force on one due to the external world. E stands for external. That means everything outside these two do universe as many bodies I have to speak these two guys they're wanting to and the force on one is some of it's due to too and some of what to do to everything else.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       Similarly, I have another equation and two x two double.is the fourth son to do do one plus the force on to due to the outside world. What do you mean by outside world? Maybe these two guys have an extra some planet and the planet is way over to the right. It's pulling all of them towards the planet with some gravitational force, so everything else is called external like one and two for example. Are connected by a spring. The spring is not that important. It's a way of transmitting force from one body to the other. If you're compress the spring and let it go, these two masters at white bread, back and forth under the influence of the other person's force. That's an example of f one two and a half to one for example, the spring is compressed at this incident is trying to push them out. That means really one is trying to push to outwards that way too is trying to push one to the left this way. That's an example of f one two and half to one. The external force could be due to something extraneous to these two bodies.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       So one example is the surface of the earth. I take these two masters connected by a sprain. There is mass one and here's my stew. I squashed the spring. If there is no gravity, they would just go vibrating up and down, but let them fall under the field of gravity. So they're also experiencing the mg due to gravity so they will both fall down and also oscillate relate to each other. They're all described by this equation. This will be the spring force transmitted from one to two. This would be the force of gravity article could be electric force at any other force to to anything else. I'm not interested. Now here's the interesting manipulation we are going to perform. We're going to add the two things on the lefthand side and equate them to whatever they get on the right hand side. Then I get m one x one double.plus m two x two double doc and that's going to be, I'm going to write it in a particular way. If one external plus F to external plus f one two f two one

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       I think you have some idea where I'm headed now, so what's, what's the next thing we could say? Yes, yes, because that's the third law of new whatever the underlying force, gravity spring, anything forced on one [inaudible] to enforce them to do two one will cancel and everything I get today, the whole lecture is mainly about this one simple result, this cancellation. Then this whole thing. I'm going to write this ethics journal meaning the total external force. On this two body system. So I have this peculiarity question. I'm going to rewrite it in a way that brings it to the form in which is most useful. I'm going to introduce a new guy, capital x, as you know, that's called the center of mass coordinate and it's defined as m one x one plus m two x two divided by capital m. Capital m is just the total mass and one plus empty. If I do that, this is a definition, then we can write the secret mission as follows. I would write it and then we can take over time seeing that it is correct. So this is really the big equation.

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       What did you guys try to fill in the blanks in your head? This is really correct. On the lefthand side, I have capital m times x double doc, so I have really m one plus m two times x double dot. If you take the double door, this guy, it's an one x one double.plus m to extrude double dot divided by m one plus m two so the left hand side is indeed this. That's all I want you to check. So take this expression divided by the total mass and multiply by the total mass. Well, the multiplying by the turtle masters here and when divided by the total mass you get the second didn't it threw off the center of mass coordinate.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       So what have I done? I have introduced a fictitious entity, the center of mass central Mass USA location, capital x, some grant of a weighted average of x one and x two by weighted, I mean if I'm on an m, two would equal then capitol and bill be two, two, two times at mass and you'd just get x one plus x two over to central mass would sit right in between, but if m one is heavier, it'd be tilted towards and one of inclusive vehicle be tilted towards them too. It's a way to sum that gives a certain coordinate that is nothing present at that location. There's nobody there. All the stuff they did here or that the central mass is the location of a mathematical entity. It's not a physical entity. If you go there and say watch are the central mass, you typically won't find anything and it behaves like a body.

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       After all, if you just said, I've learned Newton's laws and I walk into this room and I say this, I won't say, well this guy's talking about a body of mass capital m undergoing some acceleration due to the force for the center of mass is a body whose mass seems to be the total mass at these two particles. Who's acceleration is controlled by the same as Newton's law, but the right hand side contains only the external forces. This is the key. All the internal forces have canceled out and what remains to the external force. Now your fraternity started even got three bodies. You can do a similar manipulation and again you'll have f one two and half to three and have three or two and so on. They will all canceled and walk through. The man will be a similar thing, but this is the total external force.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       So if I can say this in words, what we have learned is that the advantage of introducing a quantity called center of mass is that it responds only to the total force and doesn't care about internal forces. So I give you an example. So he had a some at a plane, right? It's in flight and a couple of guys that are having a fight punching each other and so on. The rest of the passenger says enough is enough. And to throw them out there just floating around affecting each other's dynamics. And of course this person will feel a forced you to that person. That person would feel of course you to this person. But what I'm telling you is the center of mass is going to drop like a rock. It's going to accelerate with the forest MGH. I'm just going to accelerate with Ge.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       So at one point that this person may be having the upper hand and maybe hear the other person may be down here, but follow the central mass, you find there's simply falls under gravity. So the mutual forces do not affect the dynamics of the center of mass art. For example. Suppose at some point this person blows the other one up into say to Samurai that make it simple, cuts them up in two pieces. So let me got three bodies now, first protagonist and the other two. Now unfortunately somewhat decimated. Now you can take these three bodies, find their center of mass. It'll be the same thing. It'll just keep falling down. So even though the system is becoming more and more complicated, you cannot change the dynamics of the center of mass. It responds only to the external force. If this fight was taking place in outer space, but there's no gravity, then as this fight continues and people are flying in parts of laying everywhere, central mass, we'll just be in one location not doing anything. Yes, no, that's what I'm saying. Center of mass. If it changes, it can certainly, no one says the central mass cannot accelerate. It can accelerate due to external forces. But if there were no external forces, then the center of mass will behave like a particular with no force for the not moving to begin with. It won't move later or if it is moving to begin with that he maintain a constant velocity.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       So here's another example. Now you can obviously generalize this to more than one dimension. If you're living in two dimensions, you will introduce an x coordinate, introduce a white coordinate, and then you will have the center of mass as m r double dot equal to f and r would be m one odd one plus m two r two divided by the total mass r one and r two are just the location. Now been two dimensions of these two masses. So here, the same one here, the m too, and the center of mass you can check will be somebody in between the line joining the two points, but it'll now be a vector. So here's another example. So you'll take a complicated object. It's got masters and there's God springs. It's connected with thread and chains and everything. You throw the whole mess into the air. All the different parts of it are juggling and doing complicated movements. But if you follow the center of mass, in other words, that every instant you take the m one odd one plus m two r two plus MTR three and so on, divided by the total mass that coordinate, would it simply be following the parabolic path of a body curving under the gravity?

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       If at some point this complicated object fragments into two chunks, one with land he had in one would land there, but at every incident, if you follow the center of mass, it'll go as if nothing happened and it will land here in central mass that's not cared about internal forces but only about external forces. That's the main point and it was designed in such a way that external forces canceled in those dynamics. So everything I'm going to do today is to take that equation and mixed doubles dot equalsF or m r double dot equal f in vector form and did you is all the consequence?

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       No. First of all, you should realize that if you've got several bodies, say three bodies, then I would define the center of mass to be m I x. I divided but some or what am I? This is the shorthand. I'm going to write it only once, but you should know about the notation means if there's eye from one to three it really means m one x one plus m two x two m three x three divided by m one plus m two lesson three. This summation is a notation mathematicians, they've introduced where the index, I will go over the range from one to three. Every term you let, I take three different values and they do the song.

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       An exercise I've given to you guys to pursue at home is the following. If I got three bodies, one, two, and three defined the center of mass, you can either go to this formula, do all the next ones and add them up, or do you also have the following options? You can pick any two of them, say the first two, but get the third one. Take these to find their center of mass. Let's call it x one and to add with that total mass m one two which just just m one plus m two trade these two for a new fictitious object and put that here and forget these two, but on that one point, the deposit, the massive, these two, now you take the center of mass of this object with the third object, by the same weighting process, m three x three pluses, m one two x one two divided by the total mass. You will get the same answer as here.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       What I'm telling you is if you've got many bodies and you want the center of mass of all of them, you can take a subset of them, replace them by their center of mass, namely all that mass sitting at the center of Mass d plus the other half by their massive ego, that center of mass. And finally find the center of mass of these two centers of mass properly weighted and that will give you this result. Okay. So, uh, before I explain that equation and find all the consequences, we have to get used to finding central of mass for a variety of things. As long as they give you a 10 masses are countable number of masses, we just got to plug it in here. It's a very trivial exercise. Thanks. Become more interesting if I give you not a set of discrete masses with this great locations. [inaudible] namely countable set up passes where they give you a rod like this. This is a rod of mass m and l and I say where does his center of mass? So we have to adapt the definition that we have for this problem. So what definition, what should I do? Well this is my origin of coordinators. You've had a set of masses but definite locations. I know how to do it, but this is a continual, the trick then is to say I take a distance x from the left hand and I cut myself a very thin sliver of thickness dx.

Speaker 2:          00:17:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       That sliver has got a certain mass and I argue is that a definite distance x from the court in its origin they finish speaking, you will say, what do you mean by definitely distance? It's got a wit the x. So one part of it is it x? The other part is of x plus Dex. So it doesn't have a definite coordinate. What if the x is going to zero? This argument will eventually be invalid. So dx goes to zero. That's delivered Hasad definitely location, which is just the x coordinate of where I put it. So to find the center of mass, which is consists of multiplying every mass base location and adding, let me first find how much mass is sitting here. Let me it Delta, how much massive sitting there. But I do the following, I take the total mass and divide by l last the mass per unit length and this fellow has a wit the DX. So the massive this little slivers and Wilbert Ldx.

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       Therefore the center of mass that I want his phone by taking this sliver of that mass multiplying by its coordinate and summing over all the slivers, which is what we do by the integral from zero to l. Then I should divide by the total mass, which is just an, you can see now if you do this calculation, I get one over l the Nigga integral x Dx from zero to l and that's going to be elsewhere over too. So if you do that you'll get allover to, I'm not doing every step in the calculus because at this point we should be able to do this without every detail. So the center of mass of this Rod, that's nobody's price is right in the mid point,

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       but it's assumed that the rod is uniform, but it's like a baseball bat. They could at one end and tender at the other end. Of course, no one is saying that, but we have assumed the mass per unit length, namely Ammo. Is this a fixed number? I'm over l and then this is the answer, but there are other ways to get this result without doing all the work. Okay? So we would like to learn that other methods because it'll save you a lot of time. It must be clear to most people that the center of mass of these writers at the center. But how do we argue that? How do you make it official? You could do the integrity, you will get the answer, but I want to short circuit the integral and here's the trick is not going to work for arbitrary bodies. If I give you some freezy object like this, you cannot do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       But this is a very symmetric object. You can sort of tell if I take the midpoint, that is as much stuff to the right as to the left in some way. You want to make that argument Pharma and you do the following. Suppose I have a bunch of masses and the object is really not even regular. This general coordinates, if I replaced every x bar minus x, okay, so I'd actually change this Arctic. So this is really, it looks like this. Here's the object supposedly plays every x bar minus x that's reflecting the body or on this axis it will look like this. It'd be getting to the right instead of the left. So don't go by my diagrams. You know what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to draw the middle remained of this object the other way. Then I think it's clear to everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:20:37       If I do that x one go to minor sex because then there's averaging am I excise some load all the masses. If every x goes to minus x center of mass, we'll go to minus x but not take this rod and transport every party. Room two is negative coordinate and you take that guy and put it here. The Rod looks the same is it all looks the same. The central mass miss look the same. That means minus sex has to be equal to exit itself and the only answer this x equal to zero. So without doing any detailed calculation, you argued that the answer is x equal to zero. To do this. Of course you must cleverly pick your coordinates so that the symmetry of the body is evidence. If it took the body like this and you took a reflection on this point, it goes into the body.

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       Flipped over. There is not much you can say about it. So what do you really want to do is to pick a point of reflection so that upon reflection the body looks the same. The body looks the same. The answer must be the same, but they will argue the answer must be minus of itself. That's for the answer to zero. This is how the central of massive symmetric bodies can be fun. So we know the answer for this Rod. Suppose they give you not a 10 rod, but eh, Radha non zero with we want to know it's center of mass. We're not going to do any more work. Now by symmetry, I can argue that this has to be the center of mass because I can take uh, every point here and turn it into the point that by changing y two minus y therefore capital, why it will become minus capital wine. But the body looks the same after this mapping. So capital way zero and similarly capitol x's, you don't that the center of mass. Now what if I give you this object?

Speaker 4:          00:22:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       Nobody wanted to try that.

Speaker 4:          00:22:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       What do you guys like to try this? Yes. Can you tell me where the central mass should be? Yeah, no, no. The guy in front of you. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:23:00       Objects.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       Okay. Is that what your answer was? Okay, so the correct answer is the place, this mass by all efforts, mass, whatever it is, sitting here, they play this one by all of its mass sitting here. Then forget the math, the big bodies to be placed in by points. Then you just got two masters located here and you can find the weighted average. It may be somewhere there.

Speaker 4:          00:23:39       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       now let's take one more object then I'm pretty much done with finding these centers of mass. The object I'm going to pick, you see a triangle that looks like this. It's supposed to be symmetric even though I've drawn it this way, that is B and that is B, and that distance is h. Let the mass B m we had, it's the center of mass. This optic,

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       again by symmetry. You can tell that the white coordinator at the center of mass must lie on this line because if I think take y two minus Y, it maps onto itself so it looks the same but it's supposed to reverse capital capitol. Why? Therefore why is minus Y in that photo is zero, so it's evidently lying somewhere on this line. I cannot do further calculations of this type by saying where it is on the line because it is no longer a symmetry in the x direction is symmetric in the wild andro flipping why, but I cannot say take x two minus x. In fact, if I take extra minus x, this one looks like this. It doesn't map into itself, but I can pick any point here. If I take extra minus sex, the object looks different. It looks like that object and relating one object to another object is not what I'm trying to do. I want to relate it to the same object that cannot be done for x. It can be done for y for x. You got to do some honest work. The honest work we will do then is to take this thing, take a strip here with location x and with the DX and the height of that strip here is why, why of course babies with X. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       so I'm going to argue that to find the center of mass of this triangle, I can divide it into vertical strips with tech paddle, do each other and find the central mass by adding the weighted average of all these things. For that, I need to know what's the mass of the shaded region,

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       so let's call it delta. In the mass of the shaded region is the mass, but you're in an area. I'd find the area later on in terms of B and h, but this is mass media in India, but then I need to know the area of this trip. I'm going to give the answer, but because I don't have time to probe it, but you should think about what the answer for the area of the shaded region is. It's got a height to why and has got the width, the x, it's not quite a rectangle because the edgers lately tapered, but when Delta is goes to zero, it's going to look like a rectangle. So the idea is to why delta x, but I don't want to write everything in terms of why I wanted to write it in terms of x. Then I do similar triangles. Similar triangles tells me that why Overby is x over at h Emily, that triangle come back to that triangle tells me why divided by B is x divided by age. Therefore the y here can be replaced by the x over age.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       So that is the mass of the sliver here and are centered is obviously here. So that is a mass there. There's somebody else that I've got to do the weighted average of all of them to remember. I don't just integrate this over x, let me just give me the mass of the body. I should multiplied by a further x and then do the integral. So what I really wanted to do to find the center of mass ex used to take that mass. I got am over a, that is a tool that's an age that is a B Benson, x from there and another x because you have to multiply this by the x coordinate of this thing because that's the coordinator of the central mass of this that our two x's. That's what he got to remember. So that should be integrated from zero to age. That'll give me h cubed over three so I get to em, the Eh h h cubed over three.

Speaker 1:          00:28:06       Now you know what? There's one more thing we have to do. We must replace the area of the triangle by one half base times altitude, which is Bah. Well, I also forgot to do, I did everything by the mass because the center of mass is this weighted average divided by the total math. So I got a divided by one over there like claim. If you do this and cancel everything, you will get the answer of two thirds age. Okay. So not surprisingly, the center of mass of this is not halfway to the other end, but two thirds of the way because it's top heavy, the side of it, the heavier, this is the level of calculus you should be able to do in this course. We are able to take some body, slice it up in some fashion and find the location of the center of mass. You come by and symmetry arguments with actual calculation for this liver by symmetry. You know the central mass is at the center. You don't waste your time, but then when you add these guys, there is no further cemetery you can use. You have to do the actual work.

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       So what have I done so far? What I've done is point out to you that when you work with extended bodies are more than one body. We can now treat the entire body, replace the body by single point for certain purposes. The single point that's called the center of mass. When am I attend? All the mass contemplated the center of mass. So you have created a brand new entity, which is fictitious. It doesn't mask with a total mass. It has a location equal to the center of mass and it, it moves in response to the total force and is not aware of internal forces. And that's what we want to explore it. I already gave you a clue as to what the implications are, but let me, let me now take a thorough analysis of this basic equation and r w. Dot. Equals F. We just got to analyze the consequence. So there are several cases you can consider. Case one is f external, not equal disease.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       So this is a two bodies subject to mutual forest and to an outside force. The simplest example, I wanted to give it to you, but I'll repeat it. We're not going to do this in great detail. We all know if I had a point mass like this, it will do that. What I'm not telling you is for take a complex body made up 20,000 parts, all connected with each other, pushing and pulling. If you flipped that crazy tongue thing in the air, it'll do all kinds of directions and juggling as it moves around. But if you fall in it's center of mass, it's center of mass of followers, simply a parabola because the external force on it is just mg. So it will be m r double dot equals m g and that's just motion with constant acceleration in the way that action and it just a predictable problem.

Speaker 3:          00:31:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       And I had repeat once more for emphasis that if this object broke into two objects, typically what will happen is one will fly there and one will land here. But in every instance if you found their center of mass, you will find it proceeds as if nothing happened. For example, if you have an explosive device that blows them apart, the pieces are all flying. But that is coming from one part of the piece pushing and another part of the piece. But that those forces that have no interest with as far as the external force score say distilled gravity. So the central of massive continue traveling beyond that, I'm not going to do too much with this thing. So let me now go to case to case too. If you want case to a is f external equal to zero. What does mean if f external is zero, that means this is zero. That miss m r double doctor zero. That means m R. Dot. Is a constant because it's not changing. Who is this? Mr? What does it stand for? Well, it looks like the following. If you take a single particle of mass m and velocity X. Dot. We use the symbol of p maybe haven't ever used it before in the course and that's called the momentum.

Speaker 2:          00:32:59       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       we'll let them hold the body is this peculiar combination of mass and velocity. In fact, in terms of momentum, they may write Newton's law instead of saying it's m Dvdt it just m a you can also write it as d by Dt of envy because MSA constantly and you can take it inside the dead averted and that we can write as the PBT sometimes instead of saying forces buy stamps, acceleration people often say forces the rate of change and momentum. Today, there is a momentum of a body is changing, is the applied force, so you've have not introduced to the notion of momentum well here at this, so if you think about it that way, this looks like the momentum of the center of mass and we are told the momentum of the central mass does not change if there are no external forces, but the momentum of the central of massive buddy, simple interpretation in terms of the parts that make up the center of mass. Let's see what it is. Let's go back here. Remember, let me just take two bodies and you will get the idea. It's m one plus m two historical m and let's take just one dimension. When there's an x one.plus m two x two dot. They might've been in one plus m two that is what an x.is the m one plus m two cancels here and you find this is just p one plus p to let's use the symbol capital p for momentum or the center of mass.

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       The momentum of the center of mass is the some of the momentum of the two parts. But what you're learning is, so let me write it one more time. If FX journalists equal to zero, then p one plus p two an art change with time.

Speaker 1:          00:35:03       This is a very, very basic and fundamental property and it's in fact one another result that survives all the revolutions of relativity and quantum mechanics. Well, what I've said for two bodies as true for 10 bodies, you just do the summation over more terms. So let me say in words what I'm saying. Take a collection of bodies or to give an instance. Everything is moving. It's got his own velocity and its own momentum. Add up all the momentum. If you the one dimension, just add the numbers, different true dimension. Add the vectors. You get a total momentum that total momentum does not change if there is no outside forces acting on. So a classic example is two people are standing on ice. That total momentum is zero to begin with and the ice is capable of incapable of any force along the plane. It's going to support you vertically against gravity, but if it friction list, it cannot do anything in the plane, then the claim is that if you and I are standing and be pushed against each other and be fly apart, my momentum has to be exactly the opposite of your momentum because initially you're split.

Speaker 1:          00:36:10       Mine was zero. That cannot change because I don't wake so forced to save two particles push against each other. They can only do so without changing the tone.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       Okay, so p one plus B two does not change. And here's another context in which is important support that is a mass and one going with some velocity be one and here's the second mass him to going with some velocity be too. They collide when they collide. All kinds of things can happen. I mean in one may bump his head on that and come backwards. Audit could be heavy object that pushes everything in the forward direction. At the end of the day, you will have some m one going with the new velocity. Be One frame and m to going with a new philosophy. We to prime and what I'm telling you is that m one v One plus M Two v two will be equal to m one v one prime. Let's aim two three to prime your net collision. Of course, one block exerts a force on the other block and the other block exerts an opposite force on this block.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       That's the reason why even though individually that momentum could be very different. Finally, the momentum will add up to the same total. Here's a simple example. You can show that if this mass and that mass at equal and say this one has addressed, that will come soon. Here's this. You can show under certain conditions, this one will come to rest in. This will start moving with the speed of the, the target will move with the speed or the projectile. So moment of individual objects have changed. One was moving before this nonmoving, one was at rest. It's moving, but when you add up the total doesn't change. And this is called the law of conservation of momentum, so that's so important. I'm just going to write it down here one more time and the basic result is if external forces are zero, then p one [inaudible] p two last B three and so on before would be p one prime list B, two prime, less beat, three prime and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:38:29       We had this means before and that means after and what's it Ben is before when it's after pick any two times in the life of these particles. It's like law of conservation of energy, but we said e one equals z to that one and booster for before and after. Well here we cannot use one and two for before and after because one and two and three are labeling particles. So the before quantities or written without a prime. The African studies are written with a prime. Everybody followed this. Pretty important. You follow the statement and follow the conditions under which it's balance that cannot be external forces. For example in the collision of these two masses, if the restriction between the blocks in the table, you can imagine they collide and they both come to rest after awhile. What are generally that moment of finally they don't? What happened? Well, he had, you have an explanation, namely the force of friction was an external force acting on them. What I'm saying is that the only force in the block is the one due to each other. Then the total moment and will not change. So the case that I consider to a was external force equals zero but center of mass was moving because it had a momentum. Then the claim is that momentum will not change. I'm coming to the last case, which is if you want case to be,

Speaker 5:          00:39:57       yes,

Speaker 1:          00:39:59       external forces are zero, a center of mass was zero. Other words center of mass was addressed.

Speaker 5:          00:40:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       Do you find this different cases complicated than, I don't mind telling you one more time. The center of mass behaves like a single object. Responding to the external force is clear to the external forces. Nonzero central mass will accelerate external forces. Zero central mass will not accelerate their cases. One and two, two and two B are the following. If it does not accelerate, Isabella city will not change. So then you have the two cases. It had a velocity which had maintained audit, had no velocity, in which case it does not even move. See if you apply f equals m a to a body and there is no forces you cannot see the body will be rest, go to the body, will maintain the velocity. So if it had a velocity would go at the velocity. If it was addressed, a little remain at rest. Same goes for the center of mass. If the center of mass was moving, it'll preserve his momentum. That really means the sum of the moment of the individual pieces will be preserved. If it was addressed since the external forces zero it will remain at rest. So I want to look at the consequence of this one.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       I could have done them in either order. I can take the case whether there's no external force, there is no motion art. I can this. I chose to do it the opposite way, but it took the most complicated case, but external forces, not zero. Then I took the case where it is zero, but the central mass was moving to begin with and therefore it has to keep moving no matter what. And the simplest cases, central mass was at rest then is not moving now and it will never move. So let me give an example of where the idea comes into play. We looked at the planetary motion of the sun and the earth and I said the earth goes around the sun. So let's look at it a little later that year and the only force between the earth and the sun is a mutual forcer gravitation. Now my question to you is, is this picture of the sun sitting here and the earth moving around acceptable or not? In view of what I've said, yes.

Speaker 4:          00:42:26       Neutral.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       Yeah, but that's the answer to the problem. But what is wrong if I just say the son remains here in the earth, goes in a circle, which is what we accepted last night.

Speaker 4:          00:42:36       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:42:40       that's certainly, that's one way. Do you understand what he said? He said the momentum of the sun is not changing. The momentum of the earth is changing. So the total momentum is changing, but total momentum cannot change. So that's not acceptable. But in terms of center of mass, you can say something else. Yes, it's moves. Maybe you can tell me, you cannot point out from that, but tell me which way you think it's moving.

Speaker 4:          00:43:07       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       right in the beginning it's somewhere here. A little later there's dead lifts. There's the central mass would do this if the picture that I gave you last time was actually correct. So a son, a finite mass staying at and a planet orbit thing, an owner that is simply not acceptable because the center of mass is moving without external forces that's not allowed. Artists, he said the momentum is constantly changing. This guy has no momentum. That gets a momentum that points this way now and points that we later. But look what I've said here. Take one and two to be the earth and the sun doesn't add up with the same number.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       So we sort of know what the answer should be. We know that the thing that cannot move, it's not the sun and it's not the earth, it's the center of mass. That's what cannot move. If it does, an elite was addressed, it'll remain addressed. So the center of mass, if it cannot move, so let's start off the sun here. Start out. The earth here joined them. The central mass is some bad here. Actually the sun is so much more massive than the earth. The central mass lights inside the sun. But I'm taking another solar system where the sun is a lot bigger than the earth, but not as big as an iPad world. So I can show the central mass here that cannot move. So what that means is a little later, the planet is here and I wanted to keep the center there. The Sun has to be here and somewhat later when the planners, they're, the sun has to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:44:42       So what will happen is the sun will go around on a circle of smaller radius, the planet, and go around on a circle of a bigger radius. Always around the center of mass, so you've got this picture and I was like a Dumbbell, asymmetric big guy here, smaller here, fixed that and turn it. You get a trajectory for the sun and you get it radically for the earth on a bigger circle. Centered remains fixed so you feel played. Loss of gravity. I've given you a homework problem. You've got to be careful of the board. One thing when I played the law of gravity, you may apply to the earth for example. Then you will say the center portal, centripetal acceleration, NV squared over r is the force of gravity. When you do that calculation, be careful be is the velocity of the planet and when you do the MV squared over r, the r you put will be the distance to the center of mass from where you are.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       That'd be the NV squared over R, but when you create that to the force of gravity, it a g m one m two over r squared for that are it is the actual distance from the earth to the sun that you should keep because the force of gravity is a function of the distance between the planets, not between the planet and the center of mass. The actual force on the earth is really coming not from here but on the other side of this where the sun is. But luckily at every instance the sun is constantly pulling it towards the center of the circle. So very clever solution. Planet moves around a circle. It doesn't acceleration to where to center and somebody is providing the force, but there's somebody who's not at the center but always on the other side of the line joining you to the center. So you still experience a force. They were the center under the action of that forest. You can show it, we'll have a circular orbit and you can take some time calculating now relation between time period and radius and whatnot. So this is called the two body problem.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       So this is one example. Where do you realize, hey, central mass, if we follow it, it cannot be moving and therefore the actual motion of planners and more complicated than we thought. Okay, then that is a whole slew of problems. One can do that. The center of mass is not moving. So I'll just give you a couple of examples. Then I will stop, but I won't do the numbers. Here's one example. That is a carriage that contains a horse and the hardest is on this far end. And as they tell us to do, uh, we won't draw the hearts. We just say it's the point mass m and the railway carriage is the big mass, capital m and let's say the left hand of the railway carriage is here.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       You cannot see the horse. Yeah. Horses inside the hearts decides to know is that I've tired of sitting on this side of this room. I'm going to the other side. The hardest goes to the other side. First of all, you will know something's going on without looking in. Because when the hardest moves to the left, the cat, it has to move to the right first. Convince yourself that it has to move somewhere. Because originally the center of mass between these two objects, that one, and that one is something in between. Somewhere here if the heart scan, but that side central mass is now the average of those two, which is some bad over there in central mass is moved and that's not allowed. Central mass cannot move. So if the separate off mass originally on that line, it has to remain in that line. So what will happen in the end is that the horse will come here, the center of the carriage will be that, but the central mass would come out the same way.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       So typical problem you guys will be expected to solve. We look like this, given all these masters and given the length of the carriage, find out how much the caddied moves. So you think you can do that? Uh, give some numbers and plug in the things. For example, this guy is that at a distance, l over to this. The hardest is that it listens. L make this your origin or coordinate. Take the weighted average of those two and get the x coordinate at the center of mass. You don't have to worry about the why because there's nothing happening in the y. So the x coordinate of that and that'll be somewhere here at the end of the day. Let us see it as more than unknown distance d, which is what you're trying to calculate. Recompute the center of mass. When you do that, you remember that the center of the carriage is Ello were two plus d from this origin, the heart system, the distance d from the origin equally the centers of mass, and you will get an equation that the only unknown will be d and You solve for the and you'd tell you, we'll tell you how much it moves.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       Anybody have a question about how you attack this problem? Find the center of mass before, find a central mass after equate them and that linear equation we'll have one unknown, which is the d by which the candidates more than you can solve for. Okay, here's another problem

Speaker 5:          00:50:01       that's uh,

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       here. This is, sure. And here is a boat.

Speaker 5:          00:50:07       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:50:08       Right? Maybe I'm sure the board like a board. Here it is.

Speaker 5:          00:50:14       Okay. That's the book.

Speaker 1:          00:50:17       No, you are here.

Speaker 1:          00:50:23       So the board has a certain mass, which we can pretend this concentrated there you have a little mass m and the board is at a distance, say d from the shore and you are at a certain distance x from the edge of the boat and you want to get out. Okay, you want to go to shore. So what do you do? So if you're superman or superwoman, you just take off and you land where you want. What supplies do you have? Limited jumping capabilities, very natural that you want to come as far to the left as possible. And then John, suppose it is true that d we just say three meters is the maximum you can possibly jump, but as you cannot jump the plastics. So you said, let me go to the end then I'm safe because I can jump the distance. D and again we know that's not going to be, it's not going to work because when you move, look, it's very simple.

Speaker 1:          00:51:23       If you move and nobody else moves, we got a problem because if you found the center of mass with one location for you and you change your location and nothing has changed the central mass, we'll change it. That's not allowed here. I'm assuming that I know how to sort of force this in real life. The water will exert horizontal force, but there's an ignored in this calculation that no horizontal forces, if you move, everything else has to move. So what'll happen is that when you move the board would a move from there, maybe somewhere over to the right leg. This, you are certainly at the edge of the board, but the board has moved a little extra distance delta and you have to find the delta. You find it by the same trick. Find the center of mass of you and the board. Preferably with this as the origin.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       You can use any origin you want for central mass. It's not going that is not going according to anybody, but it's convenient to pick the shortest, your origin point, the way that some of your location in your mass port location and boards mass at the end of the day, put yourself on the left end of the boat and let's say it does more the distance delta. So the deal distance now is deep plus delta. That's what you are. That was l over two is where the center of the borders find the new center of mass and he quit them and you will find how much the board would a mode and that means you have to jump a distance deeply. Plus Delta. Everybody followed that. That's another example of its central Madison move. Now let's ask what happens next. So you leap in the air. Okay, I got add barn. What do you think is happening when you add barn? Yes. Go ahead. What's happening? The book.

Speaker 4:          00:53:14       Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:53:16       It'll be moving. And why do you say it? And we'll be moving?

Speaker 4:          00:53:20       Yeah, cause the center of a mess.

Speaker 1:          00:53:23       There's one way to say that central mass cannot move if you move to the left, the border moved to the right. That's equivalent way to say that.

Speaker 4:          00:53:30       Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       right. Momentum cannot change. Originally momentum. Oh zero nobody was moving. If suddenly you're moving, the board has to move the other way. Of course, it doesn't move at the same velocity or the same speed. Most of the same momentum. So the big game of the both types of small B of the board will equal your small lamp times your Big v. Other words, you, let's say move with the big speed. The board moves with the smallest speed than these two numbers in magnitude would be equal. So they feel, you know, going on one of the big cruise ships you dump on the short, you're not going to notice the movement of the shape of the ship. But it technically speaking, it does move the other way. Okay, you have to add a barn. Okay. Then in a few seconds later, you collapsed on the shore. You're right there. What's happening? The boat. Is it going to stop now your momentum is zero.

Speaker 4:          00:54:24       Yes, yes.

Speaker 1:          00:54:31       Everybody agree? I will repeat that answer but you should all have figured this out. The board will not stop just because you hit the shore. Okay? Bought it. Keep moving because there's no force on the board is going to keep moving. The question is how come I suddenly have momentum in my system when I had no more met them before? It's because the ethics journal has now come into play. Previously it was just you and the boat and you couldn't change your total momentum, but the ground is not pushing you as obviously pushing you to the right because you were flying to the left and you were stopped. So your combine system, you end up board have right word forced acting for the time it took to stop you. It's that momentum that scattered by the boat. Better way to say this is you and the board exchange Momenta you pushed the board of the right, you move to the left and your momentum is killed by the shore. The board, no reason to change. It keeps going so you can calculate. Can you calculate how fast the board is moving? Yeah. Anybody telling me how to calculate how fast the board is moving? Uh, but I am. I am on the shore now fallen on the shore. I'm asking you how fast the boat is moving.

Speaker 4:          00:55:47       Cool.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       Right? I think the, I think I just got the right answer. If I only told you that I jumped and landed on the shore, that's not enough to predict how fast the boat is moving. But if I told you my velocity when I was airborne, then of course I know my momentum and you can find the board momentum and that's the velocity it will retain forever. So you need more information than simply saying I jumped to the shore. It depends with what velocity I left the boat and landed on the ground. If I leave really hard, the boat will go really fast. The opposite.

Speaker 2:          00:56:25       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       okay, that's the end of this family have a central mass problems, so I'm going to do a another class of problems. This in said rocket, I just going to did I have the rocket equation rockets something everybody understand but it's a little more complicated than you think. Everyone knows you blow up a balloon, you let it go, the balloon goes one way. The ad goes the other way. Action and reaction to an equal. Even lay people know that. Odd. If you stand on a frozen lake and you take a gun and you fire something but then the bullet goes one way and you go the opposite way again because of conservation of momentum. The rocket is a little more subtle and I just want to mention a few aspects of it. I don't want to go into the rocket problem in any detail. It's good for you to know how these things have done.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       Here's the rocket whose mass at this instant, this m was. The velocity is v. Right now what rockets do is the emit gases and the gases have certain exhaust velocity. That velocity is called the zero in magnitude is pointing away from the rocket and it has a fixed value relative with the rocket not related to the ground. If you're writing with the rocket and you look at the fumes coming out to the back, they will be leaving you at that speed be not a short time later. What happens short time later, the rocket has a mass m minus Delta because it's lost some of its own body mass in the form of exhaust fumes, exhaust fumes. I'm just showing them as a blob here and the rockets velocity and now is not B but B plus Delta v and what's the velocity of the fumes? Here is where you gotta be careful. Your velocity was V at that instant. The last year of the rocket fuel with the to the ground is B minus v zero. That's the part you got to understand. Rocket has the smaller mass and bigger velocity. Everyone understands that. What? What's the momentum of the gas leaving the rocket if the Mass Delta, but what does its velocity? Its velocity with the specter of the rocket is pointing the left at Vizio, but the rocket itself is going to the right at speed. B. Speed of seen from the ground will be B minus vizio.

Speaker 1:          00:58:57       So the law of conservation of momentum, we'd say m times V is equal to m minus Delta Times v Plus Delta v Let's Delta Times v Minus v zero. This is momentum before and momentum after equal. So you open up this bracket, you get sideways letters better be uniform. This is MV than Minus v dealt, I don't want to call it Delta v I want to call it v Delta Plus Am Delta v Minus Delta planes, Delta B plus Delta v Minus Delta Times v Zero I want to call it be Zero Delta please. And I want to put the belt on the right is you may get confused. Delta usually stands for the change of something so I don't want, that's not what I mean. So you can sell this MV and you cancel this Mv. You cancel this v Delta and that's be delta. This one you ignore because it's the product of two infinite decimals. One is the amount of gas in a small time, Delta t, others infant. As much change in velocity, we keep things with a linear. This then you get the results m times Delta v is equal to v Zero Times Delta.

Speaker 2:          01:00:29       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:00:30       so I'm going to write it as Delta v over B zero is equal to Delta over there. This is the relation between the change in the velocity of the rocket, the velocity of the exhaust gas as seen by the rocket. The I'm on emitted in the small time divided by the mass at that instance, but what in in the sense of calculus, what is the change in the mass of the rocket? If Amazon mass of the rocket, what would you call this? A change the mass of the rocket in this short time.

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:11       Yup. Yup. No, no, no. In terms of the symbol, see at what's the change in the mass of the rocket is Delta, but he's really speaking minus Delta. If you keep track of this sign they change in the variable is really negative and Delta here at Stanford a positive number. So if you remember that you would write this minus d m o m. Well the rest is simple mathematics. I don't want to do this. When if you integrate this side and integrate that I and you know DM over amis a logarithm, you will find the results and you would find that is out that the V at any time is the final going to be initial plus. Maybe I might've saw do this integral here. This integral will be the final might minus v initial over v zero will be the log of an initial over m final so you will find the final, he's v an issue plus v zero log an initial what am fine, I'm doing, it's rather fast because I'm not that interested in following this equation any further. It's not a key question like what I've been talking about now.

Speaker 2:          01:02:37       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:02:37       so this is a show you how we can apply the law of conservation of momentum. I'm not going to hold you responsible in any great detail for the derivation, but that is a formula that tells you the velocity of the rocket at any instant. If you knew the mass at that incident.

Speaker 2:          01:02:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       the rocket will pick up speed and it's mass and keep going down and the log of the mass before to the mass after Times v not is the change in the velocity of the rocket. Okay, so I have to give you some more ammunition to do your homework problems. I'm going to discuss the last and final topic, which is the subject of collisions. So we are going to take the collision of two bodies, one body other than body m One v one m two feet too. They collide at the end of the day. You're going to have the same two bodies moving, get some velocities. The one frame B, two prime. I would go list to find the final velocities. That's a goal of physics. I tell you what's happening now I'm asking you what's happening later. So here, here's one. There are two conditions you need because you're trying to find two unknowns, right? If you want to. Onwards I need two innovations. One equation always true, so let me write that down. Always drew, always true is the condition that the momentum before is the momentum after and One v one prime plus aim two feet to prime.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       You need a second equation to solve for the two unknowns and that's where there are two extreme cases. What are which I can give you the second equation.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       The one extreme case is called totally inelastic in a totally inelastic coalition. The two masses stick together. That means to be one frame and Vitu prime but not too unknown for a single unknown v Prime. Then it's been easy to solve for the momentum because they stick together and move as a unit so you can right here. That is equal to m one m two times that the prime, so you get v Prime is m One v one plus M Two v two or and m one plus m two that's a simple case boot. Things hit stick together and we'll wear the common speed. The common speech should be so that the total momentum like grease what you have before. That's called total inelastic. Other category is called totally elastic.

Speaker 5:          01:05:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       In a totally elastic collision, Kennedy energy is conserved that you can write as a following relation involving quadratic things. M One v one square plus one half and two we have two square is equal to one half m one B one Prime Square. There's one half m to be two prime square. You can, it turns out juggle this equation and that equation and solve for v one prime and B to cry.

Speaker 5:          01:06:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       well I'll tell you what the answer is. I don't expect you to keep solving it. The answer is that the one prime is equal to m one minus m two over m one plus m two Times v One plus two m two four. What am one was him to be too, Lisa? No great secrets. You will find them in any textbook if you cannot follow my handwriting. It running out of time. Yes. What you should be understanding now is that better formula for the final velocity when the coalition historically elastic or totally inelastic. If the total inelastic, it's what I wrote there be one prime miss something. Totally elastic. You have a formula like this one, so here you just to be placed everywhere you saw an m one you put a name to

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       2:00 AM 1:01 AM 1:00 AM to be one. Don't waste too much time writings. I think you can go home and fill in the blanks. It's in all the books. What you carry in your head is there's enough data to solve this because I will tell you the two bodies, I'll tell you [inaudible] I tell you the initial velocities, plugging the numbers, you get the final, the last. Remember this elastic inelastic coalition. This is in one dimension. Now I'll give you a typical problem. Where do you have to be very careful in using the law of conservation of energy? You cannot use the law of conservation of energy in an inelastic collisions. In fact, they ask you to check if two bodies take two bodies identical with opposite velocities, total momentum, a zero they slam, they sit together as a lump. They got no kinetic energy in the end.

Speaker 1:          01:08:00       In the end. At the beginning they had both had kinetic energy. So kinetic energy is not conserved in a totally in Alaska collusion in elastic collision. It is. So here is an example that tells you how to do this carefully. Yes. So this is called the belly dick. So if you have a Bistol, you matter of fact that a pistol, the bullets coming out of the pistol at certain speed and you want to tell the customer what the speed is. How do you find it? Well nowadays we can measure these things phenomenally well with all kinds of fancy techniques down to 10 to the minus 10 seconds. In the old days, this is the trick people had. You go and hang a chunk of wood from the ceiling and then you find the bullets with some Speed v zero and you know its mass. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       The bullet comes ramps into this chunk. So I cannot draw one more picture. So you guys imagine though, will it is embedded in this. I think you also know intuitively the minutes is embedded. The whole thing sets in motion. Now you could put this on a table. Forget all the road. If you can find the speed of the entire combination, then by using conservation of momentum, you can find out the speed of the bullet, but that's hard to measure. People have a much cleverer than idea. You just ram into this thing. This is like a pendulum, so the pendulum raises up. Now put a certain maximum height that you can easily measure and from that maximum height you can calculate the speed of the bullet.

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       So I'm going to conclude by telling you what equations you're allowed to use the two stages to be. Pay attention and then we're done. In the first coalition when the bullet Ram into this block, you cannot use law of conservation of energy. In other words, you might be naive and say, look, I don't care about what, what happened in between. Finally, I got a certain energy m plus M Times v Times eight that's my potential energy. No kinetic. Initially I had minus one half m zero square. I equate these two guys and I found zero. That will be wrong. That's wrong because you cannot use the law of conservation of energy in this process. When I tell you that is a totally inelastic collision in the middle because what will happen to some energy will go into heating up the block. It might even cats fired if the boiler's going too fast, but you can use the law of conservation of momentum momentum all the time in the first coalition to did use that m plus m times some intermediate velocity is the incoming momentum.

Speaker 1:          01:10:33       You understand that from that you can find the Velocity v with which this composite thing, block and bullet, we'll start moving. Once it start moving, it's like a pendulum with initial momentum or energy, it can climb up to the top and convert the potential to candidate candidate candidate. The potential. There is no loss of energy in that process. Therefore, if you extract this velocity and took one half m plus m times, this is the last new square. You may in fact equate that the impalas MGH, so let me summarize this last result. In every collision, no matter what momentum is conserved, energy may or may not be, and if it gives you a problem like this, where in that some funny business going on with this, not energy conserving, don't use energy conservation from start to finish, you use momentum conservation. Find the speed of the composite object. This is what you got understanding. You'd had this not this equation. When can I use conservation of mechanical energy when Kenny not bullet driving into a chunk of wood? You better. No, you cannot use conservation of Kennedy, Ghana, but once the combination is going up, trading candidate for the potential, you can.
