thing you see are our libraries you see

people sometimes don't realize is why it

people sometimes don't realize is why it
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.499
people sometimes don't realize is why it
is we have so many of them and the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
is we have so many of them and the
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.129
is we have so many of them and the
reason is because information is growing

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139
reason is because information is growing
 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.630
reason is because information is growing
so the freedom of information archive is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
so the freedom of information archive is

could begin to aggregate those

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
could begin to aggregate those
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.200

the Columbia libraries because of the
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800
the Columbia libraries because of the
space that it provides and the platform

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
space that it provides and the platform
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.990

that it has provided for all of us to
support these kinds of projects Columbia

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
support these kinds of projects Columbia
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.440
support these kinds of projects Columbia
libraries through projects like the

is showing the way for libraries all
 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.720
is showing the way for libraries all
over the world so it's all the more

over the world so it's all the more
important than that Columbia libraries

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680
important than that Columbia libraries
 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.010
important than that Columbia libraries
and I hope more libraries begin to see

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020
and I hope more libraries begin to see
 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.840
