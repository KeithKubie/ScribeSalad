This episode was proudly
made possible by Subaru.

00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:10.448
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:19.720
You know, a lot of people
lose sleep every night

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.890
because they think the
world is going to hell

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.240
and that things
are getting worse.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.620
And we have a mass media that
operates under the principles--

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.532
if it bleeds, it leads.

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:32.840
And you can understand
why that is the case.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.509
I mean, we have inherited
an amygdala in our brain

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:39.050
which is the part
of the brain that's

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.810
responsible for triggering an
alarm during moment in which we

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.280
have to flee or neutralize
a perceived threat.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.800
This has been
biologically selected

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.470
for because it has helped
us survive over time.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.410
So you can understand why we
are glued to the TV screen

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.290
through the most negative
news and creating

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.780
a sort of
self-amplifying feedback

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.600
loop of doom and gloom.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.950
But again, my friends,
look a little bit closer.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.365
Peek behind the curtain.

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:07.560
And what you actually find
is a lot more reassuring.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740
According to the work
of Steven Pinker, who

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.020
wrote the book, "The Better
Angels of our Demons,"

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.489
and has a viral TED Talk called,
The Myth of Violence, the world

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:18.780
has actually been getting
better for hundreds of years.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.510
Today-- according to
Pinker-- the chances

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.330
of a man dying at the hands of
another man on a global scale

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.865
are the lowest than they've ever
been in the history of mankind.

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:31.740
Listen to that again.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.050
The chances of a man dying
at the hands of another man

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.150
are the lowest that
they've ever been.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.460
Hans Rosling, a statistician
and data visualizer,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.160
has gone viral with a series
of talks-- including a TED

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.650
Talk-- in which he maps
every nation on earth

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.680
by every measurable
indicator of quality of life

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.670
and shows that every
nation is improving.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.300
Even the ones on
the very bottom are

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.495
doing better than
they used to be.

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:55.780
So again, when seen
as a whole, you

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.005
see the man-machine civilization
increasingly leveraging

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:03.819
its tools to address the
grand problems of humanity.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.360
I mean, there was
an article recently

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.120
in The New York Times that
said that the most extreme form

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.962
of poverty around the world
is actually almost eliminated.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:14.336
I mean, I would
have never known.

00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:15.627
This was in The New York Times.

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:16.565
It's unbelievable.

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:19.800
Or a 2010 United Nations
Development essay

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.390
cited by Bill Clinton
and Time Magazine

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.800
in an article titled,
"A Case for Optimism,,"

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.380
in which he says-- forget
about the info-haves

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.205
and the info-nots.

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:31.600
And he cited the cell phone
as the greatest invention

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.540
in history to pull
people out of poverty.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.000
So again, these are just the
numerous amount of examples.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.130
There's infinitely more.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.080
But the world is
on the right track.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.550
It's not utopia, as
Steven Johnson would say,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.172
but it's leaning that way.

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:46.380
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm an optimist.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.247
These are data-driven facts.

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:51.520
