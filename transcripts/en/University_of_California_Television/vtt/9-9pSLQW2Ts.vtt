00:00:01.447 --> 00:00:05.530
(mesmerizing instrumental music)

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.450
- I'm pleased, along
with the Graduate Council

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.360
to welcome Sir John Gurdon
as this year's speaker

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.943
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock lecture series.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.380
As a condition of this bequest
we're obligated and happy

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.880
to tell you how the endowment
came to UC Berkeley,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.670
so at the risk of some
repetition from yesterday,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240
it's a story that exemplifies
the many ways this campus

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.130
is linked to the history of
California and the Bay Area.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.090
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.250
came to San Francisco during the Gold Rush

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.050
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.930
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.780
here at Berkeley, as an expression

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.070
of his long-held interest in education.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.640
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.520
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.960
for her colorful personality
as well as her generosity,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.720
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.440
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.743
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.630
The Hitchcock Fund has become
one of the most cherished

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.940
endowments of the
University of California,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.610
recognizing the highest distinction

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.930
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.420
So thank you Lillie and Charles,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.950
and now I'd like to say a few
words about Sir John Gurdon.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.330
We heard his impressive
list of honors yesterday

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
which included, from our
parochial United States

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.600
point of view, election
as a Foreign Associate

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.420
of the National Academy of
Sciences of the USA in 1980,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.760
but I'd like to highlight some
of his many accomplishments

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.233
that led to this recognition.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.410
Sir John will discuss today

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.120
his important experiments
that demonstrated

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.460
the constancy of the
genome through development.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.420
In these he showed, for
example, that a skin cell

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.727
does not throw away the genes
to become muscle or nerve,

00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:21.900
and so these experiments
showed that the nucleus

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.100
of a specialized cell,
if properly reprogrammed,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.740
could support development
of a whole animal.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.350
This really stressed
the need to understand

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.023
how genes were selectively
used, selectively transcribed.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.130
His experiments using
this cloning in amphibians

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.940
really settled the scientific
question of whether

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.450
different animal cells
have the same genes or not,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.640
and it remained not so
much a scientific question

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.320
but a technological
one of whether the same

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.750
would be true of mammals, but of course,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.823
it took a couple of decades
before this was finally shown.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.193
Following his experiments
in the '60s and early '70s

00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:05.433
on cloning of amphibians,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.530
his work became important
to molecular biologists

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.900
through his demonstration
that purified messenger RNAs

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.700
were very efficiently expressed

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.370
after they'd been injected
into frog oocytes.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.250
This ability to produce correctly

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.260
processed and sorted proteins

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.460
from a very limited
amount of messenger RNA

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.420
was very important in the
early days of biotechnology,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.000
and if one looks at the methods,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.360
actions of some of those
early biotech papers,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.690
you usually find that the
ability to assay and therefore

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.810
to clone these important
genes, such as interferons,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.440
depended on Sir John's
observations that the oocyte,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.450
the spherical test tube as
it's sometimes referred to,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.790
was very effective in
expressing these RNAs.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.980
These experiments with oocytes and eggs

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.820
were extended by Sir John to
study the expression of genes.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.060
With Don Brown, he showed
that purified animal genes,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.020
first the 5S genes, even before
the advent of DNA cloning,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.200
and later protein-coding
genes were correctly expressed

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.200
when injected into
oocytes as purified DNA.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.910
This stressed again that the
signals that control expression

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.053
must be directly encoded
by the DNA sequence.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.970
As we heard yesterday, Sir
John has gone on to study

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.080
the logic of developing embryos,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.030
how signaling factors are distributed

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.170
and interpreted to guide cell fates.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.320
In recent years, he's also
returned, as we shall hear,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.950
to the question of how
proteins in the egg cell

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.733
are able to reprogram specialized nuclei.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.730
As we know, there are
plenty of experiments

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.840
that can be done in biology,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.030
but if one's to discern some
sort of formula for success

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.710
from Sir John's example,
I'd say it's twofold.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.780
First of all, he's directly
involved in the experiments,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.600
working at the bench with a
small group of colleagues.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.090
Secondly, he's got an extraordinary focus

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.460
on what's interesting and important,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.950
and though this may not lead,
as he mentioned yesterday,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.930
to five lectures on the
history of paintbrushes,

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.830
it does lead him to
avoid working on things

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.710
that are feasible but
ultimately not that interesting.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.987
He continually asks
himself and his colleagues,

00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:21.617
"What is the most important
experiment to be done now?",

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:24.277
and also, "What is the most interesting

00:05:24.277 --> 00:05:27.330
"possible outcome from this experiment?".

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.813
Of course, the corollary of the latter

00:05:28.813 --> 00:05:32.323
is that if the best possible
result is not that interesting,

00:05:32.323 --> 00:05:34.010
then one should move on to do something

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.260
that is more interesting.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.230
So it's a tremendous
honor to welcome Sir John

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.468
to give the second of
his Hitchcock lectures.

00:05:42.468 --> 00:05:44.769
(audience applauds)

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:48.170
- So, thank you Richard for
your very kind introduction

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.550
and indeed, thank you
for coming back today,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.570
very robust of you those
who were here yesterday

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.363
to hear the second stage
of this presentation,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.090
and today the computer
seems to be willing to work.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.090
Now this very dim picture

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.510
and it might help to have
the lights down a bit,

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.010
they get better than this,
I should hasten to say,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.950
shows that, I talked
yesterday about how an egg

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.540
makes an embryo, a fetus
and finally an adult

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.690
and so you go from an egg to
a range of specialized cells,

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.173
for example, blood and skin.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.500
And I mentioned that,
in the case of mammals,

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.580
this remarkable option exists

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.780
of taking cells from the early embryo,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.417
and they are called embryonic
stem cells, ES cells,

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:43.930
and they can then be
put back into an embryo,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.930
so you again have a route
to specialized cells

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.733
through that particular variant.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.201
Now today I want to go back again,

00:06:55.201 --> 00:06:57.703
starting from specialized cells,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.150
and this red arrow shows
that we can go right back

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.130
to the beginning again, back to the embryo

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.520
and then follow through
these various routes

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.820
until you, again, get back to the adult

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.950
and this time you have
different kinds of cells,

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.460
for example, muscle and nerve.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.460
So in effect you can derive
these kinds of cells,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.900
muscle and nerve, from
completely different cells

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.400
such as blood or skin,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.560
and that's the sense in which
you go from egg to adult,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.240
and adult back to the embryo again.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.440
And the real point of this,
at the practical level,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.440
is to achieve cell replacement
without immunosuppression,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.260
you know that if you receive
cells from someone else

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.030
you will be unable to
continue to accept those cells

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.640
without immunosuppression which
is a serious disadvantage,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.050
and I'm going to be talking about

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.410
this route in that direction,

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.680
but I should say that these
experiments, like many others,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.940
started with a purely scientific question

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.980
which Richard has clearly annunciated,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.980
that is, whether all cells of
the body have the same genes?

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.200
Now the concept of
replacement is not novel,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.200
and this picture dating from 1495

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.980
shows that there were two
saints, Cosmas and Damian,

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.270
who, if you can hopefully
see it better than I can,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.340
are replacing the leg
of an individual here,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.509
there's the spare leg,
curiously color-coded, and,

00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:41.690
(audience laughs)

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.690
interestingly helped by two
technicians who had wings

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.030
which I hope was helpful
in the particular case.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.620
Unfortunately, this
experiment has not proved

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.620
to be reproducible, and we
have to think of other routes.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.600
Now there are a number of ways round this

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.920
and this is just to tell you

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.160
what the four points I'm
going to try and cover,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.850
I'll be talking a bit about
replacement and regeneration

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.640
versus the remarkable
stability that cells have,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.130
then I'll talk a bit about stem cells

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.170
from adults and embryos,

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.120
then about nuclear reprogramming

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.450
with a view to therapeutic cloning,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.230
and then I'll say at
the end something about

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.283
the ethical concerns that
may exist in this field.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.610
Now these, to some extent,
we get normal replacement

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.580
and these deer have these amazing antlers

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.580
which can actually weigh
as much as 70, 80 pounds

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.660
and they are regrown every year
in a matter of three months,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.010
so there's an extraordinary
ability, in some cases,

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:01.010
for enormous amount of
proliferation and replacement.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.600
And indeed, in ourselves
we replace our blood cells

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.450
at an amazing rate, indeed,
you may be alarmed to hear

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.320
that by the time I finished
you will have destroyed

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.070
something like 100 million blood cells,

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.370
happily they'll be replaced.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.370
But then some of the parts
of our body are not replaced,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.210
for example, the lens your born with

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.290
essentially stays throughout your life,

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:32.100
and other parts of the pancreas
and so on are not replaced,

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.760
so that leads on to the question

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.230
of whether we have an
ability to regenerate

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.300
parts of the body that
have been lost or removed.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.900
Now this particular
question also goes back

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.220
a remarkable time in history,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.610
and this quotation comes from Hesiod

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.713
which was written at about the
time of Homer, about 700 BC,

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.110
and the only bit that we need
to concern ourselves with

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.830
is the bit in yellow and
you'll see that it reads

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.657
that the liver, I can't really
look here, became immortal

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.550
and indeed it grew to the
same extent every night

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.540
as during the day the
long-winged bird, the eagle,

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.160
et that liver.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.730
Now that's a remarkable discovery,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.690
and it happens to be true,
that if liver is removed

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.940
it regrows to the same
extent as the amount lost,

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.870
now how Hesiod discovered that in 750 BC

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.500
is quite obscure to me but it
makes the interesting point

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.180
that that fundamental principle

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.203
somehow seemed to be known at that time.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.280
Excuse me.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.020
Now, moving on a lot, we now know that

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.860
in the particular case of
the salamanders or newts

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.600
there is this remarkable
regenerative ability,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.500
so if you cut the arm
off at the forearm level,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.630
in the course of some days
that will completely regrow,

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.200
as it also will if you cut
it off at the arm level,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.960
it knows how to regrow the same amount,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.960
so that regenerative ability does exist,

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.020
but we have to remember
that when that happens

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.850
there is really no evidence
that the cells which

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.340
replace the missing part have
actually changed in type,

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.770
so when you get new muscle and new bone,

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.583
the almost certain explanation is

00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:46.540
that the new muscle and
bone comes, in fact, from

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:51.540
the preceding muscle and bone
which was already in place,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.160
so there's no change of cell,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.380
in effect, you can only hope
to replace the kind of cell

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.170
that was already present before.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.080
Now the next thing I'm
going to talk about now

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.200
is the stability of cell differentiation,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.810
and we're asking the question of whether

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.810
cells can change their
state of differentiation.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.930
Now the only really good test of this

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.850
is to take one single cell

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.850
and to transplant it into
the wrong environment,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.320
you put the cell in among other cells

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.060
that are not of its own kind,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.050
and that's because many
experiments in this field

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.960
have involved moving
whole pieces of tissue,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.400
large groups of cells, to
another site, and of course,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.720
those cells are largely
surrounded by their own kind,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.300
and so you don't really test whether

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.610
a cell is stable in its differentiation

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.550
because it may mean that
it simply goes on doing

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.830
what it was doing in the first place

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.460
because it's surrounded by similar cells.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.600
So you need a different kind of test

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.150
and this is the one that
I think is compelling.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.720
So in this experiment,
there's an early embryo

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.120
and the red bit indicates cells

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.340
which were destined to become muscle,

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.210
they hadn't become muscle at that point

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.600
but that's what they were
going to do in development

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.550
if they'd been left there.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.430
So these cells are taken out

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.780
and separated into single
cells, and one single cell

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.500
is then implanted into
another part of the embryo,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.353
in fact, the bit that's
going to form the gut.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:40.190
Now when you grow that up,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.150
and in this case it forms
an amphibian tadpole,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.490
this cell now finds itself

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.820
still as a single cell inside the gut,

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.930
and the question is, what
does it do about that,

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.263
does it change its mind or does it not?

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.770
And the result is that it does not,

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.910
and this is the actual experiment,

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.960
that is the implanted cell,
you can barely see it but

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.940
it's labeled with a fluorescent
marker so you can follow it,

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.030
and this is the cells
that normally form muscle

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.093
with an antibody marker, and
there is that single cell,

00:15:15.043 --> 00:15:18.610
the cell that had intended
to become a muscle cell,

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.230
and indeed, it still
does become a muscle cell

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.400
even though it is still
sitting inside the gut.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.100
And this makes the important point

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.100
that these cells take a decision
remarkable early in life,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.270
really within a day of development,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.670
as to what they're going to become

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.040
and even though they haven't become,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.130
they haven't followed that route yet,

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.476
they know what they're going to become

00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:46.090
and they won't change their
mind, and generally speaking,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.230
that is true of differentiated cells,

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.060
cells on the pathway to differentiation,

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.010
they simply will not change
their mind to a different fate

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:00.620
as long as you keep the whole cell intact.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.400
And there are other
experiments of this sort

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.423
that show that even earlier
than in this experiment,

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.733
cells have made up their
mind and won't change fate.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.230
Now one explanation for
that is the following,

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.010
and that would be that,
in this diagram of a cell,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.740
the nucleus expresses genes

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.460
and the messenger RNA
goes into the cytoplasm,

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.490
makes protein, and some of that protein

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:31.420
goes back into the nucleus
and reprograms that genome

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.980
to express the same genes,

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.580
so when this cell divides
into two daughters

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.580
this cyclic reprogramming
ensures that the cells continue

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:47.260
to follow the program that
they have already embarked on,

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.760
that's the simple way of explaining

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.630
why it is that cells enter a pathway

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:59.323
and are extremely reluctant
to change their mind.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.700
We'll come back to that in a minute,

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.320
but I now want to turn to
this question of stem cells

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.293
in both adults and in embryos.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.150
Of course, what we'd like
to do is to get stem cells

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:22.150
out of our various tissues
and use them for replacement,

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.760
but they're actually very hard to find,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.430
and I should just explain quickly

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.400
what we mean by a stem cell.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.120
So here is a cell, and
a stem cell is defined

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.470
as one which can do two things,

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:40.190
it can either reproduce itself,
go on continually dividing,

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.170
making more cells of its own kind,

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.560
or it can enter a differentiation pathway,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.680
so in this case it divides
and one of the daughters

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.090
follows the differentiation pathway,

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.340
becoming, for example, a
nerve cell or muscle cell,

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.900
the other one remains a stem cell,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.420
and in the course of time
that one will divide again

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.060
and one of its daughters
will go off and specialize

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.190
and the other one remain a stem cell,

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.063
so that's what we really
mean by a stem cell.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.650
Now people have been looking
very hard for these stem cells,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.160
and I show this quite complicated
picture from Elaine Fuchs

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.160
where she was looking for
stem cells that recreate skin,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.330
our skin reproduces pretty well,

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.810
and the point of it is
that the actual stem cells

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.650
are essentially
indistinguishable from others,

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.170
tucked away in a little corner,
almost impossible to find

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.820
unless you use a battery of markers,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.200
and only with great difficulty
can one identify them at all,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.940
and even if you have, to get
them out is more difficult,

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.960
and even when you have,
they almost never seem

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.933
to change fate and become
something entirely different,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.313
so that's one of the
problems of stem cells.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.427
Now there's an interesting experiment

00:18:59.427 --> 00:19:03.410
I'm going to mention now by Helen Blau

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:08.080
where, what was done in this
case was to take patients,

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.620
human patients, which were suffering

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.940
from a hematological disorder, cancer,

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.940
and to try to alleviate their condition

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:24.040
they gave them bone marrow grafts,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.990
and in some cases the bone marrow cells

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:31.150
were taken from males rather than females.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.900
In the course of time,
these patients passed on

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.090
and they were able to
look at the brain cells,

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.610
in particular, these Purkinje cells

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.410
which are rather recognizable,
and they could tell whether

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.143
derivatives of the bone
marrow had entered the brain.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.400
In fact, that happened,
though not frequently,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.620
in fact, they scored some
tens of thousands of cells

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.820
and I think they found four which showed

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.080
derivatives of the bone
marrow in the brain,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.831
and this was shown by using markers,

00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:12.650
the green arrow up there
points to a little spot,

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.930
and that is an indication of genes

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.740
which are on the Y chromosome

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.460
and they're from the male contributor,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.190
the red one is the female chromosome.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.810
It showed that, in some
cases, bone marrow cells

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:33.520
could actually contribute and
become part of brain cells,

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.570
and that's remarkable,
one has to say however,

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.520
that it was an extremely
rare event, and in fact,

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.500
this was a fusion and it
doesn't actually tell you

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:50.480
that the bone marrow cell was
making any useful contribution

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.280
to the Purkinje cell of the brain,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.050
it could be that it fused there

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.590
and the Purkinje cell didn't
mind, it just accepted this

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.930
and without really making
any difference to it.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.140
So that argues that this kind of idea

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.240
of bone marrow stem cells may exist

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.890
and there may be cells in the bone marrow

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.880
which can follow a whole
range of different options,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.460
but it has yet to be shown

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.400
that this would really be a useful route

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.253
and that it would be in any
way therapeutically useful.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.240
Well now we move on to
embryonic stem cells,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.070
and this is a remarkable field,

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:41.070
and it started with people,
Stevens and Pierce discovering

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.950
that there are things
called teratocarcinomas,

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.950
these are really cancers
which proliferate extensively

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:54.830
and they often form a whole
chaotic range of cell types,

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.110
you can see, can hardly read it from here

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.940
but there you can see, I think,
on the picture, hopefully,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.940
that erythrocytes blood is
formed, keratinocytes, top right,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.070
connective tissue, cartilage, bone,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.960
a whole range of cell types
really chaotically arranged.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.570
Now the remarkable thing about those cells

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.570
is that they could be
transplanted into hosts,

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:24.010
and in some cases, they
made perfectly normal cells,

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.750
they even gave up their
cancerous condition.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.110
Now that was the background
to remarkable experiments

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:36.110
of Martin Evans in 1981
when he really discovered

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.280
that you can do the following experiment.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.033
You start with a mouse
embryo making the early,

00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:48.790
there's the zygote, the fertilized egg

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.210
and then it makes the blastocyst,

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.090
it's a bunch of about 200 cells containing

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:59.323
the future embryo ones
called inner cell mass there,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.640
of course, if you leave
the embryo it will make

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640
whatever it would, mice or humans,

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.640
and you can take these cells
and put them in culture

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.830
where, amazingly, they go on
growing almost indefinitely.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.190
And then what you can
do is take these cells

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:21.400
and implant them into a host
embryo, another kind of embryo,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.100
when they will differentiate
into the whole range of cells,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.770
every cell you can imagine,

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.370
it's a truly remarkable
phenomenon and to this day,

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.910
we really do not know what
these embryonic stem cells

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.810
really are in a mouse,

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.550
there's no evidence that a
mouse has any such cells,

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.120
nevertheless, when you
take these cells out,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.480
they will grow in culture

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.360
and they have this really
extraordinary ability

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.050
to differentiate into many directions,

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.800
really a kind of ideal stem cell.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.310
And in recent years this
has now been done in humans,

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.180
this is a human embryo, the
blastocyst and inner cell mass

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.300
and you can, with some difficulty,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.050
people have been able
to grow these in culture

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:10.400
and some of them will
remain undifferentiated,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.560
and other ones will begin to differentiate

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.580
in different directions.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.660
Now this is potentially
a very valuable method,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.850
and a huge amount of work
is being done at the moment

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.900
to try to find ways of getting

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.630
a homogenous differentiation
of these cells,

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.900
they tend, again, to make
a rather chaotic collection

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.400
of different kinds of cells,

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.340
so I'm not going to pursue that,

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.900
except to just summarize these points.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.500
So these embryonic stem cells

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.940
have many remarkable advantages,

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:47.940
they have a capacity for almost
indefinite proliferation,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.200
they have multipotent differentiation,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.220
you can make them into
everything including germ cells,

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.170
and you can freeze the stocks.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.590
Now the disadvantages
seem to be the following,

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.760
they do tend to undergo genetic changes,

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.470
those who work with them
will realize that after time,

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.840
the stock has undergone various changes

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.880
so they don't really remain

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.603
exactly how they were in the first place.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.050
It's hard to make them
make some cell types,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.130
notably things like pancreas,
it's extremely difficult

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.920
to get them to go in that direction,

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.680
they go very easily into
the nerve direction,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.450
neural direction.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.530
And lastly, if all this works perfectly,

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.930
there is still the problem
of immunorejection,

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.150
and what that means is
that when you hope to

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.250
give a patient cells of this kind,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.850
they will be rejected by the
normal rejection mechanism

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.200
unless the patient is immunosuppressed.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.220
Now that's not a good thing
to be if you can avoid it

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.300
because you get all the
infections that are around,

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.965
and as a matter of fact
it considerably increases

00:25:56.965 --> 00:26:01.090
the probability of these
cells becoming cancerous,

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.660
so that's not an ideal route

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.237
but no doubt one that will be followed

00:26:06.237 --> 00:26:10.303
and will turn out to be
progressively, I think, very useful.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:15.040
But I would like to now
follow the other route

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.550
that we particularly are interested in,

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:22.550
and that's to do with
nuclear reprogramming

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.630
and therapeutic cloning, as we call it.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:31.630
So, first of all, what is
the question we're asking?

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.660
And what we're trying to ask is whether,

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.680
we say, can we make
rejuvenated embryonic cells

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.680
from adult cells, and I
mean, of the same individual?

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.700
Now if you could do that,
you would avoid the need,

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.980
I'm sorry about the spelling,

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.900
it says immunosuppression not
needed, it should have said,

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.610
means you would avoid that
because if you can have

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:59.050
embryonic cells of your
own genetic constitution

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.163
you would not have to be immunosuppressed.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.810
And the principle of this route

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.080
is the nuclear transfer route

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.330
which has been mentioned by Richard,

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.140
and the idea is the following.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.980
That you start with an egg,
and I'm going for a while

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.330
to talk about frog eggs
where this all started,

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.600
but the principles are the
same for mice and humans,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.310
so you start with this egg

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.940
and you actually use
ultraviolet irradiation

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.180
to kill the female pronucleus,
the egg chromosome,

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.170
so it's cytoplasm with no nucleus,

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:41.170
and then you pick up a
single cell in a micropipette

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.750
in such a way that the cell wall is broken

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.960
but the nucleus is not damaged,

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.150
and then you inject that broken cell,

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.130
but with a protected
nucleus into this egg,

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.980
where it essentially substitutes
for the egg and the sperm

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.870
that normally enter that egg,

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.483
and then you get a ball of
cells and eventually an adult.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.950
Now, this is the principle of cloning

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.550
because each time you do that,

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.360
you start with the nucleus
of a cell from an individual

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.800
and you get a whole range of individuals

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.693
which are genetically identical,
cloning as it's now called.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.060
This is not itself a novel situation

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.190
and this picture, which
may seem wholly irrelevant,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.070
is actually a picture of a forest

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.590
with bracken growing
throughout this forest,

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.490
and you may or may not
know that bracken in forest

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.490
is essentially one plant,

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:43.000
it's all been produced vegetatively so

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.093
actually every bit of this
bracken is all part of a clone.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.300
But in animals that doesn't work,

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.720
and we have to follow this
other route that I've mentioned

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.980
where you have to be rather careful

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.980
in taking up a cell into
a special micropipette,

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.560
this has been specially
forged under the microscope

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.570
with an exceedingly sharp hypodermic tip

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.220
and a smooth orifice there
for the cell to go in

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.830
because you have to break the cell wall

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.470
but definitely not disturb
the nucleus inside the cell,

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.610
and part of the skill is to
make these special instruments,

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.820
which of course is all
done under a microscope

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.820
and then to inject the nucleus
into the cell in such a way

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.630
that you don't damage the egg

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.350
and hence the reason for this sharp point.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.600
So there is the pipette

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.780
and it's just grabbed hold of the cell

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.300
and it's going to, it's a
very old film or video indeed

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.570
so I apologize for the condition,

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.320
if you watch very carefully,

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.100
you'll see something move up there,

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.320
we'll see it later better,
that in fact is a bubble of air

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.660
which you have to put in the
micropipette in order to decide

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.873
when the cell at the end has
been injected into the egg,

00:29:57.873 --> 00:30:00.730
of course, the inside of
the egg is also invisible

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.030
because of the pigmentation.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.510
So this egg has now received
the transplanted nucleus

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:10.280
and in a moment it will start
dividing into a two-cell,

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.700
in real life, that takes
about an hour and a half,

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.620
and here we see a sample of them,

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.230
now that one's going pretty well,

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.380
that's got a two-cell, as has that,

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.140
and that's just now gone
into the four-cell stage.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.650
These ones didn't work
and that does happen

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.550
in a certain number of cases for reasons

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.230
we don't understand, it just doesn't work.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.160
Now that one's getting on quite well,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.370
it's a good eight-cell,

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.570
and I think in a moment we'll
take a look at one such one,

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:41.700
here is one of this kind,
it's beginning to divide,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.520
and these divisions
occur rather frequently,

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.760
about every half hour in this species,

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.360
much slower in mice and humans.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.570
Now in this case you get a typical result

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.620
where the cells on one side
are dividing very well,

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.700
in fact, if you look very carefully

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.220
you'll probably see there's a,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.450
this wave of division
starts at about that point,

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.711
it'll suddenly send a wave of
division through the embryo

00:31:04.711 --> 00:31:06.630
and then it'll wait about half an hour,

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:07.879
and then another one will start

00:31:07.879 --> 00:31:11.480
and go right through the
embryo making these cells,

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.010
essentially dividing the embryo
into large numbers of cells.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.556
Now you'll notice that in this case

00:31:16.556 --> 00:31:18.483
there is no such division,

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.170
that's a very common result
of transplanting nuclei

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:27.593
from specialized tissues where
they weren't ready to divide.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:31.470
What you then do is to take
these cells, the good cells,

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.976
separate them again, and we'll
see this happen in a moment

00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:37.037
and then you retransplant and here we are,

00:31:37.037 --> 00:31:39.890
there's the pipette, that's
the air bubble marker,

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.280
this broken cell has gone in the end,

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.610
this will now go into an egg,

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.340
and we may see the
bubble marker move down,

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.910
I think it's going to do it
in a moment, there it goes,

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:54.190
and pushing the nucleus,
you hope, inside the egg

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:58.110
which will then now be able
to divide completely normally,

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.620
that's a perfectly good four-cell embryo,

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:05.160
and it will divide just about
as well as normal embryos do,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.670
partly because the nucleus has now been,

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:13.120
to some extent, rejuvenated
and brought back to thinking

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.891
that it's a nucleus of a
normal embryo in its cell.

00:32:17.891 --> 00:32:20.740
So that's how these things work

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.130
and we may wait for just a moment or two

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.520
to see this division going on,

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.870
these cells dividing very fast,

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.230
again, there's a wave of
mitosis starting at one end

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.020
and working through the embryo.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.010
Now this one is completely divided,

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.680
all the cells are dividing in unison,

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.010
and that's the kind of one

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.760
which will normally make a
perfectly normal individual,

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.970
it's got a few thousand
cells at this point,

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.730
so that's how the thing works.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:51.470
Now, just going quickly over the history,

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.157
Briggs and King first
did these experiments

00:32:53.157 --> 00:32:57.910
and they found that by the
fairly early embryonic stage

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.210
they got no normal development.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.360
We happen to use Xenopus where,

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.900
although the success rate
goes down, you do, in fact,

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:09.300
get a number of embryos going
through entirely normally

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.190
and this was, I was lucky enough

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.900
to get this in as a graduate student,

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.600
the first entirely normal adult animal

00:33:17.719 --> 00:33:19.710
in the vertebrates obtained by cloning,

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.980
so this was taken from a gut cell nucleus

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.253
and it makes this frog which was,

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.560
actually lived to 20 years,
pretty good for frogs,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.380
and it laid eggs and everything else,

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.480
and you can make clones this way.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.387
This is an albino donor,
that's to say, embryo

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.510
that had the white pigmentation,
was used to supply nuclei

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.500
and that's why all these clonal progeny,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.680
which are males and
therefore small, are white,

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.940
even though they have come
from eggs of the dark female

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.870
so that's the basic idea of cloning.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:59.580
Now let me quickly go through the issue

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.610
of whether this still works
for specialized cells,

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.980
here is a tadpole with muscle,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.310
and you can take a single muscle cell out,

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.670
that's the nucleus, this is a muscle fiber

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:12.210
going right the way
down through that cell,

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.560
transplant that nucleus to eggs

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.760
and you get, essentially, normal tadpoles,

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.140
here's one from the nuclear transplant,

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.410
that from the control, and
when you look, for example,

00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:25.100
at the eye of such a
nuclear transplant tadpole

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.330
it's actually entirely
normal, lens, retina,

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:33.140
but all these cells have a
nucleus that was originally part,

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.920
in this particular case,
of an intestine cell,

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.513
so the reprogramming does happen.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.430
The success rate is quite small,

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:46.980
to get normal adult
fertile frogs, about 1%,

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.460
many of them form these partial embryos

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.050
of just the kind that
we've seen on that video.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.560
Now you can use those, here's one,

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.610
you can take cells from this part directly

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.810
and graft them into a host,

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.833
like we might do for
cell rescue experiments,

00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:06.300
there's the graft,
happens to be GFP-labeled,

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.870
and here are now the green cells

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.960
derived from the intestine nucleus

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.940
that are parts of perfectly normal muscle,

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.550
each one of those is a normal muscle cell,

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:20.450
derived however, from the
nucleus of an intestine cell.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.874
So that procedure works
rather well, you'll get,

00:35:23.874 --> 00:35:26.460
so for example, if you
start with intestine

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.010
you can get muscle and nerve
by these various maneuvers

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.800
in something like 30% of the cases.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.750
And the main point I
need to make now is that,

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:41.260
as I said at the beginning,
when you transfer whole cells

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.580
from one part of an embryo to another,

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:48.580
there is no possibility whatever
of getting a reprogramming

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.260
or switch from, say,
intestine to muscle or nerve,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.050
but once you take the
nucleus out of that cell,

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.050
then by nuclear transfer you
get something like 35% of them

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:04.720
will switch fate completely
to this new direction.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.550
So that's the principle
of nuclear transfer,

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.830
and the conclusion is that the nuclei

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.243
of some differentiated
cells are totipotent,

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.770
you can get fertile adults, for example,

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.500
from the nuclei of intestine cells,

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.290
functional muscle and nerve from intestine

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:25.760
comes with a relatively high
frequency of about a third,

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.660
and the fundamental point is that there is

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.430
a conservation of the genome
during cell differentiation,

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.000
indeed if that weren't so,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.383
the whole idea of cloning could not apply.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.640
And now finally, as was mentioned,

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.360
this has been done in mammals

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.993
with the famous Dolly the sheep,

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.230
this works remarkably
well and refinements,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.670
particularly by the Jaenisch
lab have actually been able

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:55.970
to go through with a
genetically deficient mouse,

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.390
do, through nuclear
transfer, gene correction

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.680
and finally rescue the
animal by this route,

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.390
so it's really a considerable
achievement and shows,

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:07.093
I think, the future direction
for this kind of work.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:13.202
So the conclusions so far

00:37:13.202 --> 00:37:17.040
are that some transplanted
somatic cell nuclei,

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.053
I'm sorry, I can see what's happened,

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.940
I'm just going to go back a step now,

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.010
let me just take a couple
of minutes on this point,

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.200
it's a slightly complicated point

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.150
which I'm only going to
spend two or three minutes on

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.720
and a number of people
will not follow this but,

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.270
for the connoisseurs,
they might be interested.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.810
The curious recent discovery is this,

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:42.140
that if you start with nuclei
from the specialized cell,

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.530
transplant the nucleus

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.840
and take them into the wrong germline,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.800
like the intestine to neuroectoderm,

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.470
about half of the nuclei
actually show a memory

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.750
of the gene expression they had before,

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:59.560
likewise if you start with
the neuroectoderm nuclei,

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.600
transplant them with several divisions

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.580
and take them into the endoderm,

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.610
most of them, nevertheless remember that

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.210
they were originally going
to be neuroectoderm cells

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:13.930
and they express such a marker,
it's a surprising result,

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:15.620
and indeed, you can carry that on for

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.020
a whole another generation,
so that for 30-cell divisions,

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.550
some nuclei remember their fate.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.100
And so the conclusion from this

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.380
is that some transplanted
somatic cell nuclei

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.360
show a long term memory
of an active gene state,

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.590
and this may account for some cases

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.800
of abnormal embryo development,

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.520
because we do need to explain why it is

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.150
that only about a third of
these nuclear transfers work

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:46.150
and that seems to be one
important explanation for that.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.330
We don't know the basis of
this remarkable phenomenon

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.330
but it may well have to do
with the epigenetic marks

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:58.740
placed on cells such as the
association of histone H3.3

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.180
being amazingly persistent.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.890
So that little commentary on the side

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.300
leads me to the last
part of the talk where

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.973
I want to talk about mechanisms
of nuclear reprogramming.

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:14.250
Now the reason we want to know about this

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:17.030
is that in the far distant future,

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.240
I'm sure long after my time,

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.200
it should, in principle, be
possible to take a skin cell

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.310
and to overexpress, in that cell,

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:31.450
those genes which are needed
to reprogram that cell

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.440
back to an embryonic condition

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.220
without even having to go through an egg,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:40.190
that's the long term aim,
but in order to achieve that

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.830
we have to know what are the mechanisms

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:46.080
by which these nuclei are reprogrammed

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.343
once you take them out
and put them into an egg?

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.750
So I'm going to talk briefly now

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.770
about the cells that we call oocytes,

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.140
these are the forming
egg cells from the ovary,

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:03.330
and they contain an amazing
structure, which is this,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:08.330
inside that cell and it's
called a germinal vesicle,

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.810
and it's a very specialized nucleus

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.360
containing a large amount of material

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.363
which is needed by the
embryo for development.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.610
Now these cells contain
amazing chromosomes

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.000
called lampbrush chromosomes,
the most transcripts

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.130
in the active chromosome
that's ever been discovered,

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.430
huge number of genes are
transcribed enormously fast,

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:37.430
so these oocytes are used
to get a direct switch

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.210
of a nucleus from one kind
of gene expression to another

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.680
without any replication or
cell division in between,

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.710
it's a very kind of ideal
cell in which to observe

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.890
and hence analyze this remarkable switch

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.703
or reprogramming of gene expression.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.230
And I would say there are three things

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:00.240
we need to do to understand
this, eventually,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.810
one is the reversal of epigenetic changes,

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.250
I'll mention that in a moment,

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:09.240
we have to understand the
supply of transcription factors,

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.510
and what I call chromatin decondensation

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:17.483
which has to do with making
these genes accessible.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.050
Now, we found out recently that

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:25.390
you can take mouse fibers out of nuclei,

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.550
put them into the oocytes

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:30.100
and you turn on this stem
cell gene called Oct4,

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.050
it's a very important
gene for making stem cells

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.070
behave as such, so you can see the genes

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.915
strongly activated a
few days after transfer.

00:41:37.915 --> 00:41:41.210
The gene that these cells had
on before is extinguished,

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.020
that's inherited message,

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:47.080
and so it means that you
can, slightly surprisingly,

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:52.080
use frog oocytes to
reprogram mammalian nuclei,

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.880
that's an extremely useful thing

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.273
because of the huge abundance
of these frog materials.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.760
Now, looking at just
going quickly over this,

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.710
one direction is that we find
that one of the key events

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:10.540
is this removal of the methylation state,

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.650
the mark in these
specialized simus nuclei,

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.640
this particular diagram
connoisseurs would appreciate

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.170
shows the removal of methyl groups

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.088
from the promoter region of Oct4,

00:42:22.088 --> 00:42:25.220
it's a very important step
in this reprogramming.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.280
This happens, oocytes can do it,

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.910
and most other cells,
very few other cells can,

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:32.880
and we're really trying
very hard to find out

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.310
what is the mechanism in the molecules

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:39.623
that reverse the process
of this specialization?

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:45.610
Step two involves the recognition
of transcription factors

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.080
and this rather complicated diagram shows

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.240
the bit of the Oct4 gene,
the promoter region,

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.640
to which a number of
proteins are known to bind.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.310
Now this, because of the huge
amount of material available,

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:02.370
you can hope to find proteins that bind

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:06.120
to these regions of that promoter gene,

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.220
and in making this point I should say that

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:13.600
we have something like
a million-fold advantage

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.350
in using frog material rather
than mouse, or even worse,

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:22.250
human material to find out how
these genes are reprogrammed,

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:27.250
and that's because one frog
egg is 4,000 times bigger

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:29.200
than a mouse or human egg,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:34.200
and one frog contains 25,000 such oocytes,

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.400
so it's a great thing and
I'll mention this again,

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.287
to choose your material
favorably, that's that root.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.420
And lastly, this thing of decondensation

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:52.230
is rather remarkable, these
are actually mammalian nuclei

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.940
inside this germinal
vesicle of the oocyte,

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.950
and you will see that these enlarge,

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.420
that they've gone from a small thing

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.150
to this really large inflated object,

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:07.790
about a 10 to 20-fold expansion,

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:12.450
and that is probably critical
in enabling the genes needed

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.900
for the turning on of these
stem cell marker genes,

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.410
the reprogramming, to actually work.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.930
We have to try to find out what that is,

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:25.730
and one way of doing this is to find

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.120
that if you take the
proteins off these nuclei

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.670
before you transplant them,

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.970
you accelerate the rate of reprogramming,

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:36.487
leading possibly to a way of finding out

00:44:36.487 --> 00:44:41.487
how to identify the
reprogramming components.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:45.220
So that's really all I want to say on the,

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.360
what you might say, the scientific side,

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.150
but I've left myself,
I hope, a few minutes

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:54.850
to touch on this question
of what we call ethics.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:58.310
Now, you'll know that there are objections

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:01.130
to what science can do by some people,

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:02.600
and I've been quite interested

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.450
in talking to a number of people,

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:10.450
particularly religious people,
people in the priesthood,

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.450
about this whole issue
because I'm interested

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.610
in why they should think, if they do,

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:19.420
that science isn't the best way forward,

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.540
and as far as I can diagnose,
there are five reasons

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.427
why people have reservations
about this work,

00:45:25.427 --> 00:45:26.920
and these are the five.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.370
So one of them says, it's what I call

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:33.527
the thin end of the wedge
argument, and they say,

00:45:33.527 --> 00:45:36.827
"Well, we don't mind
your putting mouse nuclei

00:45:36.827 --> 00:45:38.997
"into frog oocytes, who worries about that

00:45:38.997 --> 00:45:42.557
"but what next will you
do, and so we better

00:45:42.557 --> 00:45:46.040
"stop this thing quickly
before it gets out of hand".

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.600
I find that a somewhat
unconvincing argument

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.093
because, for example, if you
really wanted to save lives

00:45:53.093 --> 00:45:56.530
you would ban all transport,
all cars and transportation

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:00.130
but we don't choose to do
that, there's always an element

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.290
of disadvantage to most advantages,

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.840
so I'm not persuaded by
that type of argument,

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.513
a rather tiresome one because
it's not very specific.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:11.810
The second argument is, the
whole thing is unnatural,

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:13.860
well of course, that's
not a very good argument

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.710
because nearly everybody
will use antibiotics,

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.040
which are themselves unnatural and so,

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.920
if you're really going to
object to this kind of work

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:26.763
on that ground, you should
not use antibiotics.

00:46:27.648 --> 00:46:29.310
Third argument I've heard

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.803
is that God intends humans to suffer,

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:37.620
now that's an interesting thought
but if you read the Bible,

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.310
you will observe that there
are a number of stories

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.070
which are miracles, now to me,

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:48.830
the bottom line of a miracle
is to relieve suffering,

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.270
they all seem to come out that way,

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:52.110
people get better, not worse,

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.240
and so I would say that
that's not what God intends,

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.573
at least as adjudged from the Bible.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.290
Fourth reason is the
killing of a potential life

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:04.280
and I think that's one that
is particularly prevalent

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:10.690
among people who object, now
their argument runs as follows.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.200
They will say that if
you take, for example,

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.830
the nucleus of a skin cell of you or me

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:21.490
and put that into an enucleated egg,

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:25.130
you will obtain an embryo,
and indeed you will.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.380
They say that is now a
potential human being

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.780
and you should not be killing
that potential human being

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.260
in order to make life a bit better

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.410
for yourself, is for yourselves,

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:41.423
that seems to be the
essence of the argument.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.430
I find that an inappropriate argument

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:46.940
for the following reason,

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:51.830
that when you have mammalian
embryos, mouse or human,

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:55.950
there is in my view no
possibility whatever

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.060
that they can form an individual,

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:01.550
and that's because of the
process of implantation.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.920
Embryos which can be made,
they'll develop quite well

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.870
in a test tube but unless
they are implanted,

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:11.200
there is absolutely no
possibility, to my knowledge,

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.460
that they could ever
progress beyond that stage,

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.760
and therefore the argument
is that these early embryos

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.230
are not, in fact, potential human beings

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:26.230
in any sense at all, so I would
disagree with that argument.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:28.840
And the last argument I heard was this,

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.457
which was, again, rather
surprising to me, people said,

00:48:32.457 --> 00:48:33.867
"Well it's good for us to see

00:48:33.867 --> 00:48:37.590
"how others tolerate
suffering", in my view,

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:41.230
a rather selfish view because
they're saying we admire,

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.700
as one does, people who put
up with great discomfort,

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.050
they themselves not
having that discomfort,

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.740
and therefore if we
cured all these problems,

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.060
we wouldn't have the benefit of seeing

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.190
how people put up with these things,

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.440
slightly surprisingly
that came from someone

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.620
in the priesthood so, that
was that level of argument.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.390
Well, as you can see, I'm
pretty biased on these things

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:07.833
but I, I thought I'd not
like to miss the opportunity

00:49:07.833 --> 00:49:11.060
of making these points.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:16.060
So that's what I wanted to
say on the ethical side,

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:21.577
but let me finish with one comment

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.830
and I don't know whether we could have

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:24.910
the lights up for a moment,

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.683
it would be easier if I
can see who I'm talking to.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:33.180
You may, people often say to me,

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.810
I feel I'm not heard without this thing,

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:38.050
people often say to me,
"Why do you use frogs?",

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.977
I've talked about frogs a lot and,

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:44.727
"Why don't you do all these
experiments with humans

00:49:44.727 --> 00:49:47.027
"or if not humans, at least mice,

00:49:47.027 --> 00:49:50.260
"this is a completely
inappropriate way forward".

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:55.260
Now my view is that science
has progressed very largely

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.800
by people choosing the right material,

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:03.800
and I was very impressed
when I read the account

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:08.190
by Levi-Montalcini and
Cohen of their discovery

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:10.840
of growth factors, the nerve growth factor

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.980
and you may or may not know this story

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.280
but it's something like this.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.350
They discovered that there is material

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:21.500
which makes nerves grow
extraordinarily actively

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:26.100
in Hamburger's lab a long time
ago, and so they pursued this

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:31.100
and finally they obtained
an extract of material

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:37.110
which had some nerve
growth-promoting activity.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.220
So Cohen decided, very logically,

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.430
that he must find out
what is in this extract,

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.640
so he thought well, the first thing to do

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.680
is to see if it contains nucleic acid,

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.200
so we will remove the nucleic acid.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.830
Now, in those days, a long time ago,

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:56.370
one way to do that was
to make use of a thing

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.960
called snake venom phosphodiesterase,

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.010
so he did the logical experiment

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.470
and added the phosphodiesterase,

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:07.290
thinking this might destroy the extract,

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.590
actually what it did
was to make the extract

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:11.620
enormously more active,

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.140
completely what he wouldn't have expected.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.167
Now, many would have said,

00:51:14.167 --> 00:51:16.900
"Well, that's a bad
experiment, forget that",

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.807
but he then said, "Well that's amazing,

00:51:18.807 --> 00:51:22.697
"it must mean there's something
in the extract other than

00:51:22.697 --> 00:51:26.340
"its DNA destroying activity
which is important",

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.670
so he thought, where do I get this from?

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.770
Now, this came from snake venom,

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:35.000
not an easy source of material to collect,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.987
bucket loads of snake venom,
so he then logically said,

00:51:38.987 --> 00:51:43.360
"Well, what is the snake
venom-producing gland?".

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.860
This turned out to be a thing
called the submaxillary gland,

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.157
so he then said, "Well now
let's look at rats or mice

00:51:50.157 --> 00:51:51.817
"or something that we can get a lot of

00:51:51.817 --> 00:51:55.170
"and make extracts of
the submaxillary gland",

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:58.690
which he did and finally
purified the growth factor.

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:00.660
So I find that a very interesting story

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:05.420
and it shows that it
really is best, in my view,

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.020
to work with the most favorable material,

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.320
even if it's not what you expected,

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.040
to find what you're looking for

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.770
and then of course you
can go back, as he did,

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:18.390
and find out if that factor
from the snake venom,

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:19.930
the submaxillary gland,

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:22.600
was actually the nerve
growth-promoting factor,

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.640
and that's, in fact, what happened.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.350
So, I like to persuade the people

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.050
who I hope will continue
to give me funding

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:34.790
that frog oocytes actually
do have something to offer

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:38.533
because of this extraordinary
abundance of material.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.240
So, let me just finish,

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.440
I'm just gonna summarize
this at some little length

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.080
and then I'll have a
little take home message

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.330
for those who find this rather
tiresome to read all this.

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:53.910
So, what I said is that,
reading from the top,

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:57.350
regeneration in vertebrates
is really very poor,

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:01.447
and the differentiated states
of cells is extremely stable,

00:53:01.447 --> 00:53:05.110
the cells really do like
to stay where they are.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.350
Second one says that adult stem cells

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.140
are very hard to obtain,

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.060
embryonic stem cells
proliferate and differentiate

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:16.003
but this would require
immunosuppression of the recipient.

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:18.620
We then said that nuclear transfer

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:22.077
establishes the
conservation of the genome,

00:53:22.077 --> 00:53:25.440
and reprograms nuclei back
to an embryonic state,

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.290
and the fact is that this
kind of reproductive training

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:33.530
is subject to a lot of errors
and is generally accepted,

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:37.880
I think, by all scientists to
be inappropriate for humans.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.030
The fourth one says that
nuclear reprogramming

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.970
requires reversal of
differentiation marks,

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:46.490
transcription factor supply,
chromatin decondensation

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:49.210
and, in my view, is potentially valuable,

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:52.910
indeed, for the possibility
of cell replacement

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:54.540
or therapeutic cloning.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.710
And you've seen that I
have rather firm views

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:00.513
on ethical concerns not being important.

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.760
So, for the bottom line,

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.570
the people who don't
want to follow all this,

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.850
I always have a final
thought, and this is this,

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:12.850
it says, what can be done
usually will be done, in time!

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:14.650
So, where something is possible,

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:16.950
scientists find better ways of doing it,

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:20.400
and in my modest view,
there will eventually

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.520
be useful cell replacement
through this route.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.500
And finally, the colleagues of mine

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.970
whose work I've referred to

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:31.320
is Henrietta Standley, the
single cell transplants,

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:34.710
nuclear reprogramming,
graduate student James Byrne,

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:38.270
Stina Simonsson, and all
these are graduate students

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:40.280
who have helped a lot in this work.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.324
Thank you very much.

00:54:41.324 --> 00:54:44.041
(audience applauds)

00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:48.124
