00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.179
If we were totally sane, we would respond
to the present only on its own terms; we would

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.740
worry or be angered or give way to anxiety
only as much as the circumstances before us

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.619
actually dictated. But we are not – of course
– most of us quite sane, as evidenced by

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.961
the way that we respond with such disproportion
to certain events in the here and now. We

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:37.320
have occasional tendencies to get wildly more
worried, angry and anxious than we should,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.940
if we were simply following the facts in front
of us. What causes us difficulty is that we

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.490
are wired to feel and respond according to
precedent rather than on the basis of a dispassionate

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.540
evaluation of the present, and in particular
we follow emotional tracks laid down in the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.570
distant past – when many of us were victims
of deeply unrepresentative and unusually painful

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.360
experiences, from which we continue to make
panicky, gloomy and unhelpful extrapolations.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.030
In other words, we are, to use the inelegant
but useful contemporary term, easily (far

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.220
too easily) ‘triggered’. That is, situations
in the present elicit from us with undue haste

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.340
responses formed by, and frankly better suited
to, a past whose details we have forgotten

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.549
and whose distinctiveness we cannot now perceive.
A tricky but not objectively existentially

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.990
troubling email will hence convince us at
once that this is The End. An item in the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.841
news will plunge us immediately into devastating
guilt or boundless fury. The prospect of a

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:53.310
party we have to go to or a speech we need
to give brings on unbudgeable, monumental

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.200
terror. The triggering happens so fast, there
is no chance to observe the process and see

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.579
the way in which we cede our powers of evaluation
from present to past. Our minds are simply

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.649
flooded with panic, we lose our bearings,
the rational faculties shut down and we are

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.560
lost, perhaps for days, in the caverns of
the mind. We get triggered because we don’t

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.790
have a direct link with objective reality:
each of us approaches the outer world through

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.150
the prism of an inner world with a more or
less tenuous connection to it. In this inner

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.460
world of ours lies a repository of expectations
formed through our unique histories; our internal

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.730
working models, or our best guesses, of what
the outer world will be like; how others will

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.190
respond to us, what they will say if we complain,
how things will turn out when there is a challenge.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.610
Crucially, and this is what we of course miss
when we have been triggered, the inner world

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.200
isn’t the outer world. It contains generalisations
and extrapolations from a past that may be

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.560
far harder, stranger and more dangerous than
the present. Psychologists have a handy rule

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.480
of thumb to alert us to the disproportionate
side of our responses: if we experience anxiety

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.970
or anger above a five out of ten, they tell
us, our response is likely to be fuelled not

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.770
by the issue before us, but by a past we’re
overlooking. In other words, we have to believe

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.090
(contrary to our feelings) that the issue
won’t be what it seems to be about. Image

ourselves from being so eagerly triggered

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.920
is to refuse to believe in most of what overwhelmingly
and rapidly frightens or angers us. We must

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.250
learn to adopt a robust suspicion of our first
impulses. It isn’t that there is nothing

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.700
scary or worrying in the outer world whatsoever,
simply that our initial responses are liable

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.280
to be without proportion or without calculation
of adult strength, resilience, resourcefulness

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.280
or options. Another way to approach our panic
and anxiety is to remember that, despite appearances,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.860
we are not a single person or unified ‘I’.
We are made up of an assemblage or a blend

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.919
of parts dating right back to our earliest
days. In a way we can’t easily track, different

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.989
events will engage with different parts of
us. Some of our most troubled moments are

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.830
when a difficulty in the present isn’t handled
by an adult part, but by a part formed when

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.539
we were six months or three years old. We
end up so scared because the challenge of

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.610
public speaking or of a seduction or a worry
at work has, unbeknownst to the adult part

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.520
of us, been left in the hands a very scared
toddler. In the circumstances, it can help

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.039
to ask ourselves at points not what ‘we’
are afraid of but what a ‘part’ of us

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.570
is worried about – and to learn more carefully
to differentiate the parts in question. What

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.440
might we tell a part of us in order for it
not to be so scared? Image result for david

hockney flowers It is a milestone of maturity
when we start to understand what triggers

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.520
us and why – and to take steps to mitigate
the most self-harming of our responses. Whatever

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.080
our past seems to tell us, perhaps there won’t
be a catastrophe, perhaps we’re not about

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.690
to be killed or humiliated unbearably. Perhaps
we have adult capacities for survival. Too

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.419
much of our past is inside us in a way we
don’t recognise or learn to make allowances

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.660
for. We should dare to approach many of our
triggers like a starting pistol or a fire

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:45.760
alarm that we will from now on, for well-grounded
reasons, refuse to listen to.
