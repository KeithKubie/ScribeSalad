00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:04.571
It's time to play, eBay Price
is Right RNC Edition.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:05.572
(cheers and applause)

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.441
(contestants whooping)

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:09.877
Jon! Jon!

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.747
The biggest challenge for any
presidential candidate

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.082
is getting young people
amped up to vote,

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.984
which is why their campaigns
sell hot swag

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.285
like Donald Trump hats,

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.654
Carly Fiorina tees,
Marco Rubio ear flaps,

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.122
and Mike Huckabee thongs!

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.557
So we're going to show you
a selection of the wei--

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.625
Just sit with it--

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:25.792
we're going to show you
a selection

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.095
of the weirdest campaign
(bleep), for 250 points,

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.030
whoever comes closest
to the real price wins

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.132
the chance to pick
the next president.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.767
First up, a fine gift for the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.969
Rand Paul aficionado
in your life, right here:

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.772
an enormous Rand Paul
birthday card.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.007
It's a three-foot-tall card
that comes

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.708
with a three-foot-tall
card envelope.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:44.077
The front says, "There's one
thing I have to say to you,"

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.013
as if Rand Paul has ever
just said one thing.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.682
Comedians, how much did they
want for this strange gift?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.816
Jon Heder?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.251
Uh, $11.20...

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.086
(audience shouting)

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.688
Oh, no.
Oh, my God, listen to this.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.223
-That's a lot of pressure.
-Geez.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.992
Go up? You haven't even heard
my original bid.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.661
-(audience shouting)
-Go up?

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.596
-Okay. A hundred dollars.
-All right.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.630
-A hundred dollars.
-Pretty good guess.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:04.665
A hundred dollars.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.067
(applause)

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.203
Will Sasso, Will Sasso.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.904
What do you think?

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.005
-(audience shouting)
-I don't-I don't know.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.373
I don't know.
I don't know.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.641
I don't... way up.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.043
Way... Way up.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.478
Uh, one dollar, Drew.

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:19.479
(applause)

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:20.480
One dollar.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:21.582
All right.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:22.816
One dollar.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.319
Chris D'Elia?

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:26.620
(audience shouting)

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.955
Okay, without going over, uh...

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.022
without going over, right?

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:30.424
Uh, okay, okay, okay, uh...

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.425
all right, all right, okay.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.695
Okay, okay, okay, $14.5 million.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:37.231
$14.5 million.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.298
(cheers and applause)

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:40.334
All right, the, uh...

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.570
the closest without going
over the answer was $35.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.039
Will Sasso gets the point!

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:47.708
D'ELIA:
That's really cheap for that.

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:48.909
-Well, that's what you do.
-(cheering)

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:49.943
Just one dollar.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.044
-Wow, wow, wow.
-Just one dollar.

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:53.313
-They told me to.
-A really low...

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:54.915
that's a really low price.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.451
Next up, we have another piece
of unofficial merch,

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.686
a one of a kind
Ted Cruz face dildo.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.021
Now, it's...

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.556
(audience yelling and laughing)

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.858
D'ELIA:
Wow. Wow.

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.960
HARDWICK: This is a prototype
from their Indiegogo campaign

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:08.028
and they say...

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.997
HARDWICK (reading):

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.204
It's all there.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:20.073
How much did they ask for an
early release Ted Cruz dildo?

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:21.441
Will Sasso?

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:22.476
(audience shouting)

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.646
Uh... I...

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:30.584
Last time I went dildo shopping,

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.519
uh, I would have...

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:33.820
(hisses)
Ooh, one like that.

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:35.055
You wouldn't happen to know

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.423
what-what grade of plastic
that's made out of?

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.758
-Never mind, um...
-(Hardwick laughs)

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:40.928
Um... hmm, I'm gonna say,
I'm gonna say a-around...

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:43.530
<i>around</i> $50.

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:44.765
$50.

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:45.966
All right.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.735
(cheers and applause)

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.170
Chris D'Elia.

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:51.438
Okay, look, I know, look,

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.673
all right, look, look,
look, look.

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:55.475
Guys, guys, guys, guys, chill.

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.879
I mean, that's the most rare
thing I've ever seen in my life.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.147
HEDER:
That could be anyone.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.050
I honestly think the only way
you could get that

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:06.420
is if you sell your soul,
so your soul.

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:07.521
HARDWICK:
Your soul.

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:08.655
-SASSO: Your eternal soul.
-Soul!

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.390
HARDWICK:
All right, your eternal soul.

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:12.226
Soul!

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.561
I just said, "Soul," dude.

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:16.530
Jon Heder, $50 and soul.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.531
What do you think?

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:18.665
It's an Indiegogo project,

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.201
so it's probably, like, free.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:22.369
HARDWICK:
You think free?

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.437
For right now, right now.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.138
-Okay, so you're saying free.
-Yeah.

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:26.139
You're saying $50.

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:27.508
You're saying soul.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.245
The correct answer is $40.
Jon Heder, 'cause he was

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:32.713
-the only one who didn't
go over. -Yeah! (whoops)

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.681
-I was so close! -So close.
-I would think a soul would be

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:37.117
-worth more than $40.
-Do I get it?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.552
Yeah, you actually...

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.988
-Is that the prize?
-Yes, you get the prize.

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.689
I will remove mine
at the commercial break

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:42.789
-and give it to you.
-Oh.
