00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:12.833
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.341
It's 1905, Northern California.

00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:17.851
Frank Epperson is eleven years old.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.032
He's sitting on his front porch
making a sort of DIY drink

00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:24.352
that's very popular at this time.

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:27.322
He has just poured a sugary soda powder
into a glass of water

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:31.602
and is mixing enthusiastically
with a wooden stir stick.

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:34.173
We don't know exactly how the next
24 hours play out,

00:00:34.173 --> 00:00:37.032
but we can imagine that something
catches Frank's attention

00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:40.283
and he abandons his drink mid-stir.

00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:42.094
After a cold Bay Area night,

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:45.393
Frank rediscovers his mix drink
the next morning.

00:00:45.393 --> 00:00:47.793
It's frozen solid.

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:49.322
But instead of throwing it out,

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:53.522
Frank pulls the icy block of soda out
of the glass by the embedded stir stick

00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:58.683
and, in a moment of vision, licks it.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.096
Delighted by his invention,

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:02.403
Frank begins making the frozen treat
for friends,

00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:03.823
and as he grows older,

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:06.163
begins selling them as Eppsicles,

00:01:06.163 --> 00:01:10.384
a contraction of his last name
and the word icicle.

00:01:10.384 --> 00:01:11.655
It is rumored that later,

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:15.514
Frank's own kids dubbed the icy
delicacy Pop's 'cicle.

00:01:15.514 --> 00:01:20.385
Others claim the name is a combination
of lollipop and icicle.

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:24.856
Regardless where the name comes from,
the popsicle is here to stay.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:29.744
Approximately 2 billion popsicles
are sold each year.
