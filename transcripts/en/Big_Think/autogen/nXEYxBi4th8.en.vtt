and what I think we're going to find is
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.620
and what I think we're going to find is
that we're more of a market maker where

value of that person as well as the
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.450
value of that person as well as the
value of the product so I think in many

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
value of the product so I think in many
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.160
value of the product so I think in many
