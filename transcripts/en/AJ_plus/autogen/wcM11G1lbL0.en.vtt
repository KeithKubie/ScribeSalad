00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480
detention of people which has been
 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.059
detention of people which has been
happening for a very long time by the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250
talk about replacing it with a system
 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.220
talk about replacing it with a system

immigration system was initially built

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310
immigration system was initially built
 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.619
immigration system was initially built
on the first immigration law in the

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629
on the first immigration law in the
 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:09.819
on the first immigration law in the
United States was the Chinese Exclusion

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.500
Act the first law about immigration in
the United States was how do we exclude

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510
the United States was how do we exclude
 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.140
the United States was how do we exclude
a specific type of people and our

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150
a specific type of people and our
 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.699
a specific type of people and our
immigration system has really kind of

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709
immigration system has really kind of
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.849
immigration system has really kind of
evolved from that I think initial route

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859
evolved from that I think initial route
 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.760
