00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
Jill looked at the following
sequence.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.810
0, 3, 8, 15, 24, 35.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.190
And it just keeps going, I
guess, with a dot, dot, dot.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.410
She saw that the numbers
were each 1 less

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.110
than a square number.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.820
0 is 1 less than 1, which
is a square number.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.160
3 is 1 less than 4.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.740
8 is 1 less than 9.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.950
15 is 1 less than 16.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.960
Yeah, they were all 1 less
than a square number.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.030
And conjectured that the
nth number would be n

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.180
squared minus 1.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.850
Now conjecture, that sounds
like a very fancy word.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.600
When someone makes a conjecture,
they conjecture,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.260
that just means that they're
making a statement that seems,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.470
or they're making a proposition
that seems likely

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.130
to be true.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.060
It seems like a very reasonable
thing to say.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.550
But it's not definitely true.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.250
So she conjectured that the
nth number would be n

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.300
squared minus 1.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.010
The reason why this is a
conjecture as opposed to a

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.960
100% definitely true statement,
is we don't know

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.870
whether this pattern
continues.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.980
She's just going off of the
pattern that she saw so far

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.100
and she just generalized it.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.690
She just assumes that
it keeps on going.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.099
But we don't know whether it
necessarily keeps going.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.620
Maybe the next number, you would
expect it to be 48, but

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.690
maybe it's not 48.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.880
Maybe it's something weird.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.780
Maybe it's 2.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.270
Maybe it's 500.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.870
And so the conjecture wouldn't
hold up if you were to see

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.020
that, but based on the evidence
you see so far it

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.600
seems completely reasonable
that this

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030
pattern would continue.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.690
And so she conjectured that
the nth number would be n

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.230
squared minus 1.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.510
Completely reasonable.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.195
Now did Jill use inductive
reasoning?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.860
Yes, she used inductive
reasoning.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.200
That's what inductive
reasoning is.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.640
You see a pattern.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.160
In this case, every term in this
sequence so far was-- if

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.990
it's the third term, it
was 3 squared minus 1.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.810
The fourth term is 4
squared minus 1.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.370
The fifth term is 5
squared minus 1.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.980
So she saw the pattern and she
just generalized it to say,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.730
well, I think or I've
conjectured that the nth

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.770
number will be n squared
minus 1.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.160
That's what inductive reasoning
is all about.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
You're not always going to be
100%, or you definitely won't

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.660
be 100% sure that you're right,
that the nth number

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.160
will be n squared minus 1.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.200
But based on the pattern you've
seen so far, it's a

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.160
completely reasonable thing
to-- I guess you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.410
could say-- to induce.
