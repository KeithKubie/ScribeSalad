00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.220
In the calculus
playlist, we came up

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.335
with a rationale
for Euler's formula.

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.250
And I guess that video has
gotten somewhat famous with me

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.680
talking about minds being blown
and people not having emotion.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.915
But just as a reminder,
Euler's formula

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:17.670
is that e to the i theta--

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.720
Just the formula by
itself is pretty amazing,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.120
but it becomes
especially amazing

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.600
when you substitute
pi or tau for theta.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.140
And if you don't know what tau
is, there are videos on that.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.790
But Euler's formula tells
us that e to the i theta--

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.320
there's a very good rationale
for saying that this is going

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.140
to be equal to cosine
of theta plus--

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.932
and I'll just change the color
for fun-- plus i sine of theta.

00:00:45.932 --> 00:00:48.390
And so one thing I want to do
is explore this a little bit.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.705
Can I express-- because
of Euler's formula-- can

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:52.880
I now express cosine
of theta in terms

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.860
of some combination
of the other stuff?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.870
And can I now
express sine of theta

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.160
in terms of some other
combination of the other stuff?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.130
Well, let's think about how
we can isolate a cosine theta.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.239
If this is e to
the i theta, let's

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.190
see what e to the
negative i theta would be.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.980
Actually, let me do it over
here on the right-hand side.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.680
So e to the negative i theta.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.150
This is the same thing
as e to the i times

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.410
negative theta, which--
by Euler's formula--

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.590
it would be equal to cosine
of negative theta plus i

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.920
sine of negative theta.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.460
Well, cosine of
negative theta-- this

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.340
is the same thing
as cosine of theta.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.320
And sine of negative
theta is the same thing

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.920
as negative sine of theta.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.270
So this whole thing simplifies
to negative i sine of theta.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.530
So we can write e to
the negative i theta.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.820
Let me do that pink color.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.780
We can write e to
the negative i theta

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.600
as being equal to cosine of
theta minus i sine of theta.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.920
And now we have something
pretty interesting going on.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.180
If we add these two expressions,
these two equalities

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.010
right over here,
the left-hand side--

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.109
so let's just add them up.

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.650
The left-hand side,
we're going to be

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:43.430
left with e to the i theta
plus e to the negative i theta.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.960
And on the right-hand
side, these i

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.500
sine thetas are going to
cancel out with each other.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.020
And we're going to be left
with 2 times cosine of theta.

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:56.900
And so now it's pretty
straightforward.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.950
I just isolate the cosine
theta, divide both sides by 2.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.500
Divide both sides
by 2, and we get

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.150
something pretty interesting.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.660
We get that cosine of theta
is equal to this business-- e

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.800
to the i theta plus e to
the negative i theta, all

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.956
of that over 2.

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:16.580
And we could do a
similar type of thing

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.870
to try to isolate--
let me rewrite it over.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.150
So let me rewrite this
little discovery we made.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.300
Cosine of theta can be
rewritten as e to the i theta

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.680
plus e to the negative i
theta all of that over 2.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.930
So that's kind of interesting.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.950
We can now express
cosine of theta

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.580
in terms of a bunch of
exponentials right over here.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.050
Let's see if we could do the
same thing for sine of theta.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.047
Let's imagine e to the i
theta-- and let's try to do it

00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:45.630
the other way.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.280
There's always these
weird kind of parallels

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.420
between cosine and sine.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.920
So let's just see
what happens if we

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.930
were to subtract this from that.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.530
So let's try doing that.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.250
If we were to take
e to the i theta--

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.550
let me just rewrite it over
again. e to the i theta

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.130
is equal to cosine of
theta plus i sine of theta.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.570
And from that, let's subtract
e to the negative i theta.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.600
Well, now we're going
to subtract this.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.766
So we're going to get
negative cosine theta.

00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:21.140
And then, we're
subtracting this.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.720
So plus i sine theta.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.360
And so we are left with--
when we do the subtraction--

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.270
the left-hand side, we
have e to the i theta

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.360
minus e to the negative i
theta is equal to-- this

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.180
cancels out-- and we're left
with 2i times sine theta.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.030
If we want to solve
for sine theta,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.860
we divide both sides by 2i.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.360
And we are going to be
left with sine theta is

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.770
equal to this business
right over here.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.190
So let's do this.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.610
So this is our other
discovery-- sine theta

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.560
can be written as
e to the i theta

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.907
minus e to the negative i
theta, all of that over 2i.

00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:25.240
So there's something interesting
about these structures.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.760
I can write cosine of theta
is the sum of these two

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.670
exponentials that are dealing
with imaginary numbers, sine

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.860
of theta as the difference of
these two exponential numbers

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.550
dealing with imaginary numbers.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.510
Actually, over
here, it's actually

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.885
the average of
the two functions.

00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:38.870
You're dividing by 2.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.050
Here we're dividing by 2i.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.370
And if you don't like
that i in the denominator,

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.454
you can multiply the numerator
and the denominator by i.

00:05:46.454 --> 00:05:47.620
This will become a negative.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.630
You'll have the i
in the numerator.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.090
But either way, you will
have the same expression.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.400
So this is all I
can say about this.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.870
This is just kind
of interesting.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.710
It's just kind of a fun
exploration of mathematics.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.630
But maybe there's something
neat about the structure

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.730
of these functions.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.220
What happens if we were to
take functions like this,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.350
but if we were to essentially
get rid of the i's right

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.050
over here?

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.800
They seem like there
might be some kind

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.280
of an analog between cosine
of theta and sine of theta.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.000
And so let's define
those functions.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.930
And in the next
few videos, we'll

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.388
explore them and
see if they really

00:06:18.388 --> 00:06:21.980
are analogous in some bizarre,
strange, and beautiful way

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.922
to cosine of theta
and sine theta.

00:06:23.922 --> 00:06:26.130
So we're just going to make
new function definitions,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.030
and they're just being
inspired by these new ways

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.250
that we discovered to write
cosine of theta and sine theta.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.080
And I'm going to call
the first function cosh.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.380
And it really does come
from hyperbolic cosine,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.684
and we'll explore more why
we call it hyperbolic cosine.

00:06:45.684 --> 00:06:46.850
But let's just call it cosh.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.770
I'm just experimenting
right over here.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:55.835
And we'll just say cosh of x
is equal to-- it's going to be

00:06:55.835 --> 00:06:57.960
inspired by this, but we're
going to get rid of all

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.620
of the i's.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.000
So it's going to
be e to the x plus

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.860
e to the negative x,
all of that over 2.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.270
Once again, just inspired
by this right over here.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.290
Getting rid of all of the i's.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.610
And then, let's define
another one-- hyperbolic sine.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.720
So I'll call it sinh.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.440
Sinh for hyperbolic sine.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.390
Sinh-- I guess you
could also do-- of x.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.140
And I'm just to get
rid of all of the i's.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.290
I'm just being inspired by this.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:33.686
So e to the x minus e to the
negative x, all of that over 2.

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:35.060
And in the next
few videos, we're

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.320
going to start exploring this.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.070
And we're going
to start realizing

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.540
that there is this
strange, bizarre parallel

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.690
between these things and our
traditional trigonometric

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.460
functions.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.060
Now, these will show up in
some of your mathematics,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.090
but it is important.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.860
These aren't as
core-- especially

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.100
in traditional mathematics-- as
these two characters are here,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.738
but it is a fun exploration.
