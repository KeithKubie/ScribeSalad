00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.680
Your plan of attack and reasoning for

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.170
changing the fire based
schema sounds good.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.440
So, I give you my blessing
to implement buy and un-buy.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.930
In the end you should
have this functionality,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.420
where the style changes as seen here.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.160
If the item's bought it
should be crossed out and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.700
it should say who it was bought by.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.430
If it was bought by you it
should simply say Bought by You.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.550
If it was bought by another user,
say the user's name right here.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.780
Now if the item hasn't been bought yet,
you shouldn't see a strike through, and

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.370
you should also still
see this trashcan icon

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.950
which allows you to remove the item.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.260
Items that have already been
bought can't be removed.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.680
One final note, you should only be able
to unbuy an item that you've bought.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.120
If Kagure says that she bought some jam,
Walter should not either by mistake or

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.350
on purpose, be able to un-buy
that jam she just bought.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.980
Only Kagure should be able to un-buy
an item in case her figure strayed and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.860
she bought it buy accident or
something else happened.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.440
Okay so makes sense?

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.394
All right, well I'm sending
over the spec right now and

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:53.940
I'll check back in with
you in a little bit.
