SEBASTIAN KRIESE: You
have to make sure that you

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.520
work on the best possible game.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.380
Don't waste your time on
something you don't believe in.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.680
Work on the stuff that
matters and make sure

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.455
that you have the vision right.

Wooga is a mobile game
developer based in Berlin.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.040
At our headquarters here, we
have more than 250 employees.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.230
We produce high
quality mobile games

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530
that are being played by
more than 50 million players

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.430
every month.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.060
The most popular games are
Diamond Dash, Jelly Splash,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.870
and Agent Alice.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.560
 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.780
Agent Alice is a
hidden object game.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.730
Launched on February 26th, Agent
Alice got 9 million to date.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.420
Six of them coming from
Google Play and Android only.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.260
We release a new episode
every single week

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.710
to keep players engaged
and to keep them

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.800
active over a very long time.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.410
Google Play allows us
to run fast iterations

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.780
for Agent Alice.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.050
All new features and
updates are being

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.880
developed for invite
first before they

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.080
come to other platforms.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.060
PAL TAMAS FEHER: Our
business is very fast.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.310
So our development approach
has to be also very fast.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.780
Our developer cycle is
usually one to two weeks.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.380
And this [INAUDIBLE] in
Google Play is a clear winner.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.740
We can just publish and
release our games within hours.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.070
This is what we really do love.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.660
SEBASTIAN KRIESE: Already in
the prototyping and concepting

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.420
phase, we can leverage the beta
testing feature on Google Play.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.790
The staged rollout helps us
to release a new feature only

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.350
to a tiny set of users to make
sure that everything is stable

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.340
and that it's actually
perceived well.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.880
The combination of Google
Play and Google Analytics

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.700
enables us to understand
our users even better.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.930
Looking into the
different KPIs, we

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.320
can make sure that
we understand where

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.180
our users are coming from.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.820
Tracking different steps during
the first time user experience

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.810
helps us to understand when
the user is potentially

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.120
leaving the game.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.160
Whenever that happens, we
can iterate extremely fast

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.450
and make sure that we optimize
those points to make sure

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.860
that users stay even
longer in our games.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.180
We have to make
sure that the image

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.920
quality is the best possible
on whatever screen you look.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.310
However, we usually don't
want to put huge graphics that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.100
are being displayed on a
tablet into a game that

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.770
is being played on a phone.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.220
This is the reason why
we love the multi APK

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.720
feature of Google Play.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.390
It helps us to bundle
our games to make sure

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.690
that the file size is
as small as possible

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.285
for the individual users.

00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:43.910
PAL TAMAS FEHER: Use
the full potential

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.840
of the fast iterations and make
your game with every iterations

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.340
better and better.
