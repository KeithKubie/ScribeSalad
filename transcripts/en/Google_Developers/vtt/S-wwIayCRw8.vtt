00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:06.320
DAVID HARDWICK: BetterCloud
recently reached a milestone

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.800
where we're currently serving
40,000 customers representing

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.550
over 20 million users.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.780
The cloud platform
has helped us grow

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.630
by allowing us to focus
on building the software.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.900
We've been adding about
a million users a month

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.639
to our system.

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:22.055
And knowing that we're building
on the shoulders of giants

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.959
of Google is something that
they've been able to solve.

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:27.000
It's something that we
don't have to worry about.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.124
ALEEM MAWANI: Because of
the Google Cloud Platform,

00:00:29.124 --> 00:00:30.800
we could make investments
in our product

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.340
first, as opposed
to infrastructure,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.840
and so we could
iterate really quick

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.100
on building the right product.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.974
RAFAEL SANCHES: Before
Google Cloud Platform,

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:40.230
we used to run these
scripts on the servers.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.730
We had to do our own backup.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.810
We had to do our own
database replication.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.660
And now with Google
Cloud Platform,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.470
we don't need to because
we use App Engine.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.567
And it has been great
for us because we

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:52.400
don't have to be concerned
with those things

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.369
and just focus on our product.

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:56.410
RUDOLF POTUCEK: Our former
solution was in house,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.010
so there was a very large
amount of hardware maintenance

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
overhead that we had to deal
with that we now no longer have

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.150
because Google
takes care of that.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.210
And that allowed us to focus
on the deployment aspects

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.540
and on unblocking developers
and getting code to market.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.720
It has taken away a lot
of the worries about how

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.450
do I deal with
the infrastructure

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.710
and has focused us on the
core of our product, which

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.060
is the software that we create.
