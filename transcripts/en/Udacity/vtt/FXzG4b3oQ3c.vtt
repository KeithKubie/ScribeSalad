00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.910
You may have previously learned the
order of operations using the mnemonic

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.270
PEMDAS.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.450
P stands for parentheses, E stands for
exponents, M stands for multiply,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.265
D stands for divide, A stands for
add, and S stands for subtract.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:21.655
If PEMDAS is a helpful way for
you to remember the order of operations,

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:22.675
that's great.

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:26.575
But keep in mind that even
though M comes before D PEMDAS,

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:30.915
you should still also do multiplication
and division at the same time.

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:34.500
Likewise, even though A comes before S,
you should add and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350
subtract at the same time.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.160
For multiplying and
dividing as well as for adding and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.800
subtracting, always work
from left to right.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.470
Now that we know the order of
operations, let's try a problem.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.940
Now that we know the order of
operations, let's try problem.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.222
Let's start with 20/5 x4+6 squared.

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:56.770
Enter your answer in the box.
