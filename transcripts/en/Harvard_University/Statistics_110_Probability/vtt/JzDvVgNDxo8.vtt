00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.240
So last time we proved a lot
of theorems last time right,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.410
Bayes Rule at least n factorial plus 3
theorems or something like that for any n.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.340
So that was a very productive day and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.700
I wanna continue with
conditional probability.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.440
Thinking conditionally, we did Bayes Rule.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.780
But I want to do some examples
of conditional probability and

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.870
some more stuff on
conditional probability.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.050
So basically the topic for today is not
just probability, but it's thinking.

00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:48.940
So [COUGH] probability is how to think
about uncertainty and randomness, right?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.840
That's the topic for this entire course.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.310
So, this is not just a statistics course,
this is a thinking course and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.650
you know the math we were doing last time,
the math is extremely easy, right.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.831
I like multiply both sides by something
and then there's our theorem.

00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:07.335
So it looked really easy but
to actually think about it and

00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:12.695
how to apply it is not always easy,
in fact it's often subtle.

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:16.609
So I wanna do some examples and
a few more theorems along those lines.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.440
So I like to say thinking conditionally
that that's one of the biggest themes

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.820
in this whole course, using conditional
probability, conditional thinking.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.660
It is a condition for thinking.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690
That is you can't really think clearly

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.550
except under the condition that you
understand how to think conditionally.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.910
Okay, so
that's kind of a general statement.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.870
Now, here's a general
way to solve a problem.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:56.030
This is also a course in problem solving,
okay?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.690
So I wanna just say, in general,
how do you solve a problem?

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:08.919
And there are different strategies for
solving problems, right?

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.890
Now one strategy that we already

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.170
talked a little bit about
is to try simple and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.220
extreme cases that is extremely
useful in a wide variety of problems.

00:02:30.874 --> 00:02:32.830
So I did my undergrad at Cal Tech.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.960
And at Cal Tech,
everyone's hero is Richard Feynman,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.990
who was one of the greatest
physicists of the 20th century.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.330
And people like to say that
Feynman also had an algorithm,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.750
a general problem solving
algorithm that Feynman used.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.260
Does anyone know the Feynman algorithm?

00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:54.726
Okay the Feynman algorithm is,
write down the problem,

00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:59.330
think hard about it,
write down the solution.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.040
So, that worked really well for
Richard Feynman, but it doesn't work for

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.800
anyone else that I know, okay?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.980
So we need better, so
this is one strategy, and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.740
this is a strategy that we'll be using
over and over again in the course.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.680
A second strategy that we'll be using over
and over again that's useful in statistics

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.020
but it's useful in computer science,
it's useful in math.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.410
It's useful in econ,
it's useful all over the place,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.430
is to try to break the problem
up into simpler pieces.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.860
If you have a problem that
seems too difficult and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.540
complicated try to decompose
it into smaller pieces.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.470
Try and solve the smaller,
it's recursive, right.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.558
If the smaller pieces
are still too difficult,

00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:39.820
then break up the smaller
pieces into simpler problems.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.340
So you have more problems,
but each problem is easier.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.010
And hopefully eventually you'll reach
a point where you can solve each of those

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.480
problems, put the pieces back together.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.740
So that's a very, very general
strategy for solving problems.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.830
So break up problem into simpler pieces.

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:03.480
Okay, so that's just a general strategy.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.190
But let me write down,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.350
what does that mean in the context
of what we're doing right now?

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.930
Well, let's draw a picture,
here's one of our Venn diagrams,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.240
here's the sample space S.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.910
And supposedly,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.480
we want to find the probability
of B which is Blob, B for Blob.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.240
So suppose that our problem,
this is a very general strategy.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.980
But suppose that our problem
is still a generic problem but

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.720
less generic than this,
we have this complicated looking Blob, B,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.650
and we want to find the probability of B.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.870
We don't know how to do it because
it's this complicated blob.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.162
So instead of giving up, what we would
do is to break B up into pieces,

00:04:45.162 --> 00:04:48.350
find the probability of each piece and
add them up.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.910
So that's a very simple idea, right?

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.590
Just break it up into pieces,
add up the pieces.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.850
It's a very, very powerful idea.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.880
So we are going to break
this up into pieces.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.142
Let's say this is A1 is this rectangle,
A2, A3 and here's A4.

00:05:04.142 --> 00:05:08.340
A4 doesn't actually intersect B,
that's fine.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.269
We're gonna let A1 through
An be a partition of S.

00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:20.140
The word partition just means
that these sets a which

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.730
are rectangles are disjoint and
their union is all of S.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.390
So we are just chopping up
the space into disjoint pieces.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.800
They don't have to look like rectangles.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.340
Chop it up however you want,
as long as those pieces are disjoint and

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.940
their union is the whole space,
that's called a partition of S.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.800
So that's a partition of S.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.040
Then I don't need to do
any kind of calculation,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.305
I can just immediately write down
what the decomposition says.

00:05:52.305 --> 00:06:00.160
P(B), just by the second axiom of
probability says, if you partition a set,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.520
and you want its probability,
then you can just add up all the pieces.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.550
That's all we're doing.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.796
So I can write P(B) = P (BnA1)
+ blah blah blah + P (BnAn).

00:06:12.796 --> 00:06:16.340
I don't need to write a proof for this.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.200
This is just immediate just
from the axioms of probability,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.790
it's immediate, right?

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.790
Because I broke it up
into disjoint pieces.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.120
So that's immediate, and then remember we
have this long list of theorems last time

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.830
that all just followed immediately from
the definition of conditional probability.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:39.225
So another way to write this would be,
remember P(B) intersect A1.

00:06:39.225 --> 00:06:44.485
I can either do P(B) times P(A1)
given B or the other way round.

00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:48.495
So let's do P(B) given P(A1).

00:06:48.495 --> 00:06:51.809
That's what we did last time so
that's a quick review.

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:55.440
If I want the probability of this and
this I can take one thing, and

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.740
then the other thing, given the first
thing, and I can do it in either order.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.810
That's why I said we had
n factorial theorems,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.940
because you could do it in any order,
+, blah, blah, blah,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.460
do that for all the pieces, (B/An) P(An).

00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:22.140
And this equation here is called
the law of total probability.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.340
That's the name for it, but I

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.160
prefer to just think of it as breaking
up a problem into simpler pieces.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.390
So the proof is already just written here.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.090
It's immediate, okay?

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.800
It's not like we have to spend
20 minutes trying to prove this.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.240
It's just immediately true.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.590
So whether this is useful or

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.390
not, depends on how well you
chose this patrician, okay?

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.050
So statistics is both a science and
an art.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.260
It takes a lot of practice.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:02.000
That if I had chosen this partition
in certain ways, then I multiplied,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.100
here I have only one problem and I've
multiplied into n problems And it could be

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.160
that each of those n problems is just
as hard or harder than when I started.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.040
And that would be a nightmare.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.040
But for a lot of examples that
we'll see later on in the course,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.240
and you'll see in section
on the homework and so

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.230
on, this P(B) is complicated but
each of these is really easy.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.630
So we split it up into easy problems.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.130
So that's what we are looking for,
you just need experience with that.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.740
The more problems you do, then the better
you'll get at kind of guessing

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.540
what would be a useful partition and
what would be a useless partition, okay?

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.564
So that's just the general
idea of Y is conditional.

00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:45.460
Basically there's two main reasons
conditional probability is very important.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.760
One is that it's important
in its own right, right?

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.110
Because like I was talking about last
time, conditional probabilities just says

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.920
we get some evidence, how do we update
our probabilities based on the evidence?

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.250
So, that's just a very general,
important problem.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.880
The second reason it's extremely important
is that even if we wanted an unconditional

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.570
probability like here
P(B) is unconditional.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.144
Still a lot of times we need to use
conditional probability to break it up

00:09:13.144 --> 00:09:15.367
into simpler pieces, all right.

00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:18.420
So let's do some examples.

00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:24.187
All right, I'll start with one
that seems really simple, but

00:09:24.187 --> 00:09:25.993
actually is kind of surprising I think.

00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:36.468
Suppose we have two random cards,

00:09:36.468 --> 00:09:40.620
just from a standard deck.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.960
Get random 2-card hand.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.972
So random two cards out of a 52 card deck,

00:09:51.972 --> 00:09:54.710
from standard deck.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:06.830
And then let's compute two different
conditional probabilities, okay?

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.130
So suppose we're given that
this hand has an ace, okay?

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.027
And we want the probability
that both cards are aces.

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:18.790
So let's do two things,
first of all let's find the probability.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.130
I'm just gonna write this in words, but
we could also define some notation for

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.920
the different events, but
I'll just write this in words.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.857
We wanna find the probability
that both cards are aces,

00:10:29.857 --> 00:10:34.647
given that we have an ace, that is,
I'm just gonna write have ace.

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:40.336
If you write it mathematically though,
this would be a union,

00:10:40.336 --> 00:10:43.010
it'll be the union of the first card.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.910
We don't necessarily have an ordering
of a first card and a second card,

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.300
but we could imagine we got dealt one card
first and then got dealt a second card.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.840
This would be the union of
the first card being an ace and

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.210
the second card being an ace.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.237
That is we have at least one ace.

00:10:56.237 --> 00:10:57.760
All right so that's one problem.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.060
Seems like a pretty simple problem okay,
but there's actually a lot going on here.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.465
And then a second problem is to find
the probability that both cards are aces,

00:11:07.465 --> 00:11:10.052
given that we have the ace of spades.

00:11:15.783 --> 00:11:16.890
Okay, so that's what we wanna do.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.780
So let's do the first thing first and
then the second thing second.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.200
The probability of both aces,
this one, given that we have an ace.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.280
This is just practice with the definition
of conditional probability.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.110
So the probability of a given b,
is the probability of a intersect b.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.090
Now in this case, I'll write it out but
then I'll simplify it.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.620
Both aces and we have an,
both cards are aces and we have an ace.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.920
But if you already told
that both cards are aces,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.280
then it's redundant to say we have an ace.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.570
So the the intersection of this event and
this event is just this event.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.330
So that's redundant, so
I just crossed it out, okay?

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.574
Divide it by the probability
that we have an ace.

00:12:07.937 --> 00:12:11.047
This is just a quick review with the naive
definition, which needs the naive

00:12:11.047 --> 00:12:14.272
definition here, cuz we're assuming
all two card hands are equally likely.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.510
The probability that both cards are aces,

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:24.060
well you can chose to do this problem
using order or with out order, but let's

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.690
just do this with out order cuz I don't
really care about the order of the hand.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.350
If the card consists of two aces,
there's two possibilities, right,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.890
chose two out of the four aces, and
the denominator, we know, is 52 chose two,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.880
cuz we're just picking two cards
out of 52, naive definition.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.900
The denominator, the probability we have
a miss is two ways to do that either

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.860
we could break it up into cases so there
is two cases, either we have two aces and

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:01.370
you can find that we just did that or
we have one ace and one non-ace.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.400
Those are two disjoint cases,
we could add them up.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.750
I think it's a little bit easier
to do the complement, but

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.100
you'll get the same thing either
way if you do it correctly.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.869
If we do the complement,

00:13:10.869 --> 00:13:16.951
that what we're saying is it's 1 minus the
probability that neither card is an ace.

00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:20.780
The probability that
neither card is an ace,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.937
well there are 48 non-aces in a deck,
right, 52- 4.

00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:30.858
We can choose any two of them,
divided by 52, choose 2.

00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:33.708
And if you simplify
this you get 1 over 33.

00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:41.112
So about a 3% chance of this
happening after simplification.

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:43.630
Okay, now let's do this problem.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.760
What the probability that both are aces,
given that we have the ace of spades?

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:55.511
So P of both aces,
given that we have the ace of spades.

00:13:59.659 --> 00:14:02.940
Again, there's more than one
way we can do this problem.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.275
We could just plug into the definition.

00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:09.888
The numerator would be,
what's the probability that we have both,

00:14:09.888 --> 00:14:14.205
this and this would say we have the ace of
spades and we have some other ace, right?

00:14:14.205 --> 00:14:18.210
And then you could do the denominator,
and you can work that out.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.150
I would prefer to think of
this in a simpler way but

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.250
for practice it's good to see that
you get the same answer either way.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.840
I'd rather think of this more directly.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.240
Just what does this mean?

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:35.070
We have two cards here,
now I didn't say anything about order or

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.260
unordered, what we're given,
that is we learn this information,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.550
we learned that we have the ace of spades.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.292
So here's my two card hand,

00:14:42.292 --> 00:14:46.731
and we have the ace of spades,
I'll abbreviate it to AS, Ace of Spades.

00:14:46.731 --> 00:14:49.013
Of course if we want we can put
the ace of spades on the left and

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.990
the other card on right
that's why holding these.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.320
I have the ace of spades here,
and this one here, okay.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.360
And so this card is the mystery card,
right?

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:04.220
Now this second card could be any card
other than the ace of spades, right?

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.120
By symmetry,
this card is equally likely to be

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.190
any of the 51 cards in the deck
other than the ace of spades.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.620
There's no reason that this is more likely
to be the jack of diamonds than the ace of

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.490
clubs, right?

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.174
Completely symmetric.

00:15:20.174 --> 00:15:25.146
Therefore, we can immediately just write
down the answer, 3/51 because if this is

00:15:25.146 --> 00:15:29.620
any of the other three aces, then we
have both aces and otherwise, we don't.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.065
So, it's immediately 3
over 51 by symmetry.

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.540
You could write something
more analogous to this and

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.660
if you do it correctly, you'll get
the same thing, but that's simpler.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.641
3 over 51 simplifies to 1/17, right?

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:51.403
1/17 is, it's basically double this if
this were 1/34 it would be exactly double.

00:15:51.403 --> 00:15:53.197
It's about twice as likely.

00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:57.669
So let's think about that for a second.

00:15:57.669 --> 00:15:59.050
Does that make sense?

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:06.210
Here we have an ace and
we haven't specified what suit it is.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.733
Here, we specify though
it's the Ace of Spades, and

00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:11.800
suddenly our probability almost doubled.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:20.750
Now, if I had said Ace of Hearts here,
that's not gonna change, right?

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.930
It's still gonna be one-seventeenth.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.880
If I had said Ace of Clubs
here that's not gonna change.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.397
If I said Ace of Diamonds
here that's not gonna change.

00:16:28.397 --> 00:16:30.262
The problem is symmetric.

00:16:30.262 --> 00:16:32.570
It doesn't actually matter
that it's the Ace of Spades.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.900
We don't care what suit it is, right?

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.396
It could say hearts, clubs,
diamonds, spades here,

00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:38.263
it's still gonna be one-seventeenth.

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:43.425
And yet here, where we didn't specify it,
it's 1 over 33.

00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:50.060
So I'm gonna let you think
about this problem for a while.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.340
This is a problem that
you could spend hours and

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.410
hours trying to build intuition about.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.698
I'm mainly doing it just for
practice with the definition.

00:16:59.698 --> 00:17:02.100
And to show you that even
something that sounds,

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.450
this sounds like a very simple problem,
okay?

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.622
But already something very
surprising is going on here.

00:17:07.622 --> 00:17:11.380
So conditional probability can be very,
very subtle.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.874
One hint for thinking about it is,

00:17:13.874 --> 00:17:18.618
here we're saying we have an ace
that means at least one, right?

00:17:18.618 --> 00:17:22.040
Now here, well we could say we have
at least one Ace of Spades, but

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.090
if we say there's at
least one Ace of Spades,

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.840
we're just saying we have the Ace of
Spades cuz there's only one Ace of Spades.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.910
So here I can specifically say, here I
have the Ace of Spades, something else.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.230
Here, it's complicated.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.184
I can't draw the same
picture here as there,

00:17:37.184 --> 00:17:40.619
because I'm just saying
there's at least one ace.

00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:45.508
So there's a difference here in terms
of talking about at least one or

00:17:45.508 --> 00:17:46.696
a specific one.

00:17:46.696 --> 00:17:52.792
All right, so that's just a fun problem to
think about with conditional probability.

00:17:52.792 --> 00:17:55.173
Let's do another example.

00:17:55.173 --> 00:17:59.387
This kind of thing actually
is important in gambling, but

00:17:59.387 --> 00:18:02.827
let's do one that's
important in daily life.

00:18:02.827 --> 00:18:08.478
So, suppose that we're testing for
a disease.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.816
So this is a problem
that comes up every day

00:18:16.816 --> 00:18:21.670
everywhere in the world
in a medical context.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:27.507
So suppose that a patient comes in, and
is getting tested for a certain disease.

00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:36.048
Okay, this is a good problem and
just illustrating.

00:18:38.248 --> 00:18:41.329
You have to think very carefully
about what your conditioning on,

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:42.750
what's your goal?

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.800
And that's a hint for

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.250
the homework as well to try to clearly
specify what are you trying to find.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.340
Make up some clear notation and
then say very,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:59.290
very explicitly, our goal is to find p
of what given what, that kind of thing.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.289
Okay, so patient gets tested for disease.

00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:07.892
And suppose that that particular disease
afflicts 1% of the population or

00:19:07.892 --> 00:19:13.978
maybe wanna say, 1% of people who
are similar in demographically,

00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:17.194
same age, and so on as this patient.

00:19:17.194 --> 00:19:23.607
1% of similar patients have the disease,

00:19:23.607 --> 00:19:28.974
okay, that's the assumption.

00:19:28.974 --> 00:19:33.290
And suppose that the patient tests
positive, that's the result.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:38.020
And even though testing positive
sounds good, that's actually bad.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.010
Tests positive means that the test

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.660
is asserting that
the patient has the disease.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.840
Now, the test could be wrong, right?

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.949
But if the test is correct, then that
means the patient has the disease, okay?

00:19:50.949 --> 00:19:52.893
So that's what a positive test means.

00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:58.187
Now, so far I haven't said anything
about how reliable is the test, right?

00:19:58.187 --> 00:20:00.790
So some diseases are hard to detect, okay?

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:05.088
And so some diseases are easy to detect,
some are hard to detect.

00:20:05.088 --> 00:20:08.480
And some tests work better
than other tests, right?

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.607
Okay, so we need some assumption there.

00:20:10.607 --> 00:20:13.347
And so
suppose that the test is advertised,

00:20:17.938 --> 00:20:20.840
As being 95% accurate.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.014
You might see some marketing
that the people who

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:28.786
manufacture this particular test and
they say it's 95% accurate.

00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:29.924
And what does that actually mean?

00:20:29.924 --> 00:20:32.422
I"m putting that in quotes
because that's not yet

00:20:32.422 --> 00:20:35.280
precise enough to actually
do anything with.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.400
So we're gonna have to interpret what
does it mean for it to be 95% accurate?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.520
There's more than one ways you
can interpret that phrase.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.210
That's ambiguous right now.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.536
So to be able to solve the problem
I'm gonna make a specific assumption.

00:20:49.536 --> 00:20:54.294
So suppose, that's an assumption,
that this means,

00:20:56.947 --> 00:21:00.304
Now we start needing some notation for
the different events.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.780
So let's define our events here.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.430
Let's let D be the event that
the patient has the disease.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.165
Patient has disease, D for disease.

00:21:18.382 --> 00:21:23.160
Okay, when you're defining events, try to
write it out as carefully as possible.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.300
It will be tempting here to
just write D for disease, okay?

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.040
But that's confusing, right?

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.379
Disease is not an event.

00:21:31.379 --> 00:21:33.679
The event is that
the patient has a disease.

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:38.121
Now if it's very obvious in the context
what you mean, then that's fine, but

00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:42.628
a lot of times, if you're just writing
down, B is blood, and D is disease and so

00:21:42.628 --> 00:21:44.810
on, and they're not really events.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.257
It's gonna be very confusing for anyone
to understand what you're doing, okay?

00:21:48.257 --> 00:21:49.601
So, D is the event that this patient,

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:52.123
we're assuming we have a specific
patient that we're talking about.

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:55.998
That patient has the disease,
that's event D.

00:21:55.998 --> 00:22:00.420
And let's let T be the event
that the patient tests positive.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.693
I would normally wanna use P for positive,
but it's very confusing to use P for

00:22:03.693 --> 00:22:05.095
probability and P for positive.

00:22:05.095 --> 00:22:07.309
So don't call your events P, okay?

00:22:07.309 --> 00:22:09.557
So I'll just say patient tests positive.

00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:17.349
Okay, so
those are our two events that we need.

00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:20.142
I don't think we need any
more notation at this point.

00:22:20.142 --> 00:22:25.462
So let's suppose that 95% accurate means

00:22:25.462 --> 00:22:30.642
that the probability of T given D = 0.95

00:22:30.642 --> 00:22:37.226
= the probability of T
complement given D complement.

00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:39.354
So that's an assumption.

00:22:39.354 --> 00:22:40.674
What this assumption is?

00:22:40.674 --> 00:22:42.824
So that's an interpretation
of 95% accurate.

00:22:42.824 --> 00:22:45.882
And what this says,
is if the patient has the disease,

00:22:45.882 --> 00:22:50.540
then 95% of the time that the test
will correctly report test positive.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.791
If the patient does not have the disease,

00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:56.344
then 95% of the time the test
will correctly report negative.

00:22:56.344 --> 00:22:59.728
So conditional on whether
the patient has the disease or not,

00:22:59.728 --> 00:23:02.665
95% of the time the test
gives the correct answer.

00:23:02.665 --> 00:23:04.026
Does that make sense?

00:23:04.026 --> 00:23:06.031
So that's the assumption, okay.

00:23:06.031 --> 00:23:10.162
But that's not actually
what we want to know.

00:23:10.162 --> 00:23:13.182
What do you think the patient cares about?

00:23:13.182 --> 00:23:15.170
The patient doesn't care about that.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:20.750
The patient wants to know whether he or
she has the disease, right?

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:25.746
So what the patient cares
about is not P of T given D,

00:23:25.746 --> 00:23:28.640
it's P of D given T, okay?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.743
So that's our goal.

00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:35.289
Our goal is to find P of D given T.

00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:40.995
Now, so one of the most common
mistakes in statistics as applied

00:23:40.995 --> 00:23:45.980
in real life is confusing P of
T given D with P of D given T.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.940
Although they're completely
different concepts.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.880
Luckily, we know how they're connected,
right?

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.170
We don't just ever say this
is different from this,

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.625
we actually know how they're related.

00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:57.868
They're related by Bayes rule, right?

00:23:57.868 --> 00:24:00.350
So a Bayes rule, what does that say?

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:06.434
Bayes' rule says P(D given T)
is P(T given D)P(D) over P(T).

00:24:07.906 --> 00:24:13.632
That's just Bayes' rule,
which we proved in one line Wednesday or

00:24:13.632 --> 00:24:16.900
Monday, that's Bayes' rule.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:21.260
And we already know P(D given T),
we know P(D), that's just for

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.780
the populations, that's 0.01.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:30.120
The ony thing left is P(T), we don't yet
know P(T), so here's a little trick.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.780
And sometimes if you look in books
they won't state Bayes' rule this way.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.870
They'll do something more complicated
with the sum in the denominator.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.780
But I don't consider that Bayes' rule,
this is Bayes' rule.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.154
Okay, and now often the denominator
is the tricky part, and for

00:24:45.154 --> 00:24:49.110
doing the denominator, that's when
we do this law of total probability.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:53.489
Okay, so
it's very common to use Bayes' rule and

00:24:53.489 --> 00:24:57.050
the law of total probability in tandem.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:03.204
So if we expand the denominator using
the law of total probability, well,

00:25:03.204 --> 00:25:10.840
that's just gonna be P(T given D)P(D) +
P(T given D complement)P(D complement).

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.197
So our partition is a very obvious one,

00:25:13.197 --> 00:25:17.126
the partition is just saying either
the patient has the disease or

00:25:17.126 --> 00:25:21.410
does not have the disease, so
breaking up into those two cases.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.360
Right, so it's hard to
immediately see what P(T) is, but

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.040
it's easy as soon as we
break into two cases.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.150
So we have two cases, it's kind of neat
also that this thing in the numerator,

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.230
when we write it this way,
it's the same thing here.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.072
And then plus the case where D complement,
it kind of has a nice structure to it.

00:25:38.072 --> 00:25:40.900
All right, so at this point,
we know all of these numbers,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.910
we can just plug them in.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:48.190
I guess I didn't mention, let's see,
what's P(T given D complement)?

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:52.610
Well, we know P(T complement
given D complement) is 0.95, so

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:56.440
therefore P(T given D complement) is 0.05,
right?

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.139
Cuz given, it's just the complement, so

00:26:01.139 --> 00:26:07.541
if you plug all that in,
you get approximately 0.16.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:15.272
So even though the test is supposedly
95% accurate in this sense,

00:26:15.272 --> 00:26:20.410
there's only a 16% chance that
the patient has the disease.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:25.030
And that seems surprising both to most
patients and to most doctors at first.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.398
And in fact, there was a study
Done at Harvard where they asked

00:26:29.398 --> 00:26:34.366
something like 60 Harvard doctors
a question very similar to this.

00:26:34.366 --> 00:26:37.999
And something like 80% of the doctors, and

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:42.950
they were basically asked to
guess what should this number be.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.834
And 80% of the doctors said
numbers like 95% or very,

00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:50.881
very high numbers, and
didn't realize that it was so small.

00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:59.209
So what's the moral of the story,
one thing is,

00:26:59.209 --> 00:27:04.410
you should get a second opinion,
right, do another test.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.910
And there's some subtleties
that come up there too,

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.290
because maybe the second test is
not independent of the first test.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.040
In that if there was something that was
causing the test to be wrong the first

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.110
time, maybe the same
thing would happen again.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.910
So it'd be a good idea to get
a different kind of test.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.630
Secondly, what's really going on here,

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.660
most people's intuition on this
problem is completely wrong.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.105
Maybe they guess 95%, or

00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:31.560
maybe they would conservatively
lower it down to 70% or 80%.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.080
But hardly anyone,
if you ask this problem, will say 16%.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.420
So why is people's intuition so
completely wrong about this?

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.450
Well, I think the reason is that they
focus on this part of the problem.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:48.840
But an equally important part
of the problem is this 1% here,

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.640
and that's what gets ignored.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:56.970
So there's a tradeoff here,
it's fairly rare

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:02.290
that the test is wrong, but it's also
fairly rare that someone has the disease.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.270
So there's kind of a competition
between how rare is the disease

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.940
versus how rarely is the test wrong.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.731
And for some psychological reason,

00:28:10.731 --> 00:28:13.513
most people focus on the part
about the test being wrong.

00:28:13.513 --> 00:28:17.340
And don't focus on the fact that
the disease itself is rare.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.640
So most people's intuition
is wrong because of that.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:24.350
Here's another, just if you want another
quick intuition into this problem.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.230
Remember we talked about
frequentists' world last time?

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.280
Where we were repeating the same
experiment over and over again, so

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.540
suppose we didn't just do
this with one patient.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.410
Suppose we had 1000,
I'm not going to write this,

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.360
I'm just giving you a quick intuition.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.738
Suppose we repeated this 1000 times,
as we have 1000 patients.

00:28:40.738 --> 00:28:43.967
And just speaking roughly,
if we have 1000 patients,

00:28:43.967 --> 00:28:47.530
about 10 of them will have the disease,
right, that's 1%.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:52.118
Maybe not exactly 10, but just roughly,
intuitively speaking, we'd imagine,

00:28:52.118 --> 00:28:55.000
1000 patients, 10 have the disease.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.098
And let's suppose that for those 10,
the test is correct every time, so

00:28:59.098 --> 00:29:00.865
all 10 of them test positive.

00:29:00.865 --> 00:29:05.130
Now what about the other 900 and
whatever people?

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:10.000
10 people have the disease, so
990 people do not have the disease.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.580
They all get tested, but something like 5%
of those people are gonna test positive.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.500
Just roughly speaking in that example,
I'm not gonna compute exact numbers,

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.730
I'm just giving you some intuition.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.607
Roughly speaking, 50,
that's 5% of 1000, so

00:29:26.607 --> 00:29:30.114
about 50 people would test positive
who don't have the disease, and

00:29:30.114 --> 00:29:33.560
about 10 people would test
positive who do have the disease.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.664
So that's in a ratio of 5 to 1,
and 0.16 is about one-sixth,

00:29:37.664 --> 00:29:39.472
so that's what's going on.

00:29:39.472 --> 00:29:42.310
You have 50 people who tested positive
who don't have the disease, and

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.408
10 who did, question?

00:29:43.408 --> 00:29:50.109
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:50.109 --> 00:29:55.366
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:29:55.366 --> 00:29:57.970
so that is an extremely
important question.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.952
In case anyone couldn't hear, the question
is, will they usually be higher?

00:30:00.952 --> 00:30:03.499
Because if the patient
who's getting tested,

00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:07.890
maybe they came in because they
are having symptoms and things like that.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:13.580
So the calculation would completely change
if that patient already has information,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.900
like certain symptoms that
are consistent with the disease.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.264
The calculation would change,
but the principle is the same.

00:30:20.264 --> 00:30:23.153
The principle is whatever evidence,
you have some initial, so

00:30:23.153 --> 00:30:25.730
maybe it's initially 1% if
don't have any evidence.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.244
As you start getting symptoms,
then that's evidence,

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:31.520
and you update your probabilities.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.880
And maybe this 1% would
change to something higher,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.090
and that would change the numbers around.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.780
But the principle is the same,
you get evidence and

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.020
you update your probabilities
using Bayes' rule.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.060
And here's one really crucial and

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.390
beautiful fact about Bayes' rule,
it has a certain coherency property.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:57.570
And I kinda work out the math of this in
one of the strategic practice problems,

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.410
but let me just tell you
the intuition right now.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:06.050
Suppose that you get two pieces of
evidence, not just one, suppose you

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.840
are investigating a crime and
there's two possibilities.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.674
Either you get two clues and

00:31:12.674 --> 00:31:18.193
you update using Bayes' rule using the
intersection of those two events, okay?

00:31:18.193 --> 00:31:23.123
But another possibility would be,
you get one clue, and then you go off and

00:31:23.123 --> 00:31:25.010
get lunch and take a break.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.880
You come back after lunch,
you get another clue, okay?

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.990
So suppose that you updated your
probabilities using the first clue,

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.470
and then you come back later and
get the second clue, update again.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.348
You'll get the same thing, so as long as,
so you can update it more than one step,

00:31:39.348 --> 00:31:40.990
you can update all at once.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:46.280
You can update in either order, it's
always gonna be completely consistent.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.509
So Bayes' rule is coherent in that sense,
that whatever evidence you get,

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:55.203
one piece at a time or
all at once or some combination.

00:31:55.203 --> 00:31:57.980
The end result is gonna
be what's the probability

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.560
of the thing you're interested
in given the evidence you have.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:05.486
So that's really nice.

00:32:05.486 --> 00:32:10.472
So just a couple quick
warnings about common mistakes

00:32:10.472 --> 00:32:13.580
with conditional probability.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:19.458
And then we can do another example, So

00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:23.609
I call these biohazards,
basically just common mistakes.

00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:26.634
But they are hazardous to your
health if you make them, so

00:32:26.634 --> 00:32:28.710
you have to be really careful.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.350
These are common mistakes
with conditional probability.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.518
So 1 is the one we just talked about,

00:32:36.518 --> 00:32:40.964
confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A).

00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:48.732
And we know that Bayes' rule is
how you can connect these two, but

00:32:48.732 --> 00:32:50.360
they're not the same thing.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.870
Sometimes this is called
the prosecutor's fallacy.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.054
And if you wanna find examples of this,
you can just search online for

00:32:58.054 --> 00:32:59.544
prosecutor's fallacy.

00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:01.917
That's kind of unfair to prosecutors,

00:33:01.917 --> 00:33:04.928
because defense attorneys
make the same mistake.

00:33:04.928 --> 00:33:09.134
Doctor's make the same mistake, people
make that mistake all the time in everyday

00:33:09.134 --> 00:33:11.820
life, so
it's unfair to just pick on prosecutors.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.363
The reason it's called
the prosecutor's fallacy is that it's

00:33:16.363 --> 00:33:18.221
a common situation that.

00:33:18.221 --> 00:33:20.861
And maybe sometimes the prosecutor
does it deliberately, and

00:33:20.861 --> 00:33:23.690
maybe sometimes it's cuz
they don't know this stuff.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:28.689
But it's the mistake of,
if you're deciding a criminal case,

00:33:28.689 --> 00:33:33.319
what you care about is
the probability that the defendant is

00:33:33.319 --> 00:33:36.480
guilty given all the evidence, right?

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.858
And the mistake would be focusing entirely
on the probability of the evidence,

00:33:40.858 --> 00:33:41.913
given innocence.

00:33:41.913 --> 00:33:45.944
And you want the probability of
innocence given evidence, right, so

00:33:45.944 --> 00:33:47.800
those two things get confused.

00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:52.292
Let me mention one legal example,

00:33:52.292 --> 00:33:58.200
which is a very sad true story
called the Sally Clark case.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.930
This is an extreme example, but there are
many other legal cases that are similar in

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:08.810
flavor, in varying degrees,
similar in spirit to this one.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.540
This is an especially sad, true story.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:17.410
So Sally Clark was a British
woman who had, two of her babies

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:22.390
both died for mysterious,
unexplained reasons.

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:27.850
So they were calling it like SIDS,
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:31.580
That basically just meant the two babies
died and they had no explanation.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:37.262
She was convicted of
murdering her two children.

00:34:37.262 --> 00:34:44.420
And here's basically the total evidence
that was put forward against her, okay?

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:50.550
So the prosecution got some so-called
expert to come up to testify.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:56.900
And that expert said, assuming that
she's innocent, the probability

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.940
of a baby just spontaneously dying for
no apparent reason.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.592
The so called expert,
said that the probability is 1 in 8500,

00:35:04.592 --> 00:35:08.576
I don't know where he got that number
from, but let's just accept that.

00:35:08.576 --> 00:35:12.096
Said there is only a 1 in 8500 chance
that the baby is just going to die

00:35:12.096 --> 00:35:14.419
mysteriously, assuming it's not murdered.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.120
But she had two babies and they both died,

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.480
which is obviously a terrible tragedy for
her.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.110
So he said, okay, well,
there was another one.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:29.063
So that's 1 over 8500 times 1 over 8500,

00:35:29.063 --> 00:35:32.357
which is about 1 in 73 million.

00:35:32.357 --> 00:35:36.846
So the first thing that's wrong with this
ties in with what were doing last time,

00:35:36.846 --> 00:35:38.115
about independence.

00:35:38.115 --> 00:35:42.784
That assumes independence,
which is very questionable here.

00:35:42.784 --> 00:35:44.310
Because it's not really,

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.422
maybe there's some genetic factor that
caused the first baby to die, and

00:35:48.422 --> 00:35:52.697
then the second baby had similar genetic
characteristics that led to that.

00:35:52.697 --> 00:35:57.597
So that assumes independence, which
there's absolutely no justification for

00:35:57.597 --> 00:35:59.867
assuming independence here.

00:35:59.867 --> 00:36:03.480
But even, let's just assume independence
for the sake of argument, and

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.523
let's assume that we agree with these
numbers, so it's 1 in 73 million.

00:36:07.523 --> 00:36:10.027
Even then,
since she was convicted based on this.

00:36:10.027 --> 00:36:11.583
They said, there is only 1, and

00:36:11.583 --> 00:36:15.150
basically they were saying there's a 1 in
73 million chance that she's innocent.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.285
So that's beyond a reasonable doubt, or

00:36:17.285 --> 00:36:21.560
whatever the British equivalent of that
is, so she was convicted and went to jail.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.090
But that's the prosecutor's fallacy,
right?

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:28.790
Because the relevant information is not,

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.905
the relevant thing we want to compute is

00:36:35.905 --> 00:36:40.230
P(innocence|evidence), not
the other way around.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.815
So even if you accept this number,
that's evidence given innocence, right?

00:36:45.815 --> 00:36:48.820
How are those things related, well,
they're related by Bayes' rule.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:53.882
So we could do P(evidence|innocence)
times P(innocence) over P(evidence),

00:36:53.882 --> 00:36:56.943
and I'm not gonna try to
do a calculation with that.

00:36:56.943 --> 00:36:58.923
But notice that if you write that down,

00:36:58.923 --> 00:37:01.600
you're gonna have a term
that's P(innocence).

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.278
That's the prior probability of innocence,

00:37:04.278 --> 00:37:08.615
that's the probability of innocence
before we have any evidence, okay?

00:37:08.615 --> 00:37:13.227
Now there are billions of
mothers in the world, a vast,

00:37:13.227 --> 00:37:17.949
vast majority of them do not
murder their babies, okay?

00:37:17.949 --> 00:37:23.540
So the prior probability of innocence
is extremely close to 1, okay?

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.190
So there's a trade-off between
the prior probability, versus how

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:33.900
extreme this number is, that completely
got ignored, and she went to prison.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.910
And later it sort of got
exposed that this was wrong and

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.970
it sort of got overturned, but
by then she'd spent years in prison.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:47.590
And basically, I think she died shortly
after being released from prison,

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.920
just because she was too
miserable from that.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.450
I mean, it's just an unimaginable trauma.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.320
So that was one extreme case, but
there are other cases like that.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.107
In fact, I brought two books today.

00:37:58.107 --> 00:38:00.704
The first one is called
Statistical Science in the Courtroom,

00:38:00.704 --> 00:38:03.110
this is a really, really good book.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.670
The other one is called Statistics for
Lawyers, this is also a really,

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.400
really good book.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.480
I'm not gonna talk much about them,
but if any of you are interested,

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.259
you can come look at them after class.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.210
So there are a lot of important
connections between statistics and

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.720
the law.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.780
And in fact,
we have a student in this class here,

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.600
who's organizing a group at Harvard
to focus on statistics and the law.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.010
So if anyone is interested, you can let me
know and I'll put you In touch with him.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.183
Okay, so
that's called the prosecutor's fallacy,

00:38:32.183 --> 00:38:34.731
although it's not
restricted to prosecutors.

00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:39.699
Now, another one that I wanted to
emphasize is one that I was just

00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:43.665
leading into when I mentioned
this idea of priors.

00:38:43.665 --> 00:38:47.830
So I wanna tell you what the word
prior and the word posterior mean.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.713
So the second mistake is confusing P(A),

00:38:53.713 --> 00:38:56.680
that's called the prior.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:03.410
Prior means before we have evidence,
posterior means after we have evidence.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:12.110
With P(A|B),
which is called the posterior.

00:39:16.178 --> 00:39:20.609
So one instance of that is,
sometimes students,

00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:23.984
if the problem says that A occurs, and

00:39:23.984 --> 00:39:28.743
then they would be very
tempted to write P(A) = 1.

00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:32.293
And I ask, why did you write P(A) = 1?

00:39:32.293 --> 00:39:36.578
And the student says,
because it's given that A occurred, okay?

00:39:36.578 --> 00:39:40.852
But that's completely wrong and
leads to completely wrong arguments.

00:39:40.852 --> 00:39:48.768
P(A|A) =1,
that's the key thing to keep in mind.

00:39:48.768 --> 00:39:52.074
That's always gonna be true,
given that A occurred, P(A) = 1.

00:39:52.074 --> 00:39:55.890
But if we just write the P(A),
we're not assuming that.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.680
So the problem they say we
observe that they occurred and

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.380
that's saying we're interested
in computing stuff given A but

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.750
doesn't mean just write P(A)=1,
P(A) given A is 1.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:09.280
So when you're writing down conditional
probability calculations you have to very,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.290
very careful about what should you
put to the left of this bar and

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:17.800
what do you put to the right of this bar,
okay?

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:26.130
And one more common mistake
with probability is confusing

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:34.210
independence with
conditional independence.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.120
And I haven't yet defined the term
conditional independence, so

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.230
I'll do that now.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:41.560
But I'm actually kind of assuming that
you already understand what conditional

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.050
independence means.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.690
That is,
you should be able to guess what it means.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:45.690
I'll write it down.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.170
And you can see if that
agrees with your guess.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.920
Confusing independence with
conditional independence.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.920
This is a more subtle mistake
than these first two, but

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:04.870
also comes up a lot in practice and
can lead you to completely wrong results.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.460
So I want to talk about this distinction.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.119
Independence versus
conditional independence.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.670
So, first let me write the definition
of conditional independence.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.310
So we say that,
this is the definition, but

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.620
it should be kind of
an intuitive definition.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.970
We say that a and b,
this if we have events a and

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:37.020
b, are conditionally independent.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.020
Now we can't just say
conditionally independent

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.390
unless it's clear what
we're conditioning on.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:47.290
So to say this precisely, we would
say conditionally independent given

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:52.920
some other event, we'll just call that C,
so C is what we're conditioning on.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.570
We say they're conditionally independent
given C, and then the definition should be

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.120
obvious, just write down
the definition of independence,

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.280
it's just assume everything
is conditional on C.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.134
So it's just completely analogous,
everything's conditioned on C.

00:42:06.134 --> 00:42:09.875
So I can write that down immediately.

00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:15.120
P(A intersect B given C) =
P(A given C)P(B given C).

00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:22.363
Okay, so that's the definition,
just looks like independence,

00:42:22.363 --> 00:42:24.870
except I put given C everywhere.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:29.470
And so a natural question then,
is does independence imply conditional

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:34.100
independence, and does conditional
independence imply independence?

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.620
So, let's talk about those two questions.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.891
So, first of all,
does conditional independence,

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:52.664
Let's say given C, but given whatever,

00:42:52.664 --> 00:42:57.393
imply unconditional independence?

00:42:57.393 --> 00:43:00.690
And the answer is no, not in general.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.790
So if they're conditionally independent
they may or may not be independent.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:09.194
And there's an example that I worked out
in detail on the strategic practice, so

00:43:09.194 --> 00:43:11.721
I'll just talk about
that example briefly but

00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:14.534
you can read that example
if you haven't already.

00:43:14.534 --> 00:43:16.090
That was the chess player example.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.820
Chess opponent of unknown strength,

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:27.160
this is a very common
situation in real life, right.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.160
You're going to, it doesn't have to be
chess obviously, that's just an example.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.360
Chess opponent of unknown, so
you can make up your own example.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.210
And that's one that I
like since I like chess.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.740
Unknown strength.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.590
So you're playing chess with
someone you've never met before.

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:45.880
You assume you don't know that person's
rating or any information at all,

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.980
so you have no idea about how
good that person is, right?

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.750
Well, Suppose you play a series of chess

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:58.600
games with that person, same person,
and then you play multiple games.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.370
Now it's possible that
after you win the first

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:05.730
few then that person gets demoralized and
collapses and starts playing badly.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:08.100
Well it's possible they get mad and
they think harder and

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.350
they wanna take revenge and
things like that.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:12.930
Ignore all that cuz I'm just
coming up with an example.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:16.480
So let's assume that conditional on

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.270
how strong of a player that person is,
all the games are independent.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:22.760
That's reasonable.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.287
But that does not imply that the,

00:44:28.484 --> 00:44:32.140
That doesn't imply that the games
are unconditionally independent if you

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.720
don't condition on how
strong that person is.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.020
Because if you think about it, suppose
that you win the first five games or

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.470
something, okay.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.950
At that point you'd be pretty confident
that you are a better chess player than

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.460
that person, right.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.350
So therefore the earlier
games give you evidence.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:53.550
So even though the games are seemingly
independent, the earlier games

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:58.320
give you evidence that helps you assess
the strength of your opponent, right.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.020
So that gives you evidence that's relevant
for predicting the later outcomes.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.460
Independence would mean
that the earlier games

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:07.460
that you played give you no information
whatsoever that helps you predict

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.510
the outcomes of the later games, okay?

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.830
But actually the earlier games give you
a good sense of how strong that person is,

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.290
so that's the distinction.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:23.750
So it may happen that the games
are conditionally independent.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.790
I'll say game outcomes are conditionally
independent, but not independent.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:33.020
And when I say conditionally independent,

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.480
I mean conditionally independent
given the strength of your opponent.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.400
So, that's one example, but
it would be good for practice for

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.069
you to try to come up
with your own examples.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:51.030
Given strength of opponent,
but not independent.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:55.140
So that's an example in this direction.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.960
The last thing for today though, would
be what about the converse questions.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.450
So let's talk about that.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:04.028
So they're conditionally independent
given strength of opponent, but

00:46:04.028 --> 00:46:05.825
not independent unconditionally.

00:46:08.792 --> 00:46:11.117
This is a fairly common structure for

00:46:11.117 --> 00:46:15.550
this kind of thing where there's
something that's unknown, okay?

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:17.230
And if we knew that thing,

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.990
it may be reasonable to assume
independence conditionally, but

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:25.570
without that thing, then the earlier
trials give us data that we can use, okay?

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:26.660
So that's the distinction there.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:31.320
All right, last thing is what
about the reverse question?

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:38.240
So I wanna know does independence
imply conditional independence?

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:46.768
So if A and
B are independent without any conditions,

00:46:46.768 --> 00:46:52.267
does independence imply
conditional independence given C?

00:46:56.249 --> 00:46:58.283
Okay, so that's a natural question.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:07.100
Given C in general, is this true?

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:10.610
So this is unconditional independence,
does that imply conditional independence?

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.670
Okay, and if you have to guess how of
you would guess the answer is yes?

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.690
Okay, how many of you would guess no?

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.810
Okay, well, the answer is no.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:27.350
So, let's talk about why.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:29.750
It's not obvious,
it sounds like unconditional independence,

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.310
that's like a stronger condition.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.580
If it's unconditional,
surely it should be conditional.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.925
It's more subtle than this case,
try and come up with.

00:47:39.925 --> 00:47:44.185
But this is also a very,
very common phenomenon in real life

00:47:44.185 --> 00:47:48.115
when you have some phenomenon
with multiple causes.

00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:50.715
Okay, so
if you have something that gonna occur and

00:47:50.715 --> 00:47:55.115
cause by multiple things then
you can see this kind of thing.

00:47:55.115 --> 00:47:57.305
So just to give a counter example,

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:07.400
supposed the fire alarm goes off, so
let's say F is fire alarm goes off.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:14.570
Hopefully it won't go off right now so
we can finish doing this example.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:16.770
Okay, now suppose that there are two,
just for

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:22.030
simplicity, suppose there only two things
that can cause the fire alarm to go off.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.051
So, that could be caused
by two possibilities.

00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:33.530
Either, actually, let me call this A for
alarm, and let's use F for fire.

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.650
So, it's caused by one of two things,
either F,

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:38.730
that is actually is a fire, right.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:40.630
Or, well let's say,

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.778
I'll suppose the other possible
cause is someone is making popcorn.

00:48:44.778 --> 00:48:50.310
Popcorn, and again, do not call your
events P, so I'll call it C for corn.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:55.470
And supposed that making popcorn is
completely independent of creating a fire.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.600
Okay, but suppose that either of these
two things will cause the fire alarm to

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.190
go off.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:03.630
So suppose, that's an assumption, but
I'm just constructing an example so

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:04.660
I can assume that.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.870
Suppose that F and
C are independent, okay?

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:13.830
But the key observation,
what's the probability that,

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:20.020
what's the probability that someone,
that there's a fire,

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:24.950
given that the alarm goes off,
and no one's making popcorn?

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:27.354
Well according to what I just said,
that's 1.

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:32.900
Because if the alarm goes off, then there
are two explanations, either this or

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.000
this, just like Sherlock Holmes said,
right.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.650
If you eliminate all
the other explanations, so

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.565
you eliminate the popcorn explanation,
it must be that there's a fire.

00:49:40.565 --> 00:49:44.230
So they are independent,

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:50.410
they're not conditionally independent
given that the alarm goes off.

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:51.900
Initially these are independent.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.560
As soon as the alarm goes off,
then you wanna try to explain that, and

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.870
they become dependent, so given A.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.930
All right, so that's all for today.
