00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.020
Guys, today's video
is sponsored by NordVPN.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.080
In today's video,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.200
we want to find out
what ice melt is,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.000
how it's different from salt,
and if you can melt it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.980
[Music]

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.860
This bag is ice melt.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.200
It comes in
pretty large quantities

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.300
because it's usually used
for spreading on ice

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.660
and snow to melt it,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.100
so that you can walk on it,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.220
and not have snow
and ice to deal with.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.960
And this is just regular salt.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.220
This particular stuff is meant
for making ice cream,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.780
but it should work pretty well.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.349
For rock salt, historically,

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:41.400
has been used for
melting snow and ice.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.780
But we now have
better newer compositions

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.900
that we call ice melt,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.307
and those are thrown
on the sidewalk,

00:00:47.307 --> 00:00:48.992
and you get rid of all
your snow and your ice.

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:50.155
It makes it safer to walk on.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:52.000
So we want to look at a few
of the differences,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.947
test which one
actually works better,

00:00:53.947 --> 00:00:55.300
regular salt or ice melt,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.050
and then we want
to see what happens

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.400
if we heat up the ice melt.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.780
Will it melt
through snow better?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.800
Can we get it into a liquid

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.700
that we just like
pour onto the snow,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.900
and melt it all at once?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
Lots of experiments.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.440
Lots of things to learn.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.251
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.901
We're going to take
some ice melt,

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.740
test its melting properties
versus regular rock salt,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.740
and then see what happens to it
if we heated up or melt it.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.600
All right.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.700
First, let's just take
a look at these.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.260
The rock salt here.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.040
This is sodium chloride.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.440
This is table salt.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.660
Basically, it's just
larger chunks of it.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.700
This particular ice melt
is a combination

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.100
of magnesium chloride
and calcium chloride.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.680
Calcium chloride and magnesium
chloride are supposed to work

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.320
better than sodium chloride
for melting ice and snow.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.970
That's the first thing
that we want to test.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.100
We're going to get a tray
full of both of them,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.980
and then sprinkle some
of both types of salt on top,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.160
and we'll see
which one melt it faster.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.150
But even before we do that,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.250
let's throw some ice melt
into the furnace,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.500
and get that melting.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.360
[Music]

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.800
Okay, we've got two handfuls,
about the same size.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.900
Regular salt that
Calli is holding,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.600
and ice melt salt
that I'm holding.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.000
Now, we're just going
to sprinkle them

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.900
over these trays of snow.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:16.020
[Music]

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.535
I stand by mine
is prettier than yours.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.460
I think you are correct.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.198
While we're waiting
for that salt to do its thing,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.400
what do you think we should do?

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.200
You want to build a snowman?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.440
It doesn't have to be a snowman.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:04:29.560
[Music]

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.420
Since its frosting,
you can lick your brush.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.160
In snow, probably
not a good idea.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.580
[Music]

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.000
Our snowman is
looking pretty good.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.200
So before we take a look
at the results of the ice melt,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.904
let's take a second

00:04:47.904 --> 00:04:50.740
to talk about our sponsor
for this video, NordVPN.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.080
NordVPN provides internet

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.900
protection on all
of your devices.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.580
Computer, mobile,
both Android and iOS.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.680
This is an app
that's super easy to use.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.211
You login, and it connects
your internet through a server

00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.400
in a different country.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.067
This protects your information,

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:08.185
makes it harder
for people to get in,

00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:11.160
steal your valuable IDs,
credit card information,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.140
anything you might have
on your device,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.200
and really keeps you safe.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.600
There are a couple other things

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.361
that I really love
about it as well.

00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:20.411
If you're using
peer-to-peer file-sharing,

00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:21.100
that's something you

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.480
can do while protecting
your information,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.300
and preventing anyone from
looking at what you're doing.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.443
If you want to watch
a streaming service

00:05:28.443 --> 00:05:29.400
from another country,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.060
you can choose what country to
connect through through NordVPN,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.300
so you can log on
and be like, hey,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.500
I want to check out
this streaming service,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.000
what they've got in Germany,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.180
or England, or Russia,
wherever you want to watch from,

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.020
and it'll connect you
to the internet in that country,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.600
so that when you log on to
your favorite streaming service,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.500
it shows you the shows
available in that country.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.160
It's a really cool program.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.000
One of the things that
VPNs are most useful

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.800
for is security.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.000
If you go to a hotel
or a restaurant,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.833
and you want to use the public
Wi-Fi there, there are people

00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:00.393
that want to steal your data.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:03.300
They want to take all of
your info off of your devices.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.400
Your phone has a lot
of information on you,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.100
and if you log
onto a public Wi-Fi,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.000
people can get in there,
and take it from your phone.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.500
If you're using NordVPN,
your phone is protected.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.940
People can't get in
and steal your data,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.620
with your traffic being rerouted
through a private server.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.620
Right now, Nord
has a deal going.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.660
Check out the link

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.980
or go to nordvps.com/random

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.830
to get 75% off of
a three year membership,

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.100
and use the code "random"

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.060
to get an extra free
month on top of it.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.640
Ice melt.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.400
That's exciting.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.300
What does it do?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.020
Oh, it's warm like summer.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:57.580
[Music]

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.400
Does Olaf know
what snow melt does to snow?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.300
I'm going to tell him.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.740
Don't you dare.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.220
[Music]

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.260
Whoa!

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:35.860
[Music]

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.500
So, it turns out,
liquid hot ice melt--

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.300
He's fine.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.840
Is not really good for snowman.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.100
He's, he's fine.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.800
Every--

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.600
This is fine.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.342
He's okay.

00:07:45.342 --> 00:07:46.500
Everything's fine.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.600
Our generic unnamed
non-trademarked snowman

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.920
sustained a little bit of damage,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.500
but I think we can
probably fix him back up.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.800
He's..
He doesn't need fixing.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.133
He's perfect just the way he is.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.440
Yeah, untouched.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.217
Absolutely.

00:07:58.217 --> 00:07:59.100
He's beautiful.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.720
I am wonderful.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.840
Hooah!

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.700
She's become the villain.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:13.780
[Music]

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.500
Do you want to break a Snowman?

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.600
Bye generic snowman.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.320
Musical snowman
who loves summer.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.300
He wanted to know
what happened with heat.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.520
We showed him.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.820
Our two trays of snow
have now been sitting there

00:08:30.824 --> 00:08:33.400
with the salt and ice melt
in them for over an hour,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.760
and what do you think?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.217
They look fairly similar to me.

00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:37.100
Fairly similar.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.701
I think that the one
with the rock salt

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:40.722
is actually slumping
a little bit more naturally.

00:08:40.722 --> 00:08:42.301
Where as you can see,
the pock marks

00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:43.700
of the ice melt is caused here.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.700
But you mentioned

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.600
that the differences
in cold can affect

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.900
how these are reacting.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.336
It's true.

00:08:48.336 --> 00:08:51.000
The rock salt itself is going
to help get rid of snow and ice.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.200
The main advantage
of using the ice melt,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.760
I mean, magnesium chloride
and the calcium chloride,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.300
those are supposed to help
keep melting the ice

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.360
at an even lower temperature.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.318
And what's happening here
is not melting the ice

00:09:03.318 --> 00:09:04.637
in the traditional sense.

00:09:04.637 --> 00:09:06.800
We actually have
a chemical reaction going

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.518
on that's lowering
the freezing point of the ice,

00:09:09.518 --> 00:09:11.966
so that it no longer
is able to stay solid

00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:13.400
at the same temperature.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.980
The sodium chloride
disassociates into two ions,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.240
but calcium chloride

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.840
and magnesium chloride
disassociate into three.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.380
The individual ions
interact with the water,

00:09:23.384 --> 00:09:26.100
and prevent it from
crystallizing so more ions,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.800
means more water and less ice.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.058
