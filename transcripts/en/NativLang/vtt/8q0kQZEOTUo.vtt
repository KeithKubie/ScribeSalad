1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.180
This ancient message took centuries to crack.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.550
We could always read this message.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.900
We still have no clue how to read this message. Why

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.740
<v 1>[inaudible]?</v>

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.550
<v 0>What if history were hiding something from you? Would you want to know about it?</v>

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.500
Well, if you stick with me a few minutes,

7
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.840
we'll start getting you to think like a decipher.

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.340
Then you can join the club and hold a flickering lab of to an old wall and with

9
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:29.960
your perceptive gaze, not slowly and enlightened appreciation of the symbols.

10
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.100
I'll bring the symbols and techniques you're buying the hat and the lamp though.

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.270
If you stay for this series, we'll tell tales and decipher it.

12
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:43.271
That take us from the sands of Egypt through the Central American jungle to the

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.910
middle of the Pacific.

14
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.910
You'll work alongside history's great decoders and some crackpots in their

15
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:52.040
relentless attempts to recover voices long vanished.

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.120
We already saw with decipherment is not like cryptography or crypt analysis,

17
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.780
but what is it? Yes,

18
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:04.310
like decipherment is something we do with a message we can read.

19
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.710
That was a bit vague. Let's go again.

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.870
Decipherment is an operation performed on an unknown message and it requires two

21
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.290
components. First, a script, oh writing system.

22
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.440
These visual etched, inked, carved,

23
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:22.880
whatever symbols that were eager to read mocking us silently across the ages are

24
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:23.714
called glyphs.

25
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.350
The meaningful units we're trying to identify among these glyphs are called

26
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.410
graphemes. The other thing we need is a language.

27
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.840
If there's no language underlying the symbols at all,

28
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:36.560
there's no linguistic message to decipher some claim.

29
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:40.040
This is true of the indice scripts or the tartare via tablets.

30
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.020
Before this video,

31
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.520
you talked about decipherment the way people normally do discipling symbols to

32
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.700
dig up the hidden ancient message inside of them.

33
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.410
We built on that by admitting that we have to identify the messages writing

34
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:57.050
system and its language to unearth its meaning.

35
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.790
That's our first understanding of decipherment. Let's call it model one,

36
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.130
but if you're joining our secret club,

37
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.070
you have to change the way you look at decipherment.

38
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.560
Decipherment buying certain language bits to certain writing bits and sees if

39
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:13.520
they coordinate,

40
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.790
if the message reads naturally with that writing system and that language model

41
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:22.040
number one, I really don't like these names. Let's see.

42
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.150
This one has layers are kind of hidden guts,

43
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.180
and this one is matching pieces.

44
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.170
Hidden guts is more romantic, more or regular,

45
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.700
but what happens when some hack decipher comes along and challenges you're

46
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:40.940
reading hidden guts tells you to appear through the gruffy.

47
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.570
Mckay's like a kind of sear sage matching pieces invites you to compare texts

48
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:48.380
and find a best fit.

49
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.540
It even invites predictions when we find texts and more texts in the language.

50
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.280
It's a fresh starting point for thinking about how to decipher,

51
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.210
but what can you decipher? What can you decipher?

52
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.480
That's actually a great question for next time.

53
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.530
[inaudible].
