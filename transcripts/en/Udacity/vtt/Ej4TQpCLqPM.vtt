00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.830
So we've been talking about all these
different ways to monetize your app

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.960
from premium to freemium options.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.170
But sometimes it can be difficult
to decide on a strategy.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.882
Wouldn't it be nice to get paid just
based on how much people liked your

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:12.479
game?

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.820
&gt;&gt; Yep, and Amazon has actually
created a monetization model

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.500
that tries to do just this.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.069
It's called Amazon Underground.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.280
&gt;&gt; Cool, tell me more about it.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.480
How can a game make
money off of likability?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.250
&gt;&gt; Well,
it's hard to measure likability.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.340
But we can get an idea of that based
on how often a game is played.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.800
So Amazon Underground
pays game developers

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.980
based on how much time
players spend in their game.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.480
&gt;&gt; That sounds pretty interesting.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.990
So every player would help
to monetize their game.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.890
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.410
Amazon Underground has a great
selection of premium apps and games for

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.900
free and
all in-app purchases are free, too.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.190
For example, you mentioned
playing Fruit Ninja before.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.420
And in the Underground version,
you can get all the stars and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.380
golden apples you want for free.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.150
They are still packaged in a store,
like in the original game fomat.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.380
But their price is zero.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.000
&gt;&gt; So
no other monetization models are used.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.570
That sounds really easy.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.930
But how much money can a developer
expect to make off of this model?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.655
&gt;&gt; Well, Underground has a per minute
payment rate which translates to

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:16.320
12 cents an hour.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.690
This can add up,
especially if you have a lot of players.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.090
&gt;&gt; What an interesting way to monetize.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.850
This is something to keep in mind
when you're designing your game.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.960
Different platforms may have
built-in monetization strategies.
