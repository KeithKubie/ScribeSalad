00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.560
Ellen, are you okay?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.220
Do you need anything else?

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.880
I'm great.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.580
Thank you.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.560
When do you think you'll be finished, so we can come back and get it?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.740
Probably about 9:30.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.620
Okay.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.140
Thank you.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.020
Sure.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.320
I don't think that they will be happy at the
Foundation with having the Walker Evans next

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.540
to the Cezanne, but maybe we could keep the
Walker Evans here alone on that wall and bring

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.260
the Hopper somewhere here.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.700
No, I think that, you mean...

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700
Changing.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.080
So, this way the Hopper...

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.920
It's keeping the small wall for the...

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.680
And the Walker Evans isn't...

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.600
Oh, on the same wall.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.280
On the same wall, yeah.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.920
Okay, sure.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.460
That works, yep.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.520
And that works better.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.200
And you know, that makes sense to have the
Hopper right at the beginning...

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.920
that's the first painting that entered the collection.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920
That makes sense.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.460
So, number one, it's important to check everything,
make sure the components of the mannequin

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.820
are correct and that you check off and record
on the DK display order sheet that we have

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.220
received it and that it corresponds with all
the information.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.480
We have like 15-20 mannequins that we need
to unpack for today.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.840
And the first thing I want to do is once you
open it, let's get all of this packing material

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.600
and put it in a trash bag.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.340
Sometimes there'll be paperwork and also a
little box of touch up paint or material so

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.600
let's just make sure none of that is in here.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.340
We want to make sure that it has all the pieces.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.200
It has the torso, the hands, the legs, the
arms.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.420
And for the suits, you need to make sure it's
either men or female, man or woman because

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.780
we have men and women suits.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.760
And we have Armani men and women suits.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:29.100
Somebody attached something funky here,
like this linen tape to patch it, to patch

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.820
the edge, but it's not doing anything anymore.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.560
The adhesive got all, you know, dry and it's
not doing anything.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:46.040
So, in order for me to do a good repair now,
I have to lift this up and introduce little

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.140
things to start closing it up.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.720
I'm going to do it slowly until I get it together.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.660
And I just keep going back to when people
are out there by the escalator, they just

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.000
don't know there's a show here.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.280
There's just nothing and like with people
milling around and the reflection of the glass.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.000
It's just so hidden and we've had that problem
with this gallery for years, you know, people

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.540
saying they couldn't find the Warhol show.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.140
They couldn't find the Pollock show.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.040
Sure, sure.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:03.340
It's just like...you have to kind of, you
have to just randomly wander pretty close

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.540
to here in order to know that it's here.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.220
Sure.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:23.260
If we have our weird acid green yet to be
discovered and that begins...here.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.260
I'm sorry.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.640
That begins like there and then this is just,
it's like a green.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.400
This is, I'm not making creative use of this
space, because it feels like you pass through

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.320
and then to me it feels like you want either
the title or the blow-up on that wall.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:48.040
Like the head on one and then but I do think you
would want outside...

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.340
What do you want outside?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.640
Outside a little half something.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.800
Uh-huh.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.040
Uh-huh.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.620
Here.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.120
No?

00:07:59.160 --> 00:07:59.940
Yeah.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.060
That makes more sense because then they're
not like in your field of vision at the same

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.780
time.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.780
Yeah.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.660
Just a little, I think because you would see
that coming up.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.260
You would see it coming this way.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.460
It wouldn't have to be much.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.120
Just â€œMax Ernst: Beyond Painting," tiny
arrow.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480
Yeah.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.140
And then you round the corner and it's green.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.420
And then you're here and you're thinking,
"Oh, I need to look for Max Ernst things."

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.820
And it's right there.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.820
And you've got it.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.600
That sounds good to me.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.060
Watch your sides.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.200
Good. Good.
