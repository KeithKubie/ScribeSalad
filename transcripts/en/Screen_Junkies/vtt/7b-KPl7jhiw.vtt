00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.429
From a production company that sounds like
they make porn

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.379
comes a film with the same production value
as a porn.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.890
In the low budget hit that transformed the
horror genre

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.880
into straight up torture porn.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.780
Saw.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.779
See Saw, a great idea for a student short
film that somehow got

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.920
stretched into 6 feature length sequels,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.730
two videogames,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.510
and one super fun rollercoaster!

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.780
When two strangers wake up in your typical
Taco Bell bathroom

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.579
the only way out is to patiently use the various
saws,

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.390
slabs,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.420
and guns to weaken their chains until they' re
able to break free.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.489
But instead of the obvious, prepare for 100
minutes of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849
reminiscing,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.920
"I don't remember how I got here."

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.800
playing catch,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.500
and dramatically reaching for stuff.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.280
"My family needs me!"

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.000
Almost...have another...idea...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.400
Nope!

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.540
Tremble before the Jigsaw killer,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.090
a psychopath who combines the traps
of Wile E. Coyote

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.170
with the terrifying puppetry of Jeff Dunham.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.960
"Hello, Amanda. I want to play a game."

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.130
Come, saw, and conquer the first in a long
line of cheaply made gornos, featuring

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.140
the claustrophobia of being trapped in a room

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.630
because there wasn't the budget for more
locations,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.770
the panic of the fast-paced editing

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.240
because there wasn't the budget for better
effects,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.229
and the cringe-factor of watching the movie' s
screenwriter try to act

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.579
"You could be the one who put me in this room!"

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.329
"The same thing happened to me, see!"

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.720
"Lawrence, calm down! There must be a way
out of this!"

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.720
because there wasn't the budget for professional
actors.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.789
So settle in for the one that started it all,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.110
full of cool, well thought out traps

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.530
that the sequels turn into complete parodies
of themselves.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.760
"You must press both buttons at once in the
box before you. However, in doing so, you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.739
will give a sacrifice of your own. Two can
live, four will die --"

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.499
Ugh, what the f*** is this guy talking about?

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.419
And horrific violence happening off-screen

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:41.419
that the sequels turn into the star of 
the franchise.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.480
Who watches this stuff?!

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.820
Go to starring, go to starring!

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.260
Starring...

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.339
Kristen Bell

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:15.620
Robin Hood: Man in Chain

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.510
Dental Plan (Lisa Needs Braces)

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.549
Awesome Mix, Vol. 1

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.650
Rush Hour

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.049
This Guy

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.719
The Bad Guy From Lost

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.589
I Think She's On Parenthood?

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:29.599
Filth

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.949
and Cher

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.889
Saw 1: You've Saw Them All

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.880
Hey, at least it's not a found footage movie!
