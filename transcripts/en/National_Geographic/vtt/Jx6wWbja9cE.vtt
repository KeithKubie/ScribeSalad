00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:05.305
( intro music )

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:15.981 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:18.484 line:0%
So, a lot happens, a lot
starts here in Washington DC.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.553 line:0%
For me, it was my career,
there's a lot else

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.222 line:0%
that's going on here
too, which is that

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:24.624
Washington has the distinction

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.826
of being one of the great
capitals of the world

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.528
for cocaine consumption.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.565
There is greater per
capita cocaine use here

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.268
particularly among
white collar workers,

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.769
second only to New York.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.637
So, what I want to do is begin

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:42.241
in this point of consumption,
of cocaine consumption

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.844
and take you back down
the commodity chain.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.680
Not to where we typically
think of

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.517
when we see these crazy maps
full of arrows pointing north.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.953
Not back to where coca
is grown and cocaine

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.689
is produced in South America,
but rather

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.325
I want to take you halfway
back down the commodity chain

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:02.128
to those areas hiding
under those red arrows

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.263
in Central America.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.498
Those spaces through which
cocaine is merely moved

00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:10.470
like packages in a DHL hub,
these are trans-shipment zones,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.439
through which cocaine moves
on its journey northward

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.575
to markets such as those

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.677
I'm sure
just outside the door here.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.546
So, I want
to take you specifically

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:23.750
to look at a region
in Eastern Honduras.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.785
It's known
as the Mosquito Coast region

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.388
of Eastern Honduras
and Nicaragua

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.789
and this is an area

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.725
of tremendous biological
and cultural diversity.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.594
It has many protected areas,

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:37.997
internationally recognized
world heritage sites and so on,

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.732
and I want
to take you specifically

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.502
into the communities
of the Tawahka people.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:45.237
They're one of Honduras'
smallest ethnic groups,

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:46.872
fewer than 2000 people.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:50.643
They're regionally known for
the spectacular dugout canoes

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:53.279
that they produce
almost entirely by hand,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.283
no chainsaws here,
just pure axe and ads.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.653
And I want to take you
through the ways

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:04.423
that I've become aware that this
is an area that is being

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:07.560
both culturally and
ecologically devastated

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.030
by both the consumption
here in the US of cocaine,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.535
but also what I would argue are
the US' deeply flawed policies

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:19.606
with regards
to the global war on drugs.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.175
Alright, so how did
I get into drugs? Well...

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:25.344
( laughter )

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:27.213
After working
the National Geographic

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.448
I went to live in Eastern
Honduras for two years,

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:30.984
working on a research
project there

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.753
and that began a career
as a geography professor,

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.621
by which I've been very
privileged to be able

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.624
to repeatedly return
to this place over time.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:42.228
And that has allowed
a wonderful opportunity

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.665
to really understand the very
dynamic relationships between

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:49.068
people there and the forests
with which they coexist.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.970
And I've learned a lot
about how forests

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.839
make people and people make
forests in this region.

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:54.773
And one of the things

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:57.977
that my repeat research trips
to the region had shown me,

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.346
and really convinced me of

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.983
was just how profoundly
resilient the Tawahka people

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:07.987
and the ecosystem which
defines them have been.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.756
And by resilient I
mean they have shown

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:13.092
a remarkable ability
to bounce back.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:16.062
For example, in the 1930s
their population

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:20.500
was devastated by
a smallpox epidemic.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.769
They were reduced
to about 100 people.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.204
And it was through the choices
made by women like

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.706
DoÃ±a Rufina here,
she was pushing 100 when

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:33.146
I saw her in 2011, she just
died before Christmas last year.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.748
Because there were so
few Tawahka men to marry,

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:40.419
she... among her six husbands--
Life is short...

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.654
( laughter )

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.022
in the region for men,

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:45.357
snakebite, disease
and other things.

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:47.460
Among her six husbands there
was not a single Tawahka man,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.929
but she raised all of
her children to speak

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.298
Tawahka and to learn
the Tawahka way.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:56.569
So, all of her children,
though genetically diverse,

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.472
incorporating much
non-Amerindian blood,

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:02.008
they nevertheless
speak Tawahka

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.844
and identify themselves
culturally as Tawahka.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.647
So, she and other women
like her have been

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:12.151
essential for passing on
what it is to be Tawahka.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:15.387
Tawahka have also been extremely
successful at bouncing back

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:19.057
from the threat of colonist
incursion into their territory.

00:04:19.057 --> 00:04:21.794
Savvy political leaders
like Edgardo Benitez

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.430
have been able to
organize international allies

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.500
to have in 1999
their territory declared

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.236
the Tawahka Asangni
Biosphere reserve.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.304
And then, perhaps most
impressively

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:35.908
after Hurricane Mitch wiped out
two of their communities and

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:40.613
almost all of their
horticultural and
agricultural lands,

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:44.150
decades worth of
agroforestry plots,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.319
they were able to
rebound in a way

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.188
that used the storm as
a window of opportunity

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.723
to reorganize their
agricultural activities

00:04:51.723 --> 00:04:54.626
and to, in fact, be more
sustainable planting

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.296
precious trees like
Mahogany for example.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.598
So, it was with funding
from the committee

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:01.934
for research and exploration
from National Geographic

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:05.338
that I returned in 2011
to Tawahka territory

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:08.541
thinking that I was going
to be able to research

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.710
the latest ways in which
they were manifesting

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.779
their cultural, their
socio-ecological resilience.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.782
I went down with an
undergraduate and a
graduate student

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:19.518
and it had been a while
since I'd been back,

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:22.121
I had two kids,
I had gotten tenure and

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.024
this had been my
longest time away.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:27.159
After three days of
traveling through the region

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.262
to get into the Tawahka
area by dugout canoe...

00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:33.166
This is the community
prior to our visit.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:36.202
This is what we saw.

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.404
We saw landscapes
just devastated.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:40.806
This is the site where
a community I'd known

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:42.675
and where I had eaten
my first monkey

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.944
and drunk all sorts of
fermented beverages...

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:48.414
( laughter )

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.783
...people were gone, I was
told they fled to Nicaragua.

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:54.487
Some of them were living
poor in the capital city.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.055
We saw patterns of
deforestation

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.624
I've never seen before right
down to the water's edge

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:01.827
on incredibly steep slopes
and when I talk to people

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:03.062
about what was going on,

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.665
they kept telling me
the same thing, "narcos."

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:11.236
Now, when I had lived in
this area in the mid-90s,

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:12.771
we heard planes in the night,

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.074
I mean, cocaine has been moving
through Central America

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:16.141
since the disco era

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:19.044
and I was able to use,

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:21.481
knowing the local language
and being able to talk to people

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.016
and the 20 years of trust
I've built up in this region

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.085
to really ask people
what was going on.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:29.722
Why were drugs, why was
the mere passage of drugs

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:32.425
through this area
having this effect?

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:35.127
And key to understanding
this is to understand

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:36.762
that when a plane lands

00:06:36.762 --> 00:06:40.366
and is unloaded of let's say,
700 kilos of cocaine,

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:43.236
the plane is burned,
that gives you immediately

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.404
an idea of how little the
plane is worth relative

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:48.474
to its cargo, it's just
not worth flying back.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.243
So what you see is an
absolute tsunami of money

00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:55.281
hitting these communities
that comes with,

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.150
that buys impunity
and that buys weapons.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.054
So, traffickers in this region
have been able to buy up

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:04.256
land from Tawahka and
other indigenous groups

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:06.625
and pay for the labor
to have that forest--

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:10.896
the forest lands
converted into cattle pasture.

00:07:10.896 --> 00:07:15.434
And they're doing it in huge
swaths, 500 hectares at a time.

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:19.071
And the question is why
would drug traffickers

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.207
want to be interested
in cattle ranches?

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:25.177
Well, these are untraceable
transactions right?

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:28.480
So, they're a wonderful
way to launder drug profits,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.849
otherwise known
as land laundering.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.585
And in fact, when
the US Treasury Department

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.988
froze the assets of a Honduran
trafficking organization,

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:39.291
they found that a lot
of the assets that they held

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:43.329
were in palm plantations
and cattle ranches.

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:44.797
So, it's a great way
to launder money,

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:48.767
but it's also a really excellent
way for criminal organizations

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:52.538
to diversify
their investment portfolios.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.640
They are good capitalists
like everyone else

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.843
and they are investing
in the tropical land rush

00:07:57.843 --> 00:08:00.612
driven in part by high
demand for ethanol,

00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:03.048
which is fueling, literally,

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:05.284
the expansion of African
oil palm plantations.

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:07.586
These were planted on
illicit lands,

00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:10.589
on lands illicitly purchased,
very close to the Mosquitia,

00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:12.758
in fact, moving in to
the Mosquitia

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:16.929
and the result,
of course, is that

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:19.965
the money
narcos can manipulate

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:23.268
buys complicity
with government officials,

00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:25.070
leaving the Tawahka
very much on their own

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.705
to fight this scourge.

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:28.707
And not surprisingly,
this was a group of men,

00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:31.277
of Tawahkan mosquito men
who went to challenge

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.611
some traffickers
who were clearing

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:34.480
land very close
to their territories

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.317
and they were rebuffed
with AK-47s and M-16s.

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:40.285
So, leaders are threatened
if they speak out,

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:42.221
there was literally no one
in the region

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.822
to witness this process.

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:45.590
No one knew this was going on.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.227
And so, Tawahka are also
unable to move

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:51.163
through their traditional,
seasonal agricultural

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:52.931
and fishing activities,
so they're stuck

00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:56.969
fishing for crappy little fish
near their home communities

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:59.204
because they are not
allowed, basically

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:03.643
they're sealed off by a narco
cordon to secure the area.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:06.144
And perhaps one of the
most pernicious effects of

00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:09.181
the traffickers is their
tremendous skill

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:13.452
at being able to pit,
their divide and
conquer strategies,

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:16.288
their ability to turn
neighbors against neighbors.

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:18.190
So, one of the things
they do

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.825
in approaching a remote
indigenous community

00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:22.661
is identify that weakest link,

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:26.165
that one family that
is so poor

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:29.134
that they can act
as the land consolidators

00:09:29.134 --> 00:09:33.505
on behalf of the narcos and this
pits family against family.

00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:35.107
This is a picture of Walter.

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:37.542
I took it in...
about nine years ago.

00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:40.613
We were finishing up household
survey in his community.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.281
He's in the
one-room schoolhouse

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:44.583
that has since
been sold to narcos

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:47.186
and we were having
a little dance.

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:50.489
Walter and his brother this
past Easter had heard that

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:53.091
their cousins were clearing
land for narcos in the area.

00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:56.995
He went to confront those narcos
and was killed with an M-16.

00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:59.698
The man behind these children

00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:03.035
is the man who shot him
and I know this man.

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.903
He was a lovely man,
he's the father

00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:07.539
of these four
and other children.

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:10.876
These are good people caught
in an impossible situation.

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:14.046
And they really are hanging
on by their fingernails.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:16.948
This incredibly resilient
community that I once knew

00:10:16.948 --> 00:10:19.785
is as the Tawahka leader said,

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.887
<i> "really not far
 from disappearing."</i>

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:24.689
So, the question is what
can we do about this?

00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:26.559
I think one of the things that--

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.860
There are three things
we can do.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.830
One, tell your friends who
recreationally consume cocaine

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.667
just what the cost of their
recreational use

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:37.469
is doing to places overseas.

00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:41.373
Second, I think we really need
to rethink the war on drugs.

00:10:41.373 --> 00:10:43.308
We're not talking about
legalizing cocaine.

00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:44.877
Let's not get carried away here.

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:47.313
Just talking about
sitting down and reviewing

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.950
drug policy orthodoxy,
which has for 40 years

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.718
done nothing
but move traffickers

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:54.987
into ever more remote regions
where they create

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:57.323
all sorts of social and
ecological chaos,

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:01.860
not to mention the damage
going on in urban areas.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.296
I think the Organization
of American States

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:06.098
has broken with drug
war orthodoxy,

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.800
it's one of the first big
organizations to do so.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.805
I'm working with the UN,
UNDP and the UNEP

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.606
to kind of change
the conversation

00:11:14.606 --> 00:11:17.142
within the UN system
so that they can get on board

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:20.545
with kind of ways to
rethink the drug war.

00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:22.781
But I think also,
we'd have to look

00:11:22.781 --> 00:11:26.184
at the ways in which
our retirement portfolios

00:11:26.184 --> 00:11:28.386
and other financial mechanisms

00:11:28.386 --> 00:11:31.823
and the fear over not having
enough farmland in the future

00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:35.427
are pushing financial markets
to take great interest

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:38.530
in tropical forest lands
and their destruction.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.699
And I think there are
alternatives to that.

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:42.867
Wasting less food
is one of them.

00:11:42.867 --> 00:11:44.903
Using more solar energy
so we don't need to

00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:48.907
be feeding African oil palm
to our cars is another.

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:50.876
So, let's think about
those things,

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.644
about connecting the dots
and understanding

00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:54.312
how we are all complicit

00:11:54.312 --> 00:11:58.484
in the destruction of this
really quite unique place.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:11:59.451
Thank you.

00:11:59.451 --> 00:12:01.353
( applause )

00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:04.490
( outro music )
