STEVE VINTER: Hi, and
welcome to Boston Common here

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.720
in Google Cambridge.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.130
It's great to have you here.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.810
And my name is Steve Vinter.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.640
We're here for the second
meeting of the Thought Leaders

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.570
at Google Cambridge program.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.280
And this event is in
partnership with Talks at Google

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.920
and it's live
streamed on YouTube,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.300
as well as being available
to Googlers here locally.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.090
And so it's great to have this
talk go out over the waves.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.670
The point of this
series is really

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.790
to get people in the area who
are thought leaders in industry

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.960
and academia, and I
think today's guests

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.850
are a great example of that.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000
I'd like to thank
Kara Miller, host

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.180
and Executive Editor of
WGBH's Innovation Hub,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.420
for coming back and
leading today's discussion,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.020
and welcome Dr. Kerry Emanuel
from MIT, who's an atmosphere

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.320
physicist, or scientist,
as I said, from MIT,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.170
and specializes in
hurricane physics.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.069
So sometimes you're a
hurricane physicist as well.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.610
Is that true?

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.560
Does that work?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.117
Good.

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:24.700
I think what's been
really interesting

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.840
about global weather
change is how

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.770
unified the scientific
community has

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.150
been in speaking out about this.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.170
And in addition to Dr.
Emanuel's research,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.160
he's been a big part
of communicating

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.147
with the general
public with his book

00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:45.480
two years ago about "What We
Know About Climate Change,"

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.900
which addresses both the
scientific issues and also

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.000
some of the political challenges
of having this issue be

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.127
understood and dealt
with by our society.

00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:56.710
I'd like to remind
other Googlers here

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.790
that there's a
Dory for questions

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.630
that you'd like to have
Dr. Emanuel answer.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.460
And let me turn it over to Kara.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.042
Thank you very much.

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:08.000
KARA MILLER: Thank you.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.030
And just like last
time, I really

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.360
want this to be a conversation.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.420
So I'm going to talk a
little bit with Kerry,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.230
but then we want to open things
up to out in the audience

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.500
and into the broader
audience watching.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.140
So definitely be thinking
of questions that you have.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.170
There could be,
probably, no better day

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.560
than this, because I
woke up this morning,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.670
looked at the "New
York Times" online

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.300
and saw that there was a huge
new study about climate change

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.480
that was being published
sort of looking at Americans'

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.030
perceptions of whether
climate change is real,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.530
and looking forward
to the 2016 election,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.070
would they want to
vote for somebody

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.230
who wants to do something
about it, or who says,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.160
no, it's a hoax.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.880
And what you see is
these huge numbers.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.330
The only thing I can compare
it to in terms of movement

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.630
is, if you look at the numbers
in support of gay marriage

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.260
over, let's say,
20 years, and you

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.110
see sort of a massive shift.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.496
And the other thing you
see with those numbers,

00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:11.870
as well as with
these numbers, is

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.220
that younger people
and older people

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.290
are considerably different
in terms of where they stand.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.020
So older people are
still much more cautious

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.760
about climate change, not
sure that it's happening.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.860
Younger people are much more
convinced that it is happening

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.032
and rank it in terms
of, this is something

00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:31.490
that's very important
to me, and we

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.750
have to do something about it.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.710
So against that backdrop
we're here today.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.280
And actually, Kerry,
I'm wondering,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.240
if that's the perception
out in the world

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.690
and things are
starting to change,

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.420
and you really can
see those numbers

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.490
over 10, 20 years, and
really the sort of mass

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.950
of public opinion
shift-- if you take us

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.610
inside the world of climate
scientists, where are they?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.590
How do they look
out at this world,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.364
and in at their own world in
terms of what's happening?

00:04:00.364 --> 00:04:02.030
KERRY EMANUEL: Well,
it's very difficult

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.980
to be a climate scientist
today, look at all the evidence

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.820
that we have in front of us, and
not be at least mildly alarmed.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.680
So what almost all of
my colleagues and I

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.160
see when we look
at the evidence is

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.450
risk, a rather substantial
risk to future generations.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.940
And that risk has uncertainty,
as almost all risk does, almost

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.840
by definition.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.850
If you look out at
the high tail of risk,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.970
that truly is alarming.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.840
And that's the picture
that we have to deal with.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.120
KARA MILLER: So
have you seen-- has

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.540
there, in the last year
or two, been things

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.320
that you would point to in
terms of climate science

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.100
moving that you think
we should know about,

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.850
but maybe that those
intricacies don't

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.170
get communicated to
the general public?

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.140
KERRY EMANUEL: Well, there's
no sort of sudden turning point

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.640
here.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.790
We are gradually getting
better and better

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.880
at measuring the earth.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.080
That's one improvement.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.600
So for example, over
the last decade,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.880
we have been able to do
something that's really

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.440
a breakthrough,
which is to measure

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.540
the ocean below the surface
much more accurately.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.400
It seems a little bit crazy,
but a lot of scientists

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.010
will tell you we know more
about the surface of Mars

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.520
than we do about our oceans.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.650
And it's simply a
matter of ocean water

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.180
being very difficult to measure.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.530
You can send a probe down, but
you can't transmit by radio

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.230
up through the water.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.580
So the answer turned out to
be robotic floats, little baby

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.310
submarines, you might think of
them, but they're automated.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.140
They go down, they make
measurements, they come back,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.890
they transmit the
measurements by satellite.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.430
That's one example of a
technological development

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.420
that has allowed
us to understand,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.660
for example, the heat
content of the ocean

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.440
and how it's changing much
more accurately than we

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.010
were able to do before.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.340
KARA MILLER: And what are
climate models telling you?

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.130
I mean, can you take us
forward 10, 20, 30, 40 years?

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.854
What's your sense of
where we're headed?

00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:01.270
KERRY EMANUEL: Well, let me
preface this my answer to that

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.810
by saying that although climate
models get a lot of press

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.710
and attention, and in fact they
are an important tool that we

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.720
use, we were concerned
about this problem

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.250
long before there could be
such a thing as climate models.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.620
So the Swedish chemist
Svante Arrhenius

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.400
was worried about
what would happen

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.330
if we increased carbon
dioxide, and what

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.660
it would do to the planet at
the end of the 19th century,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.320
long before digital computers.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.189
And his estimate of what
doubling carbon dioxide would

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:32.897
do to the global mean
surface temperature

00:06:32.897 --> 00:06:35.840
is well within
the limits of what

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.990
has been estimated, largely on
the basis of computer models,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.130
in the last few years.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.170
So models are big,
complicated, and there

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.140
are a lot of approximations,
somewhat offset by the fact

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.050
that there are many of
them around the world.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.270
So there are independent
groups trying to do things.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.340
So what we see is an
envelope, going forward.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.590
And in the next
100 years, assuming

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.870
that nothing happens and we
keep burning fossil fuels

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.740
at the ever-increasing
rate that we're doing it,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.660
we're looking at doubling
the atmospheric CO2

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.880
content from preindustrial
values by mid-century,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.350
and at least tripling it
by the end of the century.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.380
By the time we get
to tripling it,

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.172
even the middle of that risk
curve looks frightening to us.

00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:23.630
KARA MILLER: So
does that move mean

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.620
that we're all moving to Canada?

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.160
I mean, does it
mean that there's

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.310
going to be a massive relocation
of the population northward?

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.590
KERRY EMANUEL: Well, I think we
have to think about two things.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.890
What you're talking about,
we would call adaptation.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.910
How are people going
to adapt to this?

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.840
And let's take a recent example
that may or may have nothing

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.390
to do with climate change,
is this big blizzard we had.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.890
Now if you looked
at the newspaper,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.010
some of the people that
got really hard hit

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.280
are down in Scituate.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.215
They had huge waves.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:55.840
KARA MILLER: Right,
right on the ocean.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.220
KERRY EMANUEL: And
they have had before,

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.460
and there's a lot of damage.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.917
And I would bet
you that something

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:02.000
will happen the next time.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.942
I don't think they're just going
to rebuild there the same way.

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.650
Either they won't
rebuild there-- there's

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.680
even talk about the state
buying that property, which

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.120
has happened elsewhere--
or they'll build them

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.410
on tall stilts, which is
another way to do that.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.370
And I think this
is what happens.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.160
New York got pounded
by Sandy, and they're

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.060
making a lot of
changes for that.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.230
Now as time goes on, if that's
all that were to happen,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.850
we would gradually adapt,
and the adaptation is local.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.340
It depends on where you are.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.169
Coastlines one thing,
inland agriculture, forests.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.530
All of that get to be
more and more expensive.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.570
And people become
more and more wistful

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.100
that we weren't doing more to
mitigate the problem, that is,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.930
to actually stop
it from happening.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.730
KARA MILLER: Well, people talked
about after Sandy building

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:53.040
multi-billion dollar sea
walls in the New York area.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.490
Do you anticipate that
happening because they

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.365
don't want another
hurricane like Sandy?

00:08:58.365 --> 00:08:59.990
KERRY EMANUEL: Well,
Michael Bloomberg,

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.925
who was the mayor at
the time Sandy hit,

00:09:02.925 --> 00:09:04.300
interestingly
enough, was already

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.700
well-engaged with the
climate change problem

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.610
when that happened.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.210
And the city has
undertaken a very serious,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.960
comprehensive study
of its options.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.780
Now it, as a city, can't do
too much globally to mitigate,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.060
but it can adapt,
and so sea walls

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.050
is one of the options
they're looking at.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.080
There are other
interesting ones.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.860
It was a surprise
to me to find out

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.370
that 100 years
ago, Manhattan was

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.460
a major exporter of oysters.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.450
And they were very
special oysters

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.370
that were delicious and
widely sought after,

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.780
which is why they basically
went away, one of the reasons.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.240
Oyster beds that used to
surround southern Manhattan

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.990
were a big mitigating
factor in storm surges,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.560
which is what happened in Sandy.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.770
They actually slow it down.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.760
So one of the options
New York is looking at

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.430
is reintroducing oyster beds.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.560
There are all kinds of
proposals on the table

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.596
and it hasn't entirely
been sorted out yet.

00:10:02.596 --> 00:10:04.970
KARA MILLER: So I want to zero
in on this hurricane thing

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.400
because, as Steve said,
hurricanes are your thing.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.230
So talk a little bit about--
let's talk a little bit

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.080
about the past.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.010
What have we seen,
just up to now?

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.050
If now is the
stopping point, what

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.690
have we actually seen
in terms of hurricanes

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.110
over the last several decades?

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.420
Where have they gone?

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.960
Have they become more
numerous, stronger?

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.740
What's happening?

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.190
KERRY EMANUEL: Well, I'll
try to answer your question.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.380
But I have to tell you
first that we don't do,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.910
and we haven't done a very
good job measuring hurricanes

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.670
historically.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.860
In the Atlantic we think we have
a reasonably good record going

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.380
back to 1970, which
isn't that long ago.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.360
And then the record
starts to deteriorate.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.710
We have a reasonable
understanding of US landfalling

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.290
hurricanes, and
Caribbean hurricanes

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.990
going back much
further than that.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.780
You have to understand
that only about 11%

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.590
of the world's
tropical cyclones,

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.656
which is the generic
term for a hurricane,

00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:01.280
occur in the Atlantic,
even though they

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.430
get 99% of the press.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.950
Most of them occur in the
Indian and Pacific Oceans.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.740
And we've done a
perfectly terrible job,

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.960
and are still doing a
terrible job, measuring them.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.580
So with that as a preface,
what we've seen in

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.200
the Atlantic is a
general increase

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.310
in levels of activity from
early in the last century

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:24.760
to around the 1950s or so, and
then a fairly steep decline

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.975
from the '50s to the 1980s, and
then a fairly steep rise, then.

00:11:28.975 --> 00:11:30.600
Now I'm not talking--
of course there's

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.430
a lot of noise
from year to year.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.290
For example, last year was
very quiet in the Atlantic.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.860
But that's the sort
of decadal trend.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.210
And we're trying to
understand why that's so.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.800
And we are quite
sure that it has

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.740
to do with some kind
of climate signals,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.140
including, possibly,
global warming.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.380
But there's more
going on than that.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.670
KARA MILLER: So explain
to me how climate change

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:58.530
does enter into hurricanes and
enters into how strong they are

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.630
and where they are.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.830
KERRY EMANUEL: Interestingly
enough, hurricanes

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.860
owe their existence to the fact
that the earth has a greenhouse

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.500
effect.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.480
And broadly speaking,
the greenhouse effect

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.640
means that it's very
hard for the oceans

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.220
to lose heat by radiating
it directly to space.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.100
And so they compensate for
that by evaporating seawater.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.690
Seawater's always evaporating,
which cools the ocean.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.440
And so you have to maintain
an evaporative potential

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.220
between the atmosphere
and the ocean.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.900
It's that potential,
interestingly enough,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.380
that drives hurricanes.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.160
And we realized back
in the late 1980s

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.500
that if you put more greenhouse
gas in the atmosphere,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.960
this evaporatorative
potential has to go up.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.130
It's just basic physics.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.470
You don't need big
models for that.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.350
And so the potential for
hurricanes, in some sense,

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.900
goes up.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.080
And that potential largely
governs how intense

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.980
they get, but doesn't tell
you, oddly enough, very

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.290
much about how
frequent storms are.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.520
So a lot more people
have gotten-- a lot

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.020
more scientists have gotten
interested in this issue

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.690
since I first published a
paper in the late 1980s drawing

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.060
attention to the
potential increase

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.220
in hurricane activity
owing to global warming.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.790
And the consensus now
is that the frequency

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.900
of the very high category
events-- which historically

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.580
have completely dominated
hurricane damage

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.790
and mortality-- the
frequency of those events

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.010
will probably go up,
and there's evidence

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.900
that it is going up in
many parts of the world.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.450
But we don't know as
much about the frequency

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.770
of weak hurricanes, which
dominate the numbers.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.540
So if you like to
count, if that's

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.570
what you're interested in doing,
we don't know much about that.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.260
There are 85 tropical cyclones
around the world every year,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.880
and that number appears to be
quite stable at the moment.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.790
But the storms that we care
about as a society, the really

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:55.580
intense ones, theory,
models, and observations,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.300
to some example,
suggest that those

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.360
are going up rather
substantially

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.530
as we warm the planet.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.780
KARA MILLER: So if Governor
Cuomo from New York,

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.020
if Governor Christie from
New Jersey got you in a room

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.000
and said, we really
need to talk to you.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.310
Clearly Hurricane Sandy
was really expensive,

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.420
very traumatic for
people in our states.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.320
Give us a sense.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.360
Is this something we should now
be expecting every few years?

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.620
What do we do about it?

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.380
Is there anything to be done?

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.710
You're the expert.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.750
Help us figure out
what the plan is here.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.060
KERRY EMANUEL: So as
far as we can make out

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.470
from several different
independent studies, given

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.190
the climate of the last
century, the 20th century,

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.040
the history of hurricanes
and models of hurricanes,

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.940
Sandy was an event
whose intensity

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.060
in New York, of a surge
magnitude in New York

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.120
you might have expected
once every 700 years.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.680
In other words, it was a
very rare kind of storm.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.660
And that's comforting.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.480
We're not likely to
have another Sandy soon.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.430
But you know, the
fact that we had

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.660
one doesn't make it any
less probable to have one

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.020
the next year.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.380
But we have also
done studies where

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.800
we look at various
different climate models

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.430
and we make inferences about
hurricane activity in them.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.670
And that suggests that the
frequency of that kind of event

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.320
might go to more
like every 200 years

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.140
or so toward the
end of the century.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.380
But I have to say that
all along, the US is

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.350
a bit of a special case
here, because the US has

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.600
a terrible, terrible hurricane
problem even without climate

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.240
change, which is that
we have in place--

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.160
and this is well known in my
field and in many fields--

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.420
a lot of policies that
very strongly subsidize

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.780
and encourage people to
build flimsy structures

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.050
in dangerous places.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:56.840
And it's something you hardly
see anywhere else in the world.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.450
And if we don't conquer that
problem, which again, exists

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.460
independently of climate
change, climate change

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.064
will make that even worse.

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:08.230
KARA MILLER: Is that problem
being conquered at all?

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.360
KERRY EMANUEL: No.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.480
Congress tried a
couple of years ago

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.580
to address this in overhauling
one big piece of that subsidy,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.300
which was the federal
flood insurance program.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.830
So if you live in
a flood plain--

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.960
and that includes the coast--
that covers storm surges,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.620
you can buy fairly inexpensive
insurance to cover property.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.030
And it's not priced
according to the risk.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.170
So it doesn't cost
you that much less

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.210
if you get the insurance
in some place that's

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.300
comparatively safe.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.840
So it underwrote it.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.130
And what Congress did was
to pass a law mandating

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.230
that the insurance premiums
reflect the actual risk, which

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.100
seems like no brainer, right?

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.700
That's what insurance should do.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.100
Guess what they
just did last fall?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.920
They repealed it.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.310
There was so much
howling from people

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.560
who live on the coast, who
typically are wealthier

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.250
than the average American--
oh, my premium went up,

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.510
it's now half as much as my
car, what are we going to do,

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.380
the sky's falling.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.180
They made such a racket that
Congress basically repealed it.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.060
So my take is, we're not going
anywhere on this, not until we

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.680
have some really
colossal events that

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.940
force the government's hand.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.960
KARA MILLER: So
let's look at-- we

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.660
talked a lot about the problem.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.339
Let's look at the other
side for a few minutes,

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.090
potential solutions.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.970
Obviously there is the
sort of political side

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.250
of things, which we
can get into later.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:42.080
But talk a little bit about, are
there technological solutions?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.840
Are scientists
working on solutions

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.550
that you think have any sort of
chance of really making headway

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.639
on a pretty serious problem?

00:17:49.639 --> 00:17:51.680
KERRY EMANUEL: I'm very
optimistic on this front.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.290
I think technology is more
likely to produce results

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.000
sooner than politics, at
least in this country.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.250
That's not saying a lot.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.000
KARA MILLER: What?

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.490
KERRY EMANUEL: Everybody-- I
think everybody in this room

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:10.710
probably is aware of the
technology developments in wind

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:11.720
and solar power.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.300
The solar cells have become
more efficient, a lot lighter.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.530
I just had solar cells put
on a roof of a house we have

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.030
in Maine, a summer house,
and it's been wonderful.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.150
And maybe we can
do about 40 or 50%

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.890
of our electrical power needs.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.500
And unless there's a big
breakthrough in storage

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.055
of power, that's about the limit
because of the intermittency

00:18:36.055 --> 00:18:37.930
of sunlight and wind.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.700
It's not a panacea.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.542
And so a lot of the effort's
going to focus on baseload.

00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:45.750
But I think there are some
really, really interesting

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.480
solutions.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.660
But there are a lot of political
and social, cultural barriers

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.040
to those.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.026
So one of them is just
simply capturing the CO2

00:18:56.026 --> 00:18:57.942
from the atmosphere and
burying it, putting it

00:18:57.942 --> 00:19:01.810
in solid or liquid form and
burying it in the earth.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.580
And the Canadians and the US
and some countries in Europe

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.430
are experimenting with this.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.080
We know how to do it.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.050
It's a little bit
too expensive now.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:16.770
But I think if we had a
reasonable carbon tax in place

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.380
and we didn't have such
a low price for petroleum

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.150
as we do right at
this moment, I think

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.270
that would become
much more attractive.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.680
So with natural
gas and petroleum,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.570
there's not that much
downside to burning the stuff,

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.150
actually, if you can take
the really dangerous things,

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.500
the particulates and the carbon
dioxide out of it and bury it.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.180
So that's a promising
piece of technology.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.820
The other is next
generation nuclear fission,

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.780
which we also sort
of know how to do.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.150
And it raises a specter
in people's minds

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.030
of bombs and things.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:53.050
The fact is, we shouldn't be
operating '60s-generation power

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:53.890
plants.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.840
We're generating
dangerous waste.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.330
There's a lot of
risk of proliferation

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.430
of the fuels-- of the waste
for weapons and so forth.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.260
But we do know how to build
safe, passively safe, much less

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.690
expensive, far more efficient
reactors based on thorium

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:15.640
and using molten salt as the
medium that carries the fuel.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.820
We've actually known how to
do that since the 1950s or so.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.720
And there are all
kinds of groups,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.580
including here in Cambridge,
that have sprouted up

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.590
to try to take
advantage of that.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.600
So that could really satisfy
the baseload power in a very

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:35.140
environmentally friendly way,
produce far less toxic waste

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.260
than '60s-generation power
plants or coal plants.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.200
KARA MILLER: I'll
be the skeptic here.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.500
You know, you talked about
having potentially a carbon

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.320
tax to fund some initiatives.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.822
I remember one time
interviewing two economists, one

00:20:50.822 --> 00:20:53.030
who'd served in the Clinton
administration, one who'd

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.160
served in the George
W Bush administration.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.000
You would suppose they would
agree on, like, nothing.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.510
They didn't agree on much, but
one thing they did agree on

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.060
was that we should
have a carbon tax.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.362
And I said, wait, you both agree
we should have a carbon tax?

00:21:06.362 --> 00:21:08.070
And they were like,
yeah, most economists

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.660
really do agree
on that, wherever

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.450
they are on the
political spectrum.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.820
And I said, then you do
you think it could happen?

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.880
And they're like, no.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.840
It will never happen.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:23.700
So if we're relying on money
coming from a carbon tax

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.470
to fund some of the potentially
promising initiatives

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.660
that you talked about,
but that's never coming,

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.600
does that concern you?

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.000
Does that concern
you that those things

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.041
won't get off the ground?

00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:37.990
And then you sort of couple
that with, oil is dirt cheap,

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.620
and it's so hard to
compete with that right

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.927
now for any other
alternative fuel.

00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:46.010
KERRY EMANUEL: To just
take your last point first,

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.450
the cheapness of oil is a
very short term transient.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.970
I mean, we're not
going to see it

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.025
this cheap for a long
time, maybe a few years,

00:21:53.025 --> 00:21:53.650
optimistically.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.700
Well, optimistically
or pessimistically

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.112
depending on your point of view.

00:21:57.112 --> 00:21:59.320
KARA MILLER: Yes, but people
in renewables would say,

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.470
every time this
kind of thing comes,

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.610
it sort of cleans out a
whole bunch of startups

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.526
that are trying to do
something, and then they

00:22:05.526 --> 00:22:07.030
just get killed, and then--

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.196
KERRY EMANUEL: That's right.

00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:10.421
And in fact, I read an
editorial a couple weeks ago

00:22:10.421 --> 00:22:12.837
very sensibly saying, this is
the time to do a carbon tax,

00:22:12.837 --> 00:22:14.610
is when it's cheap.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.780
So my take on this,
having read a lot of it--

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.750
I'm not an economist,
I'm not an expert--

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.580
is that the beauty
of the carbon taxis

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.700
it would accelerate a
lot of this technology.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.470
I don't think its
absence will mean

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.280
this will never happen,
on the other hand.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.616
So one of the
things I argue when

00:22:32.616 --> 00:22:34.740
I have to argue with
Congress, which occasionally I

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.120
do about this, you know,
this is going to happen.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.730
There's going to
be carbon capture.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.280
There's going to be
next generation fission.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.460
Really the question is whether
we develop this technology here

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.380
and sell it abroad,
or whether we're later

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.090
forced to buy it from, say,
the Chinese, who are developing

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.340
these things quite independently
of what we decide to do.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.070
So I think the
technology will happen.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.860
But it could happen a lot
sooner, and perhaps more

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.900
efficiently, if we did
have a mechanism that

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.620
encouraged innovation.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.550
And that's really
what the carbon tax--

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.230
you know, there
was also, earlier,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.240
the cap and trade
solution, which came out

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.970
of a conservative think tank.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.820
So it is an area
of economics where

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:22.600
people from a broad
political spectrum agree.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.560
KARA MILLER: I want to take
your questions in two minutes.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.200
So there are-- there's a
microphone here and here.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.512
And then, as Steve said, you
can also submit your questions

00:23:31.512 --> 00:23:33.970
and they will be asked if you
don't want to do it yourself,

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.200
or if you're watching remotely.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.910
So get ready with
your questions,

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.250
and I'll turn to them
in just one minute.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.260
And one last thing
before we do that.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.390
The solar and wind potential.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.270
It's interesting.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.490
It really depends on who
you ask how much potential.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.700
Obviously Germany has just
gone sort of full-throated

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.780
into solar.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:01.290
It's not a particularly sunny
country, but they went for it.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.090
But I've talked to
people who said,

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.670
you know, the fact that
we have no good way

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.887
to store solar and wind
is a serious problem,

00:24:08.887 --> 00:24:10.470
because the wind is
not always blowing

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.080
and the sun is not
always shining.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.970
And you are never able
to really wean yourself

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.292
off that sort of
central power plant,

00:24:18.292 --> 00:24:20.000
burning coal or whatever
they're bringing

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.020
to give you electricity.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.965
KERRY EMANUEL: Well, I mean, the
real probably optimal solution

00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:26.110
is somewhere between
those two extremes.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.520
And Germany is actually, in
some ways a good, in some ways

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.270
a bad example.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:34.470
I think they got up to 20
or 25% of their power, which

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.190
is remarkable because,
as you point out,

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.340
Germany isn't a
particularly sunny place.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.982
But that's a pretty hard limit.

00:24:39.982 --> 00:24:42.190
They're going to find it
very hard to go beyond that.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.890
Now they also, at the same
time, after Fukushima,

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.660
decided, I think very
unwisely, in my view,

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.800
to decommission their
nuclear power plants.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.370
The reason I think
that's unwise is

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.300
to compensate for
the baseload, they're

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.490
building coal-fired
power plants, which

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.140
is what you don't want to do, as
fast as they can, lots of them,

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.490
in Germany.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.600
And, by the way,
they're buying power

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.700
from Switzerland and
France, who, guess what,

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.390
generate it with
nuclear reactors.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.520
So they're not really
getting off nuclear.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.040
They're just putting it in
someone else's backyard.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.390
But any sort of-- today,
looking at the technology today,

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.680
any sensible power
generation will

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.770
have a lot of
renewables in the mix.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.534
And it largely depends
on where you are.

00:25:23.534 --> 00:25:24.950
If you're in the
desert southwest,

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.510
you can do an awful
lot with solar.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.380
If you're in Seattle, well--
but that's a different problem.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.320
The sun doesn't shine as much.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.060
If you're on the coast
of Maine or Nantucket,

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.060
you can generate a
lot of wind power.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.080
But if you're down
in Louisiana, not.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.940
So it depends on
where you are, too.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.249
Question right here.

00:25:46.249 --> 00:25:48.040
AUDIENCE: So one of
the nightmare scenarios

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.877
that I read about with global
climate change is the methane

00:25:50.877 --> 00:25:52.460
clathrates at the
bottom of the ocean,

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.500
or the carbon that's sequestered
in the tundra, and worries

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.000
about, as the climate warms
these sources of carbon

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.450
could be released fairly
rapidly and kind of dramatically

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.910
change the whole chemistry.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.364
What are your thoughts about
that sort of nightmare Scenario

00:26:09.364 --> 00:26:11.280
KERRY EMANUEL: That's
an interesting question.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.220
Methane is molecule by
molecule a much more effective

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.950
greenhouse gas than
carbon dioxide,

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.210
but there's a lot less
of it in the atmosphere.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.340
But its lifetime in
the atmospheres a lot

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.740
less than CO2.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.900
It's decades as opposed
to millennia, basically.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.990
So as the tundra begins to
thaw, there is methane locked up

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.570
in it and it's released
through the atmosphere,

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.450
and that is a positive
feedback on the system.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.790
In the latest IPCC report
there was an attempt

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.620
to do an inventory of
that, and it came up

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.010
with it being not such a
big problem quantitatively.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.210
But we do know, to take
a somewhat broader view

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:58.980
of your question, that when we
study the climate going back

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.840
millions of years-- particularly
the last few hundred

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.000
thousand years we have good
records from ice scores--

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.270
we see very rapid
changes of climate

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.329
that we don't understand.

00:27:09.329 --> 00:27:11.120
I mean, we sort of
understand, for example,

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.060
why there are ice ages.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.684
We understand that
very well, actually.

00:27:13.684 --> 00:27:16.960
It has to do with varying
amounts of insulation

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.190
from changes in the
earth's orbit, which

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.690
are very predictable changes.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.000
But there are sudden jumps
that we don't particularly

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.620
understand.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.840
And the sort of thing that
keeps us awake at night

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.620
is the Donald Rumsfeld
unknown unknowns.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.320
It's that we know enough
to know that we don't

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.500
know a lot about
the climate system.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:41.310
And the possibility of a sudden
flip to a different state

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.220
can't be ruled out
because we see it

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.752
in the paleoclimate records.

00:27:46.752 --> 00:27:48.085
KARA MILLER: Question over here.

00:27:48.085 --> 00:27:50.751
AUDIENCE: I'm going to read from
the questions submitted online.

00:27:50.751 --> 00:27:53.380
How significant is
industrial release methane

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.654
regarding climate change?

00:27:55.654 --> 00:27:57.320
KARA MILLER: Industrial
release methane.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.240
KERRY EMANUEL: It's
a very interesting--

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.810
KARA MILLER: So
first of all, what

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.060
is industrial release methane?

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.420
KERRY EMANUEL: So
just like CO2 is

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.670
a byproduct of certain
industrial processes,

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.500
methane can be.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:13.420
And it's quantitatively a much
smaller problem to deal with.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:17.910
One of the sources that you
consider industrial, I suppose,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.500
is fracking.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.150
So methane is used
a lot in fracking.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.640
And in principle, it doesn't
have to get into the atmosphere

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.040
if you're careful.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.840
But in practice,
a lot of it does.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:33.410
So there's a big
push in science,

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.110
in coordination with industry
to try to reduce this problem.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:40.620
But I think other than the
fracking, it is a problem.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.430
Methane is going up
percentagewise almost

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.560
as fast carbon dioxide, but
quantitatively, so far, it's

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.600
not the magnitude of
the problem of carbon.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.490
And the other side of it
is that when you do stop,

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.390
it goes away pretty quickly,
unlike carbon dioxide.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.040
KARA MILLER: How
important to you

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.670
is it that regular are people
who are not scientists,

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.430
who are not politicians, who
are not necessarily involved

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:11.360
in this debate, understand
what's going on?

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.200
I mean, maybe it's
not that important

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.087
because they're not
going to be-- they're not

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:17.420
the policymakers and they're
not the people figuring out

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.390
what's happening in the climate.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:24.600
To what extent are all of
us sort of bystanders here?

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.157
Should we know what's going on?

00:29:26.157 --> 00:29:27.990
KERRY EMANUEL: Well, I
mean, my view of that

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.320
is that it's really great
to have, in any field,

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.280
to have a small
group of people who

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.430
study this, who try their
hardest to understand it,

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.860
climate scientists.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.300
But on the other hand it's
unrealistic and perhaps

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.030
not even a good thing
to ask everybody

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.220
to become an amateur
climate scientist.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.850
Sometimes I think that's
what people expect,

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:47.830
we expect of them.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.140
That's not true at all.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.410
I think you need to
understand two things well.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.870
One, that there is a risk,
and that my community

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.890
is practically unanimous.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.790
I mean, if you asked
biologists how many of them

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:07.070
believe that HIV causes
AIDS, maybe you get 97%,

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.890
but I doubt it.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:12.580
I mean, 97% is a
spectacular number.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.360
You don't have to have
all that much faith of it

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.780
if you start focusing on the
second thing, which I think

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.300
people ought to know more
about, is what the options are.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.040
And here I think, not so much
my profession as the engineering

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.930
profession, haven't done the
best job in conveying to people

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.430
the whole spectrum of options.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.610
There's the faction
that wants renewables.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.750
Great, because that
will be part of the mix.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.720
There's obviously the faction
who wants business as usual.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.500
They want to keep burning coal.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.100
And there's this
and that faction.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.710
But what we really need to
look at is the whole range,

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:49.920
and to see not just risk
but opportunity, OK?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.650
Quite apart from
climate change, there

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.800
are a lot of benefits that
would accrue to getting off--

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.520
particularly getting off coal,
which is estimated to result

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.770
in something like 10,000
premature deaths in the United

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.090
States every year.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.120
Would we tolerate that from
any other energy source?

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.430
If nuclear did that, every
plant would be closed instantly.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.200
But we tolerate that
because we're used to it.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.870
We ought to be phasing those
out, going with renewables,

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.400
and developing, as I
say, next generation

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.470
fission and other things so
that we have a rational mix.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.480
And we probably ought
to be doing that anyway.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.900
I think that's where the
important debate-- I'd

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.620
like to change the axis
of the debate from,

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.080
is manmade climate
change occurring

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.910
or not-- which I think is
fruitless at this point,

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.330
although we still have to
do a lot of work on it--

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.610
to a different axis where
we talk about solutions

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:42.150
and argue in a
constructive way about what

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.957
those solutions should be.

00:31:43.957 --> 00:31:46.040
KARA MILLER: It's interesting,
because in the most

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.950
recent Senate race,
Mitch McConnell,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.640
obviously running to be Senate
Majority Leader, both he

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.420
and his opponent on
the Democratic side

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.760
were strong, strong proponents
of coal despite the fact

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.620
that fewer and fewer
jobs in Kentucky

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.880
are part of the coal industry.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.360
But it was absolutely
crucial to both of them

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.206
that they be seen as the
top champion of coal.

00:32:11.206 --> 00:32:13.080
KERRY EMANUEL: Well, I
think the long history

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.480
of American politics,
and probably politics

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.080
in many other places that we
have representative democracy,

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.370
representatives are going to
be arguing for their districts.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.790
And if you're from
a coal district

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.089
you kind of have to do that.

00:32:25.089 --> 00:32:26.380
I sort of sympathize with them.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.310
But the rest of us don't
have to go along with that.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.370
And if it's just those
two voices arguing,

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.210
and then the Democratic
person you're talking about

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:38.370
was not representing
the party on this,

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.010
eventually their voices
will be drowned out.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.147
And this happens over and over
again in American politics.

00:32:44.147 --> 00:32:45.480
KARA MILLER: Question over here.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.146
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:46.146 --> 00:32:48.810
My question is
basically, what can I do?

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.196
I listen.

00:32:50.196 --> 00:32:51.945
I guess I could do
some Facebook activism,

00:32:51.945 --> 00:32:53.361
but all my friends
already believe

00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:57.040
in climate change,
so what's the point?

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:57.980
I vote.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.700
What can I as an
individual, and what

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.220
can the average person
who agrees with you

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.580
and who follows you do?

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.940
KERRY EMANUEL: That's, I
think, an incredibly important

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:07.610
question.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:12.170
And as an educator I ask myself
that-- now my students at MIT

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:15.262
ask me that question
quite a bit.

00:33:15.262 --> 00:33:16.720
There are obviously
some things you

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.870
can do as a person to try to
be more conservation-minded.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.150
And that's not so important
from the point of view

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.890
of how much energy
you actually save,

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.820
even if you sum up
over individuals,

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.150
it's little bit important, but
to change the cultural thinking

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:30.880
about climate.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.910
But the other
thing, I think it's

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.470
terribly important
for young people--

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.270
and you look young to me,
although I'm blinded by light,

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:42.920
so I can't see you very
well-- to young people

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.240
to really be more vocal about
their concern about climate.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.490
And you know, even if the
economics don't currently

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.860
weigh in favor of doing
anything about it,

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.890
politicians tend
to pay attention

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.000
when they realize that a younger
generation is really upset

00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.510
about it.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.770
I think this is how we
eventually, for example, got

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.280
out of Vietnam.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.950
It wasn't from some geopolitical
argument as much as the fact

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.050
that young people
made it very clear,

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.510
finally, to their
parents' generation,

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.484
that they were unhappy
about the situation

00:34:14.484 --> 00:34:16.800
and wanted it to change.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.260
So I think being vocal in
that sort of political stage,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.100
writing to your congressman,
organizing marches, you know,

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.540
that actually does make a
difference in the long run.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.600
That's my view.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.850
KARA MILLER: Another question.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.820
AUDIENCE: I have a
similar question.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.131
What can my employer do?

00:34:36.131 --> 00:34:39.210
And specifically, Google has
a tremendous amount of power,

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.739
computational power, money in
the bank, billions of people

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:43.000
use us every day.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.523
We also operate under
very strong constraints.

00:34:45.523 --> 00:34:47.314
We have to make money
and we have a mission

00:34:47.314 --> 00:34:49.250
to organize the
world's information.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.960
Given these
constraints, if I were

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.989
to give you some portion
of the power of Google

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:57.179
and tell you to use it as best
you could, what would you do?

00:34:57.179 --> 00:34:57.970
KERRY EMANUEL: Ooh.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.160
That's a really--
I'd probably have

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.630
to ask you some more questions
to answer that sensibly,

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.680
but I'll have a shot at it.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.440
But let me preface it by saying
that MIT, as another, not

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.200
as big as Google, but
a big organization,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.410
is asking itself that
question as a community.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.295
And I'm part of something
called-- a committee that

00:35:17.295 --> 00:35:20.580
was commissioned by the
president of MIT, Rafael Reif,

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.930
to start a climate
conversation at MIT.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.670
And it's amazing how engaged our
students are now in this issue.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.410
They're very--they ask
a lot of questions,

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.590
like the fellow who spoke before
you, about what can they do.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.750
And one thing they're
pushing MIT to do very hard

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:40.240
right now is to clean
up their own backyard.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:44.700
We're not a very an
energy-efficient campus at all.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.760
I work in something called
the Green Building, named

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.960
not for the color or for it
being environmentally sound,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.510
but after the donor.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.840
And it's as far from
green as you can imagine.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.150
It's a huge energy hog.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.530
MIT doesn't even
know, it turns out,

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.500
very much about how
much electricity

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.300
individual buildings as opposed
to the whole campus use.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.720
I think MIT should be a showcase
for innovation in energy,

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.340
and buildings in particular.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.250
And maybe there's a niche
like that for Google,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.960
that when it contemplates
building something,

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.380
for example, it could
try to showcase-- maybe

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.840
it spends a little bit more
to showcase-- energy-efficient

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.340
technology.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.650
Buildings use about
a third of the power

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.642
that we consume in this country.

00:36:31.642 --> 00:36:33.350
KARA MILLER: We talked
before we sat down

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.350
a little bit about this
idea of divestment, which

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.930
has been-- there's been
pressure at campuses

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.170
around the country, a lot
of pressure at Harvard,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:46.390
to divest from companies that
burn a lot of fossil fuel.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.910
But as you're saying,
that's a tough one

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.080
because where do
you draw the line?

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.780
What kinds of corporate
activities are OK?

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.000
Like let's say you
manufacture products,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.750
and you have people
manufacturing them

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:02.930
in Bangladesh under not
that great circumstances.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.410
That's OK, but, you
know, that a tough way

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:10.032
to sort of make that line.

00:37:10.032 --> 00:37:11.490
KERRY EMANUEL:
We're probably going

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:15.460
to stage to debate at MIT,
probably internal to MIT,

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.290
but maybe streamed out, on this
divestment issue, because it

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.950
turns out to be much
more complicated.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:24.060
And so we have big oil
companies pouring money

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.600
into research at MIT to
do things like figure

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.270
out how to bury
carbon in the earth.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.550
Do we want that to shut off?

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:33.370
I don't think so.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.540
But on the other hand,
there are some things

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.750
you probably could divest from.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:40.587
It turns out that a very small
percentage of MIT's portfolio

00:37:40.587 --> 00:37:44.260
is wrapped up in fossil
fuel companies, for example.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.020
But there's a flip side, too.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.660
Instead of talking
about divestment,

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.460
we could also talk
about the investment.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.510
That is, MIT could strategically
start a sort of subportfolio

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.570
that deliberately
tries to invest

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.950
in energy innovation, green
technology, and so forth.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.640
So we can also take the
positive side of that

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.225
and maybe run with it a bit.

00:38:04.225 --> 00:38:05.350
KARA MILLER: Question here.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.930
Thank you.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:09.420
I think your book
captures really

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.170
well the complexity
of the weather system.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.760
And I think over
the last 50 years

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.230
we've done a great job
of understand really

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.990
complex systems.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.130
I'd put the world
economy and physiology

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.000
of the human body
in those categories.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.770
And I think what we've
learned is, as much as we know

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.980
about them, we're
still a long way away

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.910
from having the effects that we
want on them in a positive way,

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.000
and truly, deeply
understanding them.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.150
And your book comments
about chaos theory

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:36.490
being a part of the
challenge with weather.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.510
I'm just wondering, if
you had a magic wand

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.250
and actually had a technological
solution to greenhouse gases,

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.280
and you therefore weren't
dependent on social change

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.240
and all those effects, and you
also had the political will

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.700
to actually apply
that magic wand,

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.950
I'm wondering whether
we're prepared to have

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.620
that kind of power and
utilize it effectively given

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.760
that changes have all
sorts of uncertain effects

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.630
that we have a very
difficult time dealing with?

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.770
KERRY EMANUEL: That's
a fascinating issue.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.920
I wish I could give you
a wise answer to that.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.510
I have always
thought that wisdom

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:15.980
is the quality of
understanding just

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.640
the depths of your own
ignorance on something.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.062
And believe me,
climate scientists

00:39:20.062 --> 00:39:22.270
have become very well
acquainted with their ignorance

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.894
on the subject.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.510
Your question is particularly
pertinent to solutions

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.250
that are on the table and have
been proposed that are broadly

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:36.380
called geoengineering, in which
we try to compensate for carbon

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.790
dioxide by blocking sunlight.

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.370
And we actually
literally could start

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:44.180
doing it both technologically
and economically right now.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.432
We can pump sulphur
to the stratosphere.

00:39:46.432 --> 00:39:47.390
We know how to do that.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.440
It's not even that expensive.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.170
But we don't want to
do that because we're

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.260
so familiar with our ignorance,
if you will, of the system

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.060
that we can give a pretty good
estimate what will happen.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.580
But we wouldn't be too
surprised if we were wrong.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.430
So there's all sorts of things.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.290
If I had a magic
wand right now, I

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.540
would implement a
stiff carbon tax

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.220
and let the market, science,
engineering kind of work

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.140
it out, because I think
we're so close to being

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.700
able to pull carbon back out
of the atmosphere, which is not

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.490
so dangerous, because
we're just reversing damage

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.720
that we've already done.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.510
KARA MILLER: Question here.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.546
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for coming in.

00:40:29.546 --> 00:40:31.170
I don't really care
about the causation

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:32.850
versus correlation factor.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.240
This is the only place I'm
going to live in my lifetime.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.530
And every generation
that I can foresee

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:39.204
is going to be on this planet.

00:40:39.204 --> 00:40:40.620
So I'm wondering,
though-- you had

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.360
talked a little bit
about the carbon tax.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.790
I grew up in Canada.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:46.980
Even the price of gasoline is
quite a bit higher than here.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.720
And you're not an economist, but
being around this topic, what's

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.780
your sense of how much we are
subsidizing our contributions

00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:01.690
to making this planet worse by
artificially lowering energy

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.041
costs in this country?

00:41:03.041 --> 00:41:05.040
I don't know if that makes
does that make sense?

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.956
KERRY EMANUEL: I think
it makes perfect sense.

00:41:06.956 --> 00:41:08.960
I mean, this is
exactly the first thing

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.930
you'd want to do, even
before you do carbon,

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:14.210
is stop subsidizing
fossil fuels.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.030
I understand that
in the United States

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.280
our subsidies for fossil fuels
are greater than our subsidies

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.310
for renewables at the moment.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:25.900
And the conservatives say
they don't like government

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.760
subsidizing one
industry over another.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.780
And yet we're doing this.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.389
It's something that
both sides of the aisle

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:34.180
ought to be able to
agree on at this point,

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.160
is stop subsidizing.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.210
And what better time
to stop subsidizing

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.980
than when the price is
already low, as it is now?

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.900
So absolutely we
should stop doing that.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.750
A carbon tax on top of
that, maybe gracefully

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.650
implemented over
some period of time--

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.050
and it doesn't actually
even have to be a tax.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.010
It can be something--
in fact, I think

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.519
this might be proposed
here in Massachusetts,

00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:56.560
is a-- I don't remember
exactly what it's called,

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.090
but you give the money
back to people in some--

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.670
so it's not a net
revenue source.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.500
It's another way to do that so
you don't have call it a tax.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.940
In fact, it wouldn't be a tax.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:11.810
But just to
stimulate innovation.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.640
I have high hopes
that Massachusetts

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:18.410
may become the first state in
this country have a carbon tax,

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.557
or some kind of fee on carbon.

00:42:21.557 --> 00:42:23.390
KARA MILLER: Let's take
these two questions.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.470
You want to just
ask your question

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.095
one right after the
other, and then you

00:42:26.095 --> 00:42:28.129
can tackle both
at the same time.

00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:28.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.378
I wanted to understand
a little more what

00:42:30.378 --> 00:42:32.180
you're saying about hurricanes.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.170
You talked about the
increased greenhouse gases

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.134
increasing the
atmospheric potential.

00:42:36.134 --> 00:42:37.800
It sounds like you're
saying that that's

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.610
going to necessarily lead to
increased hurricane activity.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:45.020
So you're saying that
there'll be more hurricanes,

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.030
or there'll be
greater intensity,

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.682
or how do we think about that?

00:42:49.682 --> 00:42:50.890
KARA MILLER: And then-- yeah.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:52.360
Let's get the second
question in too.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.200
AUDIENCE: I have a very
different question.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.590
I had this whole
fantasy last night

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:01.350
where the Koch
brothers, who are now

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:05.000
saying that they're going to
commit about a billion dollars

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.430
to the presidential campaign,
and are doing that largely

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:15.250
to fight efforts to deal
with global warming.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.850
These guys give-- you know,
they built a building over there

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:18.720
at MIT.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.844
They're giving money-- one
of them, or both of them

00:43:20.844 --> 00:43:22.217
are MIT grads.

00:43:22.217 --> 00:43:23.800
KARA MILLER: I think
just one of them.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.110
KERRY EMANUEL: One of them is.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.470
AUDIENCE: My fantasy is that
we bring them back to MIT

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.351
and we say, OK, let's
sit down and have

00:43:29.351 --> 00:43:30.350
a discussion about this.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:32.930
Here are the researchers
here in our community

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:36.230
who are doing what we
think is best work related

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:40.270
to global warming, and
try to set them straight.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:42.290
Now perhaps that's unrealistic.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:45.079
But I think my
question is, really,

00:43:45.079 --> 00:43:46.620
is there-- do we
think there's really

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.307
a disconnect in the scientific
community, disagreements

00:43:49.307 --> 00:43:50.140
over global warming?

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.329
Do we think that argument-- or
disagreements over human causes

00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:55.870
of global warming-- do we think
that argument is settled now,

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.210
and there is merely a
political disagreement?

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.870
Do we need to bring
people together

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.850
to really understand
what the causes are?

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:06.307
And would educating the Koch
brothers make a difference?

00:44:06.307 --> 00:44:08.640
KERRY EMANUEL: Really, they're
both very good questions.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.340
I'll try to take them in order.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.455
The evaporative
potential increase--

00:44:13.455 --> 00:44:15.770
there's a speed
limit on hurricanes.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:20.500
In a given atmosphere
ocean combination,

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.730
the energetics of hurricanes
puts a speed limit on them.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:26.150
If you put more carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere,

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.520
you raise the evaporative
potential and the speed limit

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.800
goes up.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.920
Now very few hurricanes
get up to the speed limit.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.950
But what it means when we do
a more detailed study of it

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:40.995
is that, indeed, we see more
of the high-intensity events

00:44:40.995 --> 00:44:42.870
when we put carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.640
or any other greenhouse gas.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.630
But what happens to the far
more numerous, but far less

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:55.884
damaging, weaker events, there's
not a strong agreement on.

00:44:55.884 --> 00:44:57.300
The other thing I
should say as an

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.910
aside is there's
a lot of agreement

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.870
that the average hurricane
will produce a lot more rain.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:03.670
That's very, very basic physics.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:07.200
And that's of concern because
a great deal of people

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.870
are killed in
fresh water floods.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.340
So to go on to the
second question,

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.210
I think I learned a great
deal from a conversation

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.650
I had a few years ago with
an ex-Republican congressman

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:21.350
from South Carolina,
Bob Inglis-- who

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.890
was a rare conservative
Republican who did take climate

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.640
change seriously--
that what was stopping

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:32.530
his colleagues from believing
it was not because we

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:36.480
scientists are necessarily
all that poor at communication

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.740
or that there haven't been
efforts to reach these people.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:43.330
It was that they were so
afraid of the solutions,

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.010
that they were going to be
solutions they couldn't buy.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.570
The science really wasn't
the issue, it turned out.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.740
And I thought that
was a very profound--

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.920
and I've tried to
go-- last year I

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.470
went to talk in a single meeting
to the heads of the American

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:59.300
Enterprise Institute, the
Competitive Enterprise

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.560
Institute, and the Heritage
Foundation, after promising

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.560
myself, I think for
Lent, that I wouldn't

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.210
stop preaching to
the converted and go

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.380
into the heart of territory.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.600
And it was a very
interesting conversation.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.110
And I sort of steered them
away from, is this is happening

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:15.810
or is it not?

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.750
I presented a little bit
of evidence, as in my book.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:20.250
And I just tried
to steer it to, you

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.970
know, what about
solutions to this?

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.360
And I said, we aren't
having the kind of debate

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.030
we should have about how we're
going to solve this problem.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.250
You guys got to get
into that debate.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.490
And I sort of got them
excited about that-- I

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.030
tried to get them excited
about that debate.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.530
By the end of the
conversation they said, yeah.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:40.510
And it sort of got
lost in the background.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:42.790
But they must have been
conscious of it at some level,

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.706
because if they start
to get involved in this,

00:46:44.706 --> 00:46:47.780
they've tacitly admitted that
there's a problem to solve.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.410
I don't know if I want to do the
Koch brothers because they're

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:54.250
so wrapped up in the particular
problem of fossil fuel.

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:56.540
They're defending
their own interests,

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.590
although one day I might.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.090
KARA MILLER: I think
David Koch, who

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:02.390
is the main donor at MIT--
I could be wrong about this,

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:07.700
I'd have to Google it-- but I
think that David Koch has said

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.380
that he doesn't necessarily not
believe in climate change, i.e.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.120
that he may believe
in climate change.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.380
It's just that he has
business interests that

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.535
would be against a carbon tax.

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.910
It's not necessarily that he
doesn't believe the science.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.326
Now I'd have to
double check that.

00:47:22.326 --> 00:47:24.560
But I think that
may be true of him.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.920
So as you said, it may be much
more of a financial incentive

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.980
rather than, of there
was only an explanation,

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.630
like some form of explanation
that would be effective.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:38.590
Last question right here.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.240
AUDIENCE: This
isn't my question,

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.640
but I just wanted to mention
that British Columbia already

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.370
has a carbon tax.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.732
And it is, in fact, a
revenue-neutral carbon tax.

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:50.690
I don't know quite what
they do with the money.

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.880
I think they use it to
reduce other kinds of taxes.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.930
But in any case,
there is that example.

00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:00.530
I could certainly see maybe
some progressive state the US

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:04.360
adopting such a thing at some
point, get a ball rolling.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.510
But anyway, my
question actually is

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:09.840
about conservation, which we
haven't talked too much about.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.650
For example, my understanding is
that Germany has invested a lot

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:18.160
in passive solar housing,
much better insulated housing.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.350
That kind of thing's probably
been pretty important.

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:23.680
I know as a homeowner I
don't do as much as I would

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.930
if I had more economic incentive
to do it, like a carbon tax.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:29.560
But I'm certainly
aware of a bunch

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.630
of stuff I could
do in my own house.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:34.370
It just-- my intuitive
sort of understanding

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:39.770
is that we have a huge way to
go in just conservation alone,

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.820
and that could potentially
be a huge source of savings.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.500
But could you comment on that?

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.560
KARA MILLER: Conservation
is the unsexy portion

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.785
of talking about the climate.

00:48:48.785 --> 00:48:50.160
KERRY EMANUEL:
But it's something

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.493
that we're in control of, right?

00:48:51.493 --> 00:48:53.700
If you own a house or
you are contemplating

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.360
buying a car or
anything else, you

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.800
can control that to some extent.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.500
And I think you're absolutely
right that the average person

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.270
is going to respond,
at some level,

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.160
to incentives and disincentives
to do this sort of thing.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.760
And buildings are about a
third of the power consumption,

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.860
vehicles another third.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.710
Industry is, I think--
very, very rough numbers.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:20.560
So if you can beat these down,
it can make a big difference.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.390
And we costed out at MIT,
what would it actually cost

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:27.676
us to comply with the gold
standard green regulation

00:49:27.676 --> 00:49:28.800
in building a new building?

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.690
And the funny thing is,
we surveyed our students

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:35.040
and faculty about what they
thought the cost excess would

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.060
be, and it ranged
from 20 to 70%.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.770
The actual numbers are
very close to zero.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.480
And that sort of
surprised me, too.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.340
And it turns out that
they're close to zero

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:47.930
because if you have more
insulation, more energy

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.740
efficiency, you're
generating solar,

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:53.010
you don't need to buy as
big a ventilation system,

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.090
for example.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:55.770
There are cost savings.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.880
And when you sum it all up,
it's pretty close to zero.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.710
And I think when
more people find out

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.420
that they can do all
this at very little cost

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.260
to themselves-- and
of course, over time,

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.100
a big economic
benefit-- it's going

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.644
to happen in a more
widespread way.

00:50:10.644 --> 00:50:12.810
KARA MILLER: Thank you for
your wonderful questions.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.710
Thanks to Kerry
Emanuel for letting us

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.860
into the world of climate
scientists for an hour.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.550
I'm sure he'll stay
for a few minutes

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:22.230
if you have other questions
that didn't get answered.

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.750
Thank you very much to
Google and Steve and Carly

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.010
for organizing.

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:26.910
Thanks.

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:28.460
KERRY EMANUEL: Thank you.
