1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,460
Okay.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,730
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burn and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:08,860
Just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast and ahhh

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,190
just checking in on you. Just checking
in on you, seeing how your week's going.

5
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:15,440
How's your week going on?
Did you have fucking team?

6
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:19,220
Have another championship parade
like minded. Well, you know what?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,230
I wish it did. Why the fuck should
my town have all the Goddamn success?

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,000
You know, it's fucking unbelievable.

9
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,340
I still can't believe you won that
fucking game, but I'm not going to go

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,650
on and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on and on

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,180
about it. Um, I'm in Charlotte,

12
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:40,180
North Carolina came in a day
before the comedy zone Gig.

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,280
I went to the a shallot hornets
versus the Brooklyn Nets,

14
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:48,050
you know, and when you try to go to
a home game, sorry, I'm going to, um,

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,350
I don't have my fucking microphone,
so I'm just recording. Right.

16
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:54,970
If my laptops are, anytime I click on
something, it might be God damn issue. Um,

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,500
but, uh, when you're trying to do
what it is that I've been doing,

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,860
which is to basically
go to all of the, uh,

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,850
to go to a home game of every fucking
team and all four major sports,

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,540
every once in a while you got to go
to a game. It's not the best game.

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,030
You've got to go see a couple of
franchises that even though they,

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,180
they've had their moments, this
is not their time. They are,

23
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,290
they're currently re
rebuilding. And that's what,

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,530
that's what happened when we saw the
Charlotte Hornets play the Brooklyn Nets.

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,300
Um, a couple nights ago,
Jesus Christ, it was,

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,200
it was just like it was, I don't
know. I don't know what it wants.

27
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:34,940
It was like a fucking WWE NBA game.

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,900
WNB A at its worst in the first
couple of seasons, you know, they,

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,060
they just didn't look good. I
mean, they look way better now,

30
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:44,120
the fundamentals and all that,
if he's watch any of the WNB.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,470
But those first few years,

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,550
I couldn't understand why it looks so
bad cause women's college basketball look

33
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:53,930
better in a w NBA. But Jesus
Christ Charlotte Verse Brooklyn,

34
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,420
Geesh, that I say that enough time, oh
this is how fucking boring that game was.

35
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:03,710
The kids that played at halftime was
fucking more exciting cause they will run

36
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:07,670
in the court. Big smiles on their
faces was fucking hilarious.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,660
That game was like something
like, you know, 16 to 14.

38
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:15,710
And it was all layups. It was
just all fucking run in the court.

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,770
Layups was tremendous. And um,

40
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:19,870
yeah.

41
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,340
But anyways, last night,
uh, we went to um, yeah,

42
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,600
we worked the comedy zone and uh, I did,

43
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:30,410
the smartest thing I've ever done on the
road in a long time was when the show

44
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:34,760
was over. I just went home
and I went to fucking bed. Um,

45
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,550
because the Charlotte
Brooklyn night, you know,

46
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:42,170
I had a couple of pops about 17, and
uh, the next day woke up. I'm like,

47
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:46,610
what the, what am I doing?
What, what the fuck am I doing?

48
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,420
Okay, I've got a newborn at home.
I can't get any goddamn sleep.

49
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,970
I'm on the road now. I should be like,

50
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,490
like a fucking sober as a church
mouse and just go right to bed.

51
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:58,250
And that's what I did last
night. Fucking phenomenal.

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,710
Other than God damn fucking cleaning
ladies coming by every 10 minutes.

53
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,760
Yeah, they didn't, they,

54
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,000
this place I'm staying in doesn't
have the fuck off side. Um,

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,710
so they just keep coming.
Housekeeping 11, they fucking knock,

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,770
right housekeeping and then immediately
open the Goddamn door. There's that.

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,650
There's the lost art
of knocking on a door,

58
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,280
waiting for a response and then
coming in somewhere along the line.

59
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,850
These goddamned kids today. Oh yeah,
I just said that these goddamn kids,

60
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,230
they think the fact they just knocked
that they can just means they can then

61
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:39,370
enter the room. You knock, you
wait for somebody to say, you know,

62
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,300
hang on a second, or blah
blah, blah, blah, blah.

63
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,420
You don't just knock on a
fucking door and walk in.

64
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,850
You've got to give the
person a chance, you know,

65
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,520
put the dick away or something, you
know? Well, who knows what they're doing.

66
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,690
Maybe they're just sitting
there in their underwear, right?

67
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,890
I don't fucking know. She fucking
knock and you wait and then you went,

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,070
sorry, just saying it fucking can't stand.

69
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:09,650
That's one of my pet peeves annoys people
who knock and then they just fucking

70
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,990
walking, um, that shit. Or if you know,
when you go into to a parking spot,

71
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,680
you know with two cars could fit and you
just stick your fucking cunt car right

72
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:20,600
in the middle of both. So no one can fit.

73
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,980
Two cars can fit anymore unless
you drive in a smart car. Um,

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,870
so anyways, tonight you probably
think Jesus bill have to uh,

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,770
that patriots Superbowl.
How could your sport,

76
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,150
okay,

77
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,040
I could just sportsworld
get any better. You don't,

78
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:43,041
I mean we'll after a major
dip I believe on Monday,

79
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:47,390
which I think they did on purpose cause
the Bruins had a little gap in their

80
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:52,391
schedule with all the buzz about
do we give the patriots excuse,

81
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,120
we have yard care

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,590
be a good time to get rid
of a Clo Julian and a,

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,390
I just want to thank
coach Juliette for, uh,

84
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,470
being the best Bruins coach since
I've been watching them. Um,

85
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,490
for the last, you know,
close to 40 years. Um,

86
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,530
Jesus [inaudible] everybody adversely,

87
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,910
I'm doing my podcast.

88
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,490
Okay.

89
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,290
All right. Let me, let me in
an hour. You think or no? Uh,

90
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,240
there's just the Thursday one. I'll be
done in like a half hour. All right,

91
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:29,690
cool. And then if you
want to talk, Hey Paul,

92
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:32,300
you go eat those eggs and then
I'll meet you first steam.

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,620
Okay.

94
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,520
All right. We got breakfast coming in
like 20, and when it's done I'll call you.

95
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,140
Okay. All right buddy. Okay,
pal. Okay. Alright, cutie.

96
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,120
Anyways, um,

97
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,690
the fuck don't fuck was I talking
about? Um, yeah. Hello Julian.

98
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,060
Jesus Christ. I'd never seen a guy
more of a victim of the GM and for the,

99
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,380
I do not that fucking move whatsoever.

100
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,540
You know, I guess maybe if he had
fallen out with the people up top,

101
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,910
I have no idea. But, um,

102
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,530
how you just gonna blame it on him
and not get rid of your fucking GM.

103
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:17,210
I don't know what they see in this.
Our GM, I have no fucking idea.

104
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,470
I don't know. Um,

105
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,390
okay.

106
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,180
I have no idea what this
guy is doing. I mean,

107
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:26,080
he got rid of everybody and I just
didn't, I don't see that way. We actually,

108
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,560
we're playing our best hockey of the
year. I felt, yeah, we won three in a row.

109
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,650
Lost a tough one of the fucking
capital's not a tough one.

110
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:33,970
They actually kicked our ass five to two.

111
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:37,680
But I mean what the fuck did the capitals,
we didn't do bad for a seventh seed.

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,260
I don't know. I think it's a dumb move.
You get rid of the guys like okay,

113
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:43,270
you want to get rid of the guy? Who
are you gonna replace them with?

114
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,660
WHO's out there, you know,

115
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,630
and actually tweeted
congratulations to every year,

116
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,860
every other NHL team out there that needs
a fucking coach that knows how to win

117
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:56,650
a cup. Um, cause that's
what we just dumped.

118
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,080
Um, I dunno,

119
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,840
I dunno.

120
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,170
I don't know to get the shit that stuff
where the ownership gives into the fan

121
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,300
base. It's like, what
are they listening to?

122
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,840
The fucking dopes that call
into sports talk radio.

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,220
I've never called in a sports talk.
I'd watch sports all the fucking time.

124
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,600
I would never call it a sports
talk radio show, you know,

125
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:22,090
just specifically to talk
about the sports thing. I mean,

126
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:26,410
I'll call in and the hyper show,
you know, who wore myself out. Oh,

127
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,460
I would absolutely do that. Oh,
speaking of worn myself out.

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,500
Um, well wait, wait, wait, wait. Let
me get back. So, uh, thank you Clo,

129
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,880
Julian and uh, for bringing us
the Stanley Cup and uh, and in a,

130
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,690
you know, 40 year drought, um,

131
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,420
and continued success wherever you go.

132
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,160
I know you're gonna do
great wherever you go.

133
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,330
Hopefully you've got a better GM
at the next place you go to. Um,

134
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,200
so anyways, um,

135
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,800
after all my ranting and
raving about, uh, award shows,

136
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,810
I think I might be a presenter at one

137
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,840
old Hollywood bill is
the writers guild awards.

138
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,040
And um, they asked me to be a presenter
or whatever. And at first I was like,

139
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,260
then I'm not going to go down and
do that fucking bullshit. But then,

140
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,940
you know what, I'm actually,

141
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:20,660
I guess often enough or selling
out, depends on how you look at it.

142
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:24,860
But what I realize is that on our show,

143
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,330
um, it's those awards shows
are a big deal for, uh,

144
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,510
for the writers because that's
how they actually get money.

145
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,640
So if you win an an Emmy, um,

146
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,500
or a writers guild or a
sag thing or whatever,

147
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,400
it's great for the writers in the
writers room cause they can say that they

148
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,910
wrote on an Emmy award winning show
and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

149
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,380
So old freckles has to play
the game a little bit. Um,

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,090
go put it on a God damn monkey suit to
fucking black tie thing. I got to go,

151
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,620
I'm going to go to one of those fucking
from places where they have the cheap

152
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,190
tuxedos cause I don't think
anybody can fucking tell,

153
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,910
just come out in those God
damn plastic bowling shoes. Um,

154
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,050
I don't know who the fuck decided that
they wanted me to be a fucking presenter,

155
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,190
but like, if they've never,

156
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,940
they've obviously never listened
to me read out loud on a,

157
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,280
on my podcast. But, uh, I don't know.

158
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:22,890
I figured this would be a good one to
try out to see what I think about it

159
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:27,000
because a, it's not televised, you know?

160
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,220
And um,

161
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,310
I don't know if we'll see if
I can actually read out loud.

162
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,030
I don't know if knee has been on me
about this shit. You gotta do it.

163
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:39,790
You gotta play the game. Alright,
I'm playing the bucket game.

164
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,780
Why make a fucking difficult business
even more? God damn difficult.

165
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,310
I'm like fuck it. I'll give it a two.
I'll let you guys know how that goes.

166
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:51,310
How my reading out loud, if that's
in fact what they have. Me Too.

167
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,510
But it's not bad. It's only
like two hours long. Um,

168
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,110
so it Kinda seems like the best one to
go to and Patton Oswald is hosting it and

169
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:02,770
I think he's a fucking genius, so at
least I'll get to listen to his monologue.

170
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,180
Um, but I am without a doubt.
I am going to get the fuck.

171
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:11,290
I'm going to get a nice fucking, I'm
going to get a senior prom special,

172
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,740
the clip on fucking tie
and all of that shit.

173
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,280
That's like the dumbest shit ever to go
out and go buy some expensive Tuxedo.

174
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:25,960
It's like, what are you a
fucking Rockefeller? Uh,

175
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,430
but I guess people trash you then,

176
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:31,570
right when you watch walk the red
carpet or something like that. Um,

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,280
so anyways, so there you go.

178
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,400
This my fully shit moment I have to make
in front of all those fucking awards

179
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:40,480
shows. Uh, I'm actually
gonna walk, go to one.

180
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,650
I don't know. What are you going to
do the fuck am I going to do right?

181
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,510
I'm doing it for the tape. Okay.
Can I get out of it by saying that?

182
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,520
So anyways, I was saying,
um, how my, um, my,

183
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,490
uh, my sporting world, how it
could get any better after the, uh,

184
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,490
the Patriots win and then the, uh, the,

185
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,350
the let down of seeing them given to the
fan pressure or whatever the fuck they

186
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:10,210
did. Getting rid of coach
Julian, um, tonight,

187
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,750
me for Z and a Joe Barnick or doing a
bucket list thing for any person that's

188
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,750
even remotely into sports.
We're going to the, uh,

189
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:24,751
the Duke versus a North
Carolina Tarheels game tonight.

190
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,890
And we've got some great seats,

191
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,030
was sitting right behind the f the
fucking Duke Bench coach k's going to be

192
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:35,380
there. If it wasn't so God damn loud in
that place, we could hear him, you know,

193
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,580
during the timeouts and everything,
it's going to be crazy. So, uh,

194
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,220
I don't know. It was a chance
you might see the three,

195
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,310
three of us dummies on TV. Um,

196
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,740
okay.

197
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,160
But beyond excited to go to this like
this is, there's a fucking huge one.

198
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,170
This is a huge one. Um, as far as the
bucket list, sports stuff to go to, uh,

199
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,270
years ago I told you, I don't know
if I told you guys I went to the, um,

200
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,790
I went to uh,

201
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:01,940
okay.

202
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,440
Indiana university
versus, um, what was it?

203
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,210
Michigan state and I believe it was a
year that Michigan State won the National

204
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,050
Championship and Bobby Knight
was still coaching there. And um,

205
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,140
okay.

206
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,980
I've never seen anything like that.
All the years, everything I've ever,

207
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,930
every sporting event I've ever gone to,

208
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I have never seen anything like
watching Bobby Knight coach a game.

209
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,570
I mean that guy, you watched
him more than as much,

210
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:33,840
if not more than you
were watching the game.

211
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,580
I was actually rooting for
the Spartans. You know,

212
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,970
I came there rooting for Indiana, but
Bobby was so fucking entertaining.

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,840
I started rooting for the Spartans
because I wanted to see him flip out even

214
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:49,710
more. I've never seen somebody with, yeah,

215
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,470
she made me feel good about myself.
Like just complete loss of composure

216
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,990
obviously or whatever his
coaching style motivating people.

217
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:02,560
I remember they let up a couple
of easy buckets in this kid.

218
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,430
The point guard starts bringing it up the
court and Bobby Knight is like 10 feet

219
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,910
onto the court and he's
yelling so much. He's like,

220
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,400
do you have a c a was it Ben Kingsley
and sexy bass? When he, when he's,

221
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,990
when he's yelling and being
a right content and he's
like throwing his head into

222
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:22,360
everything that he's saying.
That's what the fuck he was doing.

223
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,830
But it was way more intense cause
he wasn't acting. He was serious.

224
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,800
And um, I've never fucking
seen anything like that.

225
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:35,700
And that's one of my favorite of
everything that I've seen in sports.

226
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,960
The coolest thing ever is that I got
to see Bobby Knight Coach at Indiana

227
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:40,794
University.

228
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,690
Matt's fucking legendary like scenes
Zeplin we're seeing the Beatles, you know,

229
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,250
James Brown or whatever, like,
you know, that's right up there.

230
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,220
I saw Eddie Murphy on the
raw tour. I saw Eddie Wee.

231
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,290
These might think
greatest things I've seen.

232
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,820
I've seen Eddie Murphy on the raw tour.
I said when he went the purple suit,

233
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,730
I saw Bobby Knight, coach Indiana.

234
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,143
Um,

235
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,570
okay,

236
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,550
the fuck did I go from there? So
Judas Priest and the Turbo Lover Tour,

237
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,443
does that count?

238
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,640
I know I saw Stevie Ray Vaughn.

239
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,533
Um,

240
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,400
I saw Dan Marino kicked the
shit out of the Patriots,

241
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,590
um,

242
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,750
with Don Shula coaching
as someone. Great. Yeah.

243
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,190
Thinking about being an old guy as you
can start talking about all this shit

244
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,900
since like, nope, that now fucking no
longer exists. So I actually made a,

245
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:38,570
a few guys who just bear
with me clicking here, sorry.

246
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:39,950
And let's fucking loud as hell.

247
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,610
I know it's annoying and you're going
to listen to it again. Right now.

248
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,310
All right. I actually looked through, um,

249
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,760
okay.

250
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,590
I got this, this document teams scene

251
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,540
and um,

252
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,720
okay.

253
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,880
I have seen 31.

254
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,640
Okay.

255
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,480
I've been to a home game if
every major league baseball team,

256
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,440
I haven't been to all the stadiums
cause like the mets changed.

257
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,390
There's got a new one.
Philly's got a new one. Um,

258
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,810
but I've seen a total of 31.

259
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,760
There's 30 professional baseball teams.
I've seen 31 cause I went to the expos.

260
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,190
Um, I've seen 32 home games
of the NFL. There's 32 teams,

261
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:23,680
but I still need to see the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers there.

262
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:28,570
The last one I need to see, but I
saw the St Louis and the fucking, um,

263
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,730
the Saint Louis and the
fucking, uh, La Ramps.

264
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:38,850
So that's how I got up to
32. I've seen 25 NBA teams.

265
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,680
Uh, one of those being the a,
I saw both the Seattle Sonics.

266
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:44,960
Okay.

267
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,750
And the, uh, Oklahoma City Thunder.

268
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,150
Um,

269
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,720
and I saw the New Jersey Nets and I got
to go see the fucking Brooklyn that's

270
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,310
speaking of which I also
saw the fucking, oh,

271
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,000
did I see the fucking the islanders at
Nassau Coliseum. Now, if they don't,

272
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,530
if they don't become the Brooklyn

273
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,620
fucking islanders than a, that
I don't need to go see him.

274
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:14,290
It's like if you change your foot, it's
still in New York. You know what I mean?

275
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:19,180
I don't need to fucking do that.
So I've seen 27 of the 30 fucking,

276
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,080
uh, I got three more to see in, um,

277
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,370
in hockey. So I'm going to try to
knock those out over the next year.

278
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:30,270
The Fan Slam is what I'm
calling it, you know, you know,

279
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,420
Serena's fucking the Serena slim. This
is just the fan slam. The fucking,

280
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,750
you know, you have no life.
You run the fucking road,

281
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,700
you don't want to kill
yourself in a comedy Condo,

282
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,700
so you start building it
around home games. Um,

283
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,180
I actually made a list and I don't
know if you're not a sports fan,

284
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:47,320
this is going to bore the shit out of you.

285
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:51,460
But these are all the fucking places
I've been to that now no longer exist.

286
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,860
Uh, the Boston Garden, Sullivan
Stadium, a Yankee Stadium, Shea Stadium,

287
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,270
Veterans Stadium, three rivers
stadium, soon to be no longer there.

288

Joe Louis Arena, the
RCA slash Hoosier dome.

289
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,300
I saw Peyton manning there. Uh,

290
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,150
I saw a game at original soldier field,

291
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,880
got a picture and then this fucking
asshole stole my goddamn camera. I was,

292
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,290
had a picture of me and
uh, when I went to, um, uh,

293
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,230
green bay packers, that game was
a, um, it was a preseason game.

294
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:27,920
They played the browns bred fabric
was still there. Verse he says,

295
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,690
I can't count that one because
it's preseason. But the reality is,

296
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,080
is you just wants me to book, you know,

297
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,800
book a Gig at like the skyline
cafe and go to a packers game,

298
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,690
which of course I will, I'll do. Alright.

299
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,430
Continuing on county stadium to
the target center, the Metrodome,

300
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,920
the Edward Jones Dome,
which is still there,

301
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:49,010

305
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,920

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,050
San Diego Padres there and I went there
with and watch Mark McGuire take batting

307
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:11,580

I saw him hit number 27 to 28 there,

309
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,910

they redid it. Um, La,

310
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:25,830
the La sports arena that's still there,
but I saw, um, who did I see there?

311
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:26,970
I saw the clip was there.

312
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,200
I saw the clippers there and biggie smalls
was in the crowd and four days later

313
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:34,920
he was dead. Swear to
God. Uh, the La Forum.

314
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,110
Um,

315
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:42,110
I saw fucking a young Koby
Bryant and just left the,

316
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,810
uh, magic shack with
del Harris as a coach.

317
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,670
I want to say Dennis Rodman was on
that team. I went to candlestick park,

318
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,750
sat out in right field and saw a,

319
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,490

bigger Barry bonds,

320

game with a rookie year cad,

321
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,930

322
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,930
I saw a young Ken Griffey Jr I
sat right out in center field,

323
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,130

oh, and you know what else? The, uh,

324
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,240
the Montreal forum,

325
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,930
I can't believe I forgot that I saw
the [inaudible] 1989 I went up there in

326
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:24,580
March and I saw I, uh,

327
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,590
Canadians versus the fucking Minnesota
North Stars with Patrick won that.

328
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,810
Okay.

329
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,340
I of course, rooted for the North
Stars and they of course lost. Um,

330
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,700
so whatever that that's the dumb bullshit
that I do when I'm out here on the

331
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:45,380
road. And now I can add the after
tonight, do Carolina and, uh,

332
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,660
I want to thank the comedy
zone for hooking us up,

333
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,003
um,

334
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,930
with some sort of Duke booster
that gave us those tickets.

335
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,990
And I was surprised the person came
to the game. I came to the game,

336
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:59,740
came to the show last night and left
without saying hello, which was,

337
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,020
it's like at least go to thank the guy.
So if he's listening or she's listening,

338
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,050
whatever the fuck it is, it got me
the tickets. Thank you so much. Uh,

yourself. Oh my God. First of all,

in the nude. You know, it's my kitchen.

407
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:17,000
If I pulled the blinds, who gives a
shit? Right? You know, I put on an apron.

408
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,781
You know,

409
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:21,500

naked cooking with an apron on,

that's kind of like a, that's the

432
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,750
You know what it's about Com dad jeans
now guys who became dads and like the

433
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:46,460
last 10 years as those true religion ones
that add like that horseshoe stitching

434
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,630
on the fucking back.

435
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,750
I saw a couple of guys at the airport
wearing those and they had like kids and

436
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:54,710
shit in there, all faded. You know,
the dumb white stitching down the side.

437
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,060
I didn't even buy those things.

438
00:25:56,061 --> 00:26:00,590
Those things from day one look like
some country singer Shit, right?

469
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,030
Um, all right.

470
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,400
Is that been a half an hour? I have no
idea. I never know whenever I'm fucking

471
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,620
recording on just the garage
band thing here. So A,

472
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:08,930
we're going to go to the
game here tonight. Um,

473
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,600
I can't believe I'm going to see them
be this close to fucking coach k.

474
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,790
I know Duke's having a
tough time this year,

475
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:19,620
but coach k's back from
back surgery and um,

476
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,520
he did that thing where he, uh,

477
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,850
I guess every once in a while I
get so disgusted with his team.

478
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:29,851
He doesn't let them wear any Duke gear
and he won't let them in the locker room

479
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,870
until they start playing at a fucking
level that the university has used to see

480
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,200
you gotta Love That Old School
coaching that made me look up like 'em.

481
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,930
Okay.

482
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,201
You know,

483
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:44,560
I was looking up all this stuff on coach
k and I didn't realize that when he was

484
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,050
at army, he played for Bobby Knight.

485
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,740
I didn't know that he assisted with Bobby
Knight and all and there's all these

486
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:51,910
great fucking pictures.

487
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,080
He got to see the way Bobby Knight is
dressed in 1979 in Puerto Rico when he's

488
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:57,250
at the Pan Am games.

489
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,910
Of course he ended up getting arrested
because he allegedly slapped a cop or

490
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:01,840
something like that.

491
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,490
Yeah.

492
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,460
You want to talk about a guy that needs
to fucking meditate? Jesus Christ. Um,

493
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,850
yeah.

494
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,440
So anyways, uh,

495
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,040
I was watching all this stuff where's
coach sent me down this rabbit hole of

496
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,000
Bobby Knight stuff

497
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,330
and um, you know,

498
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,200
my favorite clip of all the Bobby
Knight ones was when somebody secretly

499
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:28,500
recorded them cause I feel like that
was the real Bobby night cause I thought

500
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:32,520
towards the end he kind of was,
was doing the Bobby Knight thing.

501
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,730
Like when he did that game face thing,
I think at that point he was just,

502
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,660
he started like hamming it
up when he didn't need to.

503
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,780
But like when you listen to that one
where he's talking about the Purdue game

504
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:48,400
coming up and that he has an eight
and 10 record, um, I swear to God,

505
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:53,401
I'm going to start listening to that
speech before I go to the gym because I

506
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:56,260
actually listened to that thing and he's
talking about how he had to go to some

507
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,190
function and he goes,
and I'm sitting there,

508
00:29:58,191 --> 00:30:00,790
I'm tired of sit down with a
fucking eight and 10 record.

509
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,290
Everybody fucking look sick. Second
fucking time. Hello. Is it a fucking per,

510
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:07,450
do you guys get the fuck out there?

511
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,030
Send somebody if you
fucking lose to Purdue,

512
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,790
he put me in that fucking position. I
will fucking run you something until you,

513
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,340
I don't know, something about
puking or whatever. It's,

514
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,980
it's just such a great speech.
And then the end of it.

515
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,440
Yeah,

516
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,370
my natural reaction, I laughed and
just said, that's how it's done.

517
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,500
And a, I know we got a lot of criticism
for the stuff that he did, but um,

518
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:36,640
I think a lot of that criticism
came from people that, um,

519
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,330
are not athletic. We're never
in a locker room. And um,

520
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:42,660
yeah,

521
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,290
you know, they came from that whole, they,

522
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,300
they actually had bad
experiences in sports and
listening to Bobby Knight Yell I

523
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:54,921
think just brought all their sucking
in gym class memories back and um,

524
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:57,801
I dunno,

525
00:30:57,801 --> 00:31:01,970
it's like there's this certain type of
person that is a fucking athlete and can

526
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:06,080
handle that and understands
what the fuck that is. And uh,

527
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,180
I think if they don't
have a problem with it,

528
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,260
all these people who don't play sports
should just shut the fuck up about it

529
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,500
cause you don't understand
what's going on. And um,

530
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:16,820
okay.

531
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,631
I mean, Jesus Christ,

532
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:22,130
Bobby Knight won almost a thousand fucking
games and all his former players for

533
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:26,750
the most part love them. And
um, and I always felt that kid,

534
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,220
that last fucking incident
that Bobby Knight had, um,

535
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,570
I thought that felt that kid was baiting
him cause Bobby Knight walked by and I

536
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:38,750
think the kid said, what's
up night? You don't say that.

537
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:41,030
That's totally disrespectful
and night just said that,

538
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:44,600
that fucking tempers zero
to fucking 9,000. Um,

539
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,870
but I remember when I heard that story,
like that kid was being a fucking cunt.

540
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,690
Um, but you can't do that shit anymore.

541
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,020
At least during his heyday, there
was no cell phone cameras, man.

542
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:58,420
He really would've gotten a lot of trouble
because they would have been fucking

543
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,180
video of that. And I
would've loved every second.

544
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,560
I would have loved every
second of watching him grab
some student by the fucking

545
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:09,540
throat who just, what's up
night guys walking around.

546
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,690
900 fucking wins. Some sophomore
comes by. That's come on.

547
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,310
Um, so anyways, yeah. So we're going
to be hitting that game tonight. Um,

548
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,050
if anybody knows, uh, oh, by the
way, I have to give a shout out man.

549
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,100
I went to a, um, this is my new thing
now when I'm on the road, you know,

550
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:31,720
cause I got my beautiful little daughter
up at home and I can't play drums as

551
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:36,130
much, you know, uh, Nia still lets me
rehearse and stuff like that, you know,

552
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,310
not rehearse, like practice and
shit when, uh, what I'm homeless

553
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,420
to pick the kids up. But, um,

554
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,580
I haven't been able to
go to a, a, you know,

555
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,640
the practice place that I go to out in
La as much as I would like. So I'm like,

556
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,890
why am I on the road out or
look up these rehearsal spaces?

557
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,410
So I looked up this place
when I was in Charlotte.

558
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,900
It's called the playground and
yeah. Um, I went down. Yeah man,

559
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,240
shout out to Eddie Z who runs it.

560
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,330
Totally fucking one of the
coolest dudes I've met.

561
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,140
A lot of these rehearsal
spaces are just absolute shit.

562
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,420
The drum kits are old. Everything's
fucked up. Everything sounds like shit.

563
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:20,450
I went into this place, this place
was like a fucking first-class place.

564
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,390
He stuck me in the best
room that they had a,

565
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:26,450
at a discount price cause they were doing
construction on some other rooms that

566
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:28,910
he didn't want them, you know, disturb
me or whatever while I was playing,

567
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,420
I played for like fucking
three hours. Well,

568
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:35,750
I paid for three hours long to get to
about, you know, two hours and 20 minutes.

569
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,100
And my body was like giving out on me
and I just had the best fucking time.

570
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,780
And you know what I love
when I went in there,

571
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:46,280
the snare gun was tuned too low and I
was able to tune it up to sound pretty

572
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:46,730
good.

573
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,650
And I used to not even remotely have
a game plan on how to tune up a snare.

574
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,940
And, um, I was really
psyched about that. Uh,

575
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,420
thanks. [inaudible]. Anyways, um,

576
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,220
this guy, Eddie z was
saying he, he actually, uh,

577
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:10,270
used to be a roadie for van Halen
and he was on the 1984 tour,

578
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,150
the last phone with
David Lee rough. And, uh,

579
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,130
then he did a couple with Sammy Hagar.

580
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:19,610
So he had all these fucking
really cool pictures,

581
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:24,110
just originals that he
took of like Sammy and, uh,

582
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,460
Eddie van Halen and Dave Lee Roth
was really fucking cool and, uh,

583
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,380
I had the best time and
like, that's gonna be on.

584
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:31,670
So what I'm gonna do when I'm on the road,

585
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,050
now that I'm on back building up the hour,

586
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,550
work in the comedy clubs like the
old days, uh, at such a great time.

587
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:43,010
Last night on stage a comedy zone.

588
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,700
Do Comedy Zone is one of the best fucking
comedy clubs out there. By the way,

589
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,350
if you can find the God
damn thing, you got to,

590
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,440
he walk in and there's like a
cafeteria, then a bar and there's,

591
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,640
there's a sign that says comedy
zone and nobody tells you.

592
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,200
You got to like ask like 20 people.

593
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,840
It's like you feel your
way through the dark.

594
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:02,620
Did finally go down those stairs to go
down there. But just the hallway, this,

595
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,610
the stage is set up. Um, it seems like
every seat in the house is a good seat.

596
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,320
Um, you know, for, I mean obviously
I've never sat in the crowd out there,

597
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:15,770
but uh, just had the best time
working the shit out. I did two shows,

598
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:19,430
both shows I was able to do a little
over an hour just pasting together new

599
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:22,370
ideas that I have and then
old bits that, you know,

600
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:27,200
never made it on to specials.
And I'm just thought out this is,

601
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,093
this is,

602
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,330
you wouldn't think so this is one of my
favorite times of doing stand up is just

603
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:37,331
letting everything else go and just
trying to figure out like what the new

604
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:41,640
shit's going to be. You know, I'm reading
newspapers, I'm bright and shit down.

605
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,530
Anything that I can
throw against the wall.

606
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,580
Last night I was on stage talking about
how fucking human beings are edible.

607
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,010
Like and everyone was like, what the fuck?

608
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:52,800
And that'd be something that I would
abandoned but I had no material and I just

609
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:55,490
kept going with it. And um,

610
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,303
yeah,

611
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,770
I dunno, it just takes
me back to my early days.

612
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,920
Um, I was stand up when
uh, because your skills,

613
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,420
like if you don't have the material,

614
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,440
it just complete your skills completely
diminished even though you have the

615
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:16,580
poise and the, the skill set because
you've been doing it that long,

616
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:17,414
but it's just completed.

617
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,200
Just imagine a band if they
had to like just work workshop,

618
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:26,120
some rifts in front of a fucking
crowd without like rehearse.

619
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,230
And that's the greatest thing about
the art of stand up comedy is that you

620
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:31,064
can't,

621
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,210
you can't go to a rehearsal space and
get this shit together and then fucking

622
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:38,060
like you have to second.

623
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,680
You like coming up with riffs and
front of the fucking crowd. Um,

624
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:48,110
and it's, uh, yeah, it's fucking
work. It's absolute work. But,

625
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,670
um, I don't know. I'm a fucking lunatic,
so I totally enjoy this part of it.

626
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,340
So anyways, that is the
podcast. Uh, once again,

627
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:59,720
thanks to whoever it is that
owns these two seats, um,

628
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,290
whoever that is, get in
touch with the comedy zone.

629
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:07,700
You have free tickets to any comedy
show that I ever do. Full life,

630
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,380
front row, whatever the fuck you want.
Forgiven given up these tickets. Um,

631
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,370
Jan, thank you enough. This is
going to be amazing. So I'm,

632
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,720
we're on our way up to Durham
and I was just out there,

633
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,840
so I know a couple of good
spots to eat at. So, uh,

634
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,920
we're going to have a good time.
All right, that's the podcast.

635
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,170
Go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend.
Yukon and I will talk to you. Uh,

636
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,970
I'll talk to you on Monday. I'll let
you know about the game. All right.

637
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,063
Mm.

638
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,763
Uh,

639
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,310
[inaudible] uh

640
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,953
mm.

641
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,480
Hey,

642
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,190
what's up? This is Bill Barr and uh,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

643
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,140
I just did a 50 minute podcast.

644
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:05,460
I tried to save it and
didn't once again this week.

645
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:10,560
Talked for fucking hour
evidently to nobody. Um,

646
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:15,590
I'm going to have to buy some sort of
device so I can save them so I can try and

647
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,440
pull them back up. I don't
know what to tell you, but a,

648
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:20,910
I don't even know if this
one's going to record.

649
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,770
I don't know if I'm going too long.

650
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,340
I don't even know who the fuck I'm
supposed to call. Who the fuck do I call?

651
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,960
It's not like I called this number
on anybody you can talk to, picks up,

652
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,100
you know, typical of how we're living.

653
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,180
Do you know I was on the fucking
airplane flying out to Boston, right?

654
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,980
I'm on the airplane and for some reason
they always have the fucking intercoms

655
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:47,530
turned all the way up the 10. Right?

656
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,780
Hello is my God damn eardrums out. So
I say the lady, she walks by, I go,

657
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:57,330
is there any way you can turn the
thing down? She's like, Nah, sy die.

658
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,400
There's nothing we can do. You
mean there's nothing you could do?

659
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,210
You can go up there. He can
fucking turn it down. But it would,

660
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,250
they be installed an intercom system

661
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,430
on 10 with no fucking volume,
whatever. Fuck this technology shit.

662
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:13,241
I got to figure out,

663
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:15,940
somebody sent me an email about
something that I can record into.

664
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,820
I'm going to try to find that. I
guess I got to go out and buy it,

665
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:21,750
but I apologize. Um,

666
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,530
I'm gonna try to do one again
tomorrow or something like that. Uh,

667
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,330
oh Jesus. It was such a great podcast.
God dammit. All right. Whatever.

668
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,930
I'm gonna try tomorrow. So
all 14 of you hang in there.

669
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,150
I'm gonna do a podcast tomorrow.
All right. Take it easy.

670
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,490
[inaudible] [inaudible]

671
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,760
bill bar. I don't know what the
fuck is wrong with this g thing,

672
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:23,820
but I have figured out
how to save my podcast.

673
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,480
All attitude was press number two. For
some reason that wasn't hearing that,

674
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,610
you know, I dunno, she
was saying it or whatever.

675
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:37,230
The computer with the fucking
female voice has been saying it,

676
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:38,850
but I don't know what's
going on with this thing.

677
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:41,250
It seems anytime I record
something longer than a,

678
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:46,610
I don't know what a doesn't fucking go
through, but I know how to save them.

679
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,800
So all I'm saying is from here on out, um,

680
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,830
I won't lose any more podcasts,

681
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:54,470
but I'm going to do a podcast tomorrow
and I'm going to save the thing and

682
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:56,210
hopefully I can publish it. All right.

683
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:59,750
Thank you for your patience and God
bless the United States of America.

684
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,460
[inaudible]

685
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,630
Hey, what's going on? It's still, it
is the Monday morning port by podcast.

686
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,830
Somebody said, pull it.

687
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,030
The Monday morning podcast
will on Guy Island.

688
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,090
That's six 18 on a fucking Wednesday.

689
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,590
And I learned how to save these podcasts
and he'd go, this is the podcast.

690
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,980
This is it. I'm doing one
take. I don't give a fuck.

691
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,260
I've already done it three times and I'm
running a red light and I made it good

692
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,960
deal the deal. Oh Hey you
guys, you guys got cameras,

693
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,120
you got cameras where you're at. You know,

694
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:04,130
you run a red light and they
take your fucking picture.

695
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,140
And if for some reason you
have to pay the fucking ticket,

696
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,190
I got a way around it. I got
away around it that I've learned.

697
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,501
Somebody told me,

698
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:19,970
all you gotta do when you run the red
light is you gotta be in the center.

699
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,590
You know, if there's two
lanes, just be in the middle,

700
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,370
had half your car in one lane after
your car on the other lane and no,

701
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:32,480
it doesn't get your full license plate
or your full face and you throw it.

702
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,970
Granted, I haven't tried that yet,

703
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:39,170
but I heard you can do
that also is another way.

704
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,630
When I got my car out here
and last on delays, evidently,

705
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,640
evidently there's so many
fucking people out here that, uh,

706
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,420
that, you know, it takes, I swear to God,

707
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:57,080
it took like four weeks or six weeks
for me to get my license plate.

708
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,280
Something ridiculous.

709
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,690
So basically I drove around
for well over a month

710
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,880
with the, just the name of the
dealership where I bought my car at,

711
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,530
on both the front and the back.
And one day as luck would have it,

712
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,310
I was like going to the airport and I
ran a fucking red light and they took my

713
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:20,930
picture and I flipped out. I
was like, ah, fuck. You know,

714
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,850
that's me flipping out that, fuck.
See, I stick it acting. That's good.

715
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:28,430
Bill, could you raise the stakes you
want to? I really did. I was like,

716
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:32,090
you gotta be fucking kidding
me. This is fucking punk shit.

717
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,860
That's what I really did. But I
didn't want to yell like that. And um,

718
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,210
but basically all they had was the picture
of the dealership and my stupid face.

719
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,020
So I never got the tickets.
Why am I admitting to this?

720
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,800
Can they use this in a court
of law? Come and get me Shea.

721
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,840
So anyways, I'm driving down the street
and I don't have my laptop with me,

722
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:55,130
so I don't have your questions,

723
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:01,210
but God knows I read them enough times
that I can actually remember him once.

724
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:04,460
So here's the first question
somebody asked me, hey bill,

725
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,000
what kind of drum kit
that you have? And it, um,

726
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,710
well you have it a band and if so, do you
have any good band stories? All right.

727
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,150
I have a late seventies
Slingerland five ply,

728
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,240
the five ply shells and nobody wants,

729
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,190
everybody wants to three plus
shells from the late sixties,

730
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:26,180
early seventies to get that great tone.
Whatever the fuck they're talking about.

731
00:44:26,181 --> 00:44:29,290
Well, fortunately I'm a comedian
so I don't give a fuck. I'll tech,

732
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,870
I'll take the extra two plies. And uh,
basically they're all bottom sizes.

733
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,400
14 by 24 bass drum. I add a 13,

734
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,480
I mean 30 had 14 and then
an 18 inch floor Floortime.

735
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,090
So years later I bought
the 16 inch floor Tom.

736
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:49,740
And recently I had another bass drum
cause I was listening to Primus and I was

737
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:52,140
like, I want to play like Tim Alexander,

738
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,750
even though I already had
a double pedal. I'm like,

739
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:58,350
I'm going to add another bass drum pedal
because that guy from slayer said it's

740
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:02,040
not the same unless you have
the fucking both of them.

741
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,960
So I went out and I bought another bass
drum and I should have realized the fact

742
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:10,110
that I suck with the double pedal,
that they added a second base drum.

743
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,590
All it was going to do was just take up
more room and it wouldn't make me any

744
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:18,360
better a drummer, but I did it.
So, uh, yeah, that's what I played.

745
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,860
I got an old snuggling kit and
have I ever been in a band? No,

746
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,520
I was never in a band. I
just had a fucking, I didn't,

747
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:29,970
the drums were at my house.
Everybody came over to jam man.

748
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,520
And we sucked. Which is why everybody,

749
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,740
whoever came over now has a real job.

750
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,470
Um, yeah, that's it. I
don't have any rock star.

751
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,500
I don't have any of you fucking fan
stories other than that we stunk the usual

752
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:53,490
shit. And the next question
somebody asked me was, uh,

753
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,430
what the fuck was the question

754
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:03,140
was some question about I guess late
at night they got these new economy

755
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:07,740
dentures, something like this.
That's what the person asked me.

756
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:11,700
Have you seen these economy dentures?
What the fuck is this? And, uh,

757
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,970
it's actually a really
interesting question because
I used to work in a dental

758
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:19,040
office and I know a little something
about dentures. Huh? We're going to meet,

759
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,910
it's peeling off another layer
of the onion as Madonna says.

760
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,090
You know, she actually had the
balls to say that one time.

761
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:31,710
She doesn't have any balls. God
knows. We've all seen her Twat, um,

762
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,380
that she actually had the nerve to say
that when she did yet another totally

763
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:41,940
planned out. You know, look, I
can dress like a whore this way.

764
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,940
Nice fucking parking
job. You fucking idiot.

765
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,360
Fuck. I swear to God, man.
People just, you know,

766
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,810
people cannot fucking drive out
here in la. They really can't.

767
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,780
Like a lot of people don't know that.
All they talk about is the traffic.

768
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,970
Who it good. It's good because so
fucking bed man. Well you know what,

769
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:07,390
when it clears up, the driving gets
it and people can actually drive the,

770
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,280
there are, I've established it
before. You know they fucking,

771
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:13,500
they suck at driving out here.
You're that homeless guy.

772
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:16,380
There's a homeless guy out here. I swear
to God he looks like George Clinton.

773
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,460
I'm from parliament. Anybody. So anyways,

774
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,800
you're asking me what
these economy dentures are.

775
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,720
I'm going to guess that they
are a one size fits all denture,

776
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:33,670
which really fucking bizarre.
And I bet I'm on the upper,

777
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,700
it has some sort of a form fitting
thing that will fit to your pallet.

778
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,000
It's horrific because when you get a
denture, you're actually supposed to,

779
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,880
you know this impressions,
you pour up a model,

780
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,710
you know if they took out some teeth,

781
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,870
they try to get the teeth to
look like your other teeth.

782
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,310
So you don't freak people out.

783
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:54,730
Like one day you look like a witch and
the next day you come walking in and look

784
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,310
like Guy Smiley. You know,

785
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,770
I used to work in a dental office. I
actually am certified to take x-rays.

786
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,240
I can take impressions. The
upper impression was the worst.

787
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,000
I'd always get some. I'm just going to
let you know that I'm a gagger. I gag.

788
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:14,410
Really?

789
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,080
Why don't you just brush your fucking
teeth so I don't have to worry about you

790
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:21,300
throwing up on the mud. The
fucking left sleeve of my, uh,

791
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,310
my what? What do you call
those? The doctor robe.

792
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,490
The doctor coat or whatever. Yeah.

793
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:31,000
I used to take the impressions
and people used to always gag

794
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,230
when you do the top. And if you
hang in there another eight seconds,

795
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,610
and then they always have done,
they always say, yeah, God,

796
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,530
I fucking hate the dentist. Really? Well,

797
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:45,220
why don't you brush your fucking
teeth? You idiot. You know?

798
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:49,090
I guess I do the same thing.
I ain't going to the gym,

799
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:53,890
but God knows I'm going to go order
a fucking pizza right now. Jesus.

800
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:56,410
I'm gonna move. So yeah,
that's what I would get.

801
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:58,210
So basically after you
took the impressions,

802
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:02,080
if you want to know the whole fucking
process and the person's going every five

803
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:06,100
seconds, if they don't puke on you,
you actually have a good impression.

804
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:10,570
Then you take it into the little lab and
then you take out the little Green Cup,

805
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,910
that rubber Green Cup,
that's all I remember.

806
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,540
Things could only be mixed in that.
I never took a chemistry class,

807
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:19,060
so I don't know why it couldn't
be just a plastic bowl,

808
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:20,350
but it was always those rubber things.

809
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,050
And then you'd mix it up
and then you'd pour it

810
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,670
into the fucking impression and then
you'd stick it on this little vibrating

811
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:31,660
thing, trying to get all
the bubbles out of it.

812
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:36,010
And it was nothing fucking worse if you
didn't get all the bubbles out of it.

813
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:36,880
And then I swear to God,

814
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:39,790
the bubble would always be right where
the person's tooth was and you'd fuck up

815
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:42,370
the whole impression. And then you'd
have to go in there and be like,

816
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,700
we gotta do it again. I'd
have to deal with that again.

817
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,740
So I would guess that what
they're doing is, is they, uh,

818
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:54,400
they're skipping that whole
step. I don't know what they do.

819
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:59,830
If you take a whole pack of juicy fruit
and you chew it up and then, you know,

820
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,740
form it to the top of your mouth and
then you mail that in and they make a

821
00:50:02,741 --> 00:50:05,450
denture out of that. I have no
fucking idea. But that's really a,

822
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:10,390
that's really a scary thing. It's
a really scary thing, you know?

823
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,820
That's the kind of Shit
I wish people focused on.

824
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,630
Like everybody keeps talking about that
fucking broad where the eight kids,

825
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:22,420
can you believe it? I mean, that's
so irresponsible. Who gives a fuck?

826
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,050
People talking about all the
money she's going to cost us.

827
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:30,450
She's going to cost us what, a couple
million, you know, what about these?

828
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,410
Do you know the fucking bankers?
Three quarters of $1 trillion.

829
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:34,610
Nobody gives a fuck about that.

830
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:38,510
Some chicks squirts eight babies out
of her twat. It's going to cost us,

831
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:42,440
you know, one half of 1% compared
to what these fucking cons did,

832
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:46,670
who stole a trillion dollars and then
gave themselves $30 million bonuses.

833
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:49,220
Nobody gives a shit about that. You know,

834
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:52,430
some chicks squirts up fucking eight
babies and all of a sudden no one can stop

835
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:55,670
looking at it. You know
why? Because it has a face.

836
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,380
You know what she looks
like? That's the thing.

837
00:50:57,381 --> 00:51:00,350
That's the genius of the bankers.
Nobody knows what a banker looks like.

838
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,770
I don't even know what the fuck my teller
looks like. I go to the Goddamn ATM

839
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:10,730
cause I worked nights.
Um, all right, what else?

840
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:13,370
What else could I do on this podcast?
This is going to be a short podcast.

841
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:17,120
I'm doing a podcast until I get home
and that's going to be it because I'm

842
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:20,720
exhausted with these fucking
podcast. All right? It's insane.

843
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:27,190
The amount of podcasts that I've done
this fucking week and to no avail.

844
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,640
You know,

845
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,230
it reminds me of listening to somebody
talking about who the fuck was it

846
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,150
recording with like a ray
Charles. You do like nine,

847
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:42,470
9,000 takes of Georgia on
my mind by the end of it,

848
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:44,270
you wanted to make them
deaf too. You know,

849
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,860
that's what I feel like right now
with these fucking podcasts. So, um,

850
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:52,580
I guess the last thing that I have to do
is I'm stuck in traffic waiting to make

851
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:56,810
my left hand turn to come
home to order a pizza, uh,

852
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,840
is I gonna announce the winner of the, uh,

853
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:02,930
the submissions for the
original a proc tologist.

854
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,960
I went to the proctologist
joke, I gotta admit, man,

855
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,960
they were all strong and
everybody seemed to like,

856
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,290
there's sort of an even amount of people
like in every one of them except for

857
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:17,240
one. So basically I think I'm gonna
pass out like a three or four DVDs.

858
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,900
You know, you know what? Everybody's
a winner, except for the one guy,

859
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:26,340
the one guy on meandered for 20 minutes
about having the chicks titty mashed in

860
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:30,680
the mammogram. He's the only one who
didn't get any votes. Everybody else.

861
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,290
The Guy with the potato salad
line got a lot of votes.

862
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,470
The dude who freak me out
get a bunch of votes and uh,

863
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,290
the dude who did the,
uh, had the great angle.

864
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:44,710
I thought this was the
most original angle of,

865
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,720
of the gay guy bragging that he's
dating approch cologists you know,

866
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,440
if he didn't listen to that
podcast, he was saying like,

867
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,000
it's kind of like if you know one of your,

868
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,590
one of your buddies started dating
a generalist, you know, and then,

869
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:02,780
then all your buddies would
be jealous. Like Jesus Christ.

870
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:05,870
I bet she can do some
freaky shit. You know,

871
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,860
you can bend her every which way
you're saying gay guys would do that.

872
00:53:09,861 --> 00:53:12,860
I bet they'd get jealous if you started
dating a proctologist and they'd all be

873
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:17,030
sitting around going to Kai. I bet he
really knows his way around an ass.

874
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,460
Thank you. That was the hacky gay guy
voice. I don't know if you guys noticed,

875
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:27,090
but my chick voice is basically the hacky
gay guy voice. Just done it a whisper.

876
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,740
If you ever want to get that
impression down instead of going,

877
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,290
hi fellows. I just go,

878
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,240
hey, what's going on? This is

879
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:41,330
his relationship going exact site that
I am a complete fucking no talent.

880
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:46,760
And anyways, I'm in my garage
right now. So this podcast is over.

881
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:50,580
I know it was a quick one. I know.
It was a quick one. All right.

882
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,690
It's a little 12 minutes.
It's an ETP. All right.

883
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,320
Like guns and roses live. That's
what it's like. All right. Step.

884
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:02,321
I didn't drop the n word even though
there was a half black Obama guitarist in

885
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:03,344
my group.

886
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,630
How fucking drugged up with slash that
day where he fucking co-signed on that

887
00:54:08,631 --> 00:54:12,890
one. Anyways, I want to thank
everybody who came out to the, uh,

888
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,130
my shows back in Boston. Uh,

889
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,420
the comedy connection at
the Wilbur Theater and out
in chicken p Massachusetts.

890
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,280
I had an, I had a great time coming back
there and a bunch of friends, family,

891
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,560
former babysitter from the 70
showed up. It was a, a was just,

892
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:34,610
it was an unbelievable weekend. And
uh, then I went out to chickopee,

893
00:54:34,611 --> 00:54:37,010
Massachusetts. That show sold out as well.

894
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,340
And I was a bunch of drunks and
I made my way through it. And uh,

895
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:48,170
then I went back to my
fancy hotel in Boston.

896
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:52,450
I ordered a Philemon Yawn. The,

897
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,620
the made had left classical
music on the clock radio.

898
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,140
Trying to remember how this
went down. That's fine.

899
00:55:00,141 --> 00:55:03,620
I walked into my a hotel room,

900
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,620
but you know the turn down service,
I don't know what that means.

901
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,230
They fold your sheets back
and they give you a mint.

902
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,550
And she left classical music
claim on my clock radio.

903
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:17,600
I ordered the a menu minion,
little mashed potatoes,

904
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,710
a glass of red wine. And
I sat there and ate it.

905
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,810
And it was one of the most
loneliest experiences I've
ever had in my life to the

906
00:55:26,811 --> 00:55:31,550
point I actually had to call Robert Kelly
and tell him in the moment how lonely

907
00:55:31,551 --> 00:55:35,810
I was. The stakes suck too. I actually,

908
00:55:35,811 --> 00:55:40,730
it was such a bad space. I actually
didn't even consider putting a one on it.

909
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,870
I went straight to ketchup. That's how
bad it was. And I don't put anything on,

910
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,440
you shouldn't put anything on a
steak. It should just taste delicious.

911
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,720
And the thing was so fucking,

912
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,900
I ordered it medium rare and it was gray
all the way through and it was tough.

913
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,380
Like fucking shoe leather. That
Mozzarella. Um, anybody know the app?

914
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,070
What's that one from anybody?
I'll give you five seconds.

915
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,410
Tough like fucking shoe
leather. That Mozzarella,

916
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,830
I only know one other fucking person
who have a new that reference.

917
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:14,330
We have a brought it up and
he owns Gotham comedy club.

918
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,570
It was, uh, Eric Roberts and uh,

919
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:24,550
the of Greenwich village talk like
fucking shoe leather, that Mozzarella,

920
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,840
any the fucking steak stunk. And
I actually put ketchup on it.

921
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,640
I like it literally takes, it
tasted like fucking hamburger it.

922
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,790
No it didn't cause hamburger tastes
great, but you know what I mean?

923
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,040
Any chefs out there, you
never put ketchup. Okay,

924
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,500
let's do overrated or underrated.
You know, it's fucking overrated.

925
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:46,350
A one steak sauce. I
don't even get it. It's,

926
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,430
it's just, it sucks.

927
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,930
I am in a garage right now talking to
myself basically about fucking a one steak

928
00:56:53,931 --> 00:56:56,870
sauce. Who gives a fuck?
I'm done with this podcast.

929
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,780
Next week you're going to get, you're
going to get a double album out of me.

930
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:03,710
All right? I promise you. But this
week you get in the EAP. All right.

931
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,440
Thank you to everybody who came out
to the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

932
00:57:06,441 --> 00:57:11,441
Massachusetts and all you fucking meth
heads and drugs who came up to the hooky

933
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,220
Louth and chicken chickopee
Massachusetts. And uh, my next Gig,

934
00:57:16,221 --> 00:57:20,780
my next upcoming Gig, I am going
to be at wise guys in Ogden, Utah.

935
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:26,570
I believe it's Saturday night,
the uh, February 21st. So,

936
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:29,630
uh, please come out to see me, man.
I've never done a club up that way.

937
00:57:29,631 --> 00:57:30,740
I've only done colleges.

938
00:57:30,741 --> 00:57:35,741
And why don't you come along and bring
your 18 fucking wives or whatever the

939
00:57:35,931 --> 00:57:40,070
hell is you Mormons do out
there. And uh, you know,

940
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:43,300
I think a, you're a cool Mormon if
you're actually listening to this.

941
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,290
So you know, come out to the show and uh,

942
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,060
congratulations to the
Lakers in the Cavaliers, man.

943
00:57:50,061 --> 00:57:53,660
You guys look like you're going to be
playing, you just playing a hundred game,

944
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,810
playing a fucking hungry
or game. But I have to,

945
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:01,520
I have to say this before I sign
off. I really think that, uh,

946
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:06,610
the reason why I can't stay on the fucking
NBA is unlike any other sports like

947
00:58:07,461 --> 00:58:11,900
that sport, the officials
control the outcome of the game.

948
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,460
Like I've never seen. It's like,

949
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:18,461
it always like the Celtics Lakers was
a fucking great game and then down into

950
00:58:18,591 --> 00:58:21,650
the end they just kept blowing
the whistle on both sides.

951
00:58:21,651 --> 00:58:25,490
I'm not being a crybaby here. Lakers won
fair and square, but I'm just saying,

952
00:58:25,491 --> 00:58:29,960
you know, sometimes they should just
put the fucking whistle away, you know,

953
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,800
just let them fucking play. And
they did that in the Cavaliers game.

954
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:38,120
It's like you got these two juggernauts
going head to fucking head and then this

955
00:58:38,121 --> 00:58:39,830
little fat keeps blowing his whistle.

956
00:58:39,831 --> 00:58:44,180
Now all the action stops and
then you know, you know, hey,

957
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:47,600
stop pushing him. That's ridiculous. Okay,

958
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,940
let's let them shoot
uncontested. It's the most,

959
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,770
it's the biggest fucking buzz kill to
the end of any game I've ever seen.

960
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:59,580
You know? And I love how they,
there's been a referee that was,

961
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,600
has been busted for having mob ties in
the fucking NBA and I'm supposed to act

962
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,320
like that's the only guy.
Like there was that was, yeah,

963
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:13,360
that was just one bad apple.
You know, I think, I don't know.

964
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:14,860
What do you guys think?
That's my question for you.

965
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:16,840
This week I'd have all
the four major sports.

966
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:20,710
Which referee do you
think if you bought them,

967
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:25,070
could influence the outcome of the,
the uh, the outcome of the game?

968
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,810
I'd have to go NBA cause it's so
easy to get a guy out of the game.

969
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:34,760
You just keep calling files in
football, you know, you want how many?

970
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:37,630
You just throw a guy out of the game,
you've got to wait til he, you know,

971
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,800
kick somebody in the balls
and spits in their face.

972
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:42,830
And I don't know what
will get me babbling.

973
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:45,950
And literally the light in my garage
went out. I got to get out of the car.

974
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:46,970
All right guys, that's it.

975
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:49,130
I'm going to save this podcast
so you're going to hear it.

976
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,790
What's, I don't know how
to fucking uploading.

977
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,870
It's been a brutal week.
Alright God, let's take it.

978
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,910
[inaudible] alright.

979
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,090
Fuck list bill. I wake up
at my girlfriend's house.

980
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:34,980
She leaves to work. I can't find
my socks. She says I have some.

981
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:38,400
She says I have some
just use mine in leaves.

982
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:43,300
I wake up later and I look for the
sock drawer. Top drawer. Right. Um,

983
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:48,350
and I find this list with about 20 to
30 names on it and my name is near the

984
01:00:48,751 --> 01:00:53,550
bottom. Oh No. Some have
check marks on them,

985
01:00:53,551 --> 01:00:54,384
et cetera.

986
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:00,660
I asked her about it and
while she's initially upset
it turns out to be her fuck

987
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:04,880
list. Wow. I don't even have a file.

988
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,960
I have a list in my head. She
actually made a fuck list.

989
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:11,750
Dude, you coined a phrase.

990
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:18,740
She said she made it after we got together
with some friends drunk one night.

991
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:23,730
She then admitted to being
somewhat of a whore. Her words,

992
01:01:23,731 --> 01:01:26,010
not mine before we met,

993
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:30,720
but assures me that she
hasn't done anything since
she met me with anyone else.

994
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:34,230
I do believe her, but I
totally blew up on her.

995
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,840
And we haven't been
talking for a few days.

996
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:41,220
I also look a bit creepy as to why
I went through her door drawer.

997
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,410
It was in an envelope. Yeah.
You know what it is? Yeah.

998
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,870
You kind of look creepy, but
she would've done that to you.

999
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:53,550
You know women call it snooping when
we do it. It's fucking creepy. Anyways,

1000
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:58,410
he goes, I need some help here on this
one too. I apologize. She already has.

1001
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:03,480
Do I just say fuck it and forget
about it? What's Ne his take on it?

1002
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,880
God dammit. You know what?

1003
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,640
I'm going to have to ask
her. Take on that one.

1004
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,880
I'm not going to have it on this
podcast. When I, when I go home,

1005
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,590
I fly home tomorrow,

1006
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:22,710
I'll try to have an
epilogue to this podcast,

1007
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,430
um, or maybe tack it onto
to the following weeks.

1008
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,470
That is a great question
because I don't trust this girl.

1009
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,310
You know that when, when a
girl is that fucking free.

1010
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,760
All right. And I know
girls are getting mad. Why?

1011
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:42,640
Why can't we be as free as you?

1012
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:46,840
I'll tell you why you can't because
you don't have to work at getting laid.

1013
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,010
Okay, I can be sexually liberated.
I still have to go out to the bar,

1014
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:57,490
man, I got to do a fucking
tap dance. You know,

1015
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,500
like me getting laid.

1016
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:04,330
It's like somebody on fucking a American
idol trying to get that ticket to

1017
01:03:04,331 --> 01:03:07,960
Vegas. You know? That's what it's
like as if for most guys anyways,

1018
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:12,970
to get laid, even if you
get good at it, it's,

1019
01:03:12,971 --> 01:03:14,410
it's like fucking, you know.

1020
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,183
Okay.

1021
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:22,180
It's, it's, it's not hot, but you guys,
anytime you want to fuck you can fuck.

1022
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:24,280
Look at that. Golden the came up
with a backup. I didn't know Zia.

1023
01:03:24,281 --> 01:03:27,400
I put my hand and I wasn't ready.
44 year old guy. I'm sitting there,

1024
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:32,170
the bootleg can't even fucking talk. Um,

1025
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,020
so that's what I would be worried about.

1026
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,640
She said she's a bit of a whore. Like

1027
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:44,900
I don't know if that's a good
thing or a bad thing or like a,

1028
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:49,000
I don't know about that one. She
sat down and she made a list.

1029
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:57,510
Jesus Cry 20 to 30 names. Now, this is
the thing, I don't know how old she is.

1030
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,270
All right. 20, you know, for a girl,

1031
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:04,680
20 to 30 names,

1032
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,550
I don't think is even that bad.

1033
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,300
The fact that she, well I dunno,
but we might be even worse because

1034
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,590
they, they

1035
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,790
are not honest about their numb. They do
the exact opposite of what we do. Guys.

1036
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:26,770
We exaggerate our numbers. They
dial them fucking back like,

1037
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,840
like women's, how many
guys are you been with?

1038
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:34,950
Numbers is like when they put out how
many people are unemployed in this

1039
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:38,100
country, you know, they try to
keep that number fucking down.

1040
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:42,300
It's the same thing. Uh, a fuck list.

1041
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,440
I mean, uh, I, I don't
know, I never get past that.

1042
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:54,100
You sat around with your friends
are your friends all whores,

1043
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,700
you know, and it's not like they just
sat there going, oh yeah, you know,

1044
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,130
I've fucking, you know,

1045
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:08,690
Bobby fell up fucking Dakota Tornado,

1046
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,750
another fucking modern
name. Um, Range Rover,

1047
01:05:13,751 --> 01:05:17,770
whatever. Fucking people
call kids and boys now. Um,

1048
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:22,080
and then, you know, there's
checks next to them of,

1049
01:05:22,081 --> 01:05:26,010
of like what she did with
them or how good the Dick was.

1050
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:27,810
And uh, I,

1051
01:05:27,811 --> 01:05:31,920
I don't know if that's one of those things
that they all fucking do and you just

1052
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:34,980
unfortunately peak behind the
curtain and you should let it go.

1053
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:39,410
I have no experience with
something like that. Um, oh,

1054
01:05:39,411 --> 01:05:41,040
this would have been a great nia question.

1055
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,000
I have to do this with her and
get into a fucking giant argument,

1056
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:50,780
but then I run the risk of
possibly getting a fucking
preview of her fuck list,

1057
01:05:51,931 --> 01:05:53,740
which I don't want to know
about. I don't want to know.

1058
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:57,180
I mean I gotta be honest with you.
I don't give a fuck at my age.

1059
01:05:57,181 --> 01:06:01,860
I don't give a clean good. Okay. What
do I think? You will fucking in a,

1060
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,550
in a goddamn bubble. I hope your banged
enough guys and learned how to fuck.

1061
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,240
I really do because I don't need some
fish in bed, you know, just laying there.

1062
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:12,720
Haman fucked a lot of people.
Great. Isn't that great?

1063
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:17,960
Do you want a pilot who hasn't flown
a lot of planes? You know there's,

1064
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:21,000
there's give and take. Okay, you got
to, girl hasn't fucked a lot of guys at,

1065
01:06:21,001 --> 01:06:21,834
you know.

1066
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:23,180
Okay.

1067
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,190
She sucks a dick. Like
she's eating green beans.

1068
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,270
That's the trade off yet.
Oh, a two. That sucks.

1069
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:35,830
That really sucks for you.

1070
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:38,230
Why were you going to wear one of
her socks to work though? You know,

1071
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:41,050
with a little fucking Chris
Everett ball hanging off the back.

1072
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,133
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1073
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:14,760
