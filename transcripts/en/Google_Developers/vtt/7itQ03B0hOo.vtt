00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.391
So to show you these widgets in action on
mobile devices, we took the expense report

00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:10.430
app that you saw, we customized it just a
little bit to adapt it to each of a couple

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:18.920
of different devices, and so here I've got
an iPad.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.130
So this is the same app.
Let me connect to the network here.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.539
This wireless network is my friend.
And it works the same way that you would expect

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.379
it to from the -- from what you saw previously.
And it does all -- you know, small adaptations

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.269
so that it feels more appropriate for the
device.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.079
So, you know, finger-dragging and things like
that.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.269
But I can still page just the same way.
Basically, the same app, I'm reusing almost

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:49.039
all the same code.
So that is on an iPad.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.620
And Ben has a version that is running on Android.
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: Indeed.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.441
And I've run this Android version.
We have the same sort of UI gestures that

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.949
you'd be expecting.
And we have a nice interface.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.850
It's very easy to use.
So we thought what we'd do is show you how

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.171
it works and you'll see some of the cool features
in the new widgets.

00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:09.060
So why don't I log in an expense report.
I've been here at Google I/O, actually for

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.890
a week now, but working really hard, really
late hours.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.220
So I'm going to have dinner and I think I'm
going to log on an expense report and have

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:37.920
a good dinner.
Wi-Fi.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.440
So we type in "dinner."
And I've had a good dinner.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:54.909
So let's finish typing it.
$150.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.960
Excellent.
So I must qualify.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.460
I'm not sure Wi-Fi is going to work for us
at the moment.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.500
So we should see this work.
But we disclaim.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.110
So I'm going to hit the "done" key on the
count of three.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.310
One, two, three.
And have a look over at Bruce's machine.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:20.120
We'll see if Wi-Fi is being good to us.
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: Double-check the done.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.360
Are you sure you nailed that?
We probably should enlarge those buttons the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:36.599
next time we do this.
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: Let's connect.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.659
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: It's worth waiting for.
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: It's worth waiting for.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.709
It's a great demo.
Back to Internet.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.730
So let's try this again.
Refresh.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.659
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: We can't plug Ethernet into these,

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.430
unfortunately.
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: If this doesn't come back

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:09.659
in a second, we will describe to you in extreme
detail, pixel by pixel what you would be seeing,

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.769
were the network not completely overloaded
right now.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.780
In fact, maybe we should just do that.
Let's do one last attempt.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.890
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: One last try.
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: We should use that HTML5

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.010
app cache feature.
The whole point, actually, is that you see

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.799
two different values much the app here, and
both of the apps are live.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.290
Let's -- okay, let's see if we can pull this
off.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.540
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: No.
Hang on.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.279
Okay.
Here we go.

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.059
So delete the last two minutes.
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: Okay.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.489
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: Okay.
So I've been working hard at Google I/O.

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.599
Rewind.
And I've been working hard and had a nice

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.390
dinner.
Let's try to add the dinner together and you

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.140
will be able to see these new widgets in action.
Let's press the plus key.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.040
And it was dinner.
And as I said earlier, we've been having a

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:15.959
good dinner.
The joys of working late.

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.070
And what we wanted to show you -- it does
require Internet, so -- I'm going to press

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.060
"done" on the count of three.
One, two, three.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.120
And have a look over at Bruce's screen.
[ Laughter ]

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.420
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: Yay!

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.800
Yay, yay, yay!
Okay.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.350
So you saw that pop in.
Now, I -- and I like that.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.550
I like that.
But what I do not like, as Ben's pretend manager

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.190
here, is $150 for dinner, because I had assumed
he was going to go fast food.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.660
This is not working for me at all.
So I'm going to deny this.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.150
And I am going to say that you, Ben, are nuts.
I don't know if you can read that.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.780
It says, "You are nuts."
I'm going to confirm.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.540
And one, two, three, we should see, network
willing, that Ben has been now updated in

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.570
real time, and --
[ Applause ]

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.810
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: So -- versus your normal
expense report cycle where your boss sits

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.130
on it for six weeks.
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: Dinner was rejected?

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.570
Good thing I'm still here.
So I am nuts.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.490
Let's amend it, then.
Let's go and edit.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.620
Let's backtrack.
And I'm not going to round the bill up this

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.850
time.
$148.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.320
And because I can't calculate tax here in
California, because I'm from Australia -- I

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.190
don't know what the total will be, but $148.13.
Done on the count of three, one, two, three.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:11.300
And --
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: Come on.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.790
You can do it.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.380
That's -- oh, $148.13.
Now, that is a different story.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.790
I mean, that's nothing.
That's chump change.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.510
Sure, no problem, Ben.
Ben, thank you.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.810
That was fantastic.
So, anyway, aside from the network glitches,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.510
 --
[ Applause ]

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:37.050
&gt;&gt;Bruce Johnson: -- let's talk about the whole
arc that you have just seen; right.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:43.700
We started with an empty directory, 200 keystrokes
later, you have an app, you have a powerful

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.780
set of tools that helps you iterate quickly.
You have a nice widget library, an app framework

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.150
to help you build apps that work very responsively,
even against huge data sets that are running

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.060
in the cloud.
You've got performance-tuning tools that are

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.400
great for diagnostics, both on your desktop
and in the cloud.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.060
And then you've got the knowledge that these
applications that you're building with the

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.170
tools that we're talking about here can be
easily adapted to all the different mobile

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.200
devices that your users are actually using.
We hope you'll try these out.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.030
We're really excited about all of these things
that are coming in GWT 2.1 and Spring Roo

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.020
and STS.
A lot of great stuff.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.530
Please do download it and let us know what
you think.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.740
Thank you.
&gt;&gt;Ben Alex: Thanks.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.020
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;David Glazer: Thanks, guys.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.330
And, again, if you want to hear more, want
to see these things in action, try them yourself,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.710
the sessions, attend the session, talk to
the engineers, download the code.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.070
You can build apps like that.
You can have your own demo fun with your own

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:42.190
applications that you've built on these open
tools, do your own innovation.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.340
The third thing we said we were going to show
you is flexible deployment.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.430
We've been showing you how to build these
great Web apps.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.520
But what do you do when you build them?
How do you make sure you're not locked into

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.139
one architecture when you build them?
The answer is, because you're building on

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:59.400
open standards, you're not locked in.
You've actually been seeing over the last

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.160
few demos, you have been seeing cloud portability
in action.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.240
The first few demos you saw built with one
tool stack, open standards, were running on

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.610
a development server right here on the development
box.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.100
You then saw some demos.
When Bruce started showing you Speed Tracer

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:21.280
using Insight, you saw those same demos, same
application, deployed to a virtual machine

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.510
running on a VMWare instance, using TC Server.
And then you saw some of the same demos running

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:33.029
on Google App Engine, same application.
Using Google App Engine, you saw Speed Tracer

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:36.710
tracing across that.
How do you as a developer make that decision?

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.900
What do you change in your app to do these
different deployments?

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.700
Well, Bruce showed you, if you want to deploy
your app to Google App Engine, you're in Eclipse,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.820
using the tool set, you click on the button.
You're deployed to Google App Engine.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.900
But because this app is built on the open
standards, the Java container API, Java persistence

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:59.050
API, if you want to deploy to any of the other
open standard-supporting environments, drag,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.050
drop, deploy your project to any server that
supports these standards behind your firewall,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.751
in the cloud.
It all just works, because open standards

00:09:07.751 --> 00:09:13.360
lead to innovation.
So we've shown you how to use familiar tools

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.670
to build apps quickly, how to have those apps
work everywhere you want, both every device

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.000
you want, and deploy them on every architecture
you want.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.779
That means you're now going to have a lot
of apps.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:27.260
And if you have a lot of apps, you need to
have tools to manage your applications in

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.270
the cloud.
I'd like to welcome Kevin Gibbs, the lead

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.170
of the Google AppEngine team to show you what's
happening in Google App Engine to help you

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:48.580
work with all the applications that you need.
&gt;&gt;Kevin Gibbs: Thanks, everybody.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:54.570
Now, today, you've seen some examples of Google's
approach to helping with enterprise software.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.300
Now, we don't believe in silver bullets or
single solutions.
