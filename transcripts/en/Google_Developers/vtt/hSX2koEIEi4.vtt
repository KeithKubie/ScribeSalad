ANDREW BROGDON: It used to
be that if you were an AdMob

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.349
Publisher, you
got AdMob Reports.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:10.890
And if you were a
Firebase Developer,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.010
you got Google
Analytics for Firebase.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.890
But recently, Firebase
and AdMob got together

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.260
and built a link between
their two systems.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.170
So AdMob Reporting now comes
with Firebase user metrics

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.320
like session length
baked right in.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.670
And Firebase looks like it
just found a big bag of money

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.370
because its financial
stats, like lifetime value

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.580
and revenue per user,
now include AdMob income.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.380
Plus there's a new
ad exposure metric,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.229
events for clicks and
impressions, and a bunch more.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.270
This kind of intelligence
is something you really

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.860
can't get anywhere
else, and it's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.690
easy to take advantage
of the combined

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.910
power of AdMob and Firebase.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.760
Just link your AdMob app
to a Firebase project,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.620
get the config file,
and make sure you

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.560
are using the right CocoaPods
or Gradle artifacts.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.280
That's it.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.830
Just rebuild and deploy
and watch the data roll

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.290
into Analytics and AdMob.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.320
So give it a try.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.670
