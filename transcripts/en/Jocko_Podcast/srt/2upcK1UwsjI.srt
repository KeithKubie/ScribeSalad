1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,510
Life. We truly appreciate your
father's work here in Texas.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,240
Would you ever consider
a career in politics?

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,190
Okay,

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,560
well, I appreciate that. Uh, there's a,

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,510
just a Sarah by understands that my
dad is, uh, a US congressman now. Uh,

6
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:20,840
he's a freshman, you as
congressman from a Texas district,

7
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:24,800
36 and southeast Texas. And
uh, I'm very proud of him.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,810
He retired after a career as a, as
a small town dentist, uh, you know,

9
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:33,680
business, a selling point, business
for army and the air force, army,

10
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:35,350
army and air force veteran. And uh,

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,860
he was fed up with Washington and
didn't like the options that he saw. Uh,

12
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,990
you know, that he knew were going to
be running for that seat. And he said,

13
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,790
you know what, I'm throwing my hat in
the ring. I'm going to go up there.

14
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:44,990
I'm trying to make a difference. And I,

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,050
we need more people like
that in Washington. Dad Is,

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,140
my dad is there to make a
difference and only to make it deal.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,670
He doesn't care about a career.

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,270
He didn't care about being there for
decades and decades and decades. You know,

19
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,790
he's a, he's retired and
he'd rather be fishing,

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,210
hanging out with his grandkids and,
and hunting. But, uh, he would,

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,350
but he's up there.

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,090
He cares about the country and he is
sacrificing to be there and to lead.

23
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,750
And I'm, I'm damn proud of
the job that he's doing. Uh,

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,110
and stepping up what I consider
a career in politics. Uh,

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,820
I can't imagine anything to be more
miserable than that. Uh, you know what,

26
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:24,740
on the other hand, when I look at our
nation, just as my dad know, has, uh,

27
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,510
uh, as has felt, you know, called to
do that, to step up, to lead, you know,

28
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,640
if we don't do it, who's going to do it?

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,670
So somebody has got to step up
if somebody has got to lead.

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,220
And I think when you look at the direction
of our country right now in the, the,

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,630
the political climate and, and
all that's going on, you know,

32
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,700
in this electoral cycle, um,

33
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,490
what I do that maybe I just might
be able to be talked into it. Uh,

34
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,970
we shall see what about UJ go get some,

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,470
I mean we got, we got the
bumper stickers Jocko 2016,

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,140
uh, you know, see that go Charles.

37
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:04,610
I think I would be running as if
I was to run for political office.

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,700
I would run as a dictator
and it's supreme ruler of,

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,690
of America. And that's why I
thought I would do, we, we can,

40
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,440
we can bring back some of the Roman
rule, try and triumvirate. So me,

41
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,680
you and echo who could
just take, take over a,

42
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:23,450
I don't know if I have
the stomach for politics.

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,540
I really don't like the political arena
too much and not sure it's something I

44
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,330
would ever, ever have the
desire to do. You know,

45
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:38,150
I guess that's my, that's where I sit.

46
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,760
Maybe when I was 70 years old.

47
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,983
Um,

48
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,830
yeah, people, people have asked
me to, you know, like, Hey,

49
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:47,980
if you were president, what
would you do? You know,

50
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,760
about the situation
with the Ron, you know,

51
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,940
and their development of nuclear
weapons or China getting, you know,

52
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,130
making big moves in the south China Sea
or Russia pushing the envelope. And, uh,

53
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:00,640
and, and kind of throwing
their noses at us.

54
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,860
And often I've told them
that if I were president,

55
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,000
I would immediately nominate Jocko
Willink, his secretary of defense.

56
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,930
We would change secretary of defense to
the previous title of secretary of war.

57
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,880
And, uh, and I think those problems
would, would disappear immediately. Um,

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,120
I think if I was president,
it'd be very smooth.

59
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,330
My policy would be pretty
simple. My policy would be

60
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,090
kick ass. That's what we would
do. Economics. We can do,

61
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,450
what's your economic plan? Jocko?
Kick ass. Well, what's your,

62
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,380
what would you do with this situation
over here in the Middle East? Oh, there.

63
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,690
Oh yeah. Well we're gonna do
theirs. We're gonna kick ass.

64
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,190
What about the drug problem that we've
got coming in through the borders? Oh,

65
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:45,490
the, the drug cartel. Yeah. We're
going to kick ass on that. So that,

66
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,700
that's my policy. So this is why I
probably wouldn't be the best politician

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,750
that Kinda like BTF the same thing. Yeah.
