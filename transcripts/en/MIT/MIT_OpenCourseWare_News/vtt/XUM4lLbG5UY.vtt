00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.427
OpenCourseWare is based on a

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.804
simple but revolutionary idea.

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:17.100
That MIT can advance it's 
mission by sharing nearly

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:21.438
all of it's course content 
online, for free.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.733
Early 2000 was still the heyday

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.484
of the dotcom era.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.363
MIT was trying to figure out 
what MIT should do

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.449
in this e-learning space.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.409
It was before YouTube.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.869
It was before Facebook.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.998
It was before the web had 
completely taken hold.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.837
What we're going to do is

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:49.716
we're going take all of the 
materials we use in our
classrooms

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.384
And we're going to put them 
on the web.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.137
When OCW was first launched,

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:58.058
the focus was on opening 
to the world what we teach.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.518
For an education institution 
like MIT,

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.437
we have 11,000 students.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.026
To reach 200 million people 
is really an amazing feat.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:11.279
Every year, I have 60 to 
70 bright new faces

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:14.407
Through OCW, that number
is not 60 or 70

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.786
but its thousands or even 
millions

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:20.205
OCW was the pioneer here

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.000
of being really a 
sharing kind of culture

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.462
Because we wanted to show 
students outside of MIT

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:30.465
what kind of place this is and 
what kind of students come here

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.425
Educating engineers so they can 
build more bridges

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.095
Educating musicians so we can 
make better musicians.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.181
Educating philosophers who can
think about the world around us

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:43.686
What does it mean to learn something 
at the most fundamental level?

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:48.233
It makes everybody better. It creates
a community of self-learners.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.610
It gives access to materials.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.903
The promise of OpenCourseWare

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.571
really comes down to who 
you are

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.281
And what you're trying to 
achieve.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.450
You don't have to register 
for anything;

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.703
You just go there and you 
can pull out the materials.

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:04.124
No one is watching you really.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.085
You can explore whatever you 
want to learn

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.170
whenever you want to.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.048
OCW laid the foundation

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:15.093
and it remains integral 
to the MIT mission

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.846
To advance knowledge and 
educate students

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.391
in service to the nation
and the world.
