00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.120
- [Narrator] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.290
is describe how our
perceptions of public opinion

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.970
may, or may not, affect policy decisions.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.730
So what I have here is an
excerpt from an article

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.800
on Politico that was published
at the end of February.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.630
Shortly after the shootings in Florida.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.670
And it says, support for
stricter gun laws has spiked

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.380
in polls conducted after
the fatal South Florida

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.910
school shooting, hitting its highest level

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.100
in at least a quarter-century.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.590
Roughly two in three Americans
now say gun control laws

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.010
should be made more strict
in the wake of the murder

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.000
of 17 people at Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.330
According to a number of polls,
including a new Politico,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.970
Morning Consult, poll that shows support

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.300
for stricter gun laws among
registered voters at 68%,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.300
compared with just 25% who
oppose stricter gun laws.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.300
So if there was just a direct connection

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.900
between what we're seeing
in the polls and policy,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.670
well then you might
expect stricter gun laws.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.770
And you can imagine, there
are many policy makers

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.960
who are already in support
of the stricter gun laws,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.930
who would use this data
to further their argument

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.950
why State Congress should
pass more legislation

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.910
to make stricter gun laws.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.940
But an interesting question
is why this still might be

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.120
an uphill battle in terms
of making stricter gun laws.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.850
Well, you could imagine there
are other policy makers,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.870
members of Congress, who
one, they may or may not

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.740
trust the poll data here.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.620
Maybe they don't view it as a
truly representative sample.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.207
Others might say, "Hey,
this is a temporary trend

00:01:35.207 --> 00:01:37.677
"that's driven by the graphic nature

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:40.720
"of the news surrounding these polls."

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.767
Others might say,

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.857
"Hey look, this might
be the national numbers,

00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:45.440
"I believe this poll."

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.650
And it might not even
be a temporary trend,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.007
but they say, "This is
representative of the entire country.

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.290
"The polling numbers in my
district might be different."

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.020
Now another reason why a policy maker,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.440
despite this type of national poll,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.630
may not want to vote in
favor of stricter gun laws,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.290
is that their political
calculus might not favor it.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.440
For example, even if they're constituents

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.170
support stricter gun laws,
most of their constituents

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.080
might not be so activated about that.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.300
They might care more about
things like the economy.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.670
And they might have a smaller subset,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.610
say the 25% who oppose stricter gun laws,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.650
who are willing to vote on that issue.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.580
And it might do more harm
to your political chances

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.820
to upset that group on this issue,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.550
then to try to appeal to
the majority on the issue.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.970
And the last reason why a policy
maker may not be in support

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.230
of it, even though public
opinion seems to be,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.640
is that they view the
issue as being more subtle

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.100
and more nuance then maybe they think

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.330
that the broader public might appreciate.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.640
That yes, when you see
something horrific like this

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.070
you want to regulate it
more, you want to pass laws,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.980
but there could be
policy makers who believe

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.750
that those laws won't be affective,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.350
or they might not have
the intended consequences.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.930
But it's an interesting question,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.710
when public opinion
affects policy decisions,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.743
and when it doesn't.
