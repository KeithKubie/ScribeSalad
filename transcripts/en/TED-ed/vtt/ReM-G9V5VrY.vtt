00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:16.925
Ever see a medieval painting of baby Jesus

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:18.469
sitting or standing on his mother's lap

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.595
and wonder why she's so large?

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:22.990
Paintings like Cimabue's enthroned Madonna with angels

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.321
or Duccio's Maesta

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.184
also appear out of proportion.

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:27.987
If Mary were to stand up, it seems,

00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:30.577
the angels in the picture would be as tall as her shin bone,

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:32.521
and her torso would be disproportionately small

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.237
when compared to her legs.

00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:36.119
Maybe you thought the artist simply wasn't skilled enough

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.363
to paint realistically

00:00:37.363 --> 00:00:39.338
or lacked the mathematical skill of perspective.

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:40.824
But that's not the full story.

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.695
To understand why, we need to go back

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.174
to the late fifth century

00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:46.543
when the city of Rome was attacked by the Goths.

00:00:46.543 --> 00:00:48.936
Rome was built in marble and meant to last forever.

00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:50.417
It represented, for many years,

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.168
the pinnacle of human civilization,

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:54.919
so its destruction left a huge void.

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.820
Theologians, who preached about a world beyond the physical,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.019
began attracting an audience as Rome crumbled,

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.660
and Christianity started to fill the void left by the Empire.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.108
As a replacement for the physical beauty of Rome,

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.852
Christianity offered a metaphysical beauty of virtue

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:11.156
and an eternal heaven

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:13.483
that could not be destroyed as Rome had.

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:14.857
After the fall of Rome,

00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:17.867
early medieval theologians turned away from physical beauty,

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:20.113
rejecting it in favor of inner-beauty.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.738
They maintained that while the physical world was temporary,

00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:25.086
virtue and religion were permanent.

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:27.829
Beautiful objects could lead to a misguided worship of the object

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.104
rather than the worship of goodness.

00:01:30.104 --> 00:01:32.371
It is said that the early sixth century preacher, St. Benedict,

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:33.991
upon thinking of a beautiful woman,

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:35.927
threw himself into a thorn patch,

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:37.074
and through his suffering,

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:39.477
regained his focus on spiritual beauty.

00:01:39.477 --> 00:01:40.953
He feared his desire for the beautiful woman

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:43.898
would distract him from his desire to love God.

00:01:43.898 --> 00:01:47.064
As European civilization transitioned away from empires

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:48.337
and towards religion,

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:50.997
monasteries became the gatekeepers of knowledge,

00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:52.384
which meant that classical books

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:53.676
that praised physical pleasures

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:55.760
were not copied or protected.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.691
Without protection, they became the victims of natural decay,

00:01:58.691 --> 00:01:59.872
fire,

00:01:59.872 --> 00:02:00.653
flooding,

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.739
or pests.

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.034
And without the help of monks transcribing new copies,

00:02:04.034 --> 00:02:06.514
these texts and the philosophies they carried

00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:08.288
disappeared in Western Europe

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:11.279
and were replaced by the works of people like St. Benedict,

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.363
which brings us back to these depictions of Jesus and Mary.

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:17.622
Because Christianity had so fervently rejected physical beauty,

00:02:17.622 --> 00:02:19.746
these medieval artists purposefully avoided

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:21.747
aesthetically pleasing forms.

00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:24.299
At first, decorations for churches or palaces

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.647
were limited to interesting geometric patterns,

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:27.660
which could be pleasing

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.007
without inspiring sinful thoughts of physical pleasure.

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:32.516
As the medieval period progressed,

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:34.426
depictions of Jesus and Mary were tolerated,

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:37.013
but the artist clearly made an effort to veil Mary

00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:39.437
and give her disproportionately large legs,

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:41.767
with those enormous shin bones.

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.111
The fear remained that a beautiful illustration of Mary

00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:45.898
might inspire the viewer to love the painting

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:47.606
or the physical form of Mary,

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:50.444
rather than the virtue she's meant to represent.

00:02:50.444 --> 00:02:52.069
So even though it may be fun to think we can paint

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.625
more realistically than Cimabuey or Duccio,

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.497
we need to remember that they had different goals

00:02:56.497 --> 00:02:58.481
when picking up a paintbrush.
