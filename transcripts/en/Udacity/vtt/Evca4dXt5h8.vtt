00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.504
All right, here is how I did it. I go through the first step, miles driven is

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:11.413
50,000. The first miles per gallon is 10. So, that's 5000. The price per gallon

00:00:11.413 --> 00:00:18.984
is 4. 5000 times 4 is 20,000. Now moving on to the next step, the purchase

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:24.797
price for the first car is 15,000 plus the 20,000. From over here, gets my

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:31.473
total cost of 35000 over the life time of the car. With the second car, again

00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:38.544
we drive a 50000 miles. Now the miles per gallon is 50. 50000 over 50 is a 1000

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:47.476
times 4 because we have $4 per gallon, is 4,000 for the gas cost. The purchase

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:54.154
price was 30,000, plus the gas cost 4,000 gets me to 34,000. Now let's go on

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:58.640
with the algorithm, is total cost one less than total cost two? No it's not,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.715
35,000 is bigger than 34,000. So the algorithm tells us to buy car two. Well,

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:08.345
what a relief. I never wanted to buy that one in the first place. But now I

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:14.125
have a procedure that is unambiguous, executable, and terminating that tells me

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:20.314
what car to buy. So, this is a great example of an algorithm It is a recipe of

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:24.767
steps each of which is so simple that a computer or a human can execute them

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:31.338
and it reaches an answer. Now, you will notice that this algorithm here was

00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:34.992
written up in some mixture of plain English and Math not in Java code or not in

00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:40.848
any other computer language. This is called Pseudocode, and Pseudocode is

00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:46.050
really important. When you want to develop an algorithm before you get to coded

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.743
up in Java or another programming language. What most programmers do when they

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:55.106
need to solve a complex problem is they first get out a sheet of paper and

00:01:55.106 --> 00:02:00.605
describe the problem in Pseudocode and then they write in Java. Pseudocode

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:04.385
doesn't have anyway near as many rules as Java does, but so it's a good idea to

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:09.912
restrict oneself to simple constructs in Psuedocode. Let me show you what those

00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:10.860
would be.
