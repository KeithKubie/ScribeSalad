out the Congress is debating this right
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.890
out the Congress is debating this right
now and the tough thing about it is to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
now and the tough thing about it is to
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.750
now and the tough thing about it is to
figure out how do you pay for it and who

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
figure out how do you pay for it and who
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.300
figure out how do you pay for it and who
pays for it I'm hoping that this time

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310
pays for it I'm hoping that this time
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.580

to work collectively together to do it I
 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.340
to work collectively together to do it I
am I would give it a seventy five eighty

that the main protagonists that really
scuttled health care reform last time

that would require all Americans to have

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
that would require all Americans to have
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.909
that would require all Americans to have
health insurance that's revolutionary

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919
health insurance that's revolutionary
 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.490
health insurance that's revolutionary
that is a major sea change in terms of

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500
that is a major sea change in terms of
 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.490
that is a major sea change in terms of
where we were compared to 15 years ago

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500
where we were compared to 15 years ago
 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.630
where we were compared to 15 years ago
the second part of it is that I think

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640
the second part of it is that I think
 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.830
the second part of it is that I think
everybody understands in the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840
everybody understands in the
 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.810
everybody understands in the
Congress what a key priority this issue

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820
Congress what a key priority this issue
 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.850
Congress what a key priority this issue
is to Senator Kennedy and we all know

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860
is to Senator Kennedy and we all know
 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.430
is to Senator Kennedy and we all know
that Senator Kennedy is suffering from a

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440
that Senator Kennedy is suffering from a
 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.990
that Senator Kennedy is suffering from a
very bad form of cancer but this is a

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000
very bad form of cancer but this is a
 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.180
very bad form of cancer but this is a
man that is active in the debate it

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190
man that is active in the debate it
 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.820
man that is active in the debate it
would be his lifetime work to get health

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830
would be his lifetime work to get health
 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.350
would be his lifetime work to get health
care coverage for all Americans he's

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360
care coverage for all Americans he's
 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.409
care coverage for all Americans he's
made it his main goal in the United

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419
made it his main goal in the United
 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.870
made it his main goal in the United
States Congress for several decades now

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880
States Congress for several decades now
 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.240
States Congress for several decades now
and he has devoted to getting this

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250
and he has devoted to getting this
 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.100
and he has devoted to getting this
passed so I think those two issues

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110
passed so I think those two issues
 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.189
passed so I think those two issues
combined with the the focus that the

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199
combined with the the focus that the
 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.620
combined with the the focus that the
President Obama has on the issue he said

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630
President Obama has on the issue he said
 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.159
President Obama has on the issue he said
that this is his major domestic priority

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169
that this is his major domestic priority
 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.020
that this is his major domestic priority
so I think there's going to find a way

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030
so I think there's going to find a way
 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.600
so I think there's going to find a way
to get this done it may be messy it may

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610
to get this done it may be messy it may
 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.100
to get this done it may be messy it may
not be what everybody wants to have

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
not be what everybody wants to have
 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.620
not be what everybody wants to have
completed in one swoop but I think we'll

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630
completed in one swoop but I think we'll
 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.000
completed in one swoop but I think we'll
pass something very substantial

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010
pass something very substantial
 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.240
pass something very substantial
hopefully by the end of this year i

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250
 
 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.710
 
think the european models have the most

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720
think the european models have the most
 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.150
think the european models have the most
relevance because they have a great

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160
relevance because they have a great
 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.580
relevance because they have a great
focus on primary care we don't have a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
focus on primary care we don't have a
 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.439
focus on primary care we don't have a
focus on primary care in this country we

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449
focus on primary care in this country we
 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.240
focus on primary care in this country we
have a focus on tertiary very

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250
have a focus on tertiary very
 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.790
have a focus on tertiary very
sophisticated care the way the european

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800
sophisticated care the way the european
 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.469
sophisticated care the way the european
countries built their healthcare systems

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479
countries built their healthcare systems
 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.790
countries built their healthcare systems
as they started from the bottom up

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800
as they started from the bottom up
 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.430
as they started from the bottom up
primary care and then moving towards the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440
primary care and then moving towards the
 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.200
primary care and then moving towards the
top until they ran out of money so

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210
top until they ran out of money so
 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.700
top until they ran out of money so
they've got a tremendous primary care

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710
they've got a tremendous primary care
 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.890
they've got a tremendous primary care
infrastructure they have all the

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900
infrastructure they have all the
 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.810
infrastructure they have all the
technological tools we have is just that

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820
technological tools we have is just that
 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.190
technological tools we have is just that
they don't have them in every hospital

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200
they don't have them in every hospital
 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.560
they don't have them in every hospital
in those countries we did it just the

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570
in those countries we did it just the
 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.089
in those countries we did it just the
opposite and we started from the top

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099
opposite and we started from the top
 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.700
opposite and we started from the top
down I have a very technologically

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710
down I have a very technologically
 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.440
down I have a very technologically
sophisticated healthcare system but no

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450
sophisticated healthcare system but no
 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.050
sophisticated healthcare system but no
primary care infrastructure and the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060
primary care infrastructure and the
 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.400
primary care infrastructure and the
problem that that faces is that our

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410
problem that that faces is that our
 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.779
problem that that faces is that our
health care measures infant mortality

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789
health care measures infant mortality
 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.770
health care measures infant mortality
rates longevity just basic public health

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780
rates longevity just basic public health
 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.290
rates longevity just basic public health
measures are nowhere near as good as the

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300
measures are nowhere near as good as the
 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.240
measures are nowhere near as good as the
European countries despite the fact that

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250
European countries despite the fact that
 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.190
European countries despite the fact that
we spend twice as much per person on

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200
we spend twice as much per person on
 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.080
we spend twice as much per person on
health care in this country than the

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090
health care in this country than the
 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.180
health care in this country than the
Europeans do so I think there's a lot to

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190
Europeans do so I think there's a lot to
 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.920
Europeans do so I think there's a lot to
learn about how do you build a primary

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930
learn about how do you build a primary
 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.810
learn about how do you build a primary
care infrastructure that really focuses

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820
care infrastructure that really focuses
 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.060
care infrastructure that really focuses
on primary prevention preventing disease

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070
on primary prevention preventing disease
 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.450
on primary prevention preventing disease
and really keeping people healthy well

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460
and really keeping people healthy well
 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.680
and really keeping people healthy well
the first place to start i think is a

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690
the first place to start i think is a
 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.620
the first place to start i think is a
medicare program that that is a program

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630
medicare program that that is a program
 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.140
medicare program that that is a program
that spends about four hundred billion

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150
that spends about four hundred billion
 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.959
that spends about four hundred billion
dollars a year and it is really not

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969
dollars a year and it is really not
 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.570
dollars a year and it is really not
designed to effectively keep people

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580
designed to effectively keep people
 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.700
designed to effectively keep people
healthy and so one of the low-hanging

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710
healthy and so one of the low-hanging
 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.210
healthy and so one of the low-hanging
for

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220
for
 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.070
for
oops is how do you build prevention into

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080
oops is how do you build prevention into
 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.660
oops is how do you build prevention into
that program how do we do a better job

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670
that program how do we do a better job
 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.150
that program how do we do a better job
of working with patients who are seniors

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160
of working with patients who are seniors
 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.970
of working with patients who are seniors
to keep them out of the hospital and out

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980
to keep them out of the hospital and out
 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.950
to keep them out of the hospital and out
of the physician's office and a lot of

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960
of the physician's office and a lot of
 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.840
of the physician's office and a lot of
that is just common sense work with

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850
that is just common sense work with
 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.190
that is just common sense work with
nurse practitioners working with

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200
nurse practitioners working with
 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.040
nurse practitioners working with
patients at home social workers helping

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050
patients at home social workers helping
 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.690
patients at home social workers helping
patients out with other types of

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700
patients out with other types of
 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.850
patients out with other types of
healthcare needs now this isn't a thing

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860
healthcare needs now this isn't a thing
 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.830
healthcare needs now this isn't a thing
that we could do very quickly we could

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840
that we could do very quickly we could
 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.750
that we could do very quickly we could
do a very inexpensively and there's

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760
do a very inexpensively and there's
 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.150
do a very inexpensively and there's
bipartisan support to do it so my sense

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160
bipartisan support to do it so my sense
 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.890
bipartisan support to do it so my sense
is on health care reform is that we need

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900
is on health care reform is that we need
 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.600
is on health care reform is that we need
to start places where there's mutual

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610
to start places where there's mutual
 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.730
to start places where there's mutual
agreement we can build bipartisan

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740
agreement we can build bipartisan
 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.090
