00:00:00.654 --> 00:00:03.316
- [Voiceover] So I have
this yellow rectangle here,

00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:07.060
and I have begun to fill
it with green squares.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.678
And my question to you, and to me,

00:00:09.678 --> 00:00:11.913
is how many total green squares

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:14.147
can I fit into this yellow rectangle

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.956
if we don't make any of the green squares

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:18.119
sit on top of each other?

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.524
Well, let's see.

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:20.283
We already have,

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:23.835
One, two, three, four

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:25.200
green squares.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.498
And let's add a few more.

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:28.484
So I could put one right over here.

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:30.801
So, that's one right over there.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.361
And then I could put
another one right over here.

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.474
Put another one right over there.

00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:40.474
And so I'm gonna have, one,
two, three, four, five, six

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:44.248
green squares can be
fit into this rectangle.

00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:46.666
Now let's look at this big yellow square.

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.271
And we have the same thing going on.

00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.379
We've already started to
fill it with some squares,

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.903
and my question to you is,

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:56.052
how many total squares
could we fill this with?

00:00:56.052 --> 00:00:57.698
So let's start doing that.

00:00:57.698 --> 00:00:59.242
So in this space right over here,

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:03.808
let's put more of these
squares of the same size.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.292
These squares of the same size.

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:08.953
I'm gonna draw 'em first
and then we can count them.

00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:13.017
So there you go, and then
one more right over here.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.801
And so you could fit, now
we're ready to count them.

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.824
One, two three, four, five,

00:01:19.824 --> 00:01:24.824
six, seven, eight, nine
of these smaller squares

00:01:25.188 --> 00:01:29.002
inside of this bigger yellow square.
