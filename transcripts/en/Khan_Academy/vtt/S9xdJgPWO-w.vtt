00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.080
SAL KHAN: I'm here
with Dr. Laurence Baker

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.600
from Stanford
Medical School, who

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.640
specializes in
health care policy.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.220
And I have just a
very basic question.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.240
We see these Blue Cross and
Blue Shield all of the time.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.740
And sometimes they're
used together,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.750
sometimes they're
used differently.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.210
And it just seems
confusing to me.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.332
What are these things, and how
are they related to each other?

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:20.915
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
So they're related

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:22.248
in some really interesting ways.

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:24.480
They go way back in time.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.564
So Blue Cross and Blue Shield
began as separate things.

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:28.980
Let's see if I can
get this right.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.550
Blue Shield was
started by doctors

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.100
who wanted to set
up a health care

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.180
plan to help their
patients get coverage.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.480
SAL KHAN: Kind of a
preventative shield

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.050
to help things from
getting to you.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.550
Right.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.650
Right.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.750
Right.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.110
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.970
So that was started
a long time ago.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.200
These both go back, Blue Cross
and Blue Shield, to the 1930s,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.880
really, they're getting started.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.306
Blue Cross was started
by the hospitals,

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:53.930
separately from Blue
Shield originally,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.530
and they got together
later as a way

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.530
to help patients get
coverage for hospital care.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.654
SAL KHAN: And I guess the
cross because once you're

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:02.190
in the hospital, you might
get a little religious.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.860
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Exactly.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.970
I mean, I'm not sure that's what
they had in mind originally,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.690
but--

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.650
SAL KHAN: And what
about the blue?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.590
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: I don't
know where the blue comes from.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.320
SAL KHAN: Is that just a color
that makes people feel good,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.740
it's like a health care color?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.760
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: I think it
must be a health care color.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.230
SAL KHAN: Red would
be inappropriate.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.854
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
Let's go with blue.

00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:17.210
You're not bleeding with blue.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.876
SAL KHAN: Blue is--
you look at the sky.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:19.690
OK.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.650
And so what happened?

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.790
So, I do see these
words used together.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.110
So these were separate plans.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660
Doctors created
the Blue Shields.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.040
Hospitals created
the Blue Cross.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: And
then they grew over time

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.810
and changed.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.290
So they got started in the '30s.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.340
They were around through the
'40s and the '50s, '60s, '70s,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.610
and so a couple things
happen along the way that

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.260
starts to make things
confusing a little bit.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.300
One is that they're operating
in every state, to some extent,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.040
independently.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.932
So, states regulate health
insurance in this country,

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:51.390
or have a lot to
do with regulating

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.765
health insurance
in this country.

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:54.640
And so, every state
had its own laws.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.270
And as a result, the Blue
Cross and the Blue Shield plans

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.870
in different states grew
up in different ways.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.980
So what you come down
to today is really

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.290
different plans in
every state because

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.730
of this history of development.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.460
As states develop
their laws differently,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.550
the plans would evolve
in the different states.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.000
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.583
So this is just to give myself
a kind of a framework of what's

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:16.050
happening, is that pre-1920s,
early 1930s, there really

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.240
weren't health care plans.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.270
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
Not to speak of.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.870
SAL KHAN: The physicians said,
hey, we want a way for people

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.060
to see us without having
to-- some way for them

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.260
to be paying a little bit
every month or every year,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.801
and that if something
were to happen,

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:29.150
they could see the doctors.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.061
The hospitals kind of
had the same model.

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:32.810
But they did it
differently in every state

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.190
because the state
is the regulatory--

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.820
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: The state
especially-- well, in the '30s,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.040
there weren't a lot
of state regulations

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.750
about health insurance.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.700
There wasn't health insurance.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.150
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.230
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
But as states evolved,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.563
as the health care system
evolved, as the plans evolved,

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.770
it grew separately in
slightly different directions

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.430
in every state.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.420
So that led to the
formation really of,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.210
you see Blue Cross of Tennessee,
or Blue Shield of Florida,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.089
or Blue Cross Blue
Shield of Michigan.

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:56.630
They're all different, because
they're all in their own state

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.671
environment and they've
all grown up differently.

00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:01.060
SAL KHAN: So, normally--
these kind of are brands.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.800
We've all heard of
them in that way.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.450
But normally, a brand
means something.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.350
It means more quality,
or less quality,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.080
or some type of
spin on-- you know,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.630
Apple means fun
consumer experience

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.690
or something like that.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.850
But in this case, if I'm
hearing you correctly,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.620
if there's Blue
Cross of California

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.740
and Blue Cross of
Texas, they have nothing

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.364
to do with each other, or very
little to do with each other?

00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:26.530
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: So they
all had their start kind

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.238
of together in the
'30s, and then they've

00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:29.560
all grown in their own ways.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.500
But they've stayed
related, and some of them

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.980
to greater extents than others.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.690
And so one of the things that
happened along the way was they

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.614
formed an association.

00:03:37.614 --> 00:03:40.030
There's now something in the
US called the Blue Cross Blue

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.570
Shield Association,
which is a I guess

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.470
an association of a lot of
the plans in different states

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.240
that allows them to talk to each
other, to try to work together.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.615
SAL KHAN: And this
is an umbrella

00:03:51.615 --> 00:03:54.000
for all of the Blue Cross
and all of the Blue Shields.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.740
So that's why we hear them
used so frequently together.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.550
People say Blue
Cross Blue Shield.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.340
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.390
So there's two reasons
you hear that together.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.260
One is the
association that tries

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.294
to work with plans
from both groups.

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:05.710
The other is that,
in some states,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.870
over time, the two got
together and actually became

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.074
one health insurance plan.

00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:10.990
So there are states where
the health insurance

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.290
plan is Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of a state.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.540
And there are other states
where they stayed separate.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.190
So, we're here in California,
where Blue Shield and Blue

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.389
Cross have historically
stayed as separate plans.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.680
But there are some states
where they're the same thing.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.638
And then you'd hear Blue
Cross and Blue Shield.

00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:29.180
SAL KHAN: So if someone tells
you Blue Cross of state x,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.560
that just means to you
health insurance plan.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.602
There's nothing else that you
can really take from that.

00:04:34.602 --> 00:04:36.310
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
So, once upon a time,

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.143
you may have been able
to take more from it.

00:04:38.143 --> 00:04:40.477
But these days, it's
possible for them

00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:42.060
to vary in quite a
few different ways.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.930
Some of the Blue Cross
and Blue Shield plans,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.260
especially the Blue Cross plans,
have become for-profit plans.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.560
So, historically these
were always nonprofit.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.290
But in the last--

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.470
SAL KHAN: So Blue Cross
especially, some of them

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.760
have gone for-profit.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.760
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.760
I think, in both
cases, but Blue Cross

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.774
is the one that I pay
more attention to.

00:04:59.774 --> 00:05:01.034
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.450
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
So they may be

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.060
for-profit or
not-for-profit plans.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.710
They may act in similar ways.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.630
And they do, because at least
the ones in the association,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.091
tend to act with some
similarity from place to place.

00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:14.590
SAL KHAN: And just
to-- because I've

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.810
explained this all
the time about even--

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.185
Khan Academy is
a not-for-profit.

00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:19.560
A not-for-profit is an
entity, it can, in theory,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.030
charge revenue-- Khan Academy
doesn't-- but it could charge

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.280
revenue.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.946
But there's no owner
of the organization

00:05:23.946 --> 00:05:25.790
who can become rich off of it.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.460
It's owned by the public.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.030
While a for-profit
has shareholders,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.090
and it can be bought
and sold, and it

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.674
can issue dividends,
and all the rest.

00:05:33.674 --> 00:05:34.715
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:36.720
So, historically in
America, most health plans

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.480
were not-for-profit entities.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.520
They couldn't take
money that they earned

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.750
and give it out to people
who might be the owners.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.080
They'd have to be reinvested.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.330
SAL KHAN: Exactly.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.260
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: In fact,
even in the early days of Blue

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.801
Cross and Blue Shield
in some states,

00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:51.860
they were treated as
quasi-public entities.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.070
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.170
Right.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.620
Right.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.340
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
And they've kind of

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.673
grown away from that a bit more.

00:05:54.673 --> 00:05:56.655
But there's this
history, especially

00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:59.010
with Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, of very not-for-profit,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.650
public-spirited entities.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.140
When you get to for-profit
plans, which we really

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.260
didn't have in the
US in a big way

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.600
until maybe the
last decade or two,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.050
where we've seen
some conversions.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.760
These are situations where
the plan can act explicitly

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.536
as a profit generator for its
shareholders, for its owners.

00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:17.286
SAL KHAN: And some are
now publicly traded

00:06:17.286 --> 00:06:18.460
and they're on the
stock exchange.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.800
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: They may
be publicly traded, yeah.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.840
SAL KHAN: And so when
we talk about some

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.510
of them becoming
for-profit here,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.350
it's that literally--
I don't know,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.822
the license to use the name
either Blue Cross or Blue

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:30.280
Shield, or maybe
some of the assets

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.100
of the former not-for-profit
are somehow transferred,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.979
or I guess a
for-profit buys them.

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.270
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: So we
had a series of these things.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.311
We call them conversions.

00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:41.700
And when the company converted
from being a not-for-profit

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.329
to a for-profit,
there were a lot

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:44.870
of states in which
those conversions,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.780
or situations in which
they happened, where

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.880
the public, the
government, somebody

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.810
compelled the for-profit
entity in the conversion

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.234
to create a public good.

00:06:59.234 --> 00:07:01.150
So there are some
foundations that now exist--

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.984
SAL KHAN: Oh, I see.

00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:03.566
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
In the conversion,

00:07:03.566 --> 00:07:06.170
they allowed a transfer of a
not-for-profit to a for-profit,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.670
but you had to create something
valuable for the public.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.400
So some of the things
that we see now

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.983
in states, some of
the big foundations

00:07:11.983 --> 00:07:14.200
that exist in health care,
are conversion foundations

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.711
around the for-profit
conversions

00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:16.960
of Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.750
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.446
But when we see things like--
I think it's, I always get

00:07:20.446 --> 00:07:22.320
confused between Blue
Cross and Blue Shield--

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.910
but I believe Anthem has a
kind of a-- Let me see here,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.545
Anthem was a Blue--

00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:28.490
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: Blue
Cross in California.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:35.060
So, Anthem is a company
that is a large company that

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.590
has Blue Cross, I think mostly
Blue Cross or all Blue Cross

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.902
affiliates or entities
in different states.

00:07:41.902 --> 00:07:43.360
I think there are
14 or 15 of them.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.700
SAL KHAN: So these are
for-profit Blue Crosses

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.020
if they have Anthem with them.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.490
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: I
believe that's correct.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.150
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.510
Right.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.010
Right.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.156
And is there any, I guess
in how they operate,

00:07:53.156 --> 00:07:55.030
from a consumer point
of view, any difference

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.988
between a for-profit Blue
Cross or Blue Shield,

00:07:56.988 --> 00:07:59.200
or is there anything
that we can tell?

00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.610
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
So, that's actually

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.780
a really interesting question.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.321
There are people
who've gone to look,

00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:03.860
and they've tried
to sometimes find

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.700
some evidence for differences.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.096
There are a few
studies out there

00:08:07.096 --> 00:08:08.720
where people can find
some differences.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.330
But there's not
a lot of evidence

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.959
that they behave
really differently.

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.750
At the end of the day,
they have to compete

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.190
in the same marketplace for the
business of the same companies

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.160
and the same people.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.260
And if they behaved really
obviously different,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.757
if one was obviously way
better than the other,

00:08:21.757 --> 00:08:23.840
the market would sort out
who's going to win this.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.290
And the market has allowed
both types to exist.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.880
So, there are certainly
differences in the written

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.850
charters, and maybe
differences in the preferences

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.454
in the stated
ideals of the people

00:08:34.454 --> 00:08:35.620
who run these organizations.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.219
And that might make a
difference in some cases.

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:40.010
But it's hard when you
get it all together,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.280
and you really go try to do
national data or something

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.030
to find a big
difference between them.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.404
SAL KHAN: So the
big picture here

00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:47.660
is, as much as I've
looked at health care

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.952
plans even when were trying
to figure out for employees

00:08:49.952 --> 00:08:51.993
at Khan Academy, which
health care plan to choose

00:08:51.993 --> 00:08:52.630
and which not.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.680
And I've stared, oh,
what's the difference

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.220
between Blue Cross
and Blue Shield?

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.053
There's actually very
little I can tell just

00:08:57.053 --> 00:08:58.240
by looking at those brands.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.400
I would really
have to dig deeper

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.700
into the actual
health care policy.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.750
And that's going to be
different from state to state,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.958
and some will be for-profit,
some will be not-profit.

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.690
Even that's not enough to tell
you a general rule of thumb.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.460
You really just have to look
at the health care plans.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.830
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: You have to
look at the health care plans.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.420
And it's Blue Cross
and Blue Shield.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.020
But there's other
plans out there.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.590
There's Kaiser around here.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.520
There's Aetna, and
Cigna, and other plans.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.360
And they can vary
from state to state.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.710
And even within, you
can see variations.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.550
So, Blue Cross in California,
Blue Shield in California,

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.480
might offer some different
types of choices.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.190
So, if you said, I've
got a really nice plan

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.060
from Blue Cross.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.685
And I look at another state, and
you look at a Blue Cross plan,

00:09:33.685 --> 00:09:36.185
it might be that you're just
looking at a less generous one,

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:38.184
where there is another
one that you can look at.

00:09:38.184 --> 00:09:40.710
So, you even have to look within
a company at the specifics.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.876
SAL KHAN: Definitely when
we go from state to state,

00:09:42.876 --> 00:09:45.380
it would be weird to have
brand loyalty to some of these.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.730
DR. LAURENCE BAKER: It would.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.260
Yeah.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:46.880
You know Blue
Cross Blue Shield--

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.500
SAL KHAN: Because they're not
going to be the same thing.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.310
DR. LAURENCE BAKER:
They have this history

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.320
of being public-spirited
entities, and some of that

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.260
persists to this day.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.968
So maybe that's
something to think about.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.970
But in a general sense,
there are so many things

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.386
that they could
vary on that you'd

00:09:57.386 --> 00:09:59.770
want to be very careful
with any choice you make.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.500
And know that it could really
vary across state lines.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.050
SAL KHAN: Interesting.
