title eight funding and I wondered i

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160
title eight funding and I wondered i
 

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.100
title eight funding and I wondered i
know i didn't know understand as an

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:06.110
know i didn't know understand as an
 

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.930
know i didn't know understand as an
academic that title eight is

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:07.940
academic that title eight is
 

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.640
academic that title eight is
extraordinarily small we're talking

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:09.650
extraordinarily small we're talking
 

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.990
extraordinarily small we're talking
about five million dollars which in most

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000
about five million dollars which in most
 

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.650
about five million dollars which in most
yeah well about i'm hopeful right so

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:17.660
yeah well about i'm hopeful right so
 

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.990
yeah well about i'm hopeful right so
it's a little it's it's a bit under five

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000
it's a little it's it's a bit under five
 

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.640
it's a little it's it's a bit under five
million from that you've got to take out

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:21.650
million from that you've got to take out
 

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.320
million from that you've got to take out
the administrative costs for running the

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:23.330
the administrative costs for running the
 

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.510
the administrative costs for running the
program and so really in terms of the

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520
program and so really in terms of the
 

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.370
program and so really in terms of the
money that's given out you're talking it

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:27.380
money that's given out you're talking it
 

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.610
money that's given out you're talking it
wasn't at 4.2 this year 4.2 million

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:30.620
wasn't at 4.2 this year 4.2 million
 

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:35.260
wasn't at 4.2 this year 4.2 million
dollars the average size of an NSF grant

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:35.270
dollars the average size of an NSF grant
 

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:39.850
dollars the average size of an NSF grant
one NSF grant in sociology is four

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:39.860
one NSF grant in sociology is four
 

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.870
one NSF grant in sociology is four
hundred and ninety thousand dollars they

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880
hundred and ninety thousand dollars they
 

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.010
hundred and ninety thousand dollars they
give out 80 on average every year so

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:48.020
give out 80 on average every year so
 

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.420
give out 80 on average every year so
let's think about and that's just in

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:49.430
let's think about and that's just in
 

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.220
let's think about and that's just in
sociology that's just one of the

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:51.230
sociology that's just one of the
 

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.710
sociology that's just one of the
divisions within NSF so we think about

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720
divisions within NSF so we think about
 

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.440
divisions within NSF so we think about
this in balance this targeted funding is

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:56.450
this in balance this targeted funding is
 

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.600
this in balance this targeted funding is
really quite small but it's

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:58.610
really quite small but it's
 

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.210
really quite small but it's
extraordinarily precarious and one of

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:01.220
extraordinarily precarious and one of
 

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.870
extraordinarily precarious and one of
the reasons why i think it is so

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880
the reasons why i think it is so
 

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.430
the reasons why i think it is so
precarious and I could be completely

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440
precarious and I could be completely
 

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.790
precarious and I could be completely

these funding programs and we have also
 

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:43.540

good job with that we've been a little
 

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.390
good job with that we've been a little
too apologetic I think and at this point

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400
too apologetic I think and at this point

it's extraordinarily important that we

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800
it's extraordinarily important that we
 

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.460
it's extraordinarily important that we
work together both academics as well as

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:46.470
work together both academics as well as

funders to really carefully and
 

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:52.280
funders to really carefully and
convincingly articulate that this is not

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:52.290
convincingly articulate that this is not
 

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:54.920
convincingly articulate that this is not
a second class line of funding and that

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:54.930
a second class line of funding and that
 

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.170
a second class line of funding and that
it's here for a specific reason and it's

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180
it's here for a specific reason and it's
 

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.600
it's here for a specific reason and it's
here because the demands of becoming an

00:43:59.600 --> 00:43:59.610
here because the demands of becoming an
 

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.910
here because the demands of becoming an
expert in this part of the world are

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920
expert in this part of the world are
 

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.730
expert in this part of the world are
higher and you've got to have the

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740
higher and you've got to have the
 

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.380
higher and you've got to have the
language you've got to have the travel

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:06.390
language you've got to have the travel
 

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:07.940
language you've got to have the travel
opportunities you have to have the

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:07.950
opportunities you have to have the
 

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:11.660
opportunities you have to have the
networking and if you don't this is a

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:11.670
networking and if you don't this is a
 

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.370
networking and if you don't this is a
critical area of the world that we will

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.380
critical area of the world that we will
 

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.560
critical area of the world that we will
simply not know anything about and I

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:15.570
simply not know anything about and I
 

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.850
simply not know anything about and I
think that's an argument we can make

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:16.860
think that's an argument we can make
 

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.620
think that's an argument we can make
effectively and I would encourage us all

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:18.630
effectively and I would encourage us all
 

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:21.019
effectively and I would encourage us all
to really redouble our efforts

00:44:21.019 --> 00:44:21.029
to really redouble our efforts
 

00:44:21.029 --> 00:44:22.729
to really redouble our efforts
to make that both at our department

00:44:22.729 --> 00:44:22.739
to make that both at our department
 

00:44:22.739 --> 00:44:24.949
to make that both at our department
levels at our universities but indeed

00:44:24.949 --> 00:44:24.959
levels at our universities but indeed
 

00:44:24.959 --> 00:44:26.630
levels at our universities but indeed
nationally I think that's really

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640
nationally I think that's really
 

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.449
nationally I think that's really
important for my part one of the things

that we did last year at the SSRC is to
 

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.729
that we did last year at the SSRC is to
take a big view and do a 15 year

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.380
colleagues and Ukrainian colleagues it's
a little bit easier in Eastern Europe

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:32.390
a little bit easier in Eastern Europe
 

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:34.030
a little bit easier in Eastern Europe
and in this way I think Eastern Europe

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:34.040
and in this way I think Eastern Europe
 

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.750
and in this way I think Eastern Europe
is kind of past the barrier but it's

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760
is kind of past the barrier but it's
 

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.829
is kind of past the barrier but it's
still very very difficult to engage

01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:40.839

individual colleagues now but we still
 

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.359
individual colleagues now but we still
don't have the institutional linkages

01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:49.369
don't have the institutional linkages
 

01:02:49.369 --> 01:02:51.329
don't have the institutional linkages
and I think that affects the

01:02:51.339 --> 01:02:53.440
