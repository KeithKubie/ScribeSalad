00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.750
We did also look before about how the
cones are not evenly distributed, right?

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.445
There are many, many more red and
green ones than there are blue ones,

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:09.917
remember we were talking about that?

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:13.290
And we see that most of your color
vision is based just upon the ratio

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.664
between the red and the green, and
the blue is just there to give you

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:19.434
a little bit of,
sort of sensitivity to blue, but

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:23.160
you don't really have high
resolution in the blue channel.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.340
If you were to take a look in your eye,
well,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.110
not your eye because this
has to be a dead eye.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.030
So, some other eye, or
your eye after you're dead.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.860
If you want to donate your eye when
you're done just send Megan a postcard.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.540
If you peal the retina out and
you stick it under electron micrograph,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.000
if you take a look at that,
you'd see two,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.320
you'd see that as you moved along
the eye it was not the same everywhere.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.690
In the middle, which is the area
referred to as a 'fovea', about one and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.650
a half, degrees,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.360
you see this magnificent hexagonal
packing of photo receptors, okay?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.260
So, hexagonal pack, so i, if you will,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.140
the pixels in the human eye are not on
square grid, but they are on a grid.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.239
They're on a hexagonally packed grid,
and

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.550
the regularity of this is
pretty remarkable, right?

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.520
I mean, it, it, it gives you a very
good sampling, a ve, very dense and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140
regular sampling of
the underlying visual field.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.990
Which is one of the reasons that you
have such good high resolution up here

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.960
and really lousy resolution out here.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.090
You see, so
I'm looking straight at Megan, wake up.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.920
Okay, good.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.790
So I'm looking at, I can't really
tell how many fingers I'm holding up.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.390
I mean, I happen to know, of course,
because they're my fingers.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.620
So I can tell there's seven of them,
but or, whatever.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.260
But I can't, if you do that
yourself just do it this way.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.100
If you want to have a partner, look,
look them straight in the eye and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.130
have them bring their, their fingers in.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.490
You'll see their fingers are there.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.980
You can have them wiggle them, but
if you, if they ask you how many fingers

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.340
are they holding up, you cant really
tell until it gets pretty close.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.130
And yet, you feel like you got all
this high resolution vision out here.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.240
That's an illusion that your
brain is creating for you,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.260
out here in your periphery you just have
good sensitivity in motion, in fact,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.190
wiggle your fingers you'll,
you'll see them right away.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.220
Why might you want to do that?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.820
Well, maybe you want to
saccade your eyes over there.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.740
So, the system is very good at
detecting motion in the periphery, and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.950
controlling the eye to look at it and
foveating on what's there.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.630
But you actually only have high
resolution in this very small area.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.150
In the periphery, as shown here,
you have a few large cones.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.850
So, the cones are actually big.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.790
And they're giving you
overall color information.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.670
And then you have this high density,
again, of rods so,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.940
with low levels of illumination,
you can still see out really well.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.350
There, let's take
a look at this picture.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.130
So this picture is degrees from center,
so

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.550
temporal is off to the side,
nasal is towards the nose.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.800
And the first thing you'll see is
that you've got all these cones

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.480
that are mostly in the middle,
in the fovea.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.660
That's exactly what we said.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.450
Notice, the same way we have
rods out here in the periphery,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.900
notice you don't have
any rods in your fovea.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.050
Over here's your blind spot, right?

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.000
You don't have anything there.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.030
That's why it's blind.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.990
So, what would one of the implications
be of having no cone,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.210
no rods in your fovea?

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.360
It would mean that you don't have very
good low light perception in your fovea.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.270
And here's another
experiment you can do.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.290
Some night, go outside when
there's a bunch of stars,

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.050
some that are really bright,
some that are less bright.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.560
See if you can find a star that's less
bright that stays there 'til you look at

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.440
it, and when you look at it directly,
it disappears.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.820
And that's because your fovea can't
see the low light that your rods do.
