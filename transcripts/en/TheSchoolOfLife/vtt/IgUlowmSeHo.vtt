00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:07.180
We are, all of us, beautifully crazy or, to
put it in gentler terms, fascinatingly unbalanced.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.610
Our childhoods, even the apparently benign
ones, leave us no option but to be anything

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.340
else. As a result of these childhoods, we
tend, over most issues, to list – like a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.480
sailing yacht in high wind – far too much
in one direction or another. We are too timid,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.000
or too assertive; too rigid or too accommodating;
too focused on material success or excessively

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.870
lackadaisical. We are obsessively eager around
sex or painfully wary and nervous in the face

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.360
of our own erotic impulses. We are dreamily
naive or sourly down to earth; we recoil from

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.920
risk or embrace it recklessly; we have emerged
into adult life determined never to rely on

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.290
anyone or as desperate for another to complete
us; we are overly intellectual or unduly resistant

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:05.120
to ideas. The encyclopedia of emotional imbalances
is a volume without end. What is certain is

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.560
that these imbalances come at a huge cost,
rendering us less able to exploit our talents

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.000
and opportunities, less able to lead satisfying
lives and a great deal less fun to be around.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.900
Yet, because we are reluctant historians of
our emotional pasts, we easily assume that

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.110
these imbalances aren’t things we could
ever change; they are fundamentally innate.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.230
It’s just how we were made. We simply are,
in and of ourselves, people who micromanage

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.160
or can’t get much pleasure out of sex, scream
a lot when someone contradicts us or run away

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.650
from lovers who are too kind to us. It may
not be easy, but nor is it alterable or up

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.710
for enquiry. The truth is likely to be more
hopeful – though, in the short term, more

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.420
challenging. Our imbalances are invariably
responses to something that happened in the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.930
past. We are a certain way because we were
knocked off a more fulfilling trajectory years

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.150
ago by a primal wound. In the face of a viciously
competitive parent, we took refuge in underachievement.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.639
Having lived around a parent disgusted by
the body, sex became frightening. Surrounded

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:25.760
by material unreliability, we had to overachieve
around money and social prestige. Hurt by

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.819
a dismissive parent, we fell into patterns
of emotional avoidance. A volatile parent

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.240
pushed us towards our present meekness and
inability to make a fuss. Early overprotectiveness

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.600
inspired timidity and, around any complex
situation, panic attacks.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.569
There is always a logic and there
is always a history. We can tell that our

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.879
imbalances date from the past because they
reflect the way of thinking and instincts

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:00.069
of the children we once were. Without anything
pejorative being meant by this, our way of

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.909
being unbalanced tends towards a fundamental
immaturity, bearing the marks of what was

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.199
once a young person’s attempt to grapple
with something utterly beyond their capacities.

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:18.280
For example, when they suffer at the hands
of an adult, children almost invariably take

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.860
what happens to them as a reflection of something
that must be very wrong with them. If someone

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.790
humiliates, ignores or hurts them, it must
– so it seems – be because they are, in

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.840
and of themselves, imbecilic, repugnant and
worth neglecting. It can take many years,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.319
and a lot of patient inner exploration, to
reach an initially less plausible conclusion:

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.709
that the hurt was essentially undeserved and
that there were inevitably a lot of other

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.049
things going on, off-stage, in the raging
adult’s interior life for which the child

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:01.529
was entirely blameless. Similarly, because
children cannot easily leave an offending

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:08.819
situation, they are prey to powerful, limitless
longings to fix, the broken person they so

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.529
completely depend on. It becomes, in the infantile
imagination, the child’s responsibility

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:21.690
to mend all the anger, addiction or sadness
of the grown-up they adore. It may be the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.880
work of decades to develop an adult power
to feel sad about, rather than eternally responsible

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.910
for, those we cannot change. Communication
patterns are beset by comparable childhood

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.970
legacies. When something is very wrong, children
have no innate capacity to explain their cause.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.320
They lack the confidence, poise and verbal
dexterity to get their points across with

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.380
the calm and authority required. They tend
to dramatic overreactions instead, insisting,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.530
nagging, exploding, screaming. Or else excessive
under-reactions: sulking, sullen silence,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.090
and avoidance. We may be well into middle-age
before we can shed our first impulses to explode

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.500
at or flee from those who misunderstand our
needs and more carefully and serenely try

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.190
to explain them instead. It’s another feature
of the emotional wounds of childhood that

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.710
they tend to provoke what are in effect large-scale
generalisations. Our wounds may have occurred

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.950
in highly individual contexts: with one particular
adult who hit their particular partner late

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.500
at night in one particular terraced house
in one town in the north. Or the wound may

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.070
have been caused by one specific parent who
responded with intense contempt after a specific

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.860
job loss from one specific factory. But these
events give rise to expectations of other

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.600
people and life more broadly. We grow to expect
that everyone will turn violent, that every

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.520
partner may turn on us and every money problem
will unleash disaster. The character traits

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.380
and mentalities that were formed in response
to one or two central actors of childhood

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.220
become our habitual templates for interpreting
pretty much anyone. For example, the always

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.760
jokey and slightly manic way of being that
we evolved so as to keep a depressed, listless

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.810
mother engaged becomes our second nature.
Even when she is long gone, we remain people

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.960
who need to shine at every meeting, who require
a partner to be continually focused on us

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.960
and who cannot listen to negative or dispiriting
information of any kind.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.160
We are living the wide open present through the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:44.380
narrow drama of the past. We suffer because
we are, at huge cost, too loyal to the early

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:52.160
difficult years. We should, where we can,
dare to leave home.
