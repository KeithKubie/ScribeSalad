00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:10.241
The family of giants you work for

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:12.431
is throwing a fancy dinner party,

00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:14.751
and they all want to look their best.

00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:16.021
But there’s a problem –

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:19.241
the elder giant’s favorite 
shirt is wrinkled!

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:21.631
To fix it, you’ll need to power up…

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:23.881
the Giant Iron.

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.921
The iron needs two giant 
batteries to work.

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.771
You just had 4 working ones

00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:31.511
and 4 dead ones in separate piles,

00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:34.771
but it looks like the baby giant 
mixed them all up.

00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.561
You need to get the iron working 
and press the giant shirt, fast –

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:41.751
or you’ll end up being the 
main course tonight!

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:43.401
How can you test the batteries

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:48.371
so that you’re guaranteed to get 
a working pair in 7 tries or less?

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:52.001
Pause the video now if you want to 
figure it out for yourself

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.041
Answer in 3

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:54.201
Answer in 2

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:55.661
Answer in 1

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:57.863
You could, of course, take 
all eight batteries

00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:01.163
and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations.

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:03.783
You might get lucky within 
the first few tries.

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:07.133
But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.893
will take way too long.

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:10.413
You can’t rely on luck –

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:14.963
you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly.

00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:19.801
However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination.

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:23.320
Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.060
meaning that any pile of six you choose

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.950
will have at least two 
good batteries in it.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.630
That doesn’t help you right away,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.200
since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.199
But it does give you 
a clue to the solution –

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:43.709
dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results.

00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:45.698
So instead of six batteries,

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:47.628
let’s take any three.

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:51.298
This group has a total of three 
possible combinations.

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:54.768
Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up,

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:59.658
a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one.

00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:02.188
But if all three combinations fail,

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:07.278
then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all.

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:09.593
Now you can set those three aside

00:02:09.593 --> 00:02:12.763
and repeat the process for 
another three batteries.

00:02:12.763 --> 00:02:16.543
You might get a match, but if every 
combination fails again,

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:20.253
you’ll know this set can have 
no more than one good battery.

00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:23.153
That would leave only two 
batteries untried.

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:25.483
Since there are four good 
batteries in total

00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:28.263
and you’ve only accounted for two so far,

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:31.103
both of these remaining ones must be good.

00:02:31.103 --> 00:02:34.693
Dividing the batteries into 
sets of 3, 3, and 2

00:02:34.693 --> 00:02:38.773
is guaranteed to get a working result 
in 7 tries or less,

00:02:38.773 --> 00:02:41.763
no matter what order 
you test the piles in.

00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:44.693
With no time to spare, 
the iron comes to life,

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:47.763
and you manage to get the shirt 
flawlessly ironed.

00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:52.100
The pleased elder and his family show up 
to the party dressed to the nines

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.400
… well, almost.
