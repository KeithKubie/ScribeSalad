00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.369
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:08.410
SPEAKER: Thank you,
everyone, for taking the time

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.340
to join us today, both in
person and on the livestream.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.370
I am so excited to
introduce you to Dr. Leigh

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.820
Thompson from the Kellogg
School of Business.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.220
She has been a professor
there for many years

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.740
and has done a tremendous
amount of research

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.100
in the areas of negotiation,
collaboration, creativity,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.150
and teamwork, which
in our daily lives

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.480
obviously are essential
to solving problems

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.610
and to helping to move
the company forward.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.420
So when I heard that she
had a new book out that

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.880
was focusing
specifically on helping

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.710
teams and managers
solve problems

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.666
in new and creative
ways, I absolutely

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.290
wanted to have her
come and talk to us.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.430
So without further
ado, Leigh Thompson.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.450
LEIGH THOMPSON: Well,
good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.580
So this is the
title of the book--

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.170
"Stop Spending, Start Managing."

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.520
And I want to give a head nod to
my hyper-talented collaborator,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
first author of the book--
this professor Tanya Menon

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.520
from The Ohio State University.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.960
And here's the backstory.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.500
So when I first
met Tanya, she was

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.986
working on this very
interesting project

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:17.360
that, believe it
or not, involved

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.440
a study of Fresh Choice Zoopa.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.140
And Fresh Choice, as
you probably well know,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.670
is a very trendy--

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.930
or was a very trendy--

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.620
West Coast salad buffet chain.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.830
But they were faced with a
stale concept, sinking sales.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.910
And they had their eye
on a very quirky Seattle

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.190
competitor called Zoopa.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.770
And Zoopa had a completely
different model.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.180
Instead of having
a buffet chain,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.840
they had chefs at stations
engaging customers.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.980
What's your point?

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.910
The point is that Fresh
Choice was all over Zoopa.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.890
They were looking at
their best practices.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.642
They were infiltrating
their different restaurants,

00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:56.850
learning, learning, learning.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.060
Eventually, they acquired Zoopa.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.580
And then all of a sudden,
the learning stopped.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.760
All the innovative ideas
that they initially

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.759
were very excited about,
they were dismissing.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.550
So we thought, well,
this is kind of weird.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.720
What explains that?

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.370
How can you be
all over something

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.910
and then drop it
like a hot potato?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.800
Then I started telling Tanya
about this phenomenon that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.580
was happening in some
of my executive classes.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.384
And I kept thinking of this
crazy Woody Allen quote--

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:28.050
"I never want to
belong to any club that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.100
would have me as a member."

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.766
I just wanted to find
a way to work that

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:32.310
into the conversation.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.730
So I've had more than
one of my executives

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.100
in my management
classes say that they've

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.730
had a very strange experience
in their own companies.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.170
They would have
ideas, they would

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.630
have insights that
would be dismissed

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.320
by their bosses,
leaders, upper managers.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.480
And then in the case of
one woman in my class,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.440
once she left her company,
started her own consulting

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.260
firm, her previous
company called her

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.400
and paid her four
times the money

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.880
that she ever would have asked
for for her original idea.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.780
So it wasn't until
she became an outsider

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.540
that all of a sudden, her ideas
seemed to get more valuation

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.740
or traction.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.750
So what we're going to do today
is we're going to talk about--

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.130
well, why is it the case that
sometimes what we're doing

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.700
doesn't seem to add
traction to solving

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.160
some of our internal problems?

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.310
So sometimes, our strengths
can lead us astray.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.220
So what we're going
to do today is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.860
we're going to talk about the
winner's trap, which really

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.710
comes out of this
Zoopa, Fresh Choice,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.990
we overvalue
consultants' ideas where

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.410
we tend to see our
colleagues as competitors

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.330
and we devalue their ideas.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.640
We're going to talk
about the expertise trap.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.290
And that's where we get so
involved in our own domain

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.230
that we block learning
from other domains.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.490
We're going to talk about my
favorite one, the agreement

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.150
trap.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.630
So I'm a negotiation researcher.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.730
And what I often
find is that people

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.900
are extremely uncomfortable
negotiating, especially

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.510
in unscripted situations.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.816
So we're going to have
some fun with that.

00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:21.399
Another favorite one
of mine is called

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.850
the macro-management trap.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.950
The central idea is that we've
gotten the memo that we need

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.430
to empower others and delegate.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.830
And then we take away
all the structure,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.452
and we don't put
up any guardrails.

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:38.160
And then we're going
to talk a little bit

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.600
about the communication trap.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.210
So armed with all
of our technology,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.780
the signal-to-noise ratio
is starting to be a problem.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.770
I don't expect you
to read all this.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.770
But we did a survey with a
lot of different executives,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.000
leaders, managers, et cetera.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.780
And we had them basically
say how much money

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.230
do you spend each day on--

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.480
how much money do
you lose each day

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.860
when you are not
able to negotiate

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.030
a mutually beneficial outcome.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.030
This is my favorite one.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.240
How much money would
you say is involved

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.640
in unproductive
meetings-- so if you

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.890
think about what is the
value of your time, how

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.100
many meetings you're in.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.100
We also asked a lot
of questions about

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.000
do you pay people to motivate
them to do routine work.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.060
And we asked a lot of questions
about how much money do you

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.460
pay consultants versus
your own people.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.200
And the bottom line numbers
really surprised us.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.792
So on average--
these are hundreds

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:44.250
of people that
we're interviewing--

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.690
said that they spent over
$7,000 per line item per day.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.740
If you add up the cost
of this wasted time,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.190
if you add up all these
dimensions together,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.150
there's a waste of
like a $144,000 a day,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.650
and it turns out to
be $52 million a year.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.950
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:11.200
going to unpack some of
these hidden people problems.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.190
And what we're
going to start with

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.140
is the winner's trap, which is
the basis of how we got started

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.210
in this whole enterprise.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.840
And the idea here is that
motivated, results-driven

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.430
managers get things done.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.100
A lot of us have been programmed
to be action oriented,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.540
take charge.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.430
Sometimes, though, we may see
our colleagues as competitors.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.260
Now, what I'm
going to do next is

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.690
I'm going to talk to you
about a research study.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.580
And I just want you to
make some predictions.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.510
So here's the research study.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.630
So what Professor
Menon and myself

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.620
did is we wanted to
compare how people--

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.260
managers, people
who have real jobs--

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.280
react to good ideas--

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.150
in other words,
innovative ideas--

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.730
authored by internal people,
who are their colleagues,

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.530
versus the exact
same idea allegedly

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.240
authored by an outsider.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.170
Maybe it would be a competitor.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.100
Maybe it would be somebody
outside the company.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.310
And I'm just curious--

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.470
what would be your intuition?

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.890
These people are reacting
to the exact same idea.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.930
The only difference
is that I either

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.320
think it's been authored
by a colleague of mine,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.340
or I think it's been authored
by maybe a competitor of mine.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.520
What would be your intuition?

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.260
What's your name?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.010
AUDIENCE: Deborah.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.350
LEIGH THOMPSON: Deborah.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.120
Deborah is saying I wish you
wouldn't have call on me.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.828
So Deborah, what would
be your intuition?

00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:46.512
I've told you we
have this theory.

00:07:46.512 --> 00:07:47.470
AUDIENCE: The external.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.678
LEIGH THOMPSON: The external.

00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:50.620
Do you have any intuitions why?

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.689
Why is it that we do that?

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:54.675
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:56.160
I don't have a good theory.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.870
LEIGH THOMPSON: But you
seem really quick to think

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.994
we think it's the external.

00:07:58.994 --> 00:08:00.480
So something about-- OK.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.060
So this is what we found.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.510
Deborah is spot on.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.820
So what we did here-- and
I want to explain this--

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.340
is we said, well,
how willing would you

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.690
be to learn from this
really cool, novel idea.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.200
And we found that--
again, holding the nature,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.440
substance of the
idea constant, we

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.320
are much more likely to want
to learn from outsiders' ideas

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.480
than insiders' ideas.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.310
And again, I keep
on driving home--

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.170
we're holding the
idea itself constant.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.432
And then we ask people, well--

00:08:31.432 --> 00:08:33.390
I asked the same question
that I asked Deborah.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.669
Why do you think this is?

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.000
We asked a lot of questions.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.809
But when it came to
are you concerned

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.900
that you might lose some
status in your organization

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.760
if you really followed Deborah's
idea, that's when people said,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.550
yes, we think that
that could be the case.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.770
So we did a followup
study, and we

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.010
found that managers
allocate 42% more budget

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.020
money to learn about
outsider innovation

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.180
the same way that Zoopa--

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.880
the same way that Fresh
Choice did with Zoopa.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.270
But they believed that they were
36 more likely to lose status.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.820
So then what we did is we
had to try to be good social

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.320
scientists, and we
had to say, look,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.490
if we're going to show something
bad about human behavior that

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.970
we de-value-- our
colleagues' ideas--

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.470
as good social
scientists, we should

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.120
try to be able to repair this.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.170
What's the fix?

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.670
What's the Band-Aid?

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.560
And so we hypothesized
that maybe what's going on

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.010
is this that people in
companies and organizations

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.070
get into micro-competitions.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.100
Every day, I'm trying to
be smarter than Deborah.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.620
I'm trying to be
smarter than Nicky.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.520
And so if we can get people out
of these micro-competitions,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.320
maybe they'll realize,
well, Nicky really

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.026
has a really cool
idea, and it's not

00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:50.400
going to cause me
to lose status.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.070
So what we did is we did a very
simple research investigation.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.120
We had some people call
to mind specific personal

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.370
accomplishments that they
themselves had achieved.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.590
And other people-- we
didn't tell them to do this.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.460
And what we found
is that the people

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.120
who recalled a personal
accomplishment when

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.710
they heard about
Deborah's fantastic idea--

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.770
they said, of course I
want to learn from Deborah.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.840
Of course I want to
acquire that knowledge,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.680
and of course I'll use it.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.240
If they didn't recall a personal
accomplishment-- no recall--

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.680
they were less
likely to do that.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:42.440
So the takeaway message is that
we need to widen our aperture.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.890
We need to get away from the
micro, daily competitions

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:51.020
and realize there is talent
all around me that I can use,

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.320
and it doesn't mean
that, in some sense,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.850
I'm going to be a loser.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.580
So I want to ask
you the equivalent

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.090
of a managerial Rorschach test.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.730
Let's imagine that these
two people work together.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.570
They're on the same team.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.820
And I want you to imagine
that the young woman we

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.590
see here is the boss, or at
least the older gentleman

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.040
here reports up to you.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.410
Any hypotheses about--
and let's suppose

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.140
they're discussing a
very important project.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.830
Any hypotheses about what
their professional relationship

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.330
is like?

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.621
This is an open-ended question.

00:11:32.621 --> 00:11:34.321
Can I call on you?

00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:34.820
Yes.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.690
What's your first name?

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.020
AUDIENCE: Sarah.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.936
LEIGH THOMPSON: Sarah.

00:11:36.936 --> 00:11:38.400
OK, Sarah.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.030
What do you think
is going on here?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.725
AUDIENCE: So the lady is the--

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:45.340
SPEAKER: The lady is the boss.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.410
He reports up to her.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.840
How does he feel
about this whole--

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.762
they're discussing a project.

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:52.720
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.310
Maybe he feels undervalued.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.150
He may be more experienced.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.980
LEIGH THOMPSON: He's
got more experience.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.420
You can look at
him and tell that.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.860
Anybody else have a--

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.520
thank you.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.144
Anybody else have an intuition
about how he might feel?

00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:08.560
AUDIENCE: Like he knows better.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.890
SPEAKER: Like he knows better.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.070
So I got very
interested in this.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.080
You guys know I teach
full-time MBA students.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.920
And I cannot tell you how many
times I've had a very young

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.400
28-year-old, 27-year-old
MBA student--

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.880
male or female-- say one of
the most uncomfortable things

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.570
about my previous job
before coming to b-school

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.700
was that I had older
people on my team

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.650
who were threatened by me.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.550
I was their boss.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:41.290
So in other words, they walk
around feeling like I'm young,

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.554
I'm talented, and
older people have

00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:45.720
a hard time dealing with me.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.310
And we thought, oh my gosh.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.040
What a problem to have.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.410
I don't have that
problem, but they do.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.750
So what we did is we
thought, well, we've

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.070
got to study the dang thing.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.520
So what we did is we set up a
situation where we had managers

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.550
on project teams estimate how
much they threatened others,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.250
because they're so
brilliant, and so talented,

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.990
and so accomplished.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.320
But we also asked them,
well, how threatened are you.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.270
And so I'm kind of curious.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.437
I'm going to call on some
of my folks over here.

00:13:17.437 --> 00:13:18.395
What's your first name?

00:13:18.395 --> 00:13:18.670
AUDIENCE: Andrew.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.890
LEIGH THOMPSON: Andrew.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.540
Do you have a hypothesis about
what we're going to find?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.690
How threatened-- people have
to say how threatened they are

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.690
and how threatening
other people see them

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.930
in terms of their
prowess and talent.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:36.930
You have that intuition?

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.737
AUDIENCE: People are probably
uncomfortable with admitting

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:41.820
that they feel threatened.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.736
SPEAKER: Say it again.

00:13:42.736 --> 00:13:46.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that they're threatened.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.431
SPEAKER: I think Andrew
is really on to something.

00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:49.930
And he said-- I'm
going to repeat it

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.580
for acoustical
reasons-- he said people

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.880
are uncomfortable admitting
how threatened they might be.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.440
Andrew, that's
exactly what we found.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.450
I think you have a career
as a social scientist

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.710
if you're interested.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.550
So what we did-- ignore
this junk for a minute.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.480
We asked people, look,
you're on this project team.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.000
How much do you
threaten others just

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.510
because you're so bad ass
and so talented, et cetera?

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.420
And they said, oh, my
gosh, I'm almost a five

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.910
on a five-point scale.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.660
Because I've got all
this going on for me,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.270
and it's just hard for people
to take so much of my greatness.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.729
When we flip the question,
Andrew's theory holds.

00:14:28.729 --> 00:14:30.520
We asked them, well,
how threatened are you

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.280
by all these fantastic
colleagues of yours.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.440
Oh, I'm about a 3.26.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.480
So in other words,
then we started

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.220
to become very interested in
this whole threat immunity

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.720
thing.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.860
In other words, I
don't get ruffled

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.290
that other people have a hard
time taking my greatness.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.410
And I'm overdramatizing here.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.650
So then we decided to
really dial this up,

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.950
and then we published
this crazy paper called--

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.590
based upon this bumper
sticker that we saw--

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.240
"Don't Hate Me
Because I'm Beautiful.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.660
Hate Me Because I'm Young,"
which is the snarkiest thing

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.249
that anybody could say.

00:15:06.249 --> 00:15:08.290
We don't hate you at all
because of those things.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.130
You're just annoying.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.160
And what we found--

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.576
and I want you to
think about what

00:15:13.576 --> 00:15:15.340
Andrew said a few minutes ago.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.090
What we found is to the extent
that we're walking around

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:24.686
in this little ego bubble,
where I'm so talented

00:15:24.686 --> 00:15:26.560
and I know it type of
thing, and other people

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.990
have a hard time
taking my greatness--

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.400
two things happen which really
can cost an organization

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.110
a lot of value.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.940
One thing that
happens is that people

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.460
start to dumb themselves down.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.450
Actually, about 48%
of people said, well,

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.370
I've decided to hold
back a little bit,

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.600
because I'm sure that people
will fall apart once I

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.400
start to speak my greatness.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.690
And then we also found out
that this whole threat immunity

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.460
bubble can hurt relationships.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.550
In other words,
people don't feel

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:05.350
as collaborative and
connected on a team.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:12.430
So again, the key here
is that people are not

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.890
that threatened by you.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:20.006
So we need to really speak
up and offer what we have.

00:16:20.006 --> 00:16:21.630
Now what I want to
do is I want to talk

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.170
about-- question, Nikki.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.179
AUDIENCE: What about the
theory of imposter syndrome?

00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:26.970
LEIGH THOMPSON: OK.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.620
So the great question was, what
about the imposter syndrome,

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.580
which is, oh, my
gosh, I'm the idiot.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.850
And sooner or later,
the organization

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.220
is going to realize that
I shouldn't be here.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.960
I think that that is alive
and well and kicking.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.110
But what we don't know
is what is the base

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.940
rate of the imposter syndrome.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.530
I think that a lot of times--

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:55.500
at least qualitatively
speaking-- a lot of newcomers--

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.980
like, for example, PhD
students to programs--

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.110
have a little bit of
that imposter syndrome.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.560
Once they finally pass the
preliminary examinations,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.270
they dust themselves off.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.880
So I think that the
imposter syndrome

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.130
is alive and well and kicking.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.510
But I don't think it's got as
big of a base rate, incidence

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.250
rate as this one.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.859
So I'd love to do a study
where you take people

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.890
who have this threat immunity,
put them in the same room

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.582
as somebody who has the imposter
syndrome, and see what happens.

00:17:27.582 --> 00:17:29.040
So I'm going to
switch gears, and I

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.400
want to talk about
this expertise trap.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.060
And the whole idea here--

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.250
and I've done my own
little crossing out here--

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:41.080
is that domain expertise
is essential these days.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.530
We're really
focused on let's get

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:48.610
people who are hyper-talented
in what they do.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.170
And then let's
hopefully have them

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.790
cross-pollinate
with other people.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.440
But I'm very interested in
this whole idea of where

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.050
do you get really cool ideas.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.480
And so I'm going to show you--

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.680
I wish I would have
done this study.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.490
I didn't do this study.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:03.570
But I'm going to tell
you about this study,

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.110
because I think it's great.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.810
So this study was done by
O'Creevy and his colleagues.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.440
And what they did is they had
two groups of people sitting

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.680
in front of computers, like
a Bloomberg stock trading

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.550
terminal.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.620
And they were told, look,
there's a line moving,

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.550
numbers updating.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.350
And they said, look, experiment.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.120
Play around with the buttons.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.190
See if you can figure
out what manipulates

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.460
the movement of the line.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.320
Group 1 thought that
they were, quote,

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.370
very successful in figuring out
how the buttons move the line.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.790
And these are Wall
Street traders.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.680
Group 2, which
were random people

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.140
without a financial
background, quickly

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.960
realized there is no
relationship between me

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.220
pressing, in some
sense, the lever

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.830
and what is happening
on the line.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.970
So the takeaway message that
I think O'Creevy was going for

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.760
is that sometimes,
experts in a domain

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.540
see things that might not
be there, or in some sense,

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.600
overestimate their expertise.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.630
So my next question
for you guys is

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.970
going to be where do you
get your innovative ideas.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.046
Because I'm very
interested in this.

00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:15.420
And I wanted to
tell you a story.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.250
I work with chief
security officers.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.060
I know that sounds like an
interesting group to work with,

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.984
but that's who I work with.

00:19:21.984 --> 00:19:23.400
And they told me
this great story.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.872
I said, where are you guys
getting your next innovations?

00:19:25.872 --> 00:19:28.080
You're dealing with all
kinds of really challenging--

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.752
cyber threats, all kinds of--

00:19:31.752 --> 00:19:32.820
bioterrorism.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.791
There's all kinds
of stuff going on.

00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:36.040
They told me this great story.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.230
They said that recently, they
did an off site at a zoo.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.790
And I said, come again?

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.740
What are you guys
doing at the zoo?

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.700
And they said, Leigh,
animals of every species

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.220
are under constant threat.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.590
And different species
have different ways

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.470
of protecting themselves
against threat.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.510
They said, we wanted
to learn about as many

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.290
of these different
methods as possible.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.150
Because one of those ideas,
as crazy as it sounds,

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.640
could open up an
innovation for us.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.010
Now, that sounds crazy.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.580
But I recently had a woman in
my class who, believe it or not,

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.020
was designing the
suits that people--

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.180
that health care
professionals have

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.490
to wear dealing
with Ebola patients.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.110
This is weird.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.671
And they're designing
these suits.

00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:25.170
And you have to
stay in them all day

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.628
because the patients
are coming in,

00:20:26.628 --> 00:20:28.320
and they're very comfortable.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.570
And they said, guess
who we teamed up with?

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.440
I said, I can't even imagine.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.970
She said, well, women
who are getting married

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.420
have to stay in the dang
wedding dress the whole day.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.250
So they got their greatest
innovation by, in some sense,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.250
going way outside their
domain, looking at-- well,

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.750
let's talk about
the wedding dress.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.720
It has to look gorgeous, but
it's got to be comfortable.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.520
You've got to stay
in it the whole day.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.610
So my question to you is--

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:57.586
what's your first name?

00:20:57.586 --> 00:20:58.260
AUDIENCE: Ed.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:58.710
LEIGH THOMPSON: Ed.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.876
Ed is thinking, oh, my gosh.

00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:00.932
She's coming for me.

00:21:00.932 --> 00:21:03.390
And this is a question for Ed
and anybody else in the room.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.890
If you can think of your last
cool idea or innovative idea,

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.114
however large or small--

00:21:11.114 --> 00:21:12.530
can you think of
a situation where

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:16.330
it came from outside
of a typical domain,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:21.577
like maybe a movie,
a wedding dress?

00:21:21.577 --> 00:21:23.114
AUDIENCE: My toddler.

00:21:23.114 --> 00:21:24.280
LEIGH THOMPSON: Say it more.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.154
AUDIENCE: My toddler.

00:21:27.785 --> 00:21:31.010
She's where I get a
lot of ideas about life

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.364
because I try to make her
stop doing crazy things.

00:21:34.364 --> 00:21:35.280
LEIGH THOMPSON: Right.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.680
So you're trying to keep the
toddler like, wait a minute,

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.850
we don't do things this way.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.470
So were you working on
a particular problem,

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.110
Nikki, where the toddler said,
oh, I can do it with a balloon,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.260
or something?

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.200
AUDIENCE: No, but that's just--

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.870
or randomly just talking to
people in the micro-kitchen,

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:58.007
we'll get an idea about how
to [INAUDIBLE] 3D printer.

00:21:58.007 --> 00:21:59.590
And then if you're
recycling, then you

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.885
should just be able to recycle.

00:22:01.885 --> 00:22:04.260
LEIGH THOMPSON: First of all,
I love the fact that you're

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.110
the micro-kitchen, because
we can start to now talk

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.690
about collisionable
hours, running

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.270
into people who
aren't necessarily

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.490
in my domain of expertise.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.970
And even though they haven't
had all the years of experience

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.700
you might have had, you
get a really cool idea.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.410
Anybody else have a--

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.800
same, from the toddler?

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.244
From the toddler.

00:22:28.244 --> 00:22:31.940
AUDIENCE: A couple of ideas
that I look at other industry--

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.580
like, for example, how do
you [INAUDIBLE] process.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.050
For example, we're
a software company.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.782
Then looking at the
pharmaceutical company,

00:22:40.782 --> 00:22:43.400
they may have a similar
process that I can borrow from.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.000
LEIGH THOMPSON:
Oh, that's great.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.333
I love-- what's your first name?

00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:46.100
AUDIENCE: Sam.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:46.950
LEIGH THOMPSON: Sam.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.450
All right.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:51.350
So Sam is saying, I am in the
computer software industry.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.880
But maybe they're
doing something

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.990
in pharma that has a really
cool process where we can beg,

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.200
borrow, and steal that idea.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.240
So now I want you to
predict something.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.940
This is some research I did
with my colleague [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.560
I love to study teams.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.550
Heather knows how interested
I am in your teens at Google.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.360
We did a very controlled
study in which--

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.220
and it's all about
innovation and creativity--

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.230
some groups stayed
intact, meaning

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.080
that you work with
the same people,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.640
and you didn't
change up membership.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.950
You're working on the same
problem, innovation problem.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:36.567
Other groups stayed intact
except at periodic times.

00:23:36.567 --> 00:23:37.400
What your fist name?

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.100
AUDIENCE: Boris.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.016
LEIGH THOMPSON: Boris.

00:23:39.016 --> 00:23:42.720
Except at certain periods,
Boris would come into the group,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.970
and somebody else would leave.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.690
So it was what we
called open groups.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.690
So in other words, we're
about 75% to 85% intact,

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.400
but we're having
some people go and--

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.900
it's not a total changeup.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.450
It's just what we
called an interloper.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.060
And then they had to do
a brainstorming task.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:06.040
What's your hypothesis, Boris?

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.960
Who's more innovative, the
open or the closed groups?

00:24:11.648 --> 00:24:13.000
AUDIENCE: The open groups.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.166
LEIGH THOMPSON: Open groups.

00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:16.570
And why would that--
let's imagine everybody--

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.910
it's not like you're inviting
in Einstein or anything,

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.470
but say more.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.730
AUDIENCE: I would say, for
example, when I do software,

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.825
I like to think
about it like how

00:24:25.825 --> 00:24:29.416
a user who has no idea
about my processes

00:24:29.416 --> 00:24:32.703
and all the stuff that we do,
how they can just quickly take

00:24:32.703 --> 00:24:34.850
it and use it without
all the knowledge,

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.630
advanced knowledge of
what we were doing.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:38.500
LEIGH THOMPSON: OK.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.850
So in other words, that's where
the interloper, the newcomer

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.940
might be a great pair
of eyes to test that.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.149
Anybody else have a similar--

00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:49.564
what's your name
in the very back?

00:24:49.564 --> 00:24:50.360
AUDIENCE: Brian.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.370
LEIGH THOMPSON: Brian.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:52.490
Sorry.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.860
What's your hypothesis about
the open or closed group?

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.140
Because I think Boris
is on to something,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.000
but maybe you have
a different opinion.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.660
AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.320
I feel like getting those
fresh eyes on problems

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.890
is always helpful.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.022
And I try to encourage
that in my own teams.

00:25:07.022 --> 00:25:08.980
LEIGH THOMPSON: And
sometimes, it's hard to do.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.200
So here's what we found.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.290
We found-- and this
is holding constant

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.050
the talent and training
level in the group.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.890
So it isn't like we brought
in certain gifted people.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:25.330
It was more that we just
simply reshuffled a few members

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.380
in existing groups.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.160
We reshuffled.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.670
And what we found is
that the open groups

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.080
generated more ideas.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.070
And our fancy word
for that is fluency.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:39.610
They just have a greater
proportion of per-person ideas

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.380
in a fixed amount of time.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.730
And the open groups
showed more flexibility,

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.900
which is our name for how many
different ideational shifts.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.330
How were they able to pivot?

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.590
And so that was very
interesting for us,

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.080
because we found that
a lot of times, teams

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.420
like to stay intact.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:06.720
And the idea of inviting
in an interloper

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.775
could be threatening to
the team's performance.

00:26:10.775 --> 00:26:12.400
So now we're going
to talk a little bit

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.590
about the communication trap.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.020
And here's the
nature of the trap.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.080
So we're armed with
communication technology

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.110
that transcends time and place.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:29.200
But the trap is that this very
prevalence of communication--

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.030
my iPhone, and I have email,
and I have FaceTime, all this--

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.370
that it might hurt the
signal-to-noise ratio.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.480
So now-- don't look
at this junk yet.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.820
Now I have a question for you.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:47.660
So you have been
called to facilitate

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.710
an off-site by, let's
say, an unnamed company.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.860
And the unnamed company
is saying, Boris,

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.510
we're having an off-site.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.740
We're going to have about
30, 35, 40 people there.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.620
We really need to dig deep,
discuss certain issues.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.470
But we're very concerned that
certain alpha dominant people

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.270
might monopolize the meeting.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.670
Now you can look at the
crazy stuff up here.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.800
So when you do some research--

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.730
let's take a typical
eight-person group,

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.250
and let's suppose
we're videotaping

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:26.840
in a very unobtrusive
fashion who's dominating.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:32.110
The most alpha, dominant person
in a typical eight-person group

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.540
does about 42% of
all the talking.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.630
Stated another way,
if the faculty meeting

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:39.700
is a 100 minutes
long, this person

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.860
is talking for 42 minutes.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.380
The second most
alpha-dominant person--

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.210
wow, 16%.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.730
And the rest of us are
the disenfranchised.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.930
This phenomenon is called the
uneven communication problem,

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.410
and it's almost like a
law of group behavior.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.870
So this is where you come in.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.570
This unnamed company--
what's your first name?

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:02.320
AUDIENCE: Dimitri.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.486
LEIGH THOMPSON: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:03.486 --> 00:28:04.310
AUDIENCE: Dimitri.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.309
LEIGH THOMPSON: Dimitri.

00:28:05.309 --> 00:28:08.110
Dimitri, we really need you.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:12.940
We have 35, 40 people, so we're
deathly afraid that there's

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.520
going to be one, two, or three
people who really dominate

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.270
this off-site.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:20.290
And Dimitri, money
is not an object.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.290
What can you do to
make sure that we don't

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.762
have this uneven communication?

00:28:25.762 --> 00:28:27.470
And we're going to
ask other people, too.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:34.247
AUDIENCE: So we may split all
those people to smaller groups.

00:28:34.247 --> 00:28:35.830
LEIGH THOMPSON: I
love Dimitri's idea.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.860
He's saying let's get away
from the 35-person gang.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.820
Why don't we maybe have five
or six clusters of groups

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.430
so that we can have some
simultaneous participation?

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:48.110
I love that.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.610
Other ideas?

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:49.746
What's your first name again?

00:28:49.746 --> 00:28:50.537
AUDIENCE: Caroline.

00:28:50.537 --> 00:28:52.080
LEIGH THOMPSON: Caroline.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.542
Money is not an object.

00:28:55.542 --> 00:28:57.500
AUDIENCE: In addition to
the small group thing,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.813
maybe mandating that each
person has a time to talk

00:29:01.813 --> 00:29:02.620
or going around.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.070
LEIGH THOMPSON: I like that.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.830
Caroline?

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.250
I like what Caroline is saying.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:10.060
She's saying she's not going to
be passive about participation.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.840
She's going to say maybe we
need to hear from certain people

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.010
that we haven't heard from.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:19.390
Maybe we're going to have to
play bad cop with some people.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.360
Anybody else?

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.485
So far, I love these ideas.

00:29:21.485 --> 00:29:22.640
What's your first name?

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.090
AUDIENCE: Alina.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.006
LEIGH THOMPSON: Alina.

00:29:24.006 --> 00:29:27.140
AUDIENCE: So what
about having laptops,

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.516
tablets, whatever so that people
can send in their responses

00:29:30.516 --> 00:29:31.870
anonymously.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.230
And that way, you can't
trigger responses.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.430
Nobody feels shy.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.890
For all they know, you could
just be sitting here texting.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.540
LEIGH THOMPSON: I
love Alina's idea.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.810
She's saying maybe
the way to get

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.820
more equalized participation
is to eliminate the need

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.700
to dominate the verbal floor.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.900
So I think what
Alina is saying--

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.650
she's suggesting a strategy
called brain writing.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.530
Alina, had you heard of that?

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.855
I think you have a future
as a social scientist, too.

00:30:02.855 --> 00:30:04.480
So we're going to
get to brain writing.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.480
One company that I
know deals with this

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.850
by taking a couple
of decks of cards

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.100
and passing out an equal
number of cards to everybody.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.050
I don't know-- maybe
five, six, eight cards.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.590
Every time you say
something, you play a card.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:21.740
And once your hand is
empty, you zip it up.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:26.090
So you have to think, oh, am
I going to play my card here.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.430
Some companies use timers,
like the old Wizard of Oz.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.920
Once you've set a certain
number of minutes,

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.060
some people use facilitators.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.260
I think Caroline would
make a great facilitator.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.290
And then Alina has
said, why don't we

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.660
stop all the verbal domination.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.260
Why don't we give everybody
a laptop or the equivalent,

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.300
and have them be able
to post their ideas?

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.730
So anybody in this room--

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.130
Dimitri, anybody ever
heard of brain writing?

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.080
It's not a trick question.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:54.620
OK, good.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.510
OK, I got Sam right here.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.900
So brain writing is
not brainstorming.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.750
I love brainstorming.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.680
I've done a lot of
research on it myself.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.040
But brain writing
is even better.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.460
Brain writing is the
simultaneous generation

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.940
of written ideas by
individuals in a group.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.600
And when I use this
technique, I have two rules--

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.880
no guessing and no confessions.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.950
I'm not exactly
sure what she means.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.950
Let's say I was working with
a corporate travel group.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.080
And let's say that
they were trying

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.770
to brainstorm ways of using
social media to increase

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:31.820
corporate travel sales.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.680
Let's just say that.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.660
Let's say there were 30 people.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.370
I brought in 1,500 index
cards, three-by-five cards.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:41.660
I passed them out.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.460
And I said, for the next 10
minutes, complete silence.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.560
Everybody write down
all of your ideas

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.160
for this corporate
social media travel idea.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.700
If you have 12
ideas, take 12 cards.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.370
If you have 15 ideas--
you guys are with me?

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.950
So in other words, every
single idea of yours

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.600
is on its own card.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.030
Don't sign your
name on the card.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.680
That's the no confessions part.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.520
Because when we tape the cards
on the wall, step three--

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.780
after writing
individually, posting--

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.390
step three is everybody
gets five post-it notes,

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.650
and you vote for the five
ideas you find most exciting.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.160
And you can't say, well,
I bet Alina's idea is

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.890
the third from the left.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:24.390
No.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.550
You cannot try to
guess who said what,

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.070
because it's a
meritocracy of ideas.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.350
I don't know whose
idea I'm voting for,

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.260
but I think that
that's cool, and that

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.970
will move our project forward.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:41.820
When we did this strategy,
the group generated 228 ideas

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.230
in 10 minutes.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.210
According to the
research, if we were

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.640
to have gone around
the proverbial table,

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.410
we never would have gotten
past the second idea,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.190
especially if it came from
the chief marketing officer.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:55.470
Because then everybody
would have been saying,

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.140
sounds good to me.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.560
Now let me talk about some data.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.090
So what we have here
is a meta-analysis,

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.650
which means you
take several dozen--

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.880
almost approaching
100-- research studies.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.070
And then let's
compare brainstorming,

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:16.250
which is, in some sense,
a verbal free-for-all.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.910
I love those.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.120
Everybody say anything
about a certain project

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.870
without regard to
feasibility or expense.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.650
And then let's compare
it to brain writing.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.500
And let's have-- what's
your first name again?

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.340
AUDIENCE: Dan.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.590
LEIGH THOMPSON: Let's have
Dan start us off and say--

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.050
actually, let's get a
neutral, third-party judge

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.440
who's blind to whose
ideas she's evaluating,

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.300
and she just kind of calls it.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:50.630
Dan, do you have an intuition
or a hypothesis in terms

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:56.610
of quantity and
quality as to which--

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.210
where you'd put your money?

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.980
AUDIENCE: Well, I've never
heard of brain writing,

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.090
but I'm sure it's better.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.464
Because some people
are reluctant to talk.

00:34:06.464 --> 00:34:07.380
LEIGH THOMPSON: Right.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.760
Maybe you'll judge me.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.449
And I'm an imposter, anyway.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.138
AUDIENCE: You're
doing it anonymously.

00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:14.929
LEIGH THOMPSON: We're
doing it anonymously,

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.260
because I enforce
that no guessing rule.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.190
So Dan, am I hearing
you correctly

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.400
that you would say that the
brain writing groups would

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.889
have greater quantity
and greater quality

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.500
than our brainstormers?

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.389
I think you have a career
as a social scientist, too.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.889
No, I do.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.320
I've never had anybody come
out of the gate with that.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.940
Well, Dan is exactly right.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.389
So when you look at this,
the brain writing groups

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:42.350
are generating about 2 and
1/2 times the volume of ideas.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.360
Now, maybe they're crappy ideas.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.760
But then when you have a
neutral, third-party judge

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.690
who's statistically blind
to whose ideas he or she is

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.270
evaluating, there's a
significantly greater

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.670
percentage of those ideas
deemed to be of value.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:03.910
So to me, the
takeaway is when we

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:08.200
are on the hunt for innovation,
the last thing we want to do

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.790
is have barriers to entry.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:13.750
So that's why I
love Alina's idea.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.650
Now, speaking of-- yes, sir.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.900
AUDIENCE: Question about that.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.550
So it's the product
of those that's

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.210
the most important thing.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.800
It's the number of ideas
times-- the number of good ideas

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.515
that we want to maximize.

00:35:24.515 --> 00:35:25.640
LEIGH THOMPSON: In the end.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.050
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.175
LEIGH THOMPSON: In the end.

00:35:27.175 --> 00:35:29.400
But one of the
things that we find

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.970
is that too often, groups
want to put that quality

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.310
criterion out there.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.290
And we want them--

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.810
at least upstream in
the innovative process--

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.070
to be ready to put the
rubble on the table.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.317
So what I tell a lot of
my students and executives

00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:47.400
is the way you're going
to get to dime and a ruby,

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.700
a sapphire, and a rare gem
is to have a lot of ideas

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.360
and have some
principle of selection.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.490
So the answer is yes.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:01.150
But a lot of times, groups
so quickly go to quality.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.210
And that's, again, what
we study in this book.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.100
I've been trained
to be high quality.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.990
I've been trained to
rip ideas to shreds.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:15.070
But there's always a time
and a place for that.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:18.470
We must be very
obsessed with off-sites.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.790
And I'm going to have you
make a prediction here, too.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:25.300
So our observation that
management off-sites often

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.190
have brag sessions--
and that's not the words

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.080
they use, but they often
have periods of time

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.538
where people stand
up and they talk

00:36:30.538 --> 00:36:33.520
about a lot of great
things that they've done.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:39.230
And we started to
wonder whether talking

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:45.300
about a self-enhancing
moment, a moment of pride,

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.230
versus an embarrassing
incident might help creativity.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.620
So we did a controlled
research study.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.270
We actually did
this two times, one

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.850
with teams of senior
leaders and another time

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.890
with a group of
much younger people.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.110
And we had them, right
before brainstorm,

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:06.930
either share a moment of pride
or a moment of embarrassment.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:13.950
And I'm very interested in what
would be your predictions here.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.150
Sam, what do you think?

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.748
You're a social scientist.

00:37:19.495 --> 00:37:25.580
And it's going to be all about
how many ideas that they create

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.800
without regard to feasibility.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.520
AUDIENCE: My guess would
be that the one bragging.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.910
LEIGH THOMPSON: The bragging?

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:32.409
OK.

00:37:32.409 --> 00:37:34.190
So the bragging folks--

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:36.620
maybe it's because-- OK.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.630
You think differently.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.700
What do you think, Heather?

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.713
AUDIENCE: So I think the
embarrassing incident.

00:37:43.713 --> 00:37:46.840
Because a lot of
times, people are

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.360
afraid that their idea may
not have enough quality.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.325
And so by having
somebody who they

00:37:52.325 --> 00:37:56.780
see as being successful
showing that they have not

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.240
set successful limits but
were still successful,

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.047
will free people up to
share more freely, I think.

00:38:04.047 --> 00:38:04.880
LEIGH THOMPSON: Wow.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.040
I love your intuition there.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.240
So in other words, if I have
the chief marketing officer,

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.830
the senior vice president,
whoever it might be,

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.840
talk about an
embarrassing moment--

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.990
a foible, a flaw--

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:20.210
then I'm not going to
hold back on my idea.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:23.270
Because what can be worse
than what you just said?

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.330
So that's pretty much exactly
what we found, Heather.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.160
And the way to read
these crazy data

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.580
is that we've cooked up
a creativity score which

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.740
is a combination of
fluency, flexibility, volume

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.350
times quality.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.310
And what we found
is that the groups

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:44.990
who recounted an embarrassing
moment had more ideas--

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:49.250
fluency is our fancy word
for volume per person ideas--

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.500
and they made more pivots.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.610
They experimented with
different kinds of ideas

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.700
than the self-enhancer.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.710
So now what I do is every
time I lead an off-site,

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.190
I actually have people
share an embarrassing story.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.390
And it seems weird.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.070
But pretty soon,
everybody is laughing,

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.110
exactly the way
Heather predicted.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.620
And all of a sudden,
the guard is down,

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.500
and we can start putting a lot
of things out on the. table.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.310
So I want to talk about
the macro-management trap.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.740
And the whole idea
here is that managers

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.390
are told to empower others, but
sometimes, they remove too much

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.100
in the name of empowerment.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.520
And by the way, if I hear one
more person, one more company

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.300
say our rule is that we have
no rules, I will scream.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.550
Because those studies
have been done.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:43.560
If you take away all the
rules, people freeze in place.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.640
Because it's like being at the
dinner table, and I'm not sure

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.350
which fork to pick up.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.690
Because there are
no rules, so I'm

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.280
waiting to see
what Caroline does.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.680
And Caroline is waiting
to see what I do.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.360
And no one is doing anything.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.970
So one of the
things that we have

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:03.270
witnessed over the
year-- and I apologize.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.580
This is shock value,
and I apologize.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.800
So we're very
interested in teams.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.990
Heather knows how
interested I am in teams.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.000
And I'm interested
in team composition,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.040
and I'm interested in team size.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.960
And we have found,
in our own research,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.730
that the average team
size-- this is self-report--

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.870
has increased over the years.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.600
The current average team
size in our database

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.707
is about 13 people.

00:40:28.707 --> 00:40:30.290
And some of you might
be saying, well,

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.680
that sounds like a nice number.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.530
What's wrong with 13 people?

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.830
Well, I will tell you that big
teams are less cohesive, less

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:42.780
satisfied, less cooperative,
and they have lower per-person

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.620
productivity.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:48.060
There's something about having
the smallest number of people

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.950
necessary to
accomplish the task.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:53.220
I'm going to share some of
my favorite rules of thumb.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.939
Our friend Jeff Bezos, Amazon--

00:40:54.939 --> 00:40:55.980
you guys have heard this.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.260
Our Seattle people
have heard this.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.970
He has a two pizza rule.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:05.030
If he cannot feed his team with
two pizzas, maybe it's too big.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.250
And these are not Chicago
deep-dish style pizzas.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.320
That would feed
several football teams.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.590
AT&amp;T, phone company-- maybe
seven plus or minus two people,

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.720
like a phone number.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.930
SAP restricted their 20,000
employees to teams of 8 to 12.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:25.330
And that's why I really like
Dimitri's idea, a few moments

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:29.410
back, of let's split up
this 30-person group.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:36.910
Because if I am not providing
some guardrails as the leader,

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:38.909
our teams are going to become--

00:41:38.909 --> 00:41:40.450
we have a recent
paper called "What's

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:45.610
Your Team BMI," how many
people are on your team.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.210
Now, I'm very interested,
being at a tech company,

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:53.260
to talk about
communication technology.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.789
Rule number one up here
we do at dinner parties,

00:41:56.789 --> 00:41:58.330
but we may not do
this at the office.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:01.715
It says when meeting face to
face, put away technology.

00:42:01.715 --> 00:42:02.215
Why?

00:42:02.215 --> 00:42:04.400
Why would I want to
put away my technology

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.282
if I was having a
meeting with Dan?

00:42:06.282 --> 00:42:07.490
Why on earth would I do that?

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:10.820
Maybe I want to be able
to get a phone call.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.690
Any--

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.190
AUDIENCE: You're
only half engaged.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.773
LEIGH THOMPSON: I'm
only half engaged.

00:42:14.773 --> 00:42:17.330
Because maybe this
thing is going to ring.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.460
So what happens to
the relationship

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.760
that Dan and I might have
as colleagues when there's

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.450
a cell phone on the table,
turned off, between the two

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:27.030
of us.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.960
Do you have a
hypothesis about that?

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.565
AUDIENCE: A lower
level of trust.

00:42:31.565 --> 00:42:32.690
LEIGH THOMPSON: Absolutely.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.370
So they did a recent
study where they

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.120
had two people communicating.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.550
There was a
turned-off cell phone

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:41.300
versus, I think, in another
situation, a spiral notebook.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.360
There's lower trust,
less cohesion.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.245
So that's why we say
put away the technology.

00:42:47.245 --> 00:42:48.620
I think that this
is interesting.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.940
The CEO of SuccessFactors
said two new rules--

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.810
stop the blind carbon copying.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.600
So in other words,
BCC is not allowed.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.510
And if anyone else complains
about a team member,

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.840
he brings them into the loop.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.200
I'm also very interested
on email boundaries.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.560
One unnamed consulting firm
that I have worked with

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:19.430
says you do not send emails
to team members before 7:00 AM

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:23.960
or after 5:00 PM, and
certainly not on the weekends.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.020
You're nodding your head.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.008
Nikki, good rule?

00:43:28.008 --> 00:43:30.150
AUDIENCE: We tried to
have it on our last team.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.233
LEIGH THOMPSON: You tried?

00:43:31.233 --> 00:43:33.040
It sounds like a
past tense statement.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.998
You tried to have that.

00:43:33.998 --> 00:43:35.980
Because some of us just
can't stop ourselves.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.550
Yes?

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.216
AUDIENCE: There's two
things about that.

00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:41.069
One is time zones mess with
that, make it difficult.

00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:43.610
LEIGH THOMPSON: Time zones mess
with that, especially outside

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.740
of the United States.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.050
AUDIENCE: And also,
technology makes it--

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:48.860
doesn't make it
easier to do this.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.466
Sometimes I have
ideas off hours,

00:43:50.466 --> 00:43:52.090
and the technology
doesn't make it easy

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.084
for me to put that
down and not send it.

00:43:54.084 --> 00:43:55.000
LEIGH THOMPSON: Right.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.740
So there could be
some hurdles for that.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.720
I do think it's interesting
that one organization that we

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.729
work with has--

00:44:05.729 --> 00:44:08.020
this is a little bit different
than what you're saying,

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.570
but it's something
that I do myself--

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:15.650
nothing but good news and
updates delivered via email.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.590
In other words, if
you have a problem,

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.710
do this or knock on my door.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.860
So I'm kind of curious.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.180
What is your intuition about--
why would they say nothing

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.520
but good news and
updates via email?

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.764
Why would they say that, Alina?

00:44:32.764 --> 00:44:34.741
AUDIENCE: Quicker
response rates, people

00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:36.494
actually check the emails.

00:44:36.494 --> 00:44:37.910
LEIGH THOMPSON:
Well, what happens

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:40.080
if I send you an
email saying I really

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.080
don't like what you said
in the faculty meeting,

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.090
and I would kindly
remind you to--

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.100
AUDIENCE: It's very
passive aggressive.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.299
LEIGH THOMPSON: It's
very passive aggressive.

00:44:49.299 --> 00:44:50.590
What do you guys think of that?

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.590
Remind me of your first name.

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:52.140
AUDIENCE: Sarah.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.223
LEIGH THOMPSON: Sarah,
what do you think about it?

00:44:54.223 --> 00:44:56.576
Was that a good rule to
have, or it it please, just--

00:44:56.576 --> 00:44:58.200
AUDIENCE: I feel like
it's common sense

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.400
to deal with issues
more face-to-face.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.109
There's a lot of hidden messages
people read into emails.

00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:06.650
LEIGH THOMPSON: And
what do we know--

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:09.890
what's your intuition about
how social behavior changes

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:13.430
when communicating via
information technology

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:14.220
or email?

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:14.990
Nikki?

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.990
AUDIENCE: If the rules
was nothing but good news

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:18.650
or updates delivered
via email, you're

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.480
forcing the assumption
that everyone

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.230
has positive intents if it's
coming through an email,

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:26.200
so it takes a lot of the
miscommunication out of intent

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.065
from emails.

00:45:27.065 --> 00:45:27.940
LEIGH THOMPSON: Good.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.670
Right.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.730
Absolutely right.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:34.100
So people don't have to
deconstruct the email.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.390
And we also know
about social behavior

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.460
that when you send
me a neutral message,

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.350
I interpret it as negative.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.800
When you send me a
negative message,

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.140
then I tend to flame back.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.080
So I've adopted this
strategy in my own life.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.520
I have a problem
with something, I

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.660
am going to try to have a
synchronous communication.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.624
So now I want to talk about, in
some sense, my favorite trap,

00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:00.790
which is the agreement trap.

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.690
And I want to share one
of my favorite quotes

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.660
by Eldridge Cleaver, who said
"too much agreement kills

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.080
a chat."

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.280
I'm dying to know.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.410
Boris, you're
always here for us.

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:13.760
What does he mean by this?

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.000
And by the way, not only
what does he mean, but is

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.030
that a good assumption to make?

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:21.890
What does he mean, too much
agreement kills a chat?

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.400
AUDIENCE: Sounds like people
don't challenge each other.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.400
LEIGH THOMPSON: They don't
challenge each other.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.066
So why don't I want to live in a
world where I'm not challenged?

00:46:29.066 --> 00:46:30.940
It actually might be
a lot more convenient.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.350
I'm tired of being challenged.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.030
AUDIENCE: You're
not going to grow.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.613
LEIGH THOMPSON: I'm
not going to grow.

00:46:35.613 --> 00:46:36.484
Right?

00:46:36.484 --> 00:46:37.497
What's that, Alina?

00:46:37.497 --> 00:46:38.830
AUDIENCE: Nothing new will come.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.538
LEIGH THOMPSON: Nothing
new will come up,

00:46:40.538 --> 00:46:42.580
because I'll play it safe.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.369
And you'll play it safe.

00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:45.910
And then we're going
to get bypassed.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.620
So how do I set up--

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.940
I don't know-- a culture?

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.580
Let's say how do I
set up my team so

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.411
that we can have a good chat.

00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:00.160
What can we-- remind
me of your name, sir.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:00.914
AUDIENCE: Brian.

00:47:00.914 --> 00:47:02.080
LEIGH THOMPSON: Brian, yeah.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.780
How can I set up my team so we
can have a good chat, Eldridge

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.612
Cleaver style?

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:10.200
I'm not trying to trick anybody.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.509
Alina has got-- Alina knows.

00:47:11.509 --> 00:47:13.300
AUDIENCE: So this makes
me think of improv.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:17.770
There's the yes and rule, where
you're basically like, yes,

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.100
and then you have
to build up on it.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.850
You can't ever say
no and just stop.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:22.766
LEIGH THOMPSON: Right.

00:47:22.766 --> 00:47:24.430
So I'm not saying no, but.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.000
I'm saying yes, and.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.020
So maybe one of the ways
we can have a good chat

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.010
is to use some yes anding.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.610
So I want to talk about--

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:35.361
here's one of my--

00:47:35.361 --> 00:47:36.859
I wish I would have
done this study.

00:47:36.859 --> 00:47:37.939
I didn't, but I love it.

00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:39.480
But you guys can
predict the results.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.210
I want you to predict
which pair of people--

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.280
and imagine there were
several observations.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.475
So we get newlywed couples.

00:47:49.475 --> 00:47:51.600
Presumably, these people
love each other very much,

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.640
and they're going to spend many,
many years with each other.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.150
But then in some sense,
our control group

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.760
is people who are
previously unacquainted.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.960
Maybe they're people of the
same generation and background,

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.460
but they're previously
unacquainted.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.050
And let's say they're
doing a negotiation,

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.510
or they have to
do a negotiation.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:16.210
Which one of these
would you put your money

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.970
on for reaching a
win-win agreement?

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:20.243
And remind me of your name.

00:48:20.243 --> 00:48:20.950
AUDIENCE: Ed.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:21.520
LEIGH THOMPSON: Ed.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.728
Where did you put your money?

00:48:22.728 --> 00:48:24.790
Who's going to reach
the win-win outcomes--

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:28.555
the newlyweds or the
previously unacquainted folks?

00:48:28.555 --> 00:48:29.770
AUDIENCE: No idea.

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.450
LEIGH THOMPSON: No idea.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.160
Some of us-- yeah, oh, good.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.597
Caroline is going
to come through.

00:48:34.597 --> 00:48:36.888
AUDIENCE: I did this exercise
in the negotiation class,

00:48:36.888 --> 00:48:40.754
and it was a friend versus a
classmate that you don't know.

00:48:40.754 --> 00:48:42.795
And then when you
don't know, you always

00:48:42.795 --> 00:48:44.186
reach an agreement
with the kids.

00:48:44.186 --> 00:48:46.070
You're not afraid
to give and take.

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:47.994
There's no repercussions
for the relationship.

00:48:47.994 --> 00:48:48.910
LEIGH THOMPSON: Right.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:52.780
So am I to think, Caroline,
that you would actually

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.900
put your money on these people?

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.330
Because the newlywed
couples are going

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:00.190
to too quickly capitulate.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.474
They're not going
to have the chat

00:49:02.474 --> 00:49:03.640
that I was asking you about.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.015
They're going to
say, yes, honey,

00:49:05.015 --> 00:49:06.550
I think I can live with that.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.430
They're going to do
what Nobel laureate Herb

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:10.570
Simon calls satisficing--

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:11.980
I'm OK with that.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.340
It's fine with me.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.180
It's fine with me.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:15.550
So that's exactly what happened.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.650
The previously
unacquainted people

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:22.540
were much more likely to reach
the win-win, elegant outcomes

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:28.624
because the newlywed couples
took the low-hanging fruit.

00:49:28.624 --> 00:49:30.290
AUDIENCE: I think
that the results would

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:32.090
differ if it was not newlywed.

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:35.180
I think that the results
would differ if it was more--

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.680
LEIGH THOMPSON:
Old, married people.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.625
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:38.625 --> 00:49:42.020
LEIGH THOMPSON: Old, married
people who are just saying--

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.270
and that would be an
interesting study.

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.310
I'm not sure that they
would reach the win-win.

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.110
They might reach
the win or lose.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.180
But I think this is interesting.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:55.640
They deliberately use newlyweds,
because I want to keep it good.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.295
I want to agree with her.

00:49:57.295 --> 00:49:58.730
They're in the honeymoon stage.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.646
I think that that's where
the term comes from.

00:50:00.646 --> 00:50:02.220
We're in the honeymoon stage.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.070
So what I want to
do now is I want

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.560
to get back to something that
I asked Boris and I asked

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.580
all of you guys.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.210
So how do you create a team,
how do you create a culture

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:13.340
where we can have a good chat?

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:18.110
And so companies need to
establish what we call

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.720
boxing rings and campfires.

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.260
A boxing ring means
that we can have

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.780
the tough conversations
and the debate,

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.410
but it's not going
to get personal.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:34.740
We might even end up at the
common area, at the campfire.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.110
I actually-- when
I coach teams, I

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:39.230
tell them disagree
about something

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:40.530
in your first meeting.

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:42.300
So I worked with
a team recently.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:47.737
And they decided-- you know
that show "Undercover Boss?"

00:50:47.737 --> 00:50:49.320
So we just picked
something innocuous.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.040
We just said, look.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.400
Everybody has heard
of "Undercover Boss."

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.070
Do you think it's a
good show or a bad show?

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.486
Some people think
it's a bad show.

00:50:54.486 --> 00:50:56.970
Some people said I
think it's a good show.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:00.260
Let's debate about something
that's not the big kahuna.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.277
Because when we have to
debate about the big kahuna,

00:51:03.277 --> 00:51:05.610
we can look back and say we've
already done this before.

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:09.390
We've already had a
spirited discussion.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:12.960
Leaders practice debate
and have ground rules.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.099
So I have a woman in my class.

00:51:15.099 --> 00:51:16.890
She's actually in a
pharmaceutical company,

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:17.956
not that that matters.

00:51:17.956 --> 00:51:20.580
She came up to me, and she said,
Leigh, I think I'm going nuts.

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:21.871
I said, why are you going nuts?

00:51:21.871 --> 00:51:23.470
She goes, in my
previous company,

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.409
the culture was very
much along the lines

00:51:26.409 --> 00:51:28.200
that Caroline and Boris
were talking about.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.120
People had spirited debate.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.500
They challenged one another.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.290
And for a variety of
reasons, in her new company,

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:36.579
everybody was too polite.

00:51:36.579 --> 00:51:38.370
And I said, well, what
are you going to do?

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.630
She goes, well, I've
hired a debate coach.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:44.340
Coach is going to
come in and teach us

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.340
how to have a debate
that separates

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.690
the people from the problem.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:53.410
So I want to now talk about
finding your inner negotiator.

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.180
And I want to ask you guys--

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.850
and this is not a trick
question or anything.

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:02.457
What are the qualities of
an effective negotiator?

00:52:02.457 --> 00:52:03.790
And I'm not trying to trick you.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.180
Anything you say is going
to-- remind me of your name.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:06.470
AUDIENCE: Deborah.

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.428
LEIGH THOMPSON: Deborah,
what are the qualities

00:52:08.428 --> 00:52:09.600
of an effective negotiator?

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.030
AUDIENCE: Collaborative.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:11.472
LEIGH THOMPSON: Collaborative.

00:52:11.472 --> 00:52:12.263
AUDIENCE: Creative.

00:52:12.263 --> 00:52:13.960
LEIGH THOMPSON: Creative.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.802
Dimitri?

00:52:15.802 --> 00:52:16.670
AUDIENCE: Polite.

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:17.545
LEIGH THOMPSON: What?

00:52:17.545 --> 00:52:18.392
AUDIENCE: Polite.

00:52:18.392 --> 00:52:19.350
LEIGH THOMPSON: Polite.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.640
Oh, I like that.

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.064
Boris?

00:52:23.064 --> 00:52:27.600
AUDIENCE: I think the qualities
that [INAUDIBLE] goal and some

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.600
[INAUDIBLE] negotiation.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.870
LEIGH THOMPSON: Goal focus,
that they're goal-focused.

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:33.950
They have targets.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:36.761
Anything else, Dan?

00:52:36.761 --> 00:52:37.760
AUDIENCE: Good listener.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.650
LEIGH THOMPSON: Good listener.

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:39.190
OK.

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:43.660
So everything that you've said
is definitely on the list.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.000
And we actually
consulted with, I think,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.900
the world class negotiator,
Howard Raiffa of Harvard.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.630
And this is his
list that he used.

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:55.050
And I'm kind of curious.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:57.250
Oh, she's used different
color fonts there.

00:52:57.250 --> 00:53:00.310
I can't imagine what he's doing.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.770
These are all qualities
that I think you mentioned

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.110
or we would, in
spirit, agree with.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.000
Anything you notice
about this list?

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.682
I'm just curious.

00:53:09.682 --> 00:53:11.140
Maybe I am trying
to trick you now.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.790
But not really.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.708
Dan, do you notice
anything about this list?

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.500
For example, this
list versus this list?

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.920
Nikki sees things.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.834
Alina sees things.

00:53:27.834 --> 00:53:29.720
AUDIENCE: I feel like
the one on the left

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:34.440
is focused on what can I
get out of the negotiation.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.110
LEIGH THOMPSON: Yes,
self-interested.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:41.780
And the one on the
right would be--

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:46.330
AUDIENCE: How do I basically
work with my [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.770
LEIGH THOMPSON: I think--

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:50.620
yes, it's much more
outward focused.

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.750
How can I be a win-win for you?

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:57.250
So now I'm going to ask the
loaded, loaded question.

00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:03.910
Do you see any
gender issues here?

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:04.419
Stereotypes?

00:54:04.419 --> 00:54:05.460
How about let's use that.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.210
Do we say any gender
stereotypes here?

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.644
What do we see, Nikki?

00:54:09.644 --> 00:54:11.556
AUDIENCE: The guys
are [INAUDIBLE] women.

00:54:11.556 --> 00:54:12.520
LEIGH THOMPSON: Yes.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.110
OK.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.660
So what we did is
we took this list,

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.780
and we asked people to do the
uncomfortable task that I just

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.830
asked Nikki to do.

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:23.700
We said, look, all
political correctness aside,

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.970
just indicate which of these
are stereotypically male

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:31.380
and stereotypically female,
using society's stereotypes,

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.606
not yours.

00:54:32.606 --> 00:54:34.980
And the results were as crystal
clear as you can imagine.

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:39.720
Most people said duh, these
sound like the stereotype

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:42.680
of what it's like to be a guy--

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.570
assertive, rational.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.400
I'm not going to get emotional.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.802
And the right-hand panel sounds
like stereotypical feminine,

00:54:50.802 --> 00:54:52.760
even though, obviously,
we don't agree with it.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.690
And you might be
saying I can't imagine

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.970
what point you're making now.

00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:59.280
Well, then we did a study.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.750
And I want you to ignore the
right side and stay over here.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:09.970
So when we did a study,
we had very talented,

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:16.140
motivated young managers,
people MBA-bound

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:19.150
at very elite institutions,
do a negotiation

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:20.340
that was fairly high stakes.

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:24.330
I think it was a job simulation
that they took very seriously.

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:29.280
And what we found is
that if you look up here,

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.880
this should say
ambitiousness of targets.

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.100
How high did they
set their North Star?

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.820
What were they trying to
achieve in terms of a salary

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.950
or starting options, et cetera?

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:44.010
As you can see here, the
men set much higher goals

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.910
than the women.

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:48.540
This is men, this
is women, and this

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.640
is how ambitious is my target.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.170
So the men set
much higher goals.

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:54.540
And what I want to
emphasize is that this

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:59.010
was a simulation where all
of the financial factors

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:02.140
were the same for both people.

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.350
Then what we did is we
did the exact same study.

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:09.200
People had to do this high
stakes job simulation.

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.380
But right before
they negotiated,

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.670
everybody read a very
short page of information

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:19.090
in which we took this column.

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:22.930
We said just want you
to know that negotiation

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:28.330
experts believe that
these qualities are

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:30.130
important for being
a good negotiator.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:34.030
Otherwise, I keep repeating
everybody did the same dang

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:34.780
thing.

00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.710
And what we found when we
used the positive female

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.710
stereotype--

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:44.970
all of a sudden, the women are
setting really high stretch

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:46.510
goals.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:50.560
The financial factors in the
negotiation did not change.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.840
But somehow, when
we, in some sense,

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.230
affirmed the female
stereotype-- again,

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:58.940
it was a stereotype--
the women did better.

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:03.250
Now, you might be
saying, goals, schmoals.

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:06.790
What happened in their
employment packages?

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.340
Well, as you can see here--

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.720
ignore this junk.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.220
In the control condition, the
way to read these weird data

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:19.540
is that the higher the bar,
the higher the northbound bar,

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.090
men did better than
women, because we actually

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:25.970
had them negotiating across
the table with each other.

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:31.220
When they had read about the
positive female stereotype,

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.510
the women actually did better.

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:38.360
So our take away
message is something

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.750
as subtle as
reminding people what

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:44.570
are the qualities
of a good negotiator

00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:48.260
can have a dramatic
impact on setting goals

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:51.860
and actually how I choose
to use the information

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.760
in the situation.

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.180
And I close with another study.

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.460
This is the one that's
kind of over the top here.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.040
This is what we call
the gorilla effect.

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.380
And I'm trying to show a
gorilla in the background here

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:04.700
that's not coming through.

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:05.690
We had a control group.

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:07.040
We just said do a negotiation.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:07.760
It's high stakes.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.260
Good luck.

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.500
It's going to mean a lot.

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.340
We had a unisex group.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.040
In other words,
we said, actually,

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.750
negotiation, Dan, really
involves good judgment, sense

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:20.580
of humor, patient and prepared.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.230
In other words, that
sounds like everybody.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.170
And then we had a gorilla group.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:30.110
And in the gorilla
group, we said, well,

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:33.380
there are sex differences
in negotiation.

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:37.100
And what we found, in
some sense, surprised us.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:43.570
We found that the women did
the best in the gorilla group.

00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:49.050
In other words, the higher
bars indicate that women

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:50.760
performed better than men.

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.070
And I'm curious-- do you guys
have hypotheses about why

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.380
that might be the case?

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:02.270
AUDIENCE: Because you're
so accustomed to proving

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:04.084
stereotypes wrong.

00:59:04.084 --> 00:59:05.250
LEIGH THOMPSON: That's good.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:06.176
Say it again.

00:59:06.176 --> 00:59:08.310
AUDIENCE: If we're accustomed
to trying to prove stereotypes.

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:10.226
LEIGH THOMPSON: I think
that that's brilliant.

00:59:10.226 --> 00:59:14.510
So in other words, you
give me some stereotype,

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:17.930
guess who's going to show you
that that's dead wrong right

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:18.530
now.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:22.850
So in other words, when we
gave women the tip off that,

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.520
you know what, there
are gender differences,

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.490
their response was not today.

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.349
So we think that that's
kind of interesting.

00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:33.140
And so one of the things
that we're doing--

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.598
and I'm going to try to close
very soon-- one of the things

00:59:35.598 --> 00:59:37.595
that we're doing in our
research with gender

00:59:37.595 --> 00:59:40.070
at the negotiation
table is we're

00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:45.000
looking at holding constant
the financial information,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.830
it's really about how am I
going to use that information,

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.530
and what are the expectations
I have of myself.

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:55.190
So to come full circle
here, we talk in the book

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:56.450
about a lot of these traps.

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:58.430
And again, the whole
idea is that a lot

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:01.180
of what we're doing
in our companies--

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.630
90% of what we're
doing is probably

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:05.830
working toward great ends.

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:09.130
But sometimes, when
we take some of these,

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:11.290
it can work against us.

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:13.300
And I just want
to mention that we

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:17.020
have a MOOC at Kellogg, Massive
Online Open Enrollment Course.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.300
This is the free
login information.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.120
So if you're interested in
negotiation and teams and a lot

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.920
of the things that
we've talked about,

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.421
this is the
information for that.

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:27.670
And I just wanted to take a
minute-- thank you guys so
