00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.983
- [Tutor] Let's do a little bit

00:00:00.983 --> 00:00:03.170
of a review of potential energy

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.257
and especially gravitational
potential energy,

00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:06.371
because in this video,

00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:09.890
we're going to get a
little bit more precise.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.100
So let's say that I have an object here,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.320
it has a mass of M

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.547
and I were to change its position
in the vertical direction,

00:00:16.547 --> 00:00:18.423
we're assuming that we are on Earth,

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:20.850
where the gravitational field is G

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.350
and we have a change in the
vertical direction of delta y,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.350
so this is its new position,
the object of mass, M,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.740
so what is its change in
gravitational potential energy?

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.520
Well, we have seen this before,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.030
our change in potential
energy, due to gravity

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.570
is going to be the mass of our object

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.800
times the gravitational field

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.800
times our change in position
in the vertical direction.

00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:52.474
Now this is all good, but
there's a couple of things,

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.102
that we can get a little bit more precise,

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:56.410
that we can think about in this video,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.703
one is we assumed a
constant gravitational field

00:00:58.703 --> 00:01:02.020
and that's fine if we're
near the surface of a planet

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.487
and we also are just doing
everything on a relative basis,

00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:09.210
but is there a way to come
up with an absolute number

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.100
on what is the gravitational
potential energy?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.960
Well, to think about that,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.950
let's just go back to
Newton's Law of Gravity,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.910
Newton's Law of Gravity tells
us that if I have two objects,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.610
so this object has mass, M1,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.313
this object has mass, M2

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.643
and the distance between
their center of masses is r,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.890
that the magnitude of the force of gravity

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770
and if the force of gravity's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.295
acting in this direction on that object,

00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:40.560
it would have an equal
and opposite direction

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.170
on that object right over there,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.070
so the magnitude of the force of gravity

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.370
is going to be equal to
the gravitational constant

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.310
times the product of
the two objects' masses

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.490
divided by the radius squared

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.540
or another way to think about it,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.710
if we wanna know the
gravitational field created by M2,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.902
well then you would just
divide both sides by M1,

00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:03.970
so if you divide both sides by M1,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.740
you get that the gravitational field

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.360
actually isn't constant,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.520
it is equal to the gravitational constant

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.420
times, these cancel out, M2,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.830
the mass of the object generating
the gravitational field

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.590
divided by r squared

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.024
and so this can actually help us

00:02:22.024 --> 00:02:24.360
come up with an absolute formula

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.640
for gravitational potential energy.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.668
We can say that gravitational
potential energy

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:32.400
and this is typically denoted
with a capital G over here

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.648
is equal to, let's say
the mass of the object

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:37.883
and let's just call that M1,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.370
the mass of the object

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.870
times the gravitational field,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.330
so that's G times the mass of
the object creating the field

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.030
divided by r squared

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:52.830
times the height that this is

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.380
above the center of mass of the object

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.500
generating the gravitational field,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.522
well, what's that?

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:03.040
Well, if this was Earth,
you would view r as,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.000
well, how far am I above
the center of mass of Earth?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.580
And so you would multiply that times r,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.310
times r

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.098
and so this r and one of
the rs in the r squared

00:03:17.098 --> 00:03:19.123
will cancel out, so that will just go away

00:03:19.123 --> 00:03:21.690
and then this will just become an r

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.220
and now one thing to think about

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.980
is what should the potential energy be

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.550
as r goes to infinity?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.450
Well, what is the gravitational
field as we go to infinity,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.890
as r gets really, really, really large?

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.980
Well, as r gets really,
really, really large,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.262
the gravitational field goes to zero,

00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:41.940
but at the same time,
the further you get away,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.800
the higher the potential
energy you should have

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.200
and so the way that
we've thought about this

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.436
is we say, hey look, let's
just put a negative out front,

00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:51.800
you could just put it right over here

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.897
and then it all works out,

00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:56.120
the gravitational potential energies

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.479
are always gonna be negative,

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.850
but they get less negative,
the further out you get to

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.890
and at infinity, it gets to zero.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.263
So let me rewrite this.

00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:06.540
The potential energy, due to gravity

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.540
can be written as the negative
of the gravitational constant

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.263
times the mass of the first object

00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:17.160
time the mass of the
second object divided by r

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.922
and you can see this looks an awful lot

00:04:18.922 --> 00:04:21.560
like Newton's Law of Gravity,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.740
what the difference is,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.620
we have a negative in front
of the gravitational constant,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.410
instead of dividing by r
squared, we only divide by r,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.380
but this is really, really,
really valuable now,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.817
because now we have an absolute sense

00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:37.230
of what gravitational potential energy is

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.563
and it meets all the properties we need,

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:44.040
it would still meet this idea
that the further you get away,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.100
you will have an increase in
gravitational potential energy,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.932
because it's going to
become less negative,

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:53.570
but at the same time
as you go to infinity,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.750
as r gets infinitely far,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.770
your potential energy is
going to approach zero.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.990
So I will leave you there,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.423
in future videos, we will apply this.
