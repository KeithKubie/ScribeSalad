00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.080
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Good afternoon

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.980
On behalf of all my colleagues and
in particularly Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.520
Chief of the African and
Middle East Division,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.150
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.270
I'm Joan Weeks, Head of
the Near East Section.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.460
I'm Turkish specialist.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.680
And as part of our noon
time lecture series

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.570
of today's program entitled the
enlightenment, "Lost Enlightenment:

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.290

by Dr. Fred Starr is part of and
sponsored by the Near East Section.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.360
Before I call Hirad to
introduce our speaker today,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.990
we always like to give you a little
brief overview of the division.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.250
It's comprised of three sections.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.320
There's the African Section that
covers all of sub-Sahara Africa.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.540
There's the Hebraic Section
that covers worldwide Hebraic

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.930
and literature from all
over, not only just Israel.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.210
And then we have our Near
East Section which covers all

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.850
of northern Africa, the countries,
the Arab countries, all of Turkey,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.270 position:56%
Turkic Central Asia which is today's
focus, Iran, also the Caucasus,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.810
the Turkic peoples of China.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.670
So you see, it covers a wide area
and we'd like to have you come back

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.830
and use these collections
for your research.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.970
I also want to point out that
we've left flyers in your chairs

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.640
to evaluate today's program
and we always appreciate

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.910
that that you fill those
in so we can continue

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.640
to provide these programs to you.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.950
Also, I'd just like to point

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.120
out that today's program
is being recorded so that

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.810
if you ask questions, you're just
implicitly giving us permission

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.370
to tape your questions and answers.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.280 position:56%
So with that, I'd like to call Hirad
Dinavari to the podium and ask him

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.640
to introduce our speaker.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.550
Thank you.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.320
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank
you everyone for joining us.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.460
I know it's a rainy day and
it's during lunch hour and most

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.880
of us have busy schedules, the
fact that you're here means a lot.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.950
We are very grateful
for having you here.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.150
And we have a very
distinguished speaker today

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.610
and we are showcasing a book

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.910
which is quite important
work of scholarship.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.370
Before I get into the bio,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.080
I just want to give you
a little background.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.000
We have a lecture series known

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.830
as the Persian Book Lecture Series
jointly done with the University

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.600
of Maryland who are our partners.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.970
And these have been going on since
the Persian Book Exhibit in 2014.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.870
This year is literature and other
focuses also performing arts.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.030
And we have been showing different
aspects of Persian language.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.840
And this isn't about nation states.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.010
You're fairly familiar
with the Iranian aspects

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.540
of Persian, the Afghan, Indian.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.050
We even had discussions on
Ottoman and Persian connections.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.440
Central Asia and Persian
is something

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.180
that needs a little bit more work

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.300
and in this sense this
book is unique

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.730
and the speaker today is unique
because it brings the perspective

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.900
on Central Asian Persian,
Persian used in Afghanistan,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.480
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and beyond.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.170
And in that sense, we are bringing
you a full range of lectures

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.890
that cover the entirety
of the Persian language,

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.460
its richness and diversity.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.320
Having had said that, I would

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.950 position:56%
like to introduce our speaker Dr.
Fred Starr, is the founding Chairman

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.920

Caucasus Institute.

He began working in the Turkic
world as an archeologist in Turkey

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.580
and went and found
the Kennan Institute

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.460

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.260 position:56%
Dr. Starr served as a vice president
of Tulane University and president

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.190

and Aspen Institute.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.080
He has advised three US presidents
on Russian-Eurasian affairs

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.770
and co-authored the first
comprehensive strategic assessment

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.320
of Central Asia, the
Caucasus and Afghanistan

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.440
for the joint chief of staff.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.170
Dr. Starr's recent work has focused

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.480
on reopening transcontinental
corridors of trade and transport,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.020
the New Silk Road, his book "Lost
Enlightenment" published in 2013

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.280
which is what we are
essentially making available

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.000
for you here has been translated

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.930
into nine languages including
the various dialects of Persian,

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.880
Tajik Persian and Afghanistan
Dari Persian and,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.950
of course, Farsi in Iran.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.650
And it has received many
favorable reviews and was praised

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.500
by President Ashraf Ghani of
Afghanistan as a fantastic book.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.540
Dr. Starr also founded the
Greater New Orleans Foundation,

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.680
the biggest non-governmental
aid, sorry,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.890
aid donor following the
Katrina disaster that led

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.980
to Louisiana's repertoire of
a jazz ensemble of New Orleans

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.460
which has now toured in Eurasia.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.300
Without taking more time,
I'm going to turn this

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.760
over to our distinguished speaker,
the book is available for purchase

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.680

to sign the books once
the lecture is over.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.530
We're giving it to you for
a very good price of 20,

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.130

We will give you about
10 to 15 minutes

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.050
for questions at the very end.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.660
Essentially we will be recording
this so by asking questions

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.480
and being filmed, you're
giving us consent to record you

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.830
and make your comments
available for everyone to see.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.130
Thank you.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.510
Dr. Starr, feel free to come up.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:50.520
[ Applause ]

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.190
&gt;&gt; Fred Starr: Thank
you very much indeed.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.060
It's now 11 languages.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.750
Added Italian awhile
back and Turkish.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:07.480
I want to draw back 20
years almost to the day,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:15.640
almost exactly 20 years ago, I
was in Dushanbe and the civil war

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.950
in Tajikistan was nearing its end
but you could still hear shooting.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:28.170
And the city was really kind of
a depressing mess at that time.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:35.360
Everyone was very fearful and
then suddenly in the midst

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:44.760
of this rather gloomy civil war
situation, three soldiers marched

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:53.270
down the street with a flag and I
looked, that's-- what's that flag?

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.570
I've never seen it before.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.890
It was new.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.240
And they said, well-- I caught
up with them and asked them

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.140
and they said, well
that's our new flag.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.360
And I looked at it,
I was very curios.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.500
It's first time I've ever seen it.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.890
I noticed there is a green on it.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.880
And he said, oh yeah, that
refers to the mountains,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.510
green or to the green valleys and
so on where everything is growing.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.150
And I said, and it's
white, what about that?

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.360
And they said, well, the
white is the mountains,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.010
of course, snowy mountains.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:32.630
And the red, he said well
that's the life of the people.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.020 position:56%
I thought, gee, that's unfortunate
color for the time of the civil war.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.260 position:56%
But there was also on this new flag,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.670
there were I think
seven stars and a crown.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.900
So I asked, what are the
seven stars refer to?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.510
And they didn't know.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.180
And I said, well who
designed the flag?

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.080
They-- oh, we can take you to him.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.310
He's just a few blocks away.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:08.000
It turns out it was designed
by a Lithuanian Catholic

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.450
who had an antique store, an
old book and antique store right

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.810
in the center of Dushanbe.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.410
And so I went in and met
this man very hospitable,

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.940
very interesting man and he
indeed had designed the flag.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.650
So I said, what about the stars?

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:33.210
And he said, well he said when I
was a boy, a student in Lithuania,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:42.760
I had to study a work of German
literature, [inaudible] and he said

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:51.490
that was about Persian poetry,
a Hafez mainly as you know.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:10:00.060
And he said, I then got interested
and looked around and it turns

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.480
out there were other poets.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:10.250 position:56%
And-- in Persian, but he said once I
was focusing on designing the flag.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.730
I asked, who were these other
poets that I learned about?

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:21.200
And he got the whole list you
know, Ferdowsi, Rabi'a Balkhi

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.740
and [inaudible] and many others.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.140
And he looked into it.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.930
He didn't know anything
about this, and he said that,

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.310
my goodness they are all from here.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:40.100
And he meant Central Asia and, of
course, Tajikistan particularly

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.220
but somewhere from like Rabi'a
Balkhi, she's obviously from Balkh.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.010
But they were from
the East if you will.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.210
And he said, so I decided
to put them all on the flag.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.500
And I don't know which
specific poets this reflect--

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.080
stars refer to, but it's
a very interesting--

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:04.860
it struck me as very interesting
that these figures whom one thinks

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.920
of as core figures of
Persian culture and literature

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.250
and poetry are actually
from something

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.580
that geographically is
not part of Iran today.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.170
Well, that's not quite true
because the eastern edge of Iran

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:27.510
as you know, Khorasan, Ferdowsi
was from there for example.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:33.990
But the fact is that
this extraordinary bond

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:39.100
of poetic geniuses came from
the Central Asian territory.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.010
And this got me thinking,
well, who else is from there?

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:50.050
And I-- this 20-- 18 years later
I published a 650-page book

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.010 position:56%
which is an answer to that question.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.850
Who else is from there and why?

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:01.360
Why did that happen, you know,
that these geniuses that showed

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.920
up from what we now call
Central Asia defined broadly?

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:13.730
Well, let me note that I
also knew nothing about this,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.240
learned about other
Persianate languages.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:24.460
You know, like Bactriane, like
Sogdiane, Khwarazmian so on which--

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:31.160
I mean, Khawarazmian, we know
from their greatest figure,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.060
the great scientist Biruni about
whom I'll say something more later.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.420
We know he wrote about this
thousand years ago that this--

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:46.640
an entire literature was
destroyed and Khwarazmian Persian,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.560
when the Arabs came
through after the--

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.390
in the Muslim conquest
of the region,

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.550
he says that the entire literature,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.210
whole library after
library was obliterated.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.630
So, we basically--
everything I'm talking

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.470
about is a fragment
of what once existed.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:13.890 position:56%
And all the people I'm about to talk
about why we know about them mainly

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:18.270
through a fragment of their
total works, all right.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.210
No writer, no scientist,
no mathematician,

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.900
no theologian, no philosopher,
whoever.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:35.350
Do we have more than maybe 10, 15
at most 20% of what they wrote?

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.120
The rest is lost.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.610
So everything I'm about to
speak about you have to multiply

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.970
if what we know is
based on that 20%.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.010
You have to multiply it by five.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.640
And by the way, what is preserved

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.270
and what isn't preserved
is often quite propitious

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.680
because we know the names
of some of the hundreds

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.400
and hundreds of lost works.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.650
Now, let me therefore begin

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.190
by introducing three
quite different figures.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:16.670 position:56%
The first-- and I'll introduce them
not because they're the biggest fish

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.750
in the pond, but because they
are representative of the kind

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:27.400
of geniuses that this region
produced from roughly the 8th

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.050
through the 12th centuries AD.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.390
And let me start with al-Khwarizmi.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.350
He-- you know him.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.510 position:56%
In fact, you used his name
probably in the last couple of weeks

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.410
in English without
knowing it because you--

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.130
someone was telling
you about the algorithm

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.810
on which some computer
process is based.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.810
Well, that is a distortion

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:01.260
of his name al-Khwarizmi it's
transliterated into Russian

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.370
which is not quite
right but al-Khwarizmi.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:10.300
And when he's book was
translated, his book on algebra,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:16.680
the title is Algebra by the way,
when he-- it has a subtitle,

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.440
a compendious book on calculations
by completion and balancing.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.960
When this book, Algebra, was
translated it immediately

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.970
into Latin, it became
the standard work.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:40.020
And, of course, people wondered
who is this author, al-Khwarizmi?

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.740
Well, they think-- they didn't
know much anything about him,

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.430
but they did know he was a very big
figure in the world of mathematics

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:53.780
and therefore anyone who was, you
know, this was formal compliment.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.000
Anyone who was a great
mathematician,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.690
they called in medieval Europe an
al-Khwarizmi and hence algorithm.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.560
It's part of our culture.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:14.510
He also, by the way, he had in
his spare time invented linear

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:20.300
and quadratic equations, worked
out sine and cosine functions.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.550
He also pioneered in the
field of trigonometry.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.810
And what he did basically
was to pick

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.950
up from the Greeks what they had
done in these mathematical fields

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.760
and pushed it way beyond.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.240
Why did he know about the Greeks?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.350
Because Syrian Christians
who knew Arabic

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:49.740
and knew Greek were translating
these works and they--

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.160
but there are a lot of Syrian
Christians out in Central Asia.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.260
And so, these works
were known out there.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.700
So, he also did a lot
of work in astronomy.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.450
He did astronomical tables
that were based on the kind

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:08.100
of astronomical tables they were
doing in India at this time.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.590
He also, by the way
speaking of India,

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.120
wrote a book in-- on
Indian numerals.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.820
Now, Indian numerals, do
you mean Arabic numerals?

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:25.320
No. Indian numerals, because he
wrote that book on Indian numerals,

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:32.110
Arabs picked it up and by the
time this numeral system arrived

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.860
in the west, they knew
only is Arabic numerals.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.830
But you could just as well call
them Central Asian numerals.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:46.640
But he was a formidable figure
in other words, al-Khwarizmi.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:54.590 position:56%
And just to remind you its dates are
7 AD to 850, that's a long time ago

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.890
to be doing such genius work.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:03.170
Then my second figure is from
what is now Southern Kazakhstan.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:08.970
He-- this is on the great
northern route across east-west.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.080
It's pretty much the route that
this new so-called Silk Roads

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.450
are following.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:20.560
And Farabi, al-Farabi is his
name, lived date 72 to 950.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.200
Farabi was born in the biggest
trading city of on that route,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.090
actually a suburb above it, Otrar.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.210
It's absolutely bleak
and abandoned area today.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:37.530
It used to have some farming but
it was once a great urban center.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:42.850
And this Farabi, we know
him very well in the West

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:49.210
because he wrote the book on logic.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.990
He took Aristotelian logic.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.330
And he-- again thanks to
those translations out.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.840
He didn't speak.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.980
None of this people
learned or only a couple

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.520
of them learned ancient Greek.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.610 position:56%
But he took the Arabic translations,
studied them very carefully,

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.470
they're good translations,
the Syrians did.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:19.460
And not only did he write in
meticulous detail about the field

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.220
of logic, but he expanded
considerably

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.280
on what Aristotle had done.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.580
It's extraordinary.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.160
So, his books too were
eventually translated in the west.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:38.240
And in the West, they
were very serious people,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.510
Saint Thomas Aquinas
considered him to be a great,

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.690
great genius as indeed he was.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:51.100
He also-- He wrote books on what
we would call political science,

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.790
ethics and so on.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:57.400
And he also was a music-- musician.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.470 position:56%
He played this kind of an instrument

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.290
and wrote a book on
the theory of music.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.760
That was also translated
in the Latin.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.140
It was the greatest work
on the theory of music

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.070 position:56%
in ancient times in the Renaissance.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.290
Now, who was this guy?

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.350
I'll get to that in a minute.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:26.210
The third of my three
introductory figures is from--

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.050
what is now Kyrgyzstan, he
was born in a little village

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:36.160
which is right near a big gold mine
on the north side of Issyk-Kul.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.220
And he is not called Mahmud of
Barsgan which he should be called

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.600
because that's where he was of,
but he spent much of his career

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:51.510
in Kashgar, the great Turkic
city in Xinjiang in China

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.740
which by the way is currently being
obliterated as a historic city.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.480
They are making a kind
of plastic version

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.320
and otherwise destroying it--
destroying 2000 years of history

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.580
and replacing it with high rises.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.580
But he is-- and that's Kashgar
where Mahmud of Kashgar hung out,

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.370
his dates are 1005 to 1102.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.330
Now, what did he do?

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:24.830
He wrote a Compendium of
the Languages of the Turks.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:30.370
Now, that might sound pretty
dreary to you, but in fact nothing

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.030
like this had ever been done.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.330
Why? He-- this is ethnography.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.190
It's linguistics.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:40.620
It is folklore.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.920
It is geography.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.330
He throws in this Compendium
of the Languages of the Turks.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.840
The first maps, the oldest map
that we have of Japan, anywhere.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.700
The Japanese don't
have an older map.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.060
Interesting question, why did
this guy in Central Asia come

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.700
up with the map of Japan?

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.840
His-- what he was up to
was very interesting.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:14.330
He was, and I want to stress
this, he was a Turk himself.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.600
He-- a Turk who had been obviously

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.860
as all Turks had been,
Tungrians if you will.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:29.020
They are the followers of the
traditional nomadic faiths

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:33.710
that all the Turkic tribes had,
but in his case, a generation

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:39.080
or two before him, they
had converted to Islam.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:45.660
And these Turkic soldiers
from Central Asia,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:52.680 position:56%
of whom there were a lot, they were
totally responsible for the security

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.600
of the caliphate and Baghdad.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:03.070
No Turkik-- Turkish soldiers
from Central Asia, no caliphate.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.960
And Mahmud went there,
spent some time and said,

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.260
you know, this is terrible.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.950
These people aren't facing reality.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.990
Their security is totally dependent
on the people that they don't know

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.110
and despise, and who are
treated badly in the markets.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:26.630
They think the language Turkish
is only for buying groceries in.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.170
You know, so this is all wrong.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.620
He said, they're going
to have to learn.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.820
It's high time they
learn that language, too.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:39.920
So he writes this Compendium
of the Turkic languages

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.530
and he tells you how if you learn
one the adjustments that you need

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.240
to make to learn all the others.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.540
And he tells you where this
speech is spoken and what kind

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.060
of dress they have out there

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.290
and what they ate for
dinner practically.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.730
It's an extraordinary work.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.030
Now, I've given you
three random figures.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.380
I could give 300.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.270
But I hope you sense just from
these three that we're talking

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:14.760
about some formidable,
formidable figures.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:21.980
Now, this leads to some very
important but not obvious points.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:29.660
First of all, they all wrote
in Arabic and because of that,

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.430
people not only in the west

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:39.610
but in the Middle East assumed they
were Arabs which none of them is.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:45.460
This is so fundamental an error, a
misreading and it is so widespread

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:50.480
that we-- that the entire
phenomenon of these Golden Age

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.280
of Central Asia has been ignored.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:59.970
Why? Because weren't these guys all
of the Arab renaissance, not quite.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.870
Ethnically they were very diverse.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.920
Khwarizmi was Persianate.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.260
He was of this south ethnicity
among the very diverse

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.540
like Germanic tribes, you know,
the Germanic states today,

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.450
Denmark versus Germany
or Bosnia or whatever.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.780
Very diverse, he was from one which
we've completely lost track of

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.290
and we've lost track of their
language, he was a Persian.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:35.590
Then we have Mahmud is obviously
is a Turk and probably so.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:41.530
Although living in an empire, the
Karakhanid Empire of that time,

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.290
which should complete in
many respects Persianized

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.420
and learned Arabic
for doing business in.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.370
These were sophisticated
people, multilingual,

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.420 position:56%
multicultural right from square one.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.380
And Farabi, well this is
a very sensitive point.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:01.860
Farabi, well there was
a study, the scholarship

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.690
and all this is fascinating,
Farabi wrote this big book on music

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:12.530
and a scholar went through
the entire book and pulled

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:19.180
out every reference to instruments
and to musical forms and it turns

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.890
out they were overwhelmingly
Persianate.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.990
They weren't Turk.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.140
So, you know, it's
mildly embarrassing

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.930
that the National University of
Kazakhstan is named after Farabi

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.260
but it should be for
several reasons.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:44.310 position:56%
Kazakhstan is proudly a
multiethnic society and furthermore,

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:49.050
Farabi lived in a increasingly
Turkic world himself

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.630
and was interacting and to go
beyond that, the Turks and Persians

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:58.650
of Central Asia, there
were Turks in cities.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:04.010
But large numbers of them more
on the countryside as nomads

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:10.460 position:56%
and shepherds and so on, whereas the
Persianate people originally early

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.700
had-- were living in the cities.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:19.310 position:56%
Now, to go in the city, you needed
things to survive, you needed things

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.630
that you could only
get from the Turks.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.800
If you were a Turk, to
survive, you needed things

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.330
that you could only get
from the urban people.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.400
So they knew each other,
they interacted

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.800
with each other intimately.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.550
And both of them contributed
very richly

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.020
to this Golden Age of Central Asia.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.510
So you have for example,
the great astronomer, right?

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:47.740
I won't go into-- at
length named Hojandy,

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.200
he was from Hogent obviously
in-- of northern Tajikistan.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:28:01.330
Hojandy was not only a Turk but
of a very fancy royal title even,

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.770
but there he was interacting
with one

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:11.160
of the greatest Persianate
astronomers and scientists,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.320
and mathematicians Biruni.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:19.270
So this is in ex-- these
are inextricably tied

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.570
up with each other.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:26.670
So by the time much later you
got someone like Ali-Shir Nava'i.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.320
He is totally bilingual, bicultural

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:38.050
and bilingual in terms
of his poetry.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.670
Now, the further conclusion
about from this--

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.540
these observations of these
three guys that I want

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.900
to note is they're multi-religious.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:56.020
These three, all profess
to be Muslims,

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.860
although there is some
tradition that says

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.750
that al-Khwarizmi really
remained as Zoroastrian at heart.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:08.800
Zoroastrianism being
the common religion--

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.290
religious foundation of the
region and influencing every one

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:19.670 position:56%
in interesting ways, but it was this
phenomenon that I'm writing about

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:26.360
and speaking about of the
Golden Age was multi-religious.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.640
You had very pious
Muslims on the one hand.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.800
You have guys who just went
through the motions on the other.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.600
You have guys who saw the
opportunity to get some money

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:44.630
by identifying exactly
the location of Mecca,

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.860
they used their science to do that.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.190
And, you know, that's a good
contract let's go for it.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.970
You have people of
every degree of piety.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.280
But you also have very
prominent Muslim--

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.500
Christian, Christians
among the science

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.090
and in cultural figures you had.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:08.690
You had Jews and you had
Zoroastrians and they--

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:14.410
this was not a monopoly of anyone
and they were all interacting,

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.760
they all knew each other and that
was one of the characteristics

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.910
of the movement as a whole.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:26.590
Well, I didn't mention this
but, al-Khwarizmi cut out

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:32.100
and he eventually spent a lot of--
a long part of his life in Baghdad.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.440
As did Farabi and then
he went beyond that.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:42.210
And so, it is common to say
these two guys and also Mahmud,

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:47.570
he was there for a while, this is
all part of the Arab caliphate.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.140
Not quite.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.550
It's much more interesting
than that because in the--

00:30:54.550 --> 00:31:03.300
because you have, well, Baghdad
itself was founded by Mansur

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.920
who had checked out this
great Central Asian City

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.480
of Merv arguably the greatest city
in the entire region for 500 years

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.360
and it's pretty clear that his
circular plan for Baghdad was taken

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.870
from Merv, and when they have
the dedication of Baghdad,

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:28.170
who was there to bless
the project but a bunch

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:32.090
of Jewish astrologers from Merv.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:40.320
So Baghdad had a strong Central
Asian cast from the beginning

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:50.650
but what's much more interesting
is that later when after the sons

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:56.380
of the famous Harun al-Rashid who
was thought to be a great patron

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.160 position:56%
of the arts but I would characterize
as a Jihadist than a philanderer.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:07.950
His two-- his sons ended up because
he stupidly turned the whole empire

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.470
over to them together.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.440
They ended up obviously at war
with each other and one of them,

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:21.650
who spent many years in Central
Asia at Merv now Turkmenistan,

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:26.650
one of them finally triumphed
and it was he who brought all

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:31.230
of these Central Asians to Baghdad,
they basically took it over.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:36.940
The biggest patron of the arts and
culture, four or three generations

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.270
in Baghdad was not
someone from the Arab world

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:45.390
or from traditional Persian
world, it was Central Asian family

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:49.260
from Western Afghanistan,
from Balkh, a great city there

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.660
in western Afghanistan,
the Barmak family.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:33:03.830
Well, the Barmaks had run a huge
Buddhist monastery outside of Balkh

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:09.210
and when this was destroyed
by the Arabs, they said, OK,

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:14.590
we'd better cut a deal, and they
did, they converted and they ended

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:19.720
up playing their cards very well
and when those Central Asians came

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:28.510
from Merv to take over Baghdad,
the Barmak family was among them

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:32.010
and they'd-- they prospered.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:36.910
They were richer than Croesus, they
were the ones writing the checks

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.570
for the poets, for the
philosophers, for the scientists,

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.110
for the musicians and so forth.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.890
So then I want to stress that.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:49.210
That the-- not only were these
people not from the Arab world,

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.610
even though they used the
Arabic language which was that--

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:55.320
which they by the way
greatly enriched

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.750
and transformed into
a world language.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:06.170
Persian culture did this
to Arabic but beyond that,

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.240 position:56%
they brought something very distinct

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.950
and gave a strongly
Central Asian cast

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:18.130 position:56%
to the entire caliphate that's never
really been adequately noticed.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.610
But let me move on from there.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.220
Why did this happen?

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.090
What was going on?

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:31.870
Why did this amazing explosion
of talent, of genius take place?

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:36.820
It's worth asking, you know, did
something get into the water?

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.120
Why did it happen?

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.540
It doesn't, you know, this
is a sort of thing you asked

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:47.980
about 5th century Athens, Periclean
Athens or Renaissance Florence

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.700
or this is a real question.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:55.170
It demands a serious answer and
I think there is a serious answer

00:34:55.170 --> 00:35:00.480
and part of it is, that going
back to our friend al-Khwarizmi.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:09.570
Why was he so engaged on
this Indian numeral business?

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.970
Because they were-- he
lived in Central Asia.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:18.310
They had direct and intimate
trading task with India.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:23.070
And this is where his idea of
astronomical tables came from,

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:27.370
which he introduced, and
then others took it up.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:32.260
In other words, they had
that huge tie down to India.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:37.990
They had a tie to China, although
I think in the intellectual's fear,

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.240
probably more goods went
from Central Asia to China

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.300
than the other way around.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.380
They also have the direct link with
the Middle East and with Europe.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.080
They were the only ones in
direct touch with everyone.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.100
In other words, what we think
of as an isolated region today,

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:02.340
landlocked, and all that, it-- its
significance then was precisely

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.890
because of its centrality.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.970
They were trading with everyone.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.440
Now, trade requires skills.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.420
You need to-- you need a currency.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.670
They develop currencies,
they manage--

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.660
successfully managed currencies.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.390
A lot of countries
can't do that today.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:25.500
They also weren't managing
insurance and all kinds of--

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.190
all the, you know, bills of
lading, all of the stuff.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.760
They needed good mathematics
for this.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:38.000
As early as the sixth century, some
Century A.D., a Chinese traveler

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.360
in Samarkand, then still called
Afrasiyab, Chinese traveler

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:51.520
in Samarkand wrote in amazement
about kids in Samarkand that they,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.270
you know, these eight-year-olds
all knew mathematics.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.270
He said we don't have
anything like this.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:02.640
He was stunned at the level of
education, which was required

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.720
to maintain trade, to do this--
to do this sophisticated trade.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.190
But, beyond that they
weren't just trading,

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.260
they were also manufacturing.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.040
They were-- there's a
big technology society.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.500
So, you have things like crucible
steel and technologies like paper.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.790
Chinese technically invented it,

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:33.130
but the Central Asians reinvented
it using cotton fiber instead

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:39.370
of bamboo and mulberry leaves.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.600
They became big manufacturers.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.890 position:56%
They were the biggest
manufacturers of cloth in the world.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:50.140
It's an amazing amount of
protection was going on.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:54.000
So they, thinkers whom I'm
writing about were living

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.060
in very sophisticated society.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.110
Their cities were enormous.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:05.260
Merv in the 13th Century was far
the biggest city in the world.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.870
And others were right behind them.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:12.680
Cities that we don't even think
of today, Balkh in Afghanistan

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.090
for example, Iraq was
big at one point.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:16.860
They all were.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.230
But beyond that, these were
very sophisticated cities.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.290
They had well-heated houses,

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:27.340
underfloor thermal heating,
you can't beat that.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:33.270
They had air-conditioning that
was invented on the line between--

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.730
on the border between
Afghanistan and Easter Iran.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:41.920
This air-conditioning system worked
by having a deep hole in the ground

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.780
and then a tower up above which
would suck the cool air up

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.440
and cooled the whole structure.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.110
They lived well in other words.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:56.680
Running water everywhere, very
sophisticated hydraulic systems,

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.510
which is why al-Khwarizmi
was so focused

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:05.780
on his-- on his-- on his Algebra.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:14.370 position:56%
He needed to come up with simple
systems for measuring how much water

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:17.340
to move from this field
to this filed.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.720
It came out of life in other words.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.020
It didn't-- it's not just

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.710
because this happened
to be some smart people.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:31.410
So, what I want to say then
is that is this occurred

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:35.830
because they were linked
in, they weren't isolated.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:40.030
This was an amazing
achievement all and all.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.950
Was this a Muslim Renaissance?

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.570
In one sense, it certainly was.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:50.670
In other sense is it was a much
broader kind of Renaissance

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:55.670
because as I indicated, you
had every kind of faith,

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:59.600
and you have every
degree of skepticism.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:06.800 position:56%
One of the figures that I could pass
on is a great is the greatest mind

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.330
between classical antiquity
and the Renaissance is Biruni.

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:15.840
Biruni is from what is
now Western Uzbekistan,

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:23.930
not far from Khwarizmi by the way.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:29.400
Biruni was rather skeptical
guy in his-- in his views.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.650
He was-- he said the right things

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:38.330
but he never let any religious
dogma stand in the way

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.940
of the conclusion to reason.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.470
It's very interesting
figure that way.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:50.850 position:56%
On the contrary his close
contemporary and rival was Ibn Sina,

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.940
Avicenna, the father of medicine.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:58.140
And so, well, Avicenna
was a very pious guy

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:02.850
but of a rather descendent kind.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:08.550
He was although not formally
in terms of membership cards,

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:12.430
he was closest to the Shia.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:17.780
And among the Shia he was
closest to the Ismailis.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:24.070
And his writings on medicine,
he considered kind of secondary.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.600
His real work was in
theology, very interesting.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.000
OK. That's Ibn Sina.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.440
Well, if you -- Avicenna.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.900
Where did Avicenna get his work?

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:40.040
Well, one that he-- one of his
great sources was a guy named Razi.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.280
And Razi is a-- we would
call him an Iranian today.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.850
He's from Rasht which is now in
the suburbs of the ruins of it

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.220
or in the sub-- eastern
suburbs of Tehran.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:58.820
But Razi, I claim emphatically
for Central Asia for two reasons,

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.880
his entire education
was in Central Asia

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.360
and all his students
were Central Asia.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.620
But Razi wrote an immense
compendium of medicine,

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.260
much bigger than Avicenna's.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.790
Avi-- you know, Razi was so big,
you couldn't carry it around.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:21.550
And Avicenna distilled it
to the manageable length

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:26.050
and that's why it helps account for
the extraordinary popularity that,

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.640
you know, every med-- western
medical school, that was their text

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.360
down to the 17th Century,
Avicenna's.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.930
But Razi, why do I mention him?

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:39.760
And well, because he-- religiously,
he was a skeptics skeptic.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.640
I mean, typical Raziism.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:49.360
He was writing about
prophets, P-R-O-P-H-E-T-S.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.770
He was writing about prophets and
he said, you know, very strange,

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.700
each religion seems to
have its own prophet

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.270
and they don't agree
with each other.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.690
Now, what's going on here?

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.260
Is God sending contradictory
messages?

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.530
Or is there-- well,
he was a religiously--

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:12.630
to say skeptic is the
mildest that could be setup.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.790
And there were others who
were out, not atheist.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:22.390
My point is there was-- this
was a world of rich diversity,

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:30.280
extraordinary rich diversity of
thought and just as it was of trade

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.600
and contact and stimuli coming
from every which direction.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.420
So, it does raises the question,
whatever happened to it.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.350
You know, was it killed off?

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:49.180
Since we have two distinguished
guest from Mongolia here, you know,

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.130
you got blamed for this
often, but it's not fair

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:58.930
because the intellectual burst
had ended century before the

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.870
Mongol Invasion.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.170
Was it economic?

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:10.490
Well, yes, it was, because
once the continental trade wane

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:19.150
because of high tariffs and
low security, the rich stimuli

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.030
from every direction declined.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:22.620
That helped.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.830
But what really did
it was intellectual.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:30.510
It was-- there was an intellectual
change and that was a kind

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:33.090
of war against the intellect.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:38.810 position:56%
A war against reason, a war
against logic, a war against science

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:41.390
that was-- it had a history.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:48.070
It was launched by Abu
Hamid ibn Muhammad Ghazali,

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:52.270
G-H-A-Z-A-L-I, mark the name.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.810
He was a brilliant man.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.820
He also came from the eastern
edge, what is now Iran.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.890
This is a region by the way

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:06.530
which today is called Khorasan
which refers to sunrise.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:12.920
But traditional Khorasan included
all of what is now Turkmenistan,

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.870
went all the way big chunk of
western Afghanistan as well,

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:20.240
practically the Uzbekistan.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.710
He was -- Ghazali was a typical
son of this bigger Khorasan.

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:33.980
He launched an attack against
reason, against science,

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:43.930 position:56%
against the intellect in the name of
not of just the faith but of dogma.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.610 position:56%
If-- of-- in the name of textualism.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:52.280
If there-- if it is not in the
Quran, if it's not in the sayings

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.240
of the prophet, it's not valid.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:00.570
And you can find there answers
to all life's questions.

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.370
You don't need to go in
this other route of reason,

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:05.400
logic, science and so forth.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.500
Well, this was one guy
make launching this attack,

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:15.140
but he wrote it in a very acerbic
and clever book and he preached it

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:20.640 position:56%
from the-- from nearly, we would
call it university that was founded.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:29.110
It was the first-- it was
a system and that was setup

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:34.020
and he buy the caliph in Baghdad
initially and he was the head

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.230
of this system and lectured

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:39.980
and he was very effective
of the lecture, imagine.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.320
And, you know, thousand
years ago a guy lecturing 400

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.900
to 500 people as he
did almost daily.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:55.790
He created an environment in which
thinking and use of reason, logic,

00:46:55.790 --> 00:47:00.600
science and so on, the entire
enterprise became suspect.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:06.840
That-- there was no outright ban,
but anyone engaging in those things

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:13.210
after Ghazali was telling
he was getting on the edge

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:16.550
of very dangerous territory
and people stopped.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:20.660
And it took a long time
before a serious re-battle,

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:25.000
rejoinder to Ghazali came
from within the Muslim world.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.620
It did come, let it be said.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.690
This is very much debated today.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:32.550
These are very live
issues as you can imagine.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:39.650
It couldn't be more live, but they
were live in 1100 AD when this--

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:43.050
when this great flourishing
this effervescence

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.600
of culture began to wane.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.620
Well, let me close with this,
but say one obvious point

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.930
that has occurred to
every one of you

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.500
as you're sitting there
and listening.

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.370
And that is, everything I've talked

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.980
about has tremendous
resonance today.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.870
These are new countries.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:08.920
They are inheritors of
unbelievably rich tradition

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.560
with which some are acquainted, but
by no means the whole population.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:17.640
Much of this has been
lost or forgotten.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:21.200
They are rediscovering,
reclaiming this history,

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.060
not inventing a history
but reclaiming it.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:30.740 position:56%
And the degree to which this happens
in all its richness, complexity,

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:37.220
diversity, openness to the world,
the degree to which that succeeds,

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.870
you could say that's the degree

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:45.210
to which this greater Central
Asia region will flourish today.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:50.110
If they close down their
consciousness, their minds,

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:54.470
their memories to all these,
there'll just be a bunch

00:48:54.470 --> 00:49:00.910
of not very large countries and
remote part of the world that fall

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.830
under the influence,
control and sway of others.

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:09.500
So, there's a lot at stake, a
lot in the region realize this.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.920
And I think anyone
reports to have an interest

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:18.460 position:56%
in this larger Persianate and Turkic
world, you really have to know

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.000
about this lost era,
because it is what?

[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:22.840
The question is, did--
did these stars

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.830
and I assume you meant not just
the poets, but in general these,

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:31.660
did they leave a legacy in terms
of schools following and so forth?

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.660
Yes, they did, because this
was a highly literate culture.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:42.310
When Avicenna, Ibn Sina was a
kid, he used to go to book stalls

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:47.600
in Samarkand and Bukhara

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.770
and he describes what he
bought there and the prices.

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.470
They were cheap and available.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:59.130
And then later, he-- as a
young guy who'd read any--

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:04.550
every book going on
medicine, the leader of--

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:09.780
the prince of the Samanids

all the orthodox doctors failed

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.410
and so they called this young
teenager and, can you do anything?

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:18.330
He cured the guy.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:24.080
The result was, that he-- the king
asked him, "What would you like?

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.270
Name it." And he said, "I'd
like access to your library."

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:31.790
And he describes his library
which is phenomenal, you know,

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:34.820
rooms devoted to each
subject and so on.

In other words, the book which you--

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:44.100
to which this institution is
dedicated became the vehicle

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:49.200
for a memory for schools, for
successors not just there,

all the way to the west of Europe.

So, it was the written word.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:52:03.780
And by the way, there, we think
of, you know, of talking a lot

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:07.920
about the influences
of big culture zones,

that the Ghazali's
contributions writing about faith.

are rightly respected

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.610
and regarded very highly today.

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:44.600
However, that's an older Ghazali.

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:50.300
Ghazali that I'm talking about
was the young full of himself,

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:53.690
just 10-yeared professor,
if you will,

00:53:53.690 --> 00:54:01.900
who gave the great popular
lecture who really thrived

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:07.890
on giving the intellectual
champs of his day a little hell.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:14.760
And eventually, what happened
to him is that the caliph

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:22.880
who had supported him falls and
he loses his support system.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:27.430
And lacking in supports, he's
literally out of the job.

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:33.090
He ends up then putting on a
Soviet wool overcoat and hiking off

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:36.120
to the Middle East where he
spent the rest of his life.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:39.480
Now, at that phase of
his life, you know,

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:45.080
after he'd done all this damage,
is when he wrote about faith.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:50.290
And it is those writings to which
you refer ended as those writings

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:55.820
which weren't his very,
very high noble name

00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.510

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:12.930
Yeah. He lost his patronage but
he is very blunt about it himself.

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:16.990
He had what we would call
a nervous breakdown, right?

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:19.170
It's totally clear.

an important question.

You know that he is in response

if you don't know history
or bound to repeat it.

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:25.080
And I think that's more or less
true, but in this case, you know,

if you approach not a country by the
whole group of countries as somehow,

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.140
Well, you know that's that
happens to be clinically true.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:48.400
It misses about nine tenths
of what you should be getting.

The Russians by the
way and Soviet times,

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:11.610
I have to say there were wonderful
scholars working in the USSR,

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:16.400
a high percentage of
them being Jewish.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.740
People who probably
found in this the world

00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.890

They did absolutely great research,
not on the philosophical level

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:33.670
but in getting the text figuring
out what happen, the archaeology.

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:38.190
I respect these people very highly

gravely weakened today.

the question if you didn't

what's the evidence for your claim

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.960
that this history is
being rediscovered?

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.260
It's a good question.

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:40.370
And it is asked by someone
who spent time in Balkh

and that Northern Afghanistan.

Here I would say this that every new
country creates or finds a history.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.120
You know, Uzbekistan for
example seized on Tamerlane,

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:06.790
not my idea of a great
humanitarian, but he did do some--

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:09.660
patronize some very
serious cultural activity.

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.960
It must be sad.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.390
And his successors really did.

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:16.490
The Kargas focused on manas.

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:22.700
This was president [inaudible]

which historical origins, but
this became the defining text

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.120
for this new country.

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.130
And this is more or less
what happens everywhere.

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:39.850
But what happened in
the second wave,

00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:45.160

in a very narrow sense.

against a neighbor.

00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:02.040
This is a sort-- this is running
the flag up of certain identity.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.480
And so, that has been successful.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.580
None of these countries
has collapse, disappeared.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:13.940
They are functioning states
and various degrees of success

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:17.090
and wealth, but that's--
they are there.

As you become more comfortable in
yourself, you're going to survive

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:07.170
as a state, you can
start looking around,

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:09.360
and at that the leadership level.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.270
Let me just report
to you since you ask

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.790
for concrete examples
perfectly closes

01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:17.410

ball is this story.

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:18.860
I'll give you two.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:27.350
One is the-- that the president
of Uzbekistan is Karimov,

01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:30.790
a couple of years ago
held a conference that was

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:34.000
on exactly what I was
talking about today.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.470
It was held in Samarkand.

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:38.770
He had hundreds of people
there from 40 countries.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:41.320
They were learned scholars,
political people,

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.870
you name it, a whole
diplomatic core.

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:49.860
Fifteen years before that,
he or any other leader

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:53.330
of the region would have
been talking about the guy

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:56.360
from his country as ours.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.860
In other words, he
would have referred

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.810
to our Bin-Sina or our Biruni.

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:09.130
At this conference, everyone who is
referring to our in the big sense

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:11.710
and they don't-- they were
all going out of their way

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:15.570
to say, our common heritage.

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:20.810
Second example, if you go to
downtown, Ashgabat in Turkmenistan,

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:26.970

this is a complex society,

well known what they're doing today.

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:35.920
But there is a park right downtown.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:42.060 position:56%
And the president, Berdimuhamedow
took two city blocks, combined them,

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:47.730 position:56%
tore down all the buildings and then
built a beautiful-- brought in--

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:52.350
built a beautiful marble
water course down the middle.

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:55.530
Then they planted beautiful
trees on each side, very big,

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:59.310
it must have been very
expensive moving such big tree.

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:03.610 position:56%
And then between the trees and the
watercourse on both sides where all,

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:07.100
everyone that I've mentioned
today, plus a lot of others,

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:13.190
and they're all four
meter high statues

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:18.400
and I was there and
I was shown this.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.350
And after seeing it,
I have an opportunity

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:23.050
to speak with the president.

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:25.850
I said this is-- this is wonderful.

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:31.120
And then-- and rather
impolite question, I said,

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.640
you do realize these
aren't all Turkmen.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.650

of course, we know that.

01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:43.750
But they are our common heritage.

hear everywhere.

That's why, Ashraf Ghani is on it.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:56.290
That's why the former head of
the governor of the national bank
