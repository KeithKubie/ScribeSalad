00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.540
I really hope you've enjoyed learning about how to

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.380
acquire personal genetic information in this lesson, and put it

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.480
to use. Let's see if we can summarize some of

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.850
these concepts into six main points. Point one, the decision

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.040
to acquire personal genetic information in the first place,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.650
usually involves considerations of how that information can be used,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.650
not just by you, but also by other people. Point

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.610
two. After consenting, a personal genome can be extracted, amplified,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.640
and analyzed using nothing more than

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.700
a saliva sample. Point three. Ancestry information

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.390
can be obtained generally or more

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.080
specifically about the paternal and materal lines.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.240
Point four. Family connections can be

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.500
inferred by comparing SNV compositions of related

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.500
individuals. Point five, individual SNVs can

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.400
reveal information about individual traits, inherited conditions,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.410
and even particular responses to drugs. And point six, risk for

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.560
complex traits is usually evaluated by assessing multiple SNVs.
