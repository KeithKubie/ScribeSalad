00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.139
With a tidal wave of hype, director Rian Johnson
and the team at Lucasfilm opened the flood

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.110
gates when they revealed that the 8th entry
in the Star Wars episodic films would be called

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.110
“the last jedi”.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.170
But just who is the last jedi?

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.880
The straight forward, to the point title is
actually one of the more vague titles the

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.390
space opera has had, allowing for plenty of
speculation to go around.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.170
Here are Screenrant’s 5 crazy star wars
theories about “the last jedi”.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.210
Have a suggestion of your own?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.710
Let us know in the comments and give us a
like if you were blown away by some of these

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.840
theories!

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.930
Obvious spoilers for The force awakens!

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.200
Luke and Kylo Ren
Betcha didn’t see that one coming.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.440
But it’s true; the plural form of “jedi”
is still “jedi”, thus making it totally

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.010
possible that the title can be about two or
more different beings.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.619
With its ominous red color pallet, “the
last jedi” may very well deal heavily on

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:59.010
one of the last jedi luke himself trained,
that being the fallen jedi padawan Ben Solo,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.670
also known as Kylo Ren.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.890
Dealing with the reality of murdering his
own father may have taken his toll on the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.920
master of the knights of ren and adam driver
has stated that the film will further explore

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.260
the characters humanity.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.640
Since Luke and Kylo are technically the last
two alive that have formal jedi training and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:22.650
are family, having the film deal heavily with
these two characters seems more than likely.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.930
Just Luke
The obvious choice would be that this film

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.060
will be focused heavily on Luke Skywalker.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.660
Referred to as “the last jedi” on multiple
occasions, including from master yoda himself

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.490
stating “when gone I am, the last of the
jedi you will be” and from supreme leader

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.520
snoke himself when he says “he droid will
soon be delivered to the Resistance, leading

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.090
them to the last Jedi.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.090
If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise”.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.170
Luke is finally referred to as the last jedi
in the opening crawl of the force awakens.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.170
Being almost absent from the force awakens
yet having the plot be so focused on the missing

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.310
jedi, we should not be surprised if the film
deals heavily with Luke’s demons and motivations

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.770
in a world where his own nephew has massacred
his jedi academy, bringing to ruins the dying

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.300
with of yoda.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.640
Luke and Rey
Kylo ren said it himself; she is strong with

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.440
the force.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.580
And while that may be so, Rey still has no
formal jedi training (or sith training while

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.620
we’re being specific).

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.450
Despite his failure, Luke may find it in himself
to once again pick up his saber and teach

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.569
what he has leaned, passing it down to another.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.420
Rey just so happens to have the lightsaber
that belonged to his father, which basically

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.840
demands instant training.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200
The film may explore their relationship and
the training that they will possibly undertake,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.060
thus entering rey into the formal order of
jedi (population, 2).

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.310
The two of them would thus make the last two
jedi alive and the beginning of the next rebirth

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.450
to counteract snoke and the first order.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.280
The force is calling to her after all.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.270
Just Rey
What if the title is being extra literal?

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.780
What if luke decides to train rey different
than all the rest that have come before her;

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.970
changing the rules up and the foundations
of the jedi academy?

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.250
Would she still be a jedi?

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.420
Unlikely, as she would become something else
altogether, a new identity with a new name,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.540
thus rending luke the last of his kind.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.690
This would be further personified if luke
should meet his demise in episode 8 or episode

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.030
9.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.860
Someone from the past or an outside agent
The galaxy is a vast place, filled with plenty

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.860
of people.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.000
Odds are, there are some force users out there.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.580
What if the last jedi pertains to someone
we haven’t met before?

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.250
Maybe there is another survivor from the academy
or someone who is tied to rey’s family that

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.250
we haven’t met before.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.349
Shockingly enough, the possibility of supreme
leader snoke being a jedi isn’t impossible

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.349
either.

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.500
More interesting though is taking the title
literally: the last jedi.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.569
Who were the last jedi?

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.330
Well the last to die would be yoda, obi wan
Kenobi and Anakin skywalker.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.459
If rey turns out to be a Kenobi or skywalker,
having them appear as force ghosts would play

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.530
into the title and be a welcome connection
to the prequel era films.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.310
The last jedi falls nicely into Anakin’s
redemption as well and during the unveiling

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.190
of the title, Lucasfilm stated that “the
last jedi” would be the next chapter of

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.240
the skywalker saga”.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240
So there you have it!

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.959
Those are our crazy theories as to who the
last jedi could be.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.129
Who do you think it could be?

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.129
Is it one person?

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.129
Two?

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.129
What are your theories?
