MILENA NIKOLIC:
Thank you, Shannon.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.530
Hi, I'm Milena.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.650
I'm an engineering
manager on Google Play.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.140
I lead distribution
and developer

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.160
console platform teams.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.900
I'm here to talk to
you about how you can

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.520
launch Smart on Google Play.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.020
So Ellie did a great
overview of how

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.757
you can develop Smart, and do
well while you are developing.

00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.340
I'm here to also
tell you a little bit

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.820
about what you do when you come
to launching on Google Play.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.790
More specifically, I want to
talk about rapid iteration,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.490
and how you can iterate
your app to higher quality

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.620
and to a better market fit
using some of the tools

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.010
that we provide in Google
Play Developer Console.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.730
I'm also going to talk about
how you can analyze your app,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.820
how you can experiment
with various things--

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.150
both about your app and about
your store listing-- how you

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.300
can optimize a number of
different things, how you can

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.670
localize, go globally,
and in general just

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.090
kind of improve performance
of your app in the Google Play

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.082
Store.

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:53.040
We're also going to talk
a little bit about how

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.070
you can really listen and hear
what users are telling you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.000
about your app.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And then how you can
interact with them

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.325
by addressing their feedback.

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:02.700
And then we're
very briefly going

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.991
to touch on how you
can monitor-- how

00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:06.240
you can do all this on the go.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.614
And especially how you can
monitor the status of your app

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:09.840
on the go.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.620
So let's start with
launching and iterating.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.030
I wanted to start
with this quote

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.680
we got from Michael Ritter,
the SVP of development at SGN.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.210
So they shared his
feedback with us,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.260
why they launched "Genies
and Gems" on Android first.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.810
Basically they told
us that because they

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.970
can iterate very
fast in Google Play--

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.480
because the publishing
delays are very low

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.510
and publishing is
very quick-- they

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.840
were able to achieve very
significant business outcomes.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.180
There is more of a quote.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.660
SGNs are very heavy
users of beta testing,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.430
of store listening
experiments-- a number

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.310
of different iterations tools
and experimentation tools

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.640
that I'll keep referring
to in this talk.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.070
But the interesting
thing was also

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.720
that they took a number of
findings from their insights

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.610
from experimenting
using our tools,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.150
and then were also able to
apply them to other platforms.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.199
Which is a very efficient
way of doing business.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.360
OK so as I go
through this talk, I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.540
will be referring to various
different stages of launching.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.150
And I suspect many of you
have done this before.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.660
You will you have went
through these steps.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.160
The first one would
be beta testing.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.750
So that's when you have kind
of the core flow of your app.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.702
The core idea of
what you want to do,

00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:29.910
but you're still not ready
to go very widely with it.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.520
You want to try it out with
a few friends, family, maybe

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.010
employees of your company.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.490
And have some sort of
narrow, narrow audience.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.400
The second step would
be soft launching.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.620
So this is when you
actually want to expose,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.100
you want users to get
their hands on your app.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.500
They want them to
try a few things.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.435
You want them to
actually try to use it

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:49.920
so you can measure some KPIs.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.870
Like are users
returning to your app,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.720
how are daily active users,
how does retention look.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.480
How are these basic KPIs
looking about your app.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.880
At some point you will--
when all of those numbers

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.820
look really good, when users
are spending money or spending

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.452
time within your app--
you will want to launch.

00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:10.410
We will also talk about
what are the tools that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.839
are helpful at that point.

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.130
And then we'll also talk
about what happens after that.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.990
After the initial
launch you still

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.389
want to keep going in the app.

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.930
You want to keep
adding new features,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.090
you want to keep
making it better.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.322
And that basically kicks
off this whole cycle again

00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:25.530
of when you're considering
new features that you want

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.390
to beta test, that you
want a soft launch,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.450
and eventually launch and so on.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.500
OK, I'll start with
beta testing first.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500
More than 60% of the top
1,000 apps on Google Play

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.420
are running a beta
test right now.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.220
This has been a very,
very popular tool.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.690
We have heard really
great feedback

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.990
from developers about it.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.240
You can run, as I
mentioned, closed beta test

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.880
with a very limited audience.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.000
You can run open beta test with
a much wider audience where

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.620
it can get much more feedback.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.660
I will not go into
details about how

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.260
each one of these work, what are
the different things about it,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.380
what are the things
that are the same.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.270
I will be doing office
hours later here today

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.976
and I'll be here
for all the days.

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:09.600
So if you have any
questions about that

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.570
I am more than happy to answer.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.655
However, one thing that
I do want to talk about

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:15.030
is some of the
improvements we've

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.160
made to the beta testing in
the last couple of months.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.400
One of those was
at I/O this year,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.290
we've allowed users
to start opting

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.910
in to apps with open betas
from the Play Store itself.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.420
So users can now discover
apps with open beta programs,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.900
and they can opt in directly
from the Play Store.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.480
This has proved to be that
very step that kind of removes

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.540
the churn of users
joining your beta test.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.730
So many apps have
told us that they've

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.020
got 10x larger beta programs
as a consequence of making

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.400
this change.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.760
Beta testing in that sense
becomes a very powerful

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.770
soft launch tool
where you can actually

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.150
get a meaningful number of users
using your app while it's still

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.570
in development.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.200
And you can actually
get relevant KPIs.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.210
You can work on
optimizing those KPIs

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.550
and really making them better.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.592
So at the point when you launch
fully you're really ready.

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:17.050
Which is exactly
what we recommend.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.425
We recommend if
you haven't tried

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:20.760
this we recommend you
try running an open beta

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.000
and getting users feedback
and really, really [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.620
and working on it.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.520
It does help you get to
a higher quality build.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.960
It helps you get better
product market fit,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.570
and it helps you
fine tune your KPIs.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.690
All the metrics that you
care about about your app

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.374
or your game.

00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:41.040
One more thing that
we launched recently

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.970
is private feedback
from your beta testers.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.890
Again, beta testers can
submit feedback directly

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.470
from the Play Store front.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.760
However, don't worry, no
one else gets to see this.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.210
It's just for you, you can
see it in Developer Console.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.946
And these reviews don't
affect your average rating.

00:05:55.946 --> 00:05:57.570
So it's a very safe
environment for you

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.980
to try out different things.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.480
It's OK if not everything works.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.180
It's better that you find out
about that during the beta test

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.020
than once you're launched
to everyone in production.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.830
And another recent addition
to the beta testing program

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.460
is Early Access.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.520
So this is a new
collection, which we are now

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.640
showing to users in a Play
Store Front, which features

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.400
interesting apps and games
that are still in development,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.670
but that are running
an open beta that test.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.830
Users can find them,
discover them there.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.870
And then again,
this is another way

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.000
that's bringing people
who are interested--

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
especially those users
who are early adopters.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.500
Who do want to try new things.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.270
Who do want to be the first
ones to discover an app

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.500
and to use it.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.280
They're the ones whose
feedback you can basically

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.250
get by being part of the
Early Access program.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.817
If you do have an app coming out
soon, please do reach out to us

00:06:50.817 --> 00:06:53.400
and mention that you would like
to be part of the Early Access

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.900
program.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.154
We are actively
onboarding apps to it.

00:06:59.154 --> 00:07:01.320
There are a couple of-- I
will not go into details--

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.590
but developers that have
been part of the Early Access

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.030
program so far
have shared really,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.520
really good feedback with us.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.470
They've told us that it really
helps them improve the quality.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.920
Again, kind of
interate, try out a lot

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.090
of things in a very
nice and quick way.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.830
And just a couple of notes.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.730
My favorite feedback
was from Readfeed,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.560
which is an online
book club which

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.730
was part of the first batch
of apps that were part

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.710
of the Early Access program.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.320
So they've told us that
being part of Early Access

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.070
help them identify new markets.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.220
So what are the different
things their app

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.060
could be doing to really
be useful for more users.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.915
They told us that they
were able to identify

00:07:43.915 --> 00:07:46.290
a number of different bugs,
a number of different feature

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.450
requests that users really want.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.400
In addition they
were able to A/B test

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.290
various different
things within their app

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.030
before they launched
openly to everyone.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.630
And then finally, they was
able to build a community

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.070
of very passionate users.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.349
These early adopters
are users-- they

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:03.640
are the promoters for your app.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.470
They are the community that
can really create a lot of buzz

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.180
about your app.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.740
So this is another benefit
you can get from this.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.770
And if all this wasn't
enough to convince you

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.070
that soft launching is a
really good thing to try out,

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.530
there are a few more things.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.280
Sometimes we hear
feedback from developers

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.720
who say that they would
rather keep it close and tight

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.960
and then just do
a big bang launch.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.600
Keep in mind that you
only get one chance

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.580
to make a first impression
with your users.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.669
You obviously want to make
the right first impression.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.320
And the other thing is
if you try out your app

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.600
just with ten or 15 users
before you actually launch it,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.430
you risk those users,
being your friends,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.830
maybe not being honest.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.550
Or not telling you a lot
of the data driven stuff

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.789
of like how often they
use your app, how often

00:08:55.789 --> 00:08:57.330
they're returning
to it and all that.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.704
So definitely consider something
that's a little bit more

00:08:59.704 --> 00:09:05.760
scaled before you actually
launch openly to everyone.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.100
OK a couple of tips
on how to soft launch.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.220
Closed beta would be
the first thing to do.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.200
You want a smaller,
limited set of people.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.200
You want to test all of the
proof of concept, the core game

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.100
mechanics, or the
core app flows,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.810
there are important to you.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.070
Basic user experience.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.190
Obviously want to catch
the crudest of crashes.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.950
And you want to get some open
ended feedback from your users.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.130
As a second stage, consider
a soft launch that's

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.290
still kind of a bit limited.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.320
You can do this limiting
by either choosing

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.790
a subset of countries, perhaps
the ones that have fewer users.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.832
We hear very often that
developers do soft launch

00:09:47.832 --> 00:09:50.040
in New Zealand, which is
kind of a good approximation

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.280
for big markets
like US or Europe.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.950
But its still kind of
smaller in the size.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.510
Or you can limit
based on the number

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.032
of devices, or languages,
or any different ways.

00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:02.490
At that point you
can already start

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.240
to track the metrics
that you get.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.360
So at this point you can
already start looking

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.770
at the actual data coming in.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.269
And rather than trusting people
to write a couple of lines

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:12.060
of how they like your
app, you can actually

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.650
see are they using
it twice a day,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.960
are they using it
for an hour a day.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.332
Those are very useful signals.

00:10:17.332 --> 00:10:19.290
And then as the final
stages before you launch,

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.980
you want to consider going open
beta to all the actual markets

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.430
where you're looking
to launch externally.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.010
At this point, you should be
able to get sufficient data

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.580
to really make sure that
your game economy is working,

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.060
or that users are
using your app in a way

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.050
that you would like them to use.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.710
OK so let's slot
in these two things

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.620
that we talked about into our
app lifecycle, or our launch

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.530
lifecycle.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.950
So beta testing
and Early Access.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.470
It's important to keep in
mind that they are useful all

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.570
throughout of your life cycle.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.490
You want to use
them to soft launch,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.890
you want to use them as your
launching for the first time

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:00.680
to everyone.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.210
And then you want
to keep using them

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.450
after that to keep iterating
on all the new features

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.712
that you're building, and
to keep improving your app.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.070
OK let's talk a
little bit about how

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.350
you can improve the quality
of your app early on.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.710
Ellie has talked about
Firebase Test Lab,

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.592
so I'm going to keep
building on top of this.

00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:24.050
I'm going to talk
a little bit more

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.030
about the pre-launch report.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.240
Pre-launch report is powered
by Firebase Test Lab,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.480
so all of the APKs that get
uploaded to alpha and beta

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.240
channel in Developer
Console automatically

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.490
get sent to Firebase Test Lab.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.980
And we run a number of
monkey tests on them.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.330
We try testing out
various different things.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.640
And then based on that we
generate a report which

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.190
is shared with you within
an hour of you uploading

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.650
those APKs to Google
Play Developer Console.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.080
The first thing that you want
to check out in the report

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.730
are crashes.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.400
We will run the tests on a
couple of tens of devices.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.550
This is generally
more than you can--

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.800
this probably more than
you can do yourself

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.810
while you're developing
all the time.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.360
So it's quite useful it's
automatic, it's free,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.790
so is a very nice cheap way
to detect these crashes early.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.030
In particular, you do want to
catch these crashes before they

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.770
turn into one star reviews
everyone knows about them.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.820
For every crash report, you will
be able to see a stack trace,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.280
you'll be able to see
device metadata, and then

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.494
some kind of other metadata
about run and so on.

00:12:33.494 --> 00:12:35.660
The other thing that's part
of the pre-launch report

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.000
are screenshots.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.250
So as we do these monkey
tests on your APKs,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.102
we take screenshots
all along the way,

00:12:44.102 --> 00:12:45.560
and then we share
these screenshots

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.630
with you in Google Play
Developver Console.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.070
This comes in
pretty handy to see

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.180
how your app looks on various
different device screen sizes

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.540
or DPI's or anything like that.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.370
It also comes in
pretty handy, as you

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.010
can see in the highlighted
screen shot, for testing out

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.770
we try testing out a couple
of different languages.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.340
And for example in
this screen shot

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.430
you can see that the German
translations are too long

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.830
and they make the UI kind
of overflow a little bit.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.400
So you know again you want to
catch this before the app is

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.920
actually launched.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.060
And then finally, we also share
security alerts about the APKs

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.800
that you just uploaded.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.890
Obviously I know no one
here would upload security

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.920
vulnerability on purpose,
but it does happen sometimes

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.580
by mistake.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.310
It also does happen if
you pull in a third party

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.460
SDK, for example ads
or analytics library.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.170
These sometimes come in with
security vulnerabilities.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.300
So again you want to find
out about this sooner

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.030
rather than later.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.580
And a quote we got
from Flinc, who

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.270
were really happy with the
pre-launch report so far.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.890
They're saying
that it helps them

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.985
test on way more devices
than they could afford

00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:57.276
if they were to do it manually.

00:14:00.315 --> 00:14:01.940
OK now let's look at
pre-launch report.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.160
Again, just like beta
testing and Early Access,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.010
it's sort of useful all
throughout your launch

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.940
lifecycle.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.610
You want to try it early on.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.010
It's never too early to
start getting this feedback.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.660
You want to use it
as you're launching,

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.960
and you want to use it
once your app is alive.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.210
Cool, let's talk a little bit
about analyzing, experimenting,

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.940
and optimizing.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.740
The first rule that
I want to talk about

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.980
is user acquisition report.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.140
User acquisition report
is a conversion funnel

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.030
that shows you how many
visitors to your store listing

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.060
you're getting,
how many of those

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.790
are turning into installers,
and then how many of those

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.860
are actually buying
something within your app,

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.590
and eventually
becoming repeat buyers.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.240
You can also break
down this report

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.130
based on the acquisition source.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.540
So whether this is
organic traffic that

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.070
came through the Play Store,
or whether this is paid traffic

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.695
that came through ads
or something like that.

00:14:58.695 --> 00:15:01.070
As of fairly recently you can
also break down this report

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.530
by country so you can
see how your conver--

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.900
whether, for example, your
localizations are not great,

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.680
and you are not converting that
well in Asia compared to Europe

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.660
and so on.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.510
And once you have this
data, obviously you'll

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.680
want to optimize.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.870
Just having the data for its
own sake is not very useful.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.590
The tool that fits in really
well with user acquisition

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.120
report and that will help you
optimize this kind of very

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.890
top of the funnel--
this kind of drop off

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.330
between number of
visitors and installers--

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.320
are store listening experiments.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.650
This has been another tool
that has been very, very

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.540
successful so far.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.780
Developers have told us
that they really like it.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.130
Precisely because
when you optimize

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.490
the top of your funnel, you
make the whole funnel wider.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.010
And basically it's more likely
that more users will eventually

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.260
also turn to buyers, and to
repeat buyers, and so on.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.650
More than 70% the part of
our top developers use store

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.610
listing experiment.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.180
It's a great number,
and I don't think

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.390
it's surprising given that
it's bringing results.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.140
It's bringing you
better conversion rates,

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.880
and it's bringing
you more installers,

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.250
and that's precisely
what you want.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.920
The other thing is
obviously the tool is free.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.450
The only thing that you need
is a designer or a copywriter.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.427
So someone who can
can actually work

00:16:21.427 --> 00:16:23.260
with trying to optimize
your store listening

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.690
and trying to convert
more users for you.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.890
I'm going to give you a lot of
examples about store listing

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:30.730
experiments.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.320
I feel that's the best way to
show you how developers are

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.130
actually using it, to
give you ideas of what's

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.360
useful to try out and to test.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.750
To start with,
here are Flaregames

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:49.740
who have run with a single icon
test for their "Royal Revolt

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.380
2."

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.760
They have managed to increase
user acquisition rate by 30%.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.970
So this was a pretty good.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.920
From one test being able to
increase number of installers

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.340
by that much.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.150
Erepublik Public Lab is a
little bit on the other side.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.089
For launch of "Age
of Lords" they

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.609
have run a string of
different experiments.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.740
And they have ranged
from plus 5% to plus 29%.

00:17:15.153 --> 00:17:17.069
Overall improvements to
their acquisition rate

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.010
were also pretty high.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.190
That was really good.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.510
Expedia is another
interesting example.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.329
You would think Expedia is
a well-established brand

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:30.100
at this point, and that
experimenting with their assets

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.420
wouldn't be worth it.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.050
That turned out
not to be the case.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:37.600
They have managed to get their
global install rate are by 10%

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.130
by optimizing their assets.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.830
So it's worth thinking
that if Expedia,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.590
a well-established brand,
can do this then apps that

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.010
are very early in their life
cycle can do even better.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.490
You can go with
the bolder changes,

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:56.990
you can try even more things,
and get even better results.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.220
One of my favorites,
Spry Fox's Alphabear.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.740
As you can see they have a
very unique visual style.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.730
Very, very interesting, creative
vision for what they wanted to

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.330
do.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.250
And yet they were able
to kind of experiment

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.330
with different icon types.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.470
Icon is particularly
big for games.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.630
Experimenting with
different types for games

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.890
is a really big thing.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.860
They started with the
one on the far left.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.820
And it turned out that
the one on the far right

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.450
is actually
converting 18% better.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.900
So you know it's
worth experimenting

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.830
with a few of these
different ones.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.050
Instacart had a
really great success

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.570
with experimenting with
their short description.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.990
So just by changing
their short description

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:48.050
they managed to increase
their conversion rate by 14%.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.300
And what we generally
found to work really well

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.650
is short and to the
point short descriptions

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.560
which explain the value
proposition of your app

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.630
in the shortest possible way.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:05.840
So this is what we've seen
work very well consistently.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.790
And Angry Birds went
to town with it.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.810
They really went on the
story listening experiment's

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.670
bandwagon.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.850
And they were testing for
Angry Birds "POP!" launch.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.550
They were testing the icon
over, and over, and over again.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.540
It keeps going.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.910
Basically they were running
test, after test, after test.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.920
And with each one they
were choosing a winner

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.450
and then trying out
even more variance.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.960
I guess their designers were
having a lot of fun with this.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.740
Until they ended up
with the one that

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.860
was in double-digit increase
compared to where they started.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.260
So it's worth not
just testing once.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.680
It's worth keeping the
iterations going and just

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.050
really keeping this
moving because there

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:53.260
seems to always be some
gains to be had in this area.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.240
And the final one, I promise
this is the last example.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.700
This is Mixi.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.450
This one is interesting
because Mixi

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.650
is a very, very big
Japanese developer

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.920
but they were looking
to go into US.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.700
They wanted to do to bring their
"Monster Strike" game into US.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.390
However, they had a feeling
that the local taste of people

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.180
in the US would be different
to the local taste of people

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.997
in Japan.

00:20:16.997 --> 00:20:18.830
So they wanted to make
sure that they really

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:23.820
match the local taste as
expressed in the store listing.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.310
So they started iterating
on the featured graphic

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.320
and on the video.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.240
Then went on to
iterate on the screen

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.830
shots, on the description,
and eventually on the icon.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.650
Over the scope of
a couple of months,

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.340
they had managed to increase
their conversion rate by 68%.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.070
By running of test after test
in a very scientific, very

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.490
methodical way,
very persistent way.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:51.400
Two main takeaways from this
would be A, keep going at it.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.370
Keep making changes
and keep testing.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.730
And the other one will be yes,
users in different countries

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.430
have very different tastes.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.140
Very different local flavor.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.280
So your store listing
in Asia will probably

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.590
end up looking much
different, or should end up

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.490
looking much different, to
your store listing in Europe.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.580
OK, a couple of best practices.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.950
Test in multiple languages.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.410
This is exactly what I
was telling you just now.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:25.240
So it's worth trying
out different things

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.680
for different languages.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.390
And, as of earlier
this year, you

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.520
can run multiple
tests in parallel,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.480
in different languages.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.400
So this can all be very
easy and efficient.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:34.960
Iterate.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.550
Keep at it.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.060
If it looks like there is always
a next improvement to be had,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.270
focus on one thing at a time.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.390
Don't do icon and description
tests at the same time

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.970
because it's going to be hard
to know what actually worked.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.040
So choose to optimize
the icon first

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.580
and then optimize
screenshots, or so on.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.560
Try to come up with
some sort of hypothesis.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.143
This is another thing
that we've heard

00:21:58.143 --> 00:22:01.030
is-- do feel like
your icon is too busy,

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.070
or do you feel your
colors are too pale

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.534
or just-- if you
can try to come up

00:22:04.534 --> 00:22:05.950
with some sort of
hypothesis, then

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.890
you can possibly
optimize in a better

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.000
way than just randomly trying
out different text or graphics.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.750
Give it some time.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.070
It takes time to reach
statistical significance

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.945
with these results.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.670
We pay a lot of
attention to tell you

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.300
when we think the experiment
is done and ready.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.380
But in general just giving
it more time is going to be--

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.570
you will be more
sure that it's going

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.760
to yield actual, good results.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.990
And finally be bold.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.450
Especially if you're early
in your startup's life,

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.520
try out a lot of
different things.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.710
It's harmless and it's
cheap, so it's worth

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.240
playing around with a lot of
different visual identities.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.510
OK and the last thing
related to localizing.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.060
Earlier this year we've also
launched pricing templates.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.570
Pricing templates allow
you to manage the pricing

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.840
for your entire app and
in a product catalog.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.000
In a bulk way.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.244
In a very easy, bulk way.

00:23:02.244 --> 00:23:03.910
So if you haven't
switched to them yet--

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.390
many developers have-- but
if you haven't switched

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.098
to them yet, we
definitely recommend them

00:23:07.098 --> 00:23:09.520
as a very efficient, bulk
pricing management tool.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.820
However on top of that, when
we added pricing templates

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.300
we also added smart,
localized, price rounding.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.270
So for example, if you
input your default price

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:23.430
and auto-convert to
all the 70 markets

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.840
to which Google Play now
sells, using the latest

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.800
the conversion rates we
will do the smart rounding.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.340
So for example you don't end
up with 0.73 euros price,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.080
you end up with 0.99.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.530
Or you don't end up
with 182 Japanese yen,

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.200
we would round that
to 200 Japanese yen.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.180
We came up with these smart,
locally relevant pricing

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.620
rounding rules.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:53.272
So make sure you refresh
your prices to pick those up.

00:23:53.272 --> 00:23:54.730
Your store listing
and your catalog

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.340
will look more professional
to users in those countries,

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.020
and it will also
look more relevant

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.896
for their local culture.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.880
Let's slot a couple of these
tools in our life cycle

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.880
as well.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.257
User aqcuisition tool-- sorry,
user acquisition reports

00:24:10.257 --> 00:24:11.840
store listing
experiments, and pricing

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.550
templates-- all only valid
once you've fully launched.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.760
These are the tools that require
you to have a lot of data

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.440
or certain amount of data
before you can work with them.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.620
So you can only use
them once you launch

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.570
and once you keep
iterating on your app

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.280
once it's fully launched.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.300
OK let's talk a little
bit about listening

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.340
to what your users are
really telling you,

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.280
and about interacting
with your users.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.590
We've touched very briefly
on the private feedback

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.140
in the first section--
beta testing--

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.850
but let's say now
you're launched,

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.809
you're out to
everyone, and there

00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:52.100
is a lot of feedback coming in.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.260
What do you do with
all those feedback?

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.970
But before that, let me just
refer to two things that

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.350
may not be entirely obvious.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.830
As you work on your app
quality, especially this quality

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.580
is reflected through your
average rating score,

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.280
you will actually also be
increasing your revenue.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.690
This may not be
entirely obvious,

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.064
but the feedback we've heard
from a number of developers,

00:25:14.064 --> 00:25:15.860
and the recent one
is from GameVille,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.990
is that by bringing their app
from 3.3 stars to 4.1 stars

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.720
they've also increased
their revenue by 160%.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.400
I mean this is
pretty good stuff.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.830
So it's worth trying out.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.710
The other thing that
totally may not be obvious,

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.500
is that by working
on your quality

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.280
through improving
the average rating,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.890
you're actually also
working on your velocity.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:41.590
Aviary shared very interesting
feedback with us recently.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.330
What they started doing is
they start a staged rollout,

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.180
and then they start getting
a lot of feedback from users.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.100
And they analyze
this feedback, which

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.670
allows them to cut their release
cycle to two to three weeks,

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.350
which they weren't
able to do before,

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.970
or they're not able to
do on other platforms.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:02.120
So just by really shifting
your cycle-- your development

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.100
cycle-- to make addressing
reviews a core part of it,

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.490
you can osing increase your
velocity and ship faster.

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:16.590
In the past year we've
done a lot of improvements

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.720
to-- because we realize
ratings and reviews are

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.700
really important,
we've done a number

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.867
of improvements in the area.

00:26:22.867 --> 00:26:25.200
Make sure to check them out
in the Google Play Developer

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.990
Console.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:30.220
New user overhaul user ratings
section, overhaul user review

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.930
section, and a completely
new review analysis section

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.590
that I'll come back in a minute
and I'll talk a little bit more

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.220
about it.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.680
But it's definitely
worth checking out

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.440
all the improvements
that are there.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.930
Another thing that I'll
come back to a little bit

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:46.970
later is the new mobile--
the new Google Play Developer

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.226
Console mobile app
which we've launched.

00:26:49.226 --> 00:26:51.100
But in this case I just
want to talk about it

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.930
very briefly in terms of how
it can help you manage customer

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.620
feedback and how it can help
with customer interaction

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.440
In the new mobile app obviously
you can see the latest reviews,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.410
you can see the user rating,
you can see various breakdowns

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.440
and all of that.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.400
But more importantly, you can
also interact with your users.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.360
You can reply to user reviews
directly from the app.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.540
Why that's important here is
because custom interaction

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.710
has this very important
time component.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.590
So it's important to reply
to your user feedback

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.000
in a timely fashion.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.240
And when you have Deveoper
Console App in your pocket,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.570
this now becomes much easier.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.945
You don't had to
go to your desk,

00:27:30.945 --> 00:27:33.140
and type it in properly there.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.140
The other thing that we've
launched with the app

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.570
is notifications.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:43.210
So you can get notified when
users change their review

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:46.540
after your reply, or when
they post one star reviews,

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.970
or anything like
that you will really

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.810
like to react in a quick way.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.990
And talking about
responding to user reviews,

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.260
this is starting
to be really big.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.260
In the past year
we had 92% growth

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.732
in the number of
developer replies.

00:28:06.925 --> 00:28:10.150
This is vastly bigger
than the organic growth

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.480
in number of apps, or organic
growth numbers of reviews

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.530
that are being posted.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.620
So developers are really
picking up this practice

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.110
and they're really
starting to reply a lot.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.220
So this is something
that's worth considering.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.540
It does lead to to
higher average rating.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.260
It does lead to users
feeling more appreciated.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:37.930
So users are almost starting
to expect now that developers

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:39.123
will reply to their reviews.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.700
OK so talking about
reviews, we've

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.630
recently launched
review analysis section.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.110
There are a couple
of different things

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.210
where we really
work hard to help

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.180
you parse all this feedback and
analyze all this feedback you

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.460
get from developers.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.170
One of those is highlights.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.470
So we extract all the
relevant snippets and phrases

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.020
that users are
mentioning in your app,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.250
and then we select them for
you in both Developer Console.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.980
We also show these in
the Play storefront

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.160
So it's worth keeping an eye
on what we're showing you

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.890
in the storefront and checking
it out in Developer Console

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.180
as well.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.690
The other thing we've launched
recently are review topics.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.690
So again we do various machine
learning and natural language

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.810
processing to extract the topics
that we think are relevant,

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.380
and again, that users are
talking about when they write

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.280
reviews for your app.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.700
So for example if you
are a language learning

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.350
app like the one
here, we would extract

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.340
all the various languages that
users are maybe asking for.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:47.940
Or if you're a car
racing game, we

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.460
might be talking about various
different things about cars

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.144
or about racing and so on.

00:29:53.144 --> 00:29:55.560
On top of that, you can actually
see how each one of those

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.090
topics-- what's the average
rating for reviews that mention

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.550
the topic, what's the
number of reviews,

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.280
and then also what is
the effect on the rating

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.950
that this topic has.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.525
This basically tells you
what is the easy area

00:30:10.525 --> 00:30:12.400
to focus on if you want
to improve something.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.270
So here, for example,
we can immediately

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.270
tell that the fact that this
language learning app doesn't

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.120
have support for
klingon is causing

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.022
like a lot of negative reviews

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.980
The other thing that we
have launched recently,

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.740
also part of review
analysis, was benchmarks.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.230
So we identified
eight characteristics

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.150
that every app has.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.330
Those eight are things
like design, speed,

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.400
stabilty, and so on.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.120
For each one of
those eight, again we

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.990
show you based on your
user reviews, what

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.260
is the average rating-- what
is the sentiment of users

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.790
with regard to this
particular benchmark.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.820
And then we also
show you how your app

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.920
compares on this particular
aspect to other similar apps.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.030
Apps in the same
category, or apps

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.980
that are in the same
monetization model,

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.910
or something like that.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.130
And then we'll show
you effect on rating.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.340
Is design a big
plus of your app,

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.570
or is speed a big
minus and so on.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.490
And then finally for
one interesting point

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.850
about the analysis.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.920
We also analyze the complete
corpus of all the ratings

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.090
and reviews on Google Play.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.010
There is a lot of them.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.750
One interesting thing
that we found out

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:26.250
is that the majority, or
50%, of all one star ratings

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.370
mention or are related
to stability and bugs.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.850
And then 65% of all
five star ratings

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.760
are related to speed,
design, or usability.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.340
So it's important
keeping in mind

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.674
what is the thing that's
actually driving the rating up,

00:31:40.674 --> 00:31:42.215
and what is the
thing that's actually

00:31:42.215 --> 00:31:43.410
driving the rating down.

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.480
What are the things that users
are really irritated with,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.310
and what are the things that
users are really happy about.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:54.390
A very brief mention for
also our new reviews API.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:58.140
If you want automated way to
fetch your reviews from Google

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.579
Play, and to reply to them,
we now have an API for that.

00:32:01.579 --> 00:32:03.870
It's only a couple of lines
of code integrated with it.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.010
Super easy.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.450
However if you would
rather not do that,

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.750
there is also out of
the box integration

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.880
with some popular
customer relationship

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.570
management tools, like Zendesk
and [INAUDIBLE] Social.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.610
So if you would like a
more integrated approach

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.140
to managing your
customer feedback,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.660
we have a way to
do that as well.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.590
OK let's lot in these two
tools as well-- reviews

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.240
analysis and review API.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.692
They're very useful,
not in this first stage

00:32:29.692 --> 00:32:32.070
as you are launching your
app for the first time,

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.860
but they become absolutely
critical at the point when

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.470
your app is live, and you're
receiving all the feedback

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.610
from users, and you want
to keep working on it

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:44.200
and keep improving your app.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.670
OK the last thing, monitoring
your app on the go.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:50.790
As I mentioned, we launched
the Play Console app at IO

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:55.740
this year and then
in the best kind

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.260
of way of doing what
we're preaching here,

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.810
we've also done a fast follower
release a couple of weeks

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.019
later.

00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:03.560
This fast follower
obviously included

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.760
a number of stability
fixes, but it also

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.350
included a number
of new features

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:11.430
that you guys told us would be
really good to have in the app.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.930
It included review
notifications,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.420
being able to manage store
listing experiments directly

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.360
from the app, being able to
increase the staged rollout

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.050
or to hold a bad staged
rollout out of your app.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.210
If you still haven't
tried yet, please do.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.050
Send us feedback.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:25.917
We're reading it.

00:33:25.917 --> 00:33:27.000
We're actually reading it.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.690
We are trying really
hard to address it,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.690
and we want to keep adding new
features to the Play Console

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.459
app.

00:33:35.459 --> 00:33:37.500
And one more mention of
another app that we have,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.590
which is Playbook for
developers, for you guys.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.470
This is the perfect place
to keep getting insights

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.820
about what's new
in Google Play--

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.780
to find out about new features,
to get the best practices,

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.770
to get tips and tricks, and
in general a lot of advice

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:56.990
on what is the best way
to succeed on Google Play.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.850
Slotting these two in, we
think both Play Console app

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:03.881
and Playbook app would be useful
all throughout your launch life

00:34:03.881 --> 00:34:04.380
cycle.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.650
So make sure you try them out.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.760
And I think that's everything
I wanted to cover today.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.420
Thank you.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:18.970
