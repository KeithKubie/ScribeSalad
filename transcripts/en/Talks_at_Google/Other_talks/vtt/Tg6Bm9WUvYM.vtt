00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.030
FRANCIS CHAN: Thank you.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.200
Wow, it is so good to be here.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.010
This is so cool.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.880
I mean, just walking in this
morning and seeing a few of you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.870
guys praying in here,
just praying for-- I just,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.200
I love-- what we do is we have
these house gatherings in San

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.790
Francisco, because
I just believe

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.520
there's got to be a better way
to do church where we're not

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.420
spending a fortune and
making it so professional.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.530
And so we've set up these
house churches with all people.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.420
No one gets paid.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.540
There's zero budget.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.430
All of the money
goes to the poor

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.200
or goes to reaching people
on unreached people groups.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.690
And it's an awesome thing.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.650
But it's so fun go to these
different houses in San

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.677
Francisco and just see a little
pocket of people worshipping

00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:50.760
God with all their hearts,
and go in another house

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.593
and it's like, here's
another little circle.

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:54.990
And so to walk in this
morning and see a few of you

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.400
just in prayer was like
man, this is so cool,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.520
this worship of God.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.950
And this morning I was
reading, because every day I

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.150
spend some time just alone with
God just reading the Bible.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.130
I hope you all do.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.310
Because I'm just,
I'm a skeptic, and I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.090
don't like people just
telling me what's in there.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.500
I want to read it myself.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.660
And as I've been
reading it, I'm like,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.150
no one ever talks about this or
this or this or this or this.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.900
And it's just so good to
go straight to the source.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.670
But this morning I
was reading Psalm 34

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.240
where it says, "I will
bless the Lord at all times.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.160
His praise shall
continually be in my mouth.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.290
My soul makes its
boast in the Lord.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.900
Let the humble hear and be glad.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.650
Oh magnify the Lord with me
and that us exalt his name

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.600
Together."

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600
I'm just going to bless.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080
All I want to do
is brag about him

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.570
all the time, because that's
what my soul wants to do.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.495
It just wants to brag about
him, not talk about me

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:56.370
and look what I've done,
look what I've done.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.780
It's just about man, it's just
so incredible what he's done

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.880
and what he's just kind
of blessed me with.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.100
Even in that situation
you're talking about,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.020
running into this
guy in the middle

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.080
of the street a couple years
ago, and I was scared to death.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.930
You know, it's scary.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.550
We've had people
live in our house,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.980
but there was always
people I could beat up.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.880
And it's just like wow
honey, you're on you own.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.320
It's just insane.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.510
But those things that scare
you to death, it happens.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.600
And then to see what's happened
in this guy's life since, now

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.650
he runs the whole
ministry in San Francisco.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.660
We opened a restaurant.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.710
He runs a restaurant.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.130
We opened a house for
guys coming out of prison.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.060
He runs all of that.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.390
We just opened a women's home
on Monday, and he runs that.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.180
And he's a pastor now.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.900
And this is after
12 years of prison.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.970
And that's the thing
that God loves to do,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.840
right, is take the
most unlikely candidate

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.210
and just do something amazing
so that no one can take credit

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.360
for it.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.260
But I just want to
brag about him today

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.710
because I feel like that's
what I want my life to be.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.090
My heart is to connect
people with God,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.530
not to connect them with me.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.812
You know how what's his face
gave me an introduction.

00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:20.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.940
But that's kind of good.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.000
I mean, that's his job.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.049
You just introduce
me and then go.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.340
I don't need to know your name.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.050
Just introduce me.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.150
And that's really
my job right now

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.860
is, you don't need to know me.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.369
I just want to introduce
you to someone.

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:39.910
You don't want to
spend time with me.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.570
You want to spend time with him.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.390
That's why I'm telling everyone,
get alone with this book.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.640
You don't need me.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.470
Just get alone with this book.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.660
Look what's in there and
talk to him directly,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.110
because that's what
changes your life.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.940
But this whole idea of how
to get to heaven from Silicon

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.790
Valley, the reason why I
make a statement like that

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.410
is, some of the
environments we're

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.520
in make it difficult for
us to make good decisions.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.550
For example, two months ago--
maybe not even that long,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.730
about two months ago.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.690
Maybe it was longer.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.459
Who cares?

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.570
I was at Pebble Beach.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.250
I don't play a lot of
golf, but I enjoy it.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.640
And I was invited
to a fundraiser,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.880
to speak at a fundraiser.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.130
And so I usually say
no to fundraisers.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.147
I just don't like fund
raising for people.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.355
But this was at Pebble Beach.

00:04:33.355 --> 00:04:36.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.530
And it was for a good cause.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.380
It was Children's Hunger Fund.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.680
So Children's Hunger Fund,
one of their donors sponsored

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.420
for a bunch of people
to come to Pebble Beach

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.420
to play Pebble Beach and
Spanish Bay golf course.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.040
And then at night I would
speak and talk about the poor.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.570
And so-- whoa.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.820
I don't know this was
up here and unscrewed.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.266
Thank you for being helpful.

00:05:05.287 --> 00:05:06.620
Just want to make sure nothing--

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.510
AUDIENCE: You're good.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.218
FRANCIS CHAN: --electric,
which happens--

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:11.672
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:11.672 --> 00:05:13.630
AUDIENCE: I didn't want
you to have to open it.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.290
FRANCIS CHAN: Yeah,
no, no, thank you.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.440
Thank you what's your face.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.060
OK, so perfect conditions.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.830
Pebble Beach.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.310
Those who golf, you know that's
like bucket list craziness.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.720
Front nine, first
hole, I double bogey,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.080
which is two over what
you're supposed to do,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.130
which is normal for me.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.810
Then the rest of the
front nine, I end up

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.800
with a total score of 38.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.440
So I played out
of my-- I've never

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.860
played like that in my life.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.450
The caddy even said, I've
never seen anything like this.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.100
He's been caddying
there for years.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.710
He says, "I've seen people shoot
two over on the front nine,

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.570
but not at your skill level."

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.800
He goes, "This is just
unbelievable," because he

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.930
can tell by my swing.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.810
So I just have this amazing day.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.530
And then at night I'm supposed
to talk about the poor

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.350
and needs around the world.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.940
And my mind is preoccupied with
India and some things going on.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.620
I was with my buddy Dave.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.290
And we're just talking
through these issues.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.590
And I'm going you know what,
this is like the worst place

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.360
to make a decision about how
much money to give to the poor.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.600
There's certain places
where, when I'm in India,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.760
that's when I think clearly.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.320
When I'm in Africa-- my friend
started ministering in Ethiopia

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.930
and I've traveled
there with him.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.500
When I'm there in Ethiopia,
I make completely different

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.740
decisions than when I make
them in my living room,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.430
or I make them from here.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.440
The whole point is,
my mind gets clouded.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.650
Everything's myopic.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.780
I get focused on the
here and now and this.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.360
Right now, last week, I've
been in a little bit of a funk.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.270
And my wife's like,
what's going on with you?

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.110
And I just tell her, my
mind is in Syria right now.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.290
I'm thinking about these
12 million people that

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.380
have just lost their
homes-- just like that,

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.350
boom, 12 million.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.116
And some friends
of mine-- you know,

00:07:22.116 --> 00:07:23.990
I'm trying to get some
people from our church

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.890
to go to one of their
bases, because they've

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.640
set up these [INAUDIBLE]
for these refugees

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.730
in these outlying areas
as they're heading

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.570
to Germany, this or that.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.160
And one of my friends who leads
one of the bases in this island

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.430
called Lesbos.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.780
You know it's in Greece,
or off the coast of Greece.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.870
And he says, "To give you an
idea of the scope of this,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:54.000
just our one base, on average,
every day we have people

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.190
coming in on these boats.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:01.770
On average, every day we
get between 8,000 to 10,000

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.140
people."

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:11.250
So imagine yourself on an island
and 8,000 to 10,000 people come

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.810
every day with nowhere to go.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.780
You're running for your life.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.730
And so they're just
like, we need workers.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.630
We need helpers.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.440
We need funding.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.690
And I'm just like OK, I'm
going to send as many people

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.940
as I can.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.760
Let me figure this out with you.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.150
But it's just been in
my mind because I think,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.850
OK, what type of decisions
would you make financially

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.850
if you're sitting in
that island and you

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.789
see 8,000 to 10,000
people coming off

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.280
a boat every single day,
parents with their kids

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.550
holding them just frantic,
running for their lives,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.110
and have no idea where to go?

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.360
They don't speak the language.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.680
They don't know what
to do-- every day.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.026
OK, so my decision making
there of what I want to do,

00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:00.400
what car I'm going
to drive, what

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.780
house I'm going to
live in, know where

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.480
my kids are going to educated,
just all those decisions

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.950
would be completely different
if I'm facing that every day

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.490
than if I'm in Mountain View.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.730
And that's the wrestle, right?

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.400
I mean years ago, my wife
and I, we sold everything

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:28.480
and we just went to Asia in
the slums of Mumbai in India,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.480
with our kids, just
walking through this place.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.320
We had no home anymore.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.800
And we're just at these
places where our mind's

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.750
just open to the world.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.640
And I remember my 10-year-old
at that time was just saying,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.980
"Dad, why are we leaving India?

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.104
Look at all the needs here.

00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:47.265
How can we go?"

00:09:47.265 --> 00:09:49.710
And I'm like, "Well, you
know, I promised some people

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.580
in Thailand we'd go there."

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.770
And so we went to an
orphanage in Thailand,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.890
lived there for a month.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.670
And he's like, "Well why
are we leaving here?"

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.378
I'm like, "Well,
there's people in China.

00:09:58.378 --> 00:10:00.300
I said I will go there too."

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.760
We're just going
from place to place,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.319
and each time praying
as a family, going God,

00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:06.860
is this where we're
supposed to stop?

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.830
Because I'll stop here.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.650
I'll stop wherever.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.160
Where do you want
us-- we have no home.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.140
We have nowhere to go.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.790
You know usually you
do that when you're 18,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.860
not when you've got four kids.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.910
But it was just like, God,
I want to stay focused.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.950
And I remember.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.320
I still remember,
I was in Hong Kong,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.800
and I really believed the
Lord just impressed on my mind

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.540
that I was supposed to
go back to the States.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:40.420
And I so did not want to, even
though this was all I knew.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.730
It was like this whole world
had been opened up to me,

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.800
and I'm going, I know how
I get when I go back there.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.160
And I remember in the
airport, in Hong Kong,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.110
praying with my wife and
my two oldest daughters.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:59.340
And we're just scared
to go back to the US,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.600
because we thought we're going
to get stuck in that rut again

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.230
and we're going to get
caught up in these things.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.710
And how do we make
sure that when

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.940
we go back to America that
we don't just get lame

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.080
and just look at our own lives
and just build this for myself

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.350
and worry about
retirement-- ooh, what's

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.510
going to happen in 30 years
to me-- when there's people

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.620
starving today, when there's
moms frantically looking

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.780
for clean water
anywhere, and you're

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.710
dealing with these issues that
matter for all of eternity.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.820
I remember my wife
just saying, "Look,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.520
we can't let people talk us out
of things this time through."

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.150
A lot of times we read
the Bible and we go man,

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.060
this is how we
should live our life.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.770
This is the way we're
supposed to do it.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.010
But then nice Christian people
in the US just are saying,

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.620
well you don't want to be so
extreme, and think about this,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.580
and think about where
you'll be and how you'll

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.310
be 20, 30 years from now.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:03.350
And it's like, they'll change
our whole way of thinking.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.470
But it was very wise what she
said, just, this time through,

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.900
let's not let people
talk us out of things.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.400
When we're convicted,
let's just do it.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.170
Let's just do it.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.732
Let's just make it happen.

00:12:14.732 --> 00:12:15.690
And that's what I mean.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.200
In this environment
that we're in,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.190
sometimes we don't realize
what poor decisions we're

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.910
making, just based
upon environment even,

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:30.160
just with what we see day to
day and we're not remembering

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.000
the rest of the world.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.660
And sometimes we want to
forget the rest of the world,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.390
because it's hard to just go
on with life when you know

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.680
that you've got friends on
an island trying to take care

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.980
of 10,000 new people every day.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.380
And you've got people
on bases like that.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.480
And then I've got other
friends that-- one just

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.770
got out of prison in Iran.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.620
And he's been in
there for five years

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.450
and trying to get reunited
with this family and everything

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.630
else, and the craziness.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.800
And then what the
Bible says, Hebrews,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.050
"Remember those in prison as
though in prison with them."

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.115
So every time I see people
being beheaded or whatever else,

00:13:17.115 --> 00:13:19.320
I start thinking,
their families.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.460
How do I remember them as
though I'm in prison with them?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.220
How do I remember them as
though I'm that little kid

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.460
and it's my dad who
just got beheaded,

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.310
or my dad who is being tortured?

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:38.470
How do I keep this focus
and still figure this out?

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.020
I still have a job to do.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.440
I still have things I've
got to do right here.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.570
And so our minds
can get so clouded.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.160
And that's why
Jesus says in Luke,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.710
there's that story where
this rich young ruler

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.370
comes to Jesus.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.090
And he says "Good
teacher, what must

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.050
I do to inherit eternal life?"

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:09.420
So this is a wealthy, powerful,
someone who's looked up to.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.580
And he says, hey, what do I
have to do to go to heaven?

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.940
And Jesus says, "Why
do you call me good?

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.197
No one's good except God alone.

00:14:19.197 --> 00:14:20.280
You know the commandments.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.410
Do not commit adultery.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.140
Do not murder.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.940
Do not steal.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.540
Do not bear false witness.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.120
Honor your father and mother."

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.380
And he said, "All these things
I have kept from my youth."

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:37.760
When Jesus heard this, he said
to him, "What [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.360
Sell all that you have,
and distribute to the poor.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.950
And you will have
treasure in heaven.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.510
And come follow me."

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.790
But when he heard these
things, he became very sad,

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.900
for he was extremely rich.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.330
Jesus, seeing that
he had become sad,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.740
said, "How difficult it is
for those who have wealth

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.460
to enter the Kingdom of God.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.890
It's easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:17.260
than for a rich person to
enter the Kingdom of God."

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:22.310
Jesus gave a whole different
perspective to life.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.340
I had one professor
who said it's

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.034
like when Jesus was giving
the Beatitudes on the Sermon

00:15:27.034 --> 00:15:28.450
of the Mount, it's
like Jesus went

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:33.312
into the store of happiness, and
he changed all the price tags.

00:15:33.312 --> 00:15:35.020
He says no, this is
not what it cost you.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.110
This is not how
you get happiness.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.170
That's not the price you pay.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.920
And the things that we called
blessed-- I mean, I do it too.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.980
Man, that guy's blessed.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.750
She's blessed.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.470
Why do we say that?

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.720
Because they're rich,
or they're healthy,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.530
or they've got everything
going their way.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:59.320
And yet Jesus, looking at this
rich guy, he gets sad for him.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.730
He's like oh, it's so
hard for guys like that.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.150
Earlier he had taught
them, blessed are the poor.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.230
Woe to those who are rich.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.360
Woe to those who
are comfortable now.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.640
And he actually
said it's harder.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.100
It's harder for you.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:25.960
On Friday, I'm speaking at a
chapel for the Denver Broncos.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.050
I know, it's kind of weird.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.960
But I remember the
first time I was

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.850
doing a thing for pro athletes.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.360
I remember just praying.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.120
It was during the
NBA All-Star Game.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.320
And I'm into sports.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.810
I grew up just into sports and
kind of idolizing these guys.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.670
And I just was saying God,
I don't want to go in there

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.320
and ask for autographs.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.640
I'm the speaker.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.730
I'm not supposed to care.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.160
But I remember just
praying, going God,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.150
I don't want to go
in here and just

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.180
be like-- that doesn't
do them any good.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.570
And so I just started praying.

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.810
And God just opened my
eyes, opened my eyes,

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.609
helped me to go in with
the right attitude.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:16.480
And the more I prayed for
them-- man, I'm not a crier.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.170
I definitely wasn't
a crier back then.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.230
But I just started
crying for them.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.815
I started feeling
sorry for them.

00:17:24.815 --> 00:17:26.440
I started thinking
man, what would that

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.310
be like to just grow up
and everyone worships you

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:36.620
from a young age, because you're
the best kid on the basketball

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.450
court when you're eight.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.440
And then you're 12
and now suddenly it's

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.720
even in the newspaper, and
then on and on through college.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.760
Then it gets insane.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.660
Now you're in the NBA
now you're an All-Star.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.380
Like this is insane.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.920
Like you're worshipped
all your life.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.260
And now what Jesus calls us
to do is to humble ourselves.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.440
Like he says to this rich young
ruler, man, sell everything

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.730
you have.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.740
It's a lot harder
when you have a lot.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.606
And I just got so
sad for these people.

00:18:06.606 --> 00:18:07.730
And I started thanking God.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.460
God, thank you.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.920
Thank you that I'm short.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:17.430
Thank you that not a-- I don't
think I could handle that.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.230
If I'm worshiped
all my life, could I

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.310
have ever humbled myself?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.420
And I'm just going
on and on and on.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.890
And just in my prayer
life, like God, I

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.810
feel so sorry for these people.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.210
Now I know what you
meant when you looked

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.310
at that rich young
ruler and he says,

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.900
oh it's like the person Jesus,
you can gain the whole world

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.050
and forfeit your soul.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.300
Because there's a moment
that we're all going

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.880
to stand before this being.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.640
The Bible describes how
intense of an encounter.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.330
That is every one
that's even gotten

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.930
a glimpse, a veiled
glimpse of him,

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.690
they either fall on their
faces or they faint.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.420
Or they just go, you're
going to kill me.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.040
I mean, it's just like
this shock of all shocks.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.390
And what the Bible
says the enemy tries

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.170
to do here on the Earth is
get is to just not even think

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.090
about him.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:11.370
Get us so preoccupied in
our own little worlds,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.110
you focusing on
this little thing,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.130
assuming that I need a
bunch of Twitter followers

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.690
or I want a bunch of Facebook
friends or I want this.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.246
I want this.

00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:22.120
I want to build this.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.020
I need to retire like this.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.870
And suddenly boom,
your life just ends.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.290
Now you stand before
this guy and I go oh my.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.310
I was so focused
on other things.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.380
And it just caused me
to go God, thank you.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.050
Thank you for some of
my hardships in life

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.130
that made me think through
life at a young age.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.420
My mom died while she
was giving birth to me.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.870
And I'm thankful for that now.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.450
My stepmother died in a car
accident when I was eight.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.220
And I'm thankful for that now.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.470
My dad died of
cancer when I was 12.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.530
And I look back, I go
man, I was 12 years old.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.380
My mom, my stepmom, and
my dad all died suddenly.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.910
And I'm in junior high.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.030
And I'm having to
think about life

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.870
and going what, it can
just end like that?

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.910
A 12-year-old kid
watching your dad's body

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:22.340
go into a grave, or eight,
nine years old and just staring

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.590
at a dead body
realizing it's your mom,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.930
it gets you thinking,
what is this all about?

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.820
Is this a joke?

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.090
So everything can just
be over right now?

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.720
And I started
realizing, God, that

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.050
was one of the greatest
blessings in my life,

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.560
because it caused me
to start searching.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.545
And while all my other
friends are playing Pac-Man--

00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:45.170
I don't even think
Pac-Man was out yet,

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.970
Asteroids-- Asteroids
or Space Invaders--

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.370
I'm thinking what is the
meaning of all of this.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.620
And you start realizing,
wow, blessed are the poor.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.340
Blessed are those who go
through the difficult times.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.260
He says consider it
pure joy when you're

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.942
facing trials everywhere,
because that's

00:21:05.942 --> 00:21:07.400
where the character's
built. That's

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.000
where the perseverance
is built. That's

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.580
where you start thinking
about the things that matter.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.420
But when everything's
laid out for you,

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.160
it's very easy to
live a shallow life

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.220
and start thinking that
your biggest problem is

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.820
what car to buy next, or
your biggest problem is

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.865
what life insurance policy,
or what to investment

00:21:27.865 --> 00:21:28.725
in for retirement.

00:21:28.725 --> 00:21:33.230
It becomes so huge to you or
how to race to the next thing.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.700
And it's all stuff
where at the end

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.140
you go man, what was
I doing down there?

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.110
What was I thinking?

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.100
Whereas like Jesus says in
Matthew 25, "When I come back,

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.579
I'm going to say I was hungry.

00:21:45.579 --> 00:21:46.370
You didn't feed me.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.340
I was thirsty, you gave
me nothing to drink.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.130
I was naked.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.680
You didn't clothe me."

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.030
And all these people
say, but Jesus, well I

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.180
never saw you like that.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.140
And he says, "Whatever you
did for the least of these,

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.630
you did for me.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.090
And whatever you didn't
do for the least of these,

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.450
you didn't do for me."

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.450
And this sent me on
his trajectory of man,

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.150
this is what I've got
to do with my life then.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.750
I've got to focus on this.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:18.450
First John 3, verse
16-- it's funny

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.720
how we pick certain verses
and we just gravitate to them,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.040
and we just make the whole
Bible about that one verse.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.864
And everyone knows John 3:16.

00:22:27.864 --> 00:22:29.530
And it's like man,
that's a great verse.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.386
I love John 3:16.

00:22:31.386 --> 00:22:34.260
But I like the whole Bible.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.370
And I think sometimes we
avoid certain passages.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.520
And it's like John 3:16--
what about first John 3:16?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.950
I love.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.720
"HE says by this we know love,
that he laid down his life

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.900
for us.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.520
And we ought to lay down
our lives for the brothers.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.860
But if anyone has
the world's goods

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.570
and sees his
brother in need, yet

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.870
closes his heart
against him, how

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.340
does God's love abide in him?

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.860
Little children, let us
not love in word or talk,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.561
but in deed and in truth."

00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:12.360
He says this is
how we know love.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.890
Love is don't look at me.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.680
Love is we look at him.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.150
And it says, this
is how we know.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.280
He laid down his life for us.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.990
See what I believe,
and what I believe just

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.360
from a simple
reading of scripture

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.850
is that there is a being
who recognizes everything

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.140
that's going on on this Earth.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.450
Sometimes it
doesn't feel like it

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.500
because it says in his
kindness, he lets things go.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.870
He's kind to us in hopes
that we would repent.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.710
And he's patient.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.290
I don't have the
patience of God.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.170
Man, some of the things
I've done in life

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:57.300
at an early age, which I would
hate to have to confess to you,

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.540
I just don't know how
a holy God didn't just

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.640
strike me down right there.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.100
Like you idiot, how
dare you do that

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.870
to this other created
being that I made.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.450
That son of mine or that
daughter of mine, and you

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.980
did that to her?

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.060
And his patience-- I deserve.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.530
We can all look in this room and
go oh, we're all good people.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.000
But when we go to bed at night
we all know what we've done.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.330
And we know things
that no one else knows.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.030
And then we come back and
oh yeah, I'm a good person,

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:38.290
because we compare ourselves
to someone worse, right?

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.990
But ultimately before God,
we know what we've done.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.260
And the Bible teaches
that God saw all of it--

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.700
every thought, every
word, every action.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:55.250
And because of that, I deserve
his punishment, his wrath.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:25:00.610
Exodus 34:7 says he doesn't
leave the guilty unpunished.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.430
He's a just god.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:03.540
He's a fair judge.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.420
We understand judging.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.550
Like a judge, you don't just
let someone go in their crime.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.970
And God says, I don't just
let people go in their crimes.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.290
I'm a just god.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.430
It's justice.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:18.390
You can't just say OK, you
killed her, but I'll let it go.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:23.100
No, a just god, a just
judge must punish.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.120
And now his punishments in
scripture seem extreme to us.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.720
But again, we got to go OK,
why do I think they're extreme?

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.890
Maybe it's the world I
live in where we're all

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.830
about giving rights
where a little kid--

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.160
we don't punish kids.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.340
I mean, you see kids.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.740
You ever done child care?

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.971
I mean, it's horrifying because
we don't discipline kids

00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:44.470
anymore.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.803
They just do whatever they want.

00:25:45.803 --> 00:25:47.970
A lot of us grow up in
homes where mom says,

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.750
you do that again,
I'll count to three.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.870
Please, don't count.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.000
And so this whole system
of just let it go,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.580
let it go-- we don't get
the justice and punishment.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.710
But that part I always thought
OK, that makes sense to me.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.980
What's fascinating in
the Bible is God says,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.219
let me show you what love is.

00:26:10.219 --> 00:26:11.635
This is how you
know what love is.

00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:15.750
He says in spite of everything
you've done, I have to be just.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.710
But I also want to forgive you.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.190
And so here's what
I'm going to do.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.470
I'm going to have
my son, my only son,

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.120
take the form of a man.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.120
I want to demonstrate--
I want to show the world

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.850
love like no one else has.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.560
Just like he's supreme in
his power and his holiness,

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.140
his sovereignty, he goes, watch
what I do as far as love goes.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.260
I'm going to have my son pay,
because someone has to pay.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.250
I'm going to have him
pay for your crimes.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.390
No one does this.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.200
No one does this.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.050
Anyone with a child
understands, how in the world

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.170
can anyone do this.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.640
And God says that's how
deep my love is for you.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.170
And he says and
he's going to rise

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.930
from the dead to show
that he wasn't just

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.645
another human being.

00:27:04.645 --> 00:27:06.770
And when he rose from the
grave and the people saw,

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.800
that's when they said OK,
we'll give our lives for this.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.660
At first we thought it might
have been just a crazy story

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.470
about-- but now you just
came back from the dead

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.470
and we watched you.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.439
We spoke to you
and we touched you.

00:27:18.439 --> 00:27:19.980
And now you're
sitting back in heaven

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.990
and you're saying tell
the rest of the world.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.800
So I believe that.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.060
And I believe this book.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.350
And he says, that's how
you learn what love is.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.980
He says that's why-- he goes
when you see someone in need

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.440
and you do nothing, he
says how in the world can

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.960
you say the love of
Christ abides in you?

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.180
He says you're saying that
God's spirit entered into you?

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.860
But you look nothing like God.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.960
I mean, we know
what God looks like.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.690
We know about his
love because he

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.450
saw a bunch of people
that offended him,

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:56.570
and he went down after them
and he sacrificed for them.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.700
That's love.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.160
And now those of us who
are followers of his,

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.780
we follow that pattern.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.770
And so he goes, if someone
calls himself a Christian

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.179
yet he sees that need
and does nothing,

00:28:08.179 --> 00:28:10.220
you really got to question,
is that person really

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.020
a follower of Christ?

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.450
He says is the
love of God in him?

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.020
How does God's
love abide in him?

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.370
"Little children, let us
not love in word or talk,

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.790
but in deed and in truth"

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.150
And I think that's one of
my biggest frustrations

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.050
with what we call
Christianity in America.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.230
It's all about talk.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:35.430
And that's why I got so
frustrated being a speaker.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.400
And I was known
for being a talker.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.210
It's like wow, he's one of the
best talkers I've ever known.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.890
And yet you look in scripture
and you're just going man,

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.832
I don't want to be a talker.

00:28:45.832 --> 00:28:47.290
I don't want to
spend my life being

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.205
known as a talker or a writer.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.300
I want to be known for my love.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.430
I want to be like Jesus.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.030
We don't look back and say
man, could that guy talk.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:07.010
We're just like wow, what he
was willing to sacrifice for us,

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.100
and love.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.590
And that's why he's saying
look, that's the example.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:15.730
We ought to lay down our
lives for the brothers.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.780
See that's the picture.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.590
That's the example.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.260
That's why I don't want to ever
boast on hey, look what I did.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.280
Look what I did.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:27.660
And it's always about man,
it's one thing for me,

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.800
a guy who's really
screwed up his life

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.120
and was forgiven by God to
experience that, and then

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.056
maybe pass it down a
little bit to others.

00:29:39.056 --> 00:29:40.750
But it's a completely
other thing

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.620
when you've got a holy God
and a perfect son who's

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.950
done nothing wrong.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.760
And he says watch
how much we love even

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.110
those who've offended us.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.920
That's why Jesus
said, it's no big deal

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.620
if you love those
who love you back.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.990
He goes anyone on the
earth can do that.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.670
He goes, but for believers, I
want you to love your enemies.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.320
I want you to pray for them.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.970
I want you to do good
to those who hate you.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.160
I want you to bless
those who curse you.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.250
And again, I do a lot of
work with guys coming out

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.220
of prison, guys off the
street, people in other places.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.460
And it's actually
quite enjoyable,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.939
like when you see
their life turn around.

00:30:17.939 --> 00:30:20.230
And I don't know if you've
ever been to another country

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:25.380
and to feed someone that
man, wasn't going to eat,

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.460
and the look on their
eyes when you hand them

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.470
like a bowl of rice or
something and they just light up

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.680
and they thank you.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.760
I remember seeing
this one village

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.770
and just telling my whole
church, man, I'm like man,

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.630
you should have seen
these kids or whatever.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:40.280
They don't have clothes.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.170
They don't have food.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.170
They don't have schools.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.586
They don't' have
anywhere to live.

00:30:43.586 --> 00:30:45.840
And so we built a
school and these homes.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.140
And we're sending all this food.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.020
And I went back to Africa.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.710
And there was a room way
bigger than this, a couple

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.120
hundred of these orphans.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.510
And now they're clothed.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.860
And they're in school.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.440
And they're worshipping God.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.190
And I just sneak into
the back of the room

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.850
just to take a glance.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.230
And the teacher stops
the class and says,

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.010
everyone look in the back.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.420
See that man back
there, Pastor Chan?

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.080
Every one of you is sponsored
by someone in his church.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.450
Then all these kids just get up.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.230
Man, you just see
their little heads

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.030
and their big bright smile.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.740
And they're screaming
and clapping.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.860
And I'm just like
a puddle of tears.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.652
This is the greatest
moment ever.

00:31:28.652 --> 00:31:30.320
Like I got to be a part of this?

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.000
I got to be a part of this?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.246
Jesus says, well, that's cool.

00:31:35.246 --> 00:31:36.370
He doesn't say that's cool.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.712
He's says that's good.

00:31:37.712 --> 00:31:39.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.730
But he says you
know what, now can

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.820
you do that to
those who hate you,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.310
that won't appreciate
what you've done?

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.190
Because that's what I did.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:49.984
I loved people who
nailed me to a cross.

00:31:49.984 --> 00:31:51.400
And I'm going
father forgive them,

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.050
they don't know
what they're doing,

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.240
even when they persecuted me.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.580
It's easy for me to
maybe go to Syria

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.350
and help the victims of ISIS.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.850
It's a little
harder to love ISIS.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.530
It's easy for me to go
overseas and help with Pat,

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.786
with human trafficking.

00:32:10.786 --> 00:32:15.760
But when it comes to the actual
perpetrators or the ones that

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.620
are leading these
rings, and to love them

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:23.180
and to sacrifice for
them, it's difficult.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.430
But that's what God can
give us the ability to do.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:31.480
And I'm just saying, my life's
been just this crazy miracle

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:38.910
where I just can't believe the
things God's allowed me to do.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.550
And it doesn't make any sense.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:45.570
But God says look, I choose--
I specifically choose the weak.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.460
I specifically
choose those who are

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.600
foolish to shame
the wise, those who

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.840
are weak to shame the strong.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.940
This way they don't brag at the
end of their lives and they all

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.580
know it's me.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.730
But those of us who think
that we've earned something

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.590
by ourselves and we
take credit for it

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.120
and we want to brag
about it, man, those

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.080
are the ones that God says
gosh, I'll humble you.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.900
I will humble you.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.750
But I'll give grace to
those who are humble.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:20.270
And I just want to say man,
my story is ridiculous.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.050
It just makes no
sense why God would

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:26.710
pick me and open my
eyes to his beauty,

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:32.120
and then just allow me
to go care for the poor,

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.840
care for the needy, and go
around to a place like this

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.570
and brag about my god.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.910
And you know, I
think sometimes God

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.980
puts me in these
types of environments

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.910
or with other rich people.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.990
I know some you guys
think oh, I'm not rich.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.080
No, you're loaded.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.940
You are.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.320
I mean, travel
with me some time.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:03.190
You are ridiculously
rich and blessed.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.940
And you have people
in the world that when

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.000
they hear you work at
Google, it's like ooh,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.159
like this worship thing.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:14.860
And that's why the first things
I said to those basketball

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.770
players or those
football players was man,

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:20.800
I wept for you guys.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.260
I just felt so sorry for you.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.219
And they're like what?

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.150
You feel sorry for-- I
mean, it was just the shock.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.569
I go man, I was thanking
God I'm not you.

00:34:32.569 --> 00:34:35.040
And they're like what?

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.600
And I was explaining to them
because it's so much more

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.920
difficult. Like Jesus said
to that rich young ruler,

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.020
it's just so hard.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.409
When I'm in the slums of India
and I say hey, give it all up.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.040
There's something better.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.580
They're like,
where do I sign up?

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.889
You come to Mountain
View, hey give it all up.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:56.949
There's something better.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:57.940
What?

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:58.660
This is Google.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:08.060
And you go wow, I sure hope they
don't spend their whole lives

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.160
gaining the world and
forfeiting their soul,

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.720
and losing sight of
the world around them.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.660
Because this is a
very difficult place

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.730
from which to make decisions.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.280
But you can make
decisions, good decisions.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.330
I mean, I've never
been to Syria.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.260
I've never been to Lesbos.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.370
I just had someone explain that
picture to me, and I got it.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.110
And it's affecting me.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.144
I'd never even heard of
human trafficking before.

00:35:35.144 --> 00:35:37.310
You know, a few years ago,
I was with David Batstone

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:41.070
with Not for Sale, and I'm just
sitting with him at dinner.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.790
And I'm like hey,
what do you do?

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:45.530
And he explains
human trafficking.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.300
I couldn't sleep that night.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.000
I was in a nice
hotel room, but I

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.660
couldn't sleep, because
my mind started going,

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.840
what if that was Rachel,
my oldest daughter?

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.960
What if someone abducted her?

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.390
What would I do?

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.130
What about Mercy?

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.880
And I started thinking
sweet little Mercy,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.570
my second daughter.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.930
What would I do?

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.720
I start thinking about my kids.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.860
What if someone took
one of my girls,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.610
I'm getting ready to
speak on a Sunday morning,

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.240
and I find out that my kid
is somewhere being repeatedly

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.980
raped with no hope in sight.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.720
And I just start imagining this.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.880
And I just couldn't sleep.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.360
I'm just going god,
I would go nuts.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.680
I mean, I wouldn't go
up and go hey everyone,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.900
turn to 1st Peter.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:40.330
No, I know what [INAUDIBLE]
like throwing this thing over.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.370
I would be swearing
probably, going

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:45.150
what do you guys all sit in
your nice little life doing

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.950
your little things.

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.560
Someone find my daughter.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.800
You have relationships.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.460
You know people.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.220
Figure this eff-in thing out
because I got to get her back.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.870
You know, this intensity that
I just, I was imagining myself,

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:01.650
what would I do walking onto
a stage if it was my own kid.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.170
And God saying you
know what, I want

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.790
you to do that with
all of these kids,

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.380
even though they're
not your own.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.305
And I'm just weeping.

00:37:07.305 --> 00:37:11.270
Going oh, man, that is--
that's what Jesus did.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.530
That's what I want
my life to be about.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.760
And I'm saying that comes from
a nice hotel room in Atlanta

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.340
where everyone's like
oh, Francis Chan's here.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.550
You just say, no, let me
escape that stupid world

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.830
and really think about
reality and these people,

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.180
because that's a
picture of our God

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.250
who says he didn't consider
equality with God something

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.060
to be held onto, but
he emptied himself.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.120
He had all the angels screaming
out his glory, and he's just,

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.360
I'm going to leave them.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.980
And I'm going to go here,
and I'm going to do this.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:49.371
And I'm not saying hey,
everyone quit and leave.

00:37:49.371 --> 00:37:50.620
I'm just saying you know what?

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.150
You surrender your
life completely.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.960
And for some of you maybe
it means to actually go.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.100
But others maybe
you think through.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:03.910
You know what, how can I use
what I've gotten right here?

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:07.330
My abilities, my income,
how can I use it all?

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.250
Can I be more effective
here than overseas?

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.100
Because that's
what I realized is

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.080
I think I can make a bigger
difference in the world coming

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:15.885
back to America.

00:38:15.885 --> 00:38:17.010
And that's why I came back.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.110
I got I don't speak Thai.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.080
I don't speak Hindi.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.750
I don't speak-- I can do this
and I can rally people here.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.520
And I think I do more good here.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.860
And then this book that my
wife and I are writing about,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:32.330
we were in Ethiopia, which is a
great place to make decisions.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:36.620
And I'm seeing all of these sex
trafficked women and these sex

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:40.070
slaves in these tiny places with
their kids under their beds,

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.700
and man after man
walking in for a dollar.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.490
It's just oh, it's so gross.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:48.980
I'm like, OK, let's kill.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.030
Let's make this book
the most amazing book.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.880
Let's give every single
dime to these needs.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.630
Come on honey.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.890
And we'll create
an app and we'll

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.300
do this and this and this.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.900
And everything will go.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.160
And so we had to recruit
some of you here at Google.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.775
Like man, we're going
to make this app

00:39:03.775 --> 00:39:04.900
and we're going to kill it.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.680
We're going to make
it the best ever.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.554
This is going to be the
best app for any book

00:39:08.554 --> 00:39:10.230
in the history of books.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.080
And let's get it
out there, and we'll

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.754
give it all away for free.

00:39:13.754 --> 00:39:15.670
And I'm just going to
ask people, just donate,

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.447
and all your money goes to this.

00:39:17.447 --> 00:39:18.280
I don't want a dime.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.110
I want to invest.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.360
I want to lose money
on this project

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.360
because I want to
be a giver of this.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:29.470
And so thank God for some of
you that were working hours just

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.630
on your own free time,
because you had the gift,

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.140
and say OK, I believe
in this cause.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.110
I'm going to go after it.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.526
And it's like you know what,
you're probably better served

00:39:37.526 --> 00:39:39.330
doing something like that.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.230
I've talked about
this type of stuff.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.980
A couple of baseball players the
other day were just saying man,

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.230
I just got back from Thailand.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.225
I think I'm going
to quit baseball

00:39:47.225 --> 00:39:49.030
and I'm just going
to go rescue girls.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.880
I'm like oh, I don't know man.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.870
I mean, I'm sure you're
good at rescuing girls,

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.890
but man, you're a good pitcher.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:05.920
And not everyone makes
$5 million playing catch.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.750
You may want to
consider investing that

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.700
and just live in an RV.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.910
Why don't you do that?

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.730
Live in a trailer park.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.730
That would make national news.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.080
And maybe that would be an
example to other people.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.810
Like that might be
better for the cause.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.550
So you know, it's just every
person thinking through.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.260
God, I'll go.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.130
I'll go right now.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:29.030
You want me to go over there?

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.740
You want me to go to that little
island he was talking about?

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.000
I'll do it.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.550
Or maybe I'll just work
so stinking hard over here

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.660
and I'll live a simple,
simple life so that I

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.900
can give everything I can.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.999
Sure, I have the right.

00:40:42.999 --> 00:40:44.790
Everyone's going to
tell you have the right

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.750
to build for yourself.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.640
And Jesus had the right
to stay in heaven.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.990
But his example was love.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.010
I'm not going to hold onto
this I'm going to empty myself

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.830
because I love these people.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.747
And that's what we have
the opportunity to do.

00:40:57.747 --> 00:41:00.163
But I'm telling you, it's going
to be hard, because you'll

00:41:00.163 --> 00:41:01.520
hear this message right here.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.000
And the moment you
walk out this door,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.840
you'll hear a million
other messages.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.430
And they won't sound
much like this one.

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.830
And it's like to
remember Christ.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:15.160
That's why I get alone every
day and go God, remind me

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.270
who you are.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.030
Remind me how you live.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:22.320
And I've got to stop
listening to people.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.110
I've got to block
all that noise out,

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:30.210
because it's difficult to get
to heaven from Silicon Valley.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.040
So those are my thoughts.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.885
I wanted to leave time
for a question-answer.

00:41:34.885 --> 00:41:36.609
And what's his face
is coming back.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:47.320
JON CHUI: OK, well,
what's his face here.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.710
So we wanted to share some
of these practical things

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.120
that people could be
doing so that we could

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.328
actually action item on them.

00:41:52.328 --> 00:41:53.730
Kevin, you want to stand up?

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:55.690
Kev is the CEO of Crazy Love.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.210
And he's organized a lot of the
You and Me Forever app teams

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:02.380
from Google and other campuses.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.520
And so you want to share a bit?

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.590
KEVIN KIM: Yeah man.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.592
It's such a blessing to
be here with you guys.

00:42:09.592 --> 00:42:13.530
We were praying for
you guys beforehand.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:18.390
And just our hearts were so
warmed and burdened for you,

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.140
and so thankful that
you guys are here.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.230
I actually have a
team in the back.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:28.850
I've worked with a few of
you on various projects,

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.450
and it's been such a joy.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:34.730
And if you ask them, hopefully
it's been as much of a joy

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.310
to them as it was to us.

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:37.976
It's been an incredible
blessing to us.

00:42:37.976 --> 00:42:40.100
But we want to extend that
opportunity to you guys.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.170
We do a lot of
great work all over.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.302
And Pat's here.

00:42:44.302 --> 00:42:47.430
He's doing amazing work in
Ethiopia as Francis shared.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.300
There's incredible work that
needs to be done in Syria.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.030
We do work in the inner city.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.440
We work with ex-convicts.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.170
And you know, there's
this incredible app

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.490
that we're working on right.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:02.610
I mean, it was Francis's
heart to-- the whole idea was

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.660
we had these guys that
are coming out of prisons

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.070
and they can't afford
to go to seminary.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.460
And so let's bring
seminary to them.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.760
So the whole idea was
like creating a seminary

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.950
in your pocket for free.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:14.960
And we said we didn't
just wanted for our guys,

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.070
but we wanted it for
everybody, like everybody

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:21.070
to have this amazing
exposure to the beauty

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.000
and the truth of
scripture for themselves.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.721
And we could have charged.

00:43:24.721 --> 00:43:26.220
We could have done
in app purchases.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.094
We could have said,
here's this amazing video

00:43:28.094 --> 00:43:32.200
and have it cut off, and $2.99
to watch the rest of it, right?

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.617
But we worked
really, really hard.

00:43:33.617 --> 00:43:36.116
Francis and I worked really,
really hard to raise the money.

00:43:36.116 --> 00:43:37.505
We had to raise
a million dollars

00:43:37.505 --> 00:43:40.210
to raise the money so that we
can make it available for free

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.530
for anybody, everybody
all over the world.

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:46.430
And we started getting
excited about what God would

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:47.560
do through Read Scripture.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.060
And Jon-- it's not what's
his face-- this is my man.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.765
He's my CTO on the project
for Read Scripture.

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:57.290
So Jon and his team,
they've been working

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.600
really hard on this thing.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.300
And I've been praying about it.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.390
And we're so excited
about what God's going

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:03.880
to do with Read Scripture.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.120
But then we started making
these videos in Cantonese.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.150
And we're like oh my
gosh, this is amazing,

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.940
and having a heart
for the world.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.940
And we said, wait, I
want to make these videos

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.437
in Mandarin and in Spanish
and in Hindi and in Arabic.

00:44:15.437 --> 00:44:17.520
We want to roll it out and
we want to do for free.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.790
And so we had this incredible
vision for what God's doing.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.010
And it's a small thing.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.990
What we do is a
small, small thing.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:29.030
What's been so encouraging is
to travel to all these places

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.640
and to realize,
man, God is at work

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.617
and he doesn't need any of us.

00:44:32.617 --> 00:44:33.700
He doesn't need any of us.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.030
And he is at work
doing amazing things.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.140
And what Francis just
so eloquently shared,

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.100
we get to partake in that.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.750
Like we get the joy
and the opportunity

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.230
to partake in something
that's cosmic and majestic and

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.920
glorious.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.820
And that's a gift to us.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.490
We don't benefit him.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:51.640
That's a gift to us.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.405
And so for you guys who say
hey, I want to get involved,

00:44:55.405 --> 00:44:56.280
and I don't know how.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.780
And I just want to help.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.620
I have a team in the back.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.500
Team, raise your hand.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.490
They'll capture your
information if you want

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:07.790
to help out with our ministry.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:09.759
But we can also point
you to-- our ministry

00:45:09.759 --> 00:45:10.800
is not the only ministry.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.096
We can point you
to other ministries

00:45:13.096 --> 00:45:14.220
that we're partnering with.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.190
And so if you just want to
take the step, come talk to us.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.080
And then Jon.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.040
JON CHUI: OK, so Kev, quickly,
there's a door you guys.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.540
So you guys have quick questions
for those who are Googlers.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.380
Let's put some more.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.730
We'll have five, 10
minutes of question.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.280
But Kev, can you share
quickly what you're saying?

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.660
A lot of times we just
don't get to see examples.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.019
Like Francis, you talk
about all these people

00:45:34.019 --> 00:45:35.060
going to do crazy things.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.460
But we don't see
examples of people

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.760
at Google, other than I guess
helping out with this app,

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.220
right?

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:39.930
We don't see examples.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:41.305
So could you share
that story you

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:43.149
shared with us the
other day about the two

00:45:43.149 --> 00:45:44.440
developers in your [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.200
KEVIN KIM: OK.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.030
All right, real quick, because
we've got to go, right?

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:49.840
But I have a guy.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.634
So we run house churches, right?

00:45:51.634 --> 00:45:53.550
And I have a guy that
went to my house church.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.960
Just amazing, amazing guy,
Chris Lee's friend's over there.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.190
Chris Lee worked on my You
and Me Forever app too.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.190
Guy name Greg,
Greg and his friend

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:06.230
Brendan, they graduated
out of Carnegie Mellon, top

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.800
of their class, and came
out to work in Silicon

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.410
Valley as developers.

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.540
And one was at Yahoo.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.700
One was at a medical startup.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:19.230
And Greg, he goes off on
a mission trip to India.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:23.600
And his Chinese friend Brendan,
he calls him up in India

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.150
and is like hey,
what do you think

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.940
about giving up our stuff,
because we have a lot of stuff.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.731
What do you think about
giving up our stuff

00:46:30.731 --> 00:46:33.520
and doing something
good with it?

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.020
And Greg's like all
right, sure, right?

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.850
Comes back to find that
his friend Brendan had

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.580
sold everything
that he had owned

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:49.970
and what Brendan had owned,
and gave up their apartment.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.086
He comes home with
luggage and he's

00:46:52.086 --> 00:46:53.210
like, where's my apartment?

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.591
He's like, there's no apartment.

00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:57.920
I took all the money
that we got from selling

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.300
your stuff and my stuff.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.972
And we bought this bus.

00:47:00.972 --> 00:47:02.430
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:03.960
going to live in
this bus, and we're

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.524
going to drive
around San Francisco,

00:47:05.524 --> 00:47:07.190
and we're going to
house homeless people

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.273
and tell them about Jesus.

00:47:08.273 --> 00:47:10.330
So that's what these
two developers did

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:11.620
for the better part of a year.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.760
They just went around and had
this incredible adventure.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.070
Now is it pragmatic?

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:17.490
No, right.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:20.450
But for me, the reason
why it blesses me so much

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:24.770
is because it's a little bit
like that story with Mary

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:29.860
and Martha where Mary breaks
open the bottle of perfume

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.390
and pours it out
at Jesus's feet.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.901
And you're like,
that wasn't useful.

00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:35.900
That didn't do anything.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.580
That didn't help the poor.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:41.311
But Jesus was so blessed by
that act of love and worship

00:47:41.311 --> 00:47:41.810
and faith.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:44.410
And when I look at those
two boys and just thinking

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:46.780
about them driving around
in the middle of San

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.700
Francisco in their Jesus
mobile bus with this heart,

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:55.984
and you can say, well, how
many people did they house?

00:47:55.984 --> 00:47:57.150
How do you measure advocacy?

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:01.290
And you're like, man,
they just loved Jesus.

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.710
And they did this
stupid, crazy thing.

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:06.450
And I think that story of
their love and their devotion

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.980
still has ripple effects.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.560
It blesses me and I think
it blesses other people.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.010
Is that what you wanted to hear?

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:15.343
JON CHUI: So it's just so
cool to hear stories like this

00:48:15.343 --> 00:48:17.162
where-- look at
every other religion.

00:48:17.162 --> 00:48:18.620
You know, like
every other religion

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.161
will tell you to be good to the
poor and do all these things.

00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:23.350
But no other religion
gives you this joy

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:27.530
where it's like, in
his joy, this guy

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.560
sells everything and goes.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.870
That would be my mine
thing for all of us

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:34.660
who call ourselves
followers of Jesus is,

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.600
are you doing this out of
this pure joy for Jesus?

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.010
So with that, we're
going to go to questions.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:44.350
We have less than 10 minutes.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.950
But for action
items, if you want

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:50.820
to talk to Kevin or any other
people-- Pat, raise your hand.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.500
He's helping out the
Ethiopian mission thing.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.780
In the back, Nick, can
you raise your hand?

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.730
Wave hive.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:58.690
Nick is part of Go
Love as is Barb.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:48:59.904
Barb, raise you hand.

00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:02.070
They have been really
organizing a lot of the stuff.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.110
If you go slash
love, it's basically

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.800
all the Christians who want
to actually act out in this.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.510
There's action items there.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.590
There's prayer groups.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.881
We're going to try to do
events this year to volunteer.

00:49:11.881 --> 00:49:14.620
And just go in
there to see more.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.390
So Francis, did you decide which
questions you want to answer?

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:20.980
FRANCIS CHAN: Yeah,
in our seven minutes.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.230
I'm going to just
hit one, otherwise

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:27.570
I'll just incompletely
answer everything.

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:30.950
Often I hear people appeal
to God's unbound love

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.376
and downplay his justness.

00:49:33.376 --> 00:49:37.720
I think no one can experience
that love without repentance.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.110
What would you
urge we Christians

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.600
do in midst of
increasingly disobedient

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.620
pro-choice pro-retaliation
culture we live in?

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.340
It's good.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:57.560
The Bible says in 2nd
Timothy, chapter 3,

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.530
"He says understand this,
that in the last days

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.880
there will come
times of difficulty.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.140
For people be lovers
of self, lovers

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.330
of money, proud,
arrogant, abusive,

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:12.450
disobedient to their parents,
ungrateful, unholy, heartless,

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:16.190
unappeasable, slanderous,
without self-control, brutal,

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:19.780
not loving good, treacherous,
reckless, swollen with conceit,

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:23.210
lovers of pleasure rather
than lovers of God,

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:25.150
having the appearance
of godliness

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:27.220
but denying its power.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.910
Avoid such people."

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.230
And it continues a
few verses later.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.440
"He says the time is
coming when people will not

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.140
endure sound teaching.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.540
But having itching ears, they
will accumulate for themselves

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.480
teachers to suit
their own passions,

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.940
and will turn away from
listening to the truth

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.330
and wander off into myths.

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.750
As for you, always
be sober minded.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:52.310
Endure suffering.

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.970
Do the work of an evangelist.

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:56.075
Fulfill your ministry."

00:50:56.075 --> 00:50:57.450
He says in the
end times, there's

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:01.190
going to be a norm, a
norm in the world that's

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.990
always been there.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:05.540
But the sad part is that norm is
going to leak into the church.

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.730
And that's where he's
saying avoid these people.

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:09.750
He's not saying avoid the world.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:12.140
The same as in 1st
Corinthians 5, he says look,

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.506
I want you to avoid
sexually immoral people.

00:51:15.506 --> 00:51:17.380
He goes I don't mean
the people in the world,

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.046
otherwise you'd have
to leave the world.

00:51:19.046 --> 00:51:21.780
He goes, I am
saying specifically

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.190
anyone who calls
himself a brother

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:26.150
but lives this
immoral lifestyle.

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:29.470
He goes, I don't even
want you to eat with him.

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:31.867
So understand he's saying
here, he goes in the end times,

00:51:31.867 --> 00:51:33.950
you're going to see people
that are self-centered,

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.810
people that are into pleasure
more than they're into God,

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:38.830
people who care less
about their parents,

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.460
people that are greedy.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.850
And he's saying avoid them.

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:43.460
But he's not saying
avoid everyone

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.950
in the world like that.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:47.130
He's saying in
the church, anyone

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:50.130
who calls himself a
Christian yet lives this way.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:53.350
So our job is not
to judge the world.

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:54.200
That's God's job.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.950
Our job, the Bible
says, we are supposed

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:59.480
to judge those in the church.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.150
And this is where
we've got everything

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.861
backwards in the church where
we keep judging the world.

00:52:03.861 --> 00:52:05.110
Oh, look at what they do here.

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:06.380
Look what they do here.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.770
And then we leave all the
garbage that's in the church

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:09.924
alone.

00:52:09.924 --> 00:52:11.590
And God is saying no,
it's the opposite.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:12.880
I've called you to judge.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.650
But I've called you to judge
those inside the church.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:17.390
I'll take care of
the other part.

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:19.100
But those in your
church, he goes man,

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.620
you've got to get serious about
getting that out of the church.

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.360
And so that's my heart.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.320
I hate this idea of
revenge or whatever else

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.015
when it comes into the church.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.030
Thinking about using an example,
but I probably shouldn't.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:41.090
So I'm going to
show self-control.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.390
You want to do another one?

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:43.140
JON CHUI: Wow, great answer.

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:43.930
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:44.922
FRANCIS CHAN: Was that good?

00:52:44.922 --> 00:52:45.963
Want to hear another one?

00:52:45.963 --> 00:52:47.054
JON CHUI: That was good.

00:52:47.054 --> 00:52:48.970
Can you talk a little
bit about housing crisis

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:51.192
and social tensions
in the Bay Area SF,

00:52:51.192 --> 00:52:52.650
given you work with
homeless in SF.

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:56.290
Any advice you can give
us on how we can radically

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:57.820
serve as God's people in tech?

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:03.560
People have been throwing stuff
at Google buses and things

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.544
like that.

00:53:04.544 --> 00:53:05.710
FRANCIS CHAN: Yeah, I threw.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:11.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.340
You know, we live in
a time when people

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:18.100
like to make broad
sweeping statements,

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.562
like all Chinese are smart.

00:53:21.562 --> 00:53:23.170
You know, whatever.

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:29.992
We just like to say the homeless
or that group of people.

00:53:29.992 --> 00:53:32.060
They're not all throwing
stuff at the bus.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.590
And the thing I've
learned from meeting

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:38.850
with the homeless
or the people who

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:43.010
live in the SROs or the
addicts is that you really

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:48.250
can't put a label on people.

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:51.375
And I've met some of
the people that are so--

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.090
We adopted a girl out
of the Tenderloin.

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.420
Who yeah, she was a mess.

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:02.680
But she just needed a hand up.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.070
She was there.

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:07.450
It seemed like she made some
decision to follow Jesus,

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:12.920
but living in a house with a
prostitute and drug addicts

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.110
everywhere, herself
getting involved

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:17.230
in some of those addictions.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.450
I realized man, just to
have her in the house

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:25.250
and to have a dad that
loves her and just

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:28.900
have the social worker come
over and say, hey, your house,

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.700
they threatened to
shoot up your house.

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.660
And Dalal here who's only been
there for three weeks at a time

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.840
wants to know how long is
she allowed to live here.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.790
And I said well,
I said honey, you

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:43.090
can live here as
long as you want.

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:45.000
I'm not afraid of that.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.800
You see how I
treat my daughters.

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.020
I want you to be one of
them, if you'll have me.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.435
You live here as long as you
want until you get married.

00:54:52.435 --> 00:54:55.980
And even after that, if your
husband doesn't work real well,

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.770
you know like just-- you
know, whatever you need.

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:02.950
And for her eyes to
light up and say well,

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:05.120
you guys know if you adopt
her, there's no funding.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.340
We don't care about funding.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.020
We care about her.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.630
And to see the
amazing young woman

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:16.830
she's become in a year and a
half, that's all she needed.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:19.319
There's other people I've
worked with that you give them

00:55:19.319 --> 00:55:20.860
the shirt off your
back and they just

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.930
keep taking advantage
of the system.

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:25.849
And they're always angry
no matter what you do.

00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:28.140
You feed them and they complain
about the food you just

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.150
gave them.

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:33.840
And you just realize OK,
you're here by choice.

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.390
And we've given you every
chance in the world.

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:39.840
And you have so
much resource here.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.520
And you are the problem and
you're not willing to face it.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:49.200
And so there's like night
and day polar opposites.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.250
And so what I would
encourage you to do

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.730
is get to know individuals.

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:58.270
I think that's been part of
our problem in the church.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:07.160
We like to speak in generalities
about the issue in Mexico.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:13.647
Whereas no one's actually
going and meeting Juan, right?

00:56:13.647 --> 00:56:15.730
It's like I just want to
talk about this big thing

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.700
because I could
do that in a room.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.660
But that's what changed me the
first time I went to Africa.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.600
It wasn't these
starving Ugandans.

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.760
It was Dora.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.840
It was Abisage.

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.550
It was Kenneth.

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:31.830
And they were my friends.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:32.740
And I knew them.

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.200
And I had to do
something for Kenneth

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.130
because I really liked that kid.

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:40.190
I wanted to do
something for Abisage

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:42.640
because she cracks me up.

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.590
And that's where
everything changes.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:47.580
And that's why in
our churches, we

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:50.450
don't say hey, these ex-cons.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.390
But it's Robert.

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:54.090
It's Sean.

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:55.610
It's Birdo.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:56.610
It's Raf.

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:58.230
It's this, it's that.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:00.740
They are names to these people.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.290
And they are our brothers,
and we love them.

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:06.542
And so you know, I know
we like to be in a room

00:57:06.542 --> 00:57:07.250
and discuss that.

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:10.370
But I would say get to know
individuals and their names.

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:11.090
We gotta go.

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:11.156
JON CHUI: Cool.

00:57:11.156 --> 00:57:12.710
I think we're out of time now.

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.370
So I think we're going -- are
you supposed to have a meeting

00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:16.145
here, right now?

00:57:16.145 --> 00:57:17.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
we've got a class.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.739
JON CHUI: Oh, that's OK.

00:57:18.739 --> 00:57:20.950
So we are going to need
to get kicked out of here.

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.670
If you can move the book
tables out into the foyer

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:26.219
or "foy-err", or whenever
you want to call it.

00:57:26.219 --> 00:57:27.510
Thank you, Francis, for coming.

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:31.100
