Hopefully you pretty easily got to the answer of 23. 23 chromosomes will be in

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.180
each resulting gamete after miosis. We undergo a round of DNA duplication, and

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.210
then we do two cell division processes. This reduces our chromosome

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.291
count by half, from 46 to 23.
