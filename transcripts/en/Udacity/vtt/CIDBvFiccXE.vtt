The request is going to be a get

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.050

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.240
HTTP 1.0 to make your life a little bit

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.580
easier. When you do this. I want you

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.129
to answer a few questions for me. First, what

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.290
is the status code in the response? And

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.330
second, what is the value of the location header?
