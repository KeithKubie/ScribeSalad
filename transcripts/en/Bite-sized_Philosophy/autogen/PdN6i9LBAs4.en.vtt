I mean these are all ideals right and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
I mean these are all ideals right and
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570
I mean these are all ideals right and
especially taken as a whole they

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
especially taken as a whole they
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.789
especially taken as a whole they
constitute a kind of ideal and you never

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
constitute a kind of ideal and you never
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950
constitute a kind of ideal and you never
approve you never you never attain the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
approve you never you never attain the
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.679
approve you never you never attain the
ideal the I and not only that it recedes

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
ideal the I and not only that it recedes
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899
ideal the I and not only that it recedes
as you approach it right because you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
as you approach it right because you
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.130
as you approach it right because you
straighten yourself out you think well

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
straighten yourself out you think well
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.510
straighten yourself out you think well
I've got it now and you think now wait a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
I've got it now and you think now wait a
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.070
I've got it now and you think now wait a
minute there's more to go there's still

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
minute there's more to go there's still
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.660
minute there's more to go there's still
more to go and then you get that much

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
more to go and then you get that much
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.969
more to go and then you get that much
farther along the line you think oh yeah

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
farther along the line you think oh yeah
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.469
farther along the line you think oh yeah
I thought this was the end of the road

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
I thought this was the end of the road
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.890
I thought this was the end of the road
it's like no there's plenty of

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900
it's like no there's plenty of
 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.020
it's like no there's plenty of
imperfections left to iron out and so it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
imperfections left to iron out and so it
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.359
imperfections left to iron out and so it
is a constant adjustment and but there's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
is a constant adjustment and but there's
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.350
is a constant adjustment and but there's
something about that that's also

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
something about that that's also
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.249
something about that that's also
positive because you might say that it's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
positive because you might say that it's
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.630
positive because you might say that it's
not so much that there isn't such a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
not so much that there isn't such a
 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.179
not so much that there isn't such a
thing as a good person it's that our

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
thing as a good person it's that our
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.950
thing as a good person it's that our
idea of what constitutes good isn't

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
idea of what constitutes good isn't
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.710
idea of what constitutes good isn't
right because a good person is someone

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
right because a good person is someone
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.580
right because a good person is someone
who's trying to get better and no matter

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
who's trying to get better and no matter
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620
who's trying to get better and no matter
how good you are there's better that you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
how good you are there's better that you
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.380
how good you are there's better that you
can get but the real goodness is in the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
can get but the real goodness is in the
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660
can get but the real goodness is in the
attempt right it's in the it's in the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
attempt right it's in the it's in the
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.600
attempt right it's in the it's in the
process to use somewhat of a cliche you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
process to use somewhat of a cliche you
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.639
process to use somewhat of a cliche you
know there's this I know I'll close with

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
know there's this I know I'll close with
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.889
know there's this I know I'll close with
this and it's a good way to close you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899
this and it's a good way to close you
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.150
this and it's a good way to close you
know and this is a psychological

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
know and this is a psychological
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.479
know and this is a psychological
observation the the central figure of

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
observation the the central figure of
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.040
observation the the central figure of
Western culture is Christ

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
Western culture is Christ
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.140
Western culture is Christ
and we can look at that psychologically

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
and we can look at that psychologically
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.520
and we can look at that psychologically
because Christ is the dying and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
because Christ is the dying and
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.590
because Christ is the dying and
resurrecting hero and what does that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
resurrecting hero and what does that
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.680
resurrecting hero and what does that
mean psychologically well it means that

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690
 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.390
you learn things painfully and when you

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
you learn things painfully and when you
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.910
you learn things painfully and when you
learn something painfully a part of you

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
learn something painfully a part of you
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.690
learn something painfully a part of you
has to die

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
has to die
 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.720
has to die
that's the pain you know when a dream is

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730
that's the pain you know when a dream is
 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.210
that's the pain you know when a dream is
shattered for example a huge part of you

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
shattered for example a huge part of you
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.280
shattered for example a huge part of you
that constituted that dream maybe even

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
that constituted that dream maybe even
 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.020
that constituted that dream maybe even
the biological substrate of that gene

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
the biological substrate of that gene
 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.110
the biological substrate of that gene
has to be stripped away and burned and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
has to be stripped away and burned and
 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.770
has to be stripped away and burned and
so life is a constant process of death

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
so life is a constant process of death
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.520
so life is a constant process of death
and rebirth and to participate in that

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
and rebirth and to participate in that
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.070
and rebirth and to participate in that
fully is to allow yourself to be

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
fully is to allow yourself to be
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.940
fully is to allow yourself to be
redeemed by it and so the good is that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950
redeemed by it and so the good is that
 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.120
redeemed by it and so the good is that
process of death and rebirth voluntarily

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130
process of death and rebirth voluntarily
 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.310
process of death and rebirth voluntarily
undertaken it's like you're not as good

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320
undertaken it's like you're not as good
 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.930
undertaken it's like you're not as good
as you could be so you let that part of

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
as you could be so you let that part of
 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.610
as you could be so you let that part of
you die and if someone comes along and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
you die and if someone comes along and
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.820
you die and if someone comes along and
says you know there's some dead wood

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830
says you know there's some dead wood
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.220
says you know there's some dead wood
here man it needs to be burned off you

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230
here man it needs to be burned off you
 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.540
here man it needs to be burned off you
think well that stuff's still a bit

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550
think well that stuff's still a bit
 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.550
think well that stuff's still a bit
alive when that burns it's gonna hurt

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560
alive when that burns it's gonna hurt
 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.340
alive when that burns it's gonna hurt
it's like yeah well no kidding

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350
it's like yeah well no kidding
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.440
it's like yeah well no kidding
but maybe the thing that emerges in its

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
but maybe the thing that emerges in its
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.510
but maybe the thing that emerges in its
place is something better and I think

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520
place is something better and I think
 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.730
place is something better and I think
this is the secret of human beings this

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740
this is the secret of human beings this
 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.620
this is the secret of human beings this
is what we're like you know unlike any

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630
is what we're like you know unlike any
 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.140
is what we're like you know unlike any
other creature is that we can let our

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
other creature is that we can let our
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.840
other creature is that we can let our
old selves die and let our new selves be

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850
old selves die and let our new selves be
 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.050
old selves die and let our new selves be
born and that's what we should do and so

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060
born and that's what we should do and so
 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.180
born and that's what we should do and so
where do I fall short in these twelve

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190
where do I fall short in these twelve
 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.170
where do I fall short in these twelve
rules well endlessly because well here's

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
rules well endlessly because well here's
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.150
rules well endlessly because well here's
a way of thinking about it until the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160
a way of thinking about it until the
 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.880
a way of thinking about it until the
entire world is redeemed we all fall

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890
entire world is redeemed we all fall
 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.010
entire world is redeemed we all fall
short and that's probably a good place

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020
short and that's probably a good place
 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:06.490
short and that's probably a good place
to stop

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500
 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.700
you

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710
you
 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.309
you
