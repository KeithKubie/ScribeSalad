00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.150
In the last video, we saw
how blood sugar concentration

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.270
or glucose concentration in
your blood of 80 milligrams

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:17.190
per deciliter was kind of a
normal fasting blood glucose

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.320
if you hadn't eaten for
eight hours or before a meal.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.910
And the fancy word we learned in
the last video was preprandial.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.860
What I want to do in this
video, because 80 milligrams

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.250
per deciliter really doesn't
make a lot of tangible sense

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.960
to me, I don't know
exactly how much

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.437
sugar that is, what
I want to do is

00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:35.020
try to put this in
the different units

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.550
so that we can
better conceptualize

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.970
how much sugar that
might be in our body.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.280
So let's just do a little bit
of unit analysis over here.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.957
So if we have 80
milligrams per deciliter,

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:50.290
that's what we're talking about.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.340
That's a normal fasting
blood glucose level.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490
Now let's think about how
much that is per liter.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.080
A deciliter is 1/10
of a liter, so if we

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.719
want to cancel out the
units, we want deciliters,

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.260
we have deciliters
in the denominator

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.830
here, so we want another
deciliter in the numerator.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.490
So we want to know
deciliters per liter,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.030
because then that and
that will cancel out.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.000
And there are 10
deciliters per liter.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.480
And so that gives us 80
times 10 is 800 milligrams

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.410
per deciliters cancel
out, milligrams per liter.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.399
Now, if we want that in terms
of grams, we can just multiply,

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.940
we want to get rid
of this milligram,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.760
so we want that in
the denominator.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.510
Milligrams, we want
grams per milligram.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.140
1 gram is 1,000 milligrams.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.720
So once again,
milligrams cancel out,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.466
and then you have
800 divided by 1,000.

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:51.460
So 800/1,000 is 0.8
grams per liter.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.980
Let me start over here.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.260
So we have 0.8 grams per liter,
and then to make sense relative

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.310
to a normal human body, I
looked this up on the internet,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.510
the average human body,
and so I'm assuming,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.560
I'm like 5'9", 150 pounds.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.410
I think I'm pretty
close to average.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.440
But they say the average human
body has about five liters

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.640
of blood.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.320
So let's multiply this times 5
liters per human, per average

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.650
human, obviously, a small
human will have less,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.100
and a very large
person will have

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.000
more blood flowing through them.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.070
But this is an average
person right over here.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.760
So then we get the liters cancel
out, and so we get 0.8 times 5.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.646
8 times 5 is 40,
0.8 times 5, going

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:42.630
to have one decimal
place, it's to be 4.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.390
0.8 times 5 is 4, and then
we have grams per human.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.320
4 grams per human.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.165
And just to get an idea
of what four grams are,

00:02:53.165 --> 00:03:01.300
1 teaspoon is
equal to 4.2 grams.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.090
So 4 grams is almost
a teaspoon, so it's

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.714
approximately 1 teaspoon
of glucose per human being.

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:14.130
So in your entire
bloodstream, you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.320
have about a teaspoon
of sugar that your cells

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.720
can use to do whatever
cells need to do.
