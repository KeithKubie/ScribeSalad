Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. And I am just checking in on you. A voice is still fucked up. I got two more records, people episode nine and number 10 where a just broke number 10 we're almost done. Which means all freckles is then going to be doing a bunch of spots around loss of Congolese getting ready for my European tour tour tour tour. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which starts off in Dublin, Ireland, Dublin, Ireland in a, you know what's funny is I tried to get on on July 31st it starts off and I tried to get a, you know, get a direct flight to the Emerald Aisle and the a at this point because I waited so long to get the fucking tickets, um, you know, which is a whole other story in itself, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Cause I'm going to take a vacation with my wife afterwards and she was trying to figure out where the fuck we were going to go. And I was like, lady, you better fucking figure out a place soon cause this is gonna cost me a fortune there. Um, so, uh, turns out the out of lax, the only two airlines, it was air Lingus and um, uh, what the fuck is it? Oh Jesus, I already forgot the name of the what the Hell is an Ethiopian Airlines? Okay. Figure that one out. I don't want to fly you the open airlines and let some go into like, you know, Ethiopia, Aer Lingus, the Irish one. You know, is that weird? Like if I'm going to go to the Middle East, I want to fly you, uh, that whatever United Air Emirates.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       I don't, it's just weird superstition that I have like the people at Ethiopian Airlines don't care cause they're flying to Ireland. Does that make any sense? It doesn't, that's just how scary flying us. Like if I'm going to Poland, I want a couple of Polish guy flying it despite all the jokes about them. Hey, how many Polish guys is it take to fly a plane? A fucking, hopefully two of them, you know, that studied all the shit they needed to know. So aer Lingus was more expensive and I said, well fuck it. I'm going to take the, I don't even know if that's the Irish one for some reason. I think that's the one with the four leaf clover or is it so you've got a Leprechaun on the fucking tailfin. Let me look this up. Air Lingus latee every Irish guy's giving me shit about my bad accent. Like I give a fuck. All right. Air Lingus images. Yeah, there it is. Oh, it's a three leaf clover. Put another fucking leaf on there yet. [inaudible] make me feel a little better. Oh Jesus. Is that the best plane that got? Oh boy. That looks like just some shit from the early seventies all right, let's look at Ethiopia. Where Ethiopian air lines. There is no food on this plane. Sorry. Ethiopian Airlines. Let's see what we got here. What do we got here?

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       I'm not going to lie to you. Both of these planes still look these. Neither one of these are very, uh Oh look at this steward assists. They look pretty fine. They didn't have any stewards for the Irish once. They probably all hammered. Could I have any more stereotypes in this?

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       all right. They both live professional. Who's kidding? Who? You know what it is once you travel outside of your own country, you know what I mean? I fly American Airlines. I fly United, I fly shit that I've heard of. I've always done that. Except early on in my career when I used to fly like fucking, what the fuck was that one? It was air something or other. I felt like ATA,

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       I mean you, you flew on that fucking airlines. It was like, like the cabin to the left of cockpit was open. They were up there playing like connect four and shit. It was, it was really bad. I'm done. I'll tell you. It was bad, you know? Um, no, it was, it was just like, it was still weirdest thing. You'd been in an in an airport and just feeling like you were in America and then you'd get on ATA and you literally felt like you were leaving a war torn country. Like you just look around like what the fuck did all these extras come from? Am I, am I in a my, in some fucking, uh, George Clooney movie that's some important George, one of those selling arms for some shit, you know, a very important story that needed to be tell w told we are filmmakers and this is what we do.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       You know George, they said this script was floating around Hollywood for a while. Well, you know, of good looking and I said I'm going to do it. So it got made. Um, oh, I got a call out fucking Michael Rappaport. Okay, okay. And you know, you would think that I'm going to call him out for the fact that his resting face, you never heard of resting bitch face. You know what his face looks like. It looks like. Do you remember that face Danny Ainge would make after he got called for a foul? That's what his resting face looks like. All right. Now I love this man except what he talks about. I've never seen somebody hate on Boston sports the way he does. Right? So he wrote some more bullshit about Boston sports. So I call him up breaking his balls going through, you know what you wrote us in true laughing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       We have a great fucking time. He goes on the Internet like some real housewife whore. Right? And you know what he said? He said, wow, bill Burgess called me up like a threatening make blah blah blah and all this fucking, hey, he's out. He's tweeting like some Instagram whore that's just trying to get fucking followers. I don't understand it Michael, if somebody send you into this clip right now, I even told them how fucking he was being above Boston sports. Nike. I guess he was freaking out that, that the Celtics might get Kevin Durant, which um, you know, who's kidding deal with the whole free agency game? This is how it works as a fan. Everybody doesn't like it unless the free agent comes to their team. That's basically it. But at the end of the day, even when they do come to your team in the back of your head, you know it's bullshit,

Speaker 3:          00:06:26       right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       I mean whatever. Yeah. Ut you're getting fucked over by your team. You want to go make some more money, fine. But I'm talking when you're an elite fucking player and you go to pile on another fucking team. And I'm talking as a Celtics Fan. When we did that in, what was it? Oh eight the only thing that made it decent was that the Lakers had a bunch of free agents. So we met in the finals and it was sort of, it was like the 80s in that those two teams were in the finals back to back years. But I mean it was, it was bullshit. Like I don't look at the o eight Celtics, like it was a blur. We went from last place to first place. We won the fucking thing and then we played them again next year in the finals and the referee's called 9,000 files on us.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       And like 15 on the fucking Lakers. And for some reason that was considered a good game, seven to, I don't know, but that's the NBA, you know, every once in a while they have a mobbed up ref. You know, Patrick Ewing goes to the Knicks. Yeah. You know, it's a business. Um, but I think, cause I, I when I look at the NFL where they got the parody there and uh, all of a sudden, you know, the Seahawks out of fucking nowhere can win one, you know, fucking patriots stunk for fucking ever. All of a sudden we got good, you go up, you go down these guys when those guys, you know, it's nice and fucking everybody kind of has a chance now and that's been great. Their ratings are better than ever as far as I know. And I think the, the route that the NBA is going is they create these super teams and people hate them so much that they watch rooting for them to lose.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       And um, I dunno, I liked it better. I mean back in the day, like I said, there was free agency in that type of shit, but it wasn't just the way it is now. The amount of times where people pull the old Johnny Damon where you fall, I guess Daymond one with the red sox and then like the next year or whatever, he goes through the fucking Yankees. It's just like what Jesus Christ. Can you, can you ease your way around the fact that it's just a business and it's all about money, you know? Um, I dunno, I actually don't know how Kevin Duran really helps the warriors in a way. You know, they had their two guys that were the guys and then he's coming in and, and a lot of ways he's at least number two, depending on what you think about the fucking, uh, the fucking honor roll student there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       Um, I dunno. I know people say they just want to win, but I don't, I think egos get hurt when you know, you, you used to get 25 points a game and now you're down to like 21 or 19. I Dunno. We'll see. What the fuck happens. But uh, that sucked. I was really hoping he was going to stay in Oklahoma. I'm not gonna lie to you. I was hoping that, uh, you know, after last year where they were up three games to one, that they were going in the off season to be like, you know what the fuck happened? We don't know how, we don't know how to win. We don't know how to close somebody out. And what I loved about watching the warriors come back against Oklahoma as much as I was rooting for Oklahoma is you got to watch a championship team like w w what the warriors did be in down three games to one.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       Coming back in that series was, it was fucking hilarious to me. Like watching them, it was like, you remember the horror movie? Like they never changed their pace when they were down. They didn't panic. They just kept coming. You know, it was like those old school monster movies from the 80s where the fucking Jason Guy, right, is just walking in. The victim is running away. He's the victims running the monsters walking. But the person running keeps looking over their shoulder. So they keep tripping over logs and shit. Right. So eventually the fucking deal with the hatchet walks them down and puts him out of their misery. That's what, that's what fucking the warriors did to Oklahoma. Yeah. Geez, I'm such, was that too sophisticated for you? You know, I got to tell you, watching the warriors come back against Oklahoma was like watching Friday the 13th part three. Oh Geez. Um, so I've seen a bunch of teams do that be better than the other team. They just didn't know how to fucking win. And then what happens is, as a sports fan, you get to watch them learn how to win. You get to watch him. We'll share as a faculty, that's what you get to watch. Unless the best guy goes, you know what? I don't feel like learning that's going to go join the team that came back and kicked our ass. I mean, can you imagine if movies were like that?

Speaker 4:          00:11:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       All right. There's like the nerd getting beat up by the bully. You know, there's like five nerds getting beat up by these five bullies, right? It's five on five, right? And then the third act is not the fucking nerds figure out how to beat down the bullies. One of the nerds joints, the other bullies, and then helps them go back and beat up all his friends. I mean, granted, I guess that kind of be funny if you're a sick fuck like me, but at the end of the day, I mean I that kind of movie is that,

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       well, maybe act two is that he goes to fucking golden state and the next three is he comes back and he has one of those Lebron James type movies. I don't fucking know. All I know is a, you know, I kinda got back into the NBA this year. I started watching the Celtics and that type of shit and that was a great rivalry out west and now it's no more. Did you hear what Chiles Bark Barkley? Oh, it's a great Boston named dude. Fucking chows Barkley said fucking Kevin Durant's a cheetah. Not Cheating like Tom Brady. That was bullshit. Cheek like Kevin Duran. He's not on our team, so I'll hold them to the fizz feet to the fire.

Speaker 5:          00:12:26       Um, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       no cheating like Jim or say,

Speaker 5:          00:12:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       He said that. Yeah, he's trying to cheat his way to a championship. He used the wrong word, but I understand what he's saying. He's just, he's just a fucking, yeah, he just, he left the nerd table. He CA's go to the bully table and then he's going to come back and beat up the notes. That'd be like, well, look, I'll make, I'm a tough guy over here. Um, isn't it amazing how much taller Kevin Durant is than me? And I'm still giving him shit. That's the wonderful thing about podcasting is you can fucking talk shit within the safety of your own living room. All right, whatever. I'm going to get off this fucking topic, but, uh, I did in fact to confirm Michael Rappaport's real housewife tweet, by the way, is there anyone, can somebody please Photoshop him into one of those real housewife fucking things? We had a great conversation laughing our balls off when we came to an agreement in the end of it and that Danny Ainge look in, motherfucker goes on the Internet and he, he tweets 180 letters or less about me.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       By the way, I have to apologize for a, I love Michael Rep for it. I, you know, every time I see him, I always feel like this is the last time I'm ever gonna see him. You know, there's just something about him, even though he's younger than me, he just moves around like he's in his eighties. I think he has that disease, you know that disease Brad Pitt had in that movie where he was like a fucking old baby. Whenever the fuck happened. I don't know if that's what he wrote. He reminds no, I was just a fable. Right. Where's it called? The fairy tale. Whatever. He fucking, he's like that, you know, you know, like when a fucking eight year old looks like this 70, whatever that disease is called. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:14:08       um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       I was going to see George Meichin. That's not, that wasn't the guy who was the guy who played on Ohio state. I went to Portland. That poor passed it. The microfractures in his feet, like he's playing in China now. I can't remember. I'm thinking is haven Moses. And I only play for the Broncos in the 70s. I want to say his name was George, wasn't it? Okay. We got to look this up now. How's State Ohio? How State? Uh, Portland micro fracture. Mike, not microbrewery. Get the fuck out of my growth. Breweries are the worst today.

Speaker 6:          00:14:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       All right. What's his name? What's his name? Greg [inaudible]. Michael Rappaport has Greg Oden disease.

Speaker 6:          00:15:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       It does it like Greg Oden. He got paid a ton of fucking money and he didn't follow through if he got paid. The, the, the, uh, national, uh, podcasting association drafted him, number one to come on to, into the podcasting world to talk about sports, thinking that he was going to be unfair. No thinking that he was going to be biased and fair. I came, you fucking talk this morning. Oh my God, I can't wait to do his podcast again. You know, who's kidding, who were both a couple of real housewives? You know what I mean? I think I'm slightly better looking than him though. Slightly, you know, and a little more mobile, you know, I think I bring a lot more to a team. I'm like Spike [inaudible], right? Utility player him. I don't know what he is. He's like a fucking Rappaport's like a fucking, you know, he's like dead d h You know, his career's over, you know, he can't touch his toes, so they can't have him play first base. He just sits on the bench seat and sunflower seeds gets up three, four times a game. Squinting into the fucking Sun. He just sneaks through the fences, grounds out and do a double play. Kills the rally, you know? But he's got such a big contract, they can't get rid of him.

Speaker 6:          00:16:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       He's like Greg Luzinski. If you went on a diet, I let him know. No disrespect to Greg Lissitzky. All right. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about here. Oh, Formula One. Right.

Speaker 6:          00:16:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       I needed to apologize. Um, because when I was say, when I watched the Austrian Grand Prix that it was like fucking days of thought and I said Louis Hamilton was like the Tom Cruise, the upstart. I add a completely wrong and I want to thank everybody on Twitter that set me straight so eloquently. Hey, fuck stick. Um, I guess Lewis Hamilton, he's been, he's, he's won at three times. He's a 31 fucking years old and he's already won the a for me one championship three times. He won it in 2008 2014 and 2015 Nico Rosberg has never won. So the reality is, is that Nico was the Tom Cruise, right? And Louis Hamilton is the val Kilmer. He's the ice man. That's right. Ice Man. I am dangerous. And then Lewis Hamilton clicks his teeth together for no fucking reason. Right? They're all sweaty and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       I Dunno. All I know is the British Grand Prix is a, is this fucking ah, is this Sunday and that dude toto, I swear to God, that's his fucking nick. All I want to do when I wake up in the morning is not, see the team crash. Um, sat down with them. It was just like, listen, alright, right. Stop fucking driving into each other mate. Whatever the fuck he said. I don't know where he's from. I think he's just, I think he is from Austria. Who knows. I'm new to this sport and I just like throwing up shit as fact. You know what I mean? And why would I, why would I actually waste the time to read up on this sport when I can just make big fucking statements and people on Twitter will correct me anyways, you know, then I don't have to look it up. All I gotta do is just scroll, you know, that's why these kids are so fucking dumb today.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       You know, they don't read books the way I used to, you know, three hours in, I'm 17 pages in my fucking a ds off the fucking chart. Right. Sitting there reading about Tom Sawyer. You don't think about, I dunno what you know the Queen Mary God knows whatever was said in that fucking book that made me think of something else. Apples houses, some sort of arsenic in there. And how many apples would you have to do eat to actually poison yourself? You know, eat so many fucking apples. What do you think? There's arsenic assumption, you know the apple, some sort of poison. I can't remember what, but if you ate enough of them, right, you'd actually die in that. Somebody would actually bet to say eulogy. You know, an apple a day does in fact keep the doctor away. But a, you know, eat 42 of them. You're gonna fucking die.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       But you know what? He died the fruity. Whoa. Um, anyways, let's, let's read some of the fucking horse shit here for this week. Let's read some of the advertising.

I Dunno cause you fucking cause it fits because a truly customized mattress will cost you five or 10,000 bucks. Ah, that's the reason. Who the fuck has the money to do that?

I used to know what these things were called. Parade a progress image. The GM Futurliner looked that fucking thing up. I mean, granted, it's kind of cool, but it is, it's like an easy bake oven that you can drive and somebody paid four point $1 million for that fucking thing, you know? And all I said, all I could think was what was he doing in 2008 when the fucking economy crashed other than doing fucking cartwheels out the back door of whatever fucking bank he worked at. Oh bill was that social commentary. You freckled cut? Just shut up and read the advertising. All right, up. Here we go. Hello everybody. Helix.

I, I understand what's going on over there. The banks are sewing up all your fucking countries.

Speaker 1:          00:27:01       It's like when you fucking buy a a a Co op, you know, versus a condo. You buy a Condo, the person next to you can be a fucking junkie who gives a shit. You still got your condo. But if you're in a co op playoffs, if you're in a co-op, this is the deal. What you're, you're not buying an apartment. What you're doing is you're buying shares in the building, but now you're tied in with the whole building. So basically if your neighbors, enough of your neighbors go bankrupt and the whole, the whole building goes under, you lose your shares and you either have to move out of your apartment or you go back to renting it and you're like, wait a minute, I thought I bought it. No, no, no sir. You bought shares in the building. You paid your way, but these other kinds didn't.

Speaker 1:          00:27:48       And because they didn't, you go down to the bottom of the lagoon with them. That to me is what the European Union is, right? And that's what banks want, right? And they just fucking bankrupt them. And, uh, I don't know what the fuck they do. They play that little fucking game. They buy low and then they fucking go high. And I'll fuck, could they pull the money out and everybody falls in their fucking ass and then they got another castle. You know? I think that that's how the economy works, right? And it's all run by shapeshifters. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       Just shit like that. You know what I mean? Especially when I'm in London and those stupid fucking critics show up, Ugh, fucking guys, critics are the fucking worse. There's nothing you can do. There's no show that you can have that they're not going to rip the shit out of it. It's just fucking hilarious to me. It's like I don't need critics. All right. If I wanted to feel bad about having a good show, I just call my mom. I don't fucking need you to be doing our job. You all right? Whatever. All right. July 31st everybody. Dublin, Ireland. Alright, then August 1st I'm in Belfast. I've never been there. Belfast, Ireland, the fuck is his Belfast UK. All right. It's Ireland. I think it's about time England got the fuck out of there. Um, can you imagine saying that as American seriously, you know, is we are putting up cheesecake factories in the Middle East. All right. August 1st, Belfast UK. Um, August 2nd, I'm in Galway, Ireland. Uh, which is way out on the west coast and evidently the closest airport is like a fucking hour away from it. So I don't understand what this is. This is, it seems like, should I ruin it? And actually fucking Google some pictures of it. Call Away Ireland. Let's see. We got here. Oh

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       my God. Jesus Christ. I knew it. I know. This is going to be, what are these fucking a, which is a warlock, one of those fucking movies type cities. Harry Potter. Look at this fucking place. Oh my God. I'm only spending a day there.

Speaker 4:          00:29:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       Wow. Look at the fucking castles. Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:30:07       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       I'm going to drive in there, do the show, and then I got to drive right back so I can make my flight. What the fuck am I going?

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       Did I fuck it up? Where am I going next? Alright, I'm go to a [inaudible], then I fly to a Bristol, uh, England and then Manchester, England, the, a sober, sophisticated Manchester. I'm thinking that's going to be a nice mellow crowd. Fucking loaded ticks. Um, that's what I'm anticipating in Manchester. I, I'm anticipating they're going to be a bunch of fucking lunatics, which is a, which is fine by me. I, um, I grew up Massachusetts, you know, um, London, England, August 5th and August 6th with the country critics. Uh, August 7th, I'll be in Amsterdam and then August 8th, I will be in Edinburgh, uh, for two shows. All right. So we got a late show too. Okay. Um, then I've got a couple days off where I'll be hanging out with other orange headed consts like myself. And then August 11th, I'm in Germany, Cologne, Germany, bodywash, Germany. Then August 12th, I'm in Antwerp, Belgium.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       Oh look at this. August 27th, I'm in Reno, Reno, Nevada, Reno, Nevada. And at that point we will be only a couple of months away from that fucking kitchen. T V square headed, fucking safe, crazy eyes smiling psycho from becoming the next fucking president of the United States. Oh, that's going to be a rough one. Watching all these ladies saying how fucking, what an important date is for women. I guess it will be because a woman will be elected president is just my prediction here. All right. But uh, Jesus Christ couldn't, we have gotten one that didn't have 58 pending fucking felonies. That's not a red flag. Anybody,

Speaker 1:          00:32:14       you know, I don't know. What are you going to do? Those are our choices. I don't know why. A fucking maniac who, you know, doesn't know how to use email properly. You know, sending out secrets to a friends. Um, and then some fucking guy who's a, I dunno, who really should just be a carnival barker. I feel like Trump should just standing next to some impossible game to win. Talking about how it's the greatest game ever. You know, who's he hits on underage chicks. Um, I don't know. That's just, just, just the opinions of somebody who, uh, can't pronounce words while he reads out loud what he thought. He say that Cleo, that c a, that's the podcast here for this, uh, this Thursday afternoon,

Speaker 5:          00:33:00       um,

Oh, I, you know what, somebody please send me a fucking whatever you see a Photoshop picture of fucking Rappaport's face on Danny Angel's body when he played for the Celtics. I really want to see that today. You can do whatever the fuck you want to do with my head.

Speaker 5:          00:33:17       You know, I don't give a fuck. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       that's it. All right. I got to go hit the elliptical. So I'm not a fucking fat fuck at the end of this writing season here. Congratulations to Kevin Durant. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:33:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       On your next, uh, on your, on your first championship rink. You know, I want to put together a standup tour like that. You know what I mean? I want to join like the, uh, like if Louis C K and Dave Chappelle, Dave Chappelle, we're doing like a standup tour. I'd somehow like, I not know. I don't know. I do like their next standup specials. I'll splice part of my hour in there and get credit. Uh, all right, that's it. Um, you guys have a great weekend. You conscious

Speaker 4:          00:34:01       and I'll, uh, I'll talk to you on Monday. Enjoy the music and, uh, another half hour of Monday morning podcast back from yesteryear. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:34:45       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:34:46       Nah, go to bed. [inaudible] my brain. [inaudible] t c is so to [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:35:13       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:35:13       with die. Geez.

Speaker 9:          00:35:20       Hey, what's going on? Is this still press and this is the Monday morning podcast that I'm actually doing from my [inaudible] home phone rather than my cell phone. I finally figured out how to call in this, this, this, this, my space. Uh, fucking Jesus Christ. I'm having one of those weeks. All right. I just talk. I just babbled for 12 minutes and decided that I didn't like it and now I have to fucking start all over again. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. You think I want to do this? I don't want to fucking do this.

Speaker 9:          00:35:53       You know, sometimes in life you gotta do what you got. Yeah. You the only, yeah, these fucking podcast, man. Yeah. How long these things take? Seven weeks. I get on here, you know, I just babble. It's fucking gold. Just half hour, just running my goddamn mouth out. And you have to think, and then there's other times it's, it's just, it's like shoveling wet snow. And you know what? I'm fucking sticking this one out cause I'm not gonna start over again. Eight sometimes. You know what? Sometimes you just not that funny. You fucking minds broken up or whatever. I don't know. Let's just get down to goddamn brass tax here and I'll let you know what I got going on. All right. My name is Bill Barr. This is my myspace page. This is my Monday morning podcast. I do one of these every goddamn week. Okay. Try to get people a nice laugh to start off the fucking weeks.

Speaker 9:          00:36:41       And a I, we start off in a good mood and then I ended up getting frustrated with my own ineptness and then I ended up just fucking, I dunno, I end up snapping and I say fuck a lot. All right. And uh, okay, let's get on with people ask me questions. I answer them. Look at me. I'm just, you know, I'm just blowing through this. Just blowing through the explanations. I usually take my time and explain this. You know what this is like, you ever like break your arm or something and you go to school. The next day instance, the first kid goes, hey man, what happened to your arm? Right? And you give them every last fucking detail. Okay. But then by the time you've told the fucking story to like the 12th person, by the time the 13th person comes up to you, you're like, I fucking fell down.

Speaker 9:          00:37:25       All right with the fucking thing happened. You know, that's the mindset I'm in right now as I do this podcast. After just blowing 12 minutes of your rising time on my home phone, I'm all right. Here we go. Let's get down with this shit. Hey, let's get it. Get on with it. I put up a new video because I am desperately trying to get myself to become part of the new millennium. Um, it's right underneath the podcast. If you look there, you'll see a very blurry, very blurry me in a Winnipeg jets shirt, by the way, because I'm old school, old school hooky. Um, let's meet at the punchline in Atlanta and before you watch the video, I just want to give you a little backstory of what happened. Uh, I was actually a, it was Thursday night and a couple of weeks ago and it's one of my favorite clubs now.

Speaker 9:          00:38:09       I was just having one of these awesome sets where I was, uh, I was really open and free and everything was just flowing as opposed to this podcast, which feels very arduous, free work like that. I used that word correctly. What the fuck is quest love learning those fucking lime green pants and just realized that I'm, anyways, I was having one of these, um, one of these just, you know, really open just great sets and I was about 12 minutes and everybody was laughing. Everybody's having a good time. I was having a good time, but for some reason there was this lady in the crowd and it wasn't enough that she felt my jokes were funny. She was somehow agreeing with the things that I was saying on stage. So rather than laughing at the end of every joke, you know, when the punchline came out, instead of laughing, she would just yell out Sankyo after every joke, you know, the rest of the crowd was, would be laughing and then I would just hear this woman's voice over everybody.

Speaker 9:          00:39:07       Hey Yo. So this video picks up about 12 minutes into my set. She's already yelled saying Geo like fucking 12 times. And I feel annoying. That is with me saying that to you. Just imagine being onstage trying to keep the crowd, trying to keep the fucking plate spinning and somebody keeps yelling that shit out. So she yells it out for I guess basically the sixth time and that's when I finally snapped. But I snapped in a good way. I was proud of myself where I didn't shop her head off and be overly mean. It was kind of mean, but it was definitely funny. And, um, I just want to let you guys know I'm, I'm going to start taping all my sets because, uh, you know, I riff a lot and I ended up, you know, missing a lot of good lines that I could keep in my act and also random shit happens and I'm going to start posting some of the random shit that, that, uh, happens up here.

Speaker 9:          00:40:02       Um, unless people really start to enjoy these and then they come out to my shows and then they deliberately try to yell out something, which is always the risk of it. But basically I like doing this kind of thing because I want to give you guys some new, some new laughs without having to burn any material. You know what I mean? I mean, I'm not treading Reznor here. I can't just give away my new hour for free. You know, like he can, I'm jealous musicians, right? They can just fucking put the goddamn music out for free now. And then everybody comes to their shows and when they know all the words, they get to sing along. So it's different than he can go. You know, we're going to break it down. Detroit, we're going to break it down here, right? And then he, then he slows the fucking song down and then everybody go whatever things the music level down and everybody sings along.

Speaker 9:          00:40:46       You can't do that with jokes. Maybe if I started singing my jokes, maybe I'll do that. I'll come with a fucking Ukulele on stage, you know, I could fucking sing. That's why guitar racks blow up, man telling you fucking telling you. I heard about some kid in Massachusetts. He's a kid, he's been putting funny songs up on Youtube for the last year and he just sold out the comedy connection. It's like 17 fucking years old, you know, long. It took me to sell at the comedy connection. 15 fucking years telling jokes. You know why? Because I don't sing. I would just sing my God damn jokes. What's the deal with labs? Everybody? If I would just do that, if I would just do that, I don't know you. I don't know what would happen. You know something you always want to think, you know, if I just did that, then I'd be here.

Speaker 9:          00:41:40       You never think of all the failed guitar racks. You know the ones that you guys don't see. You just see the successful ones. You know the ones with their half hour specials, the ones selling up theaters. All right? You don't see the ones that opened for me when I go to Portland, Oregon, or at least when I did back in the day, way back in the day, 10 years ago, he's played a club called Harvey's and all I remember was the walls were green and the guy used to, he used to give the whole show away, which basically he would have telemarketers call people up and just be like, Hey, guess what? You've won tickets to it. You went for free tickets to a comedy show. And the people would be like, Holy Shit, how the fuck did I win? Knows I didn't even enter the contest, you know?

Speaker 9:          00:42:26       Well, you won them because a comedy was not selling well 10 years ago. So these to give away, basically they've given away the show. He'd walked into this fucking place. It'd be a Tuesday, you know, I'd tell Mosey and, and I'm thinking, all right, the Tuesday, it'll be half full. No one knows who the fuck I am. I lean on the Mike stand, I'll riff, I'll get some new jokes. And you would walk in there and you would think that Springsteen was going to come off. It was jam packed 400 fucking drunk ass people who didn't know me and did not give a shit whether the show was good or not really, because they already felt like they had already won. They got free tickets. So you would go up there and it would just be, it'd be a fucking zoo. It would be an absolute zoo.

Speaker 9:          00:43:07       And, uh, a lot of lumberjacks that, that was the vibe I got. You know, Oregon has a lot of trees and you'd be down there in Portland and you'd be thinking, all right, it's very crunchy, very sort of a progressive. But, uh, you know, those cuts don't come out to shows. The lumberjacks would come out, they'd be screaming and yelling and eating burgers that would have fried eggs on the top of them. And, uh, and it sucked. And I don't even know why I'm talking about this. I already forgot I spaced halfway through that fucking story because, um, cause that's the mindset I'm in this week. I, you know, is I got a zillion fucking things I gotta take care of. Cause I'm on my way to Pittsburgh this week and I'm flying in a day early, uh, to do, um, I'm doing a lot of radio this week cause I'm going to try to sell that fucking place out.

Speaker 9:          00:43:52       I want to be on a wd VIII with Randy Bowman this week. Um, and if I had any fucking brains, I would've looked that up and giving you a, I don't know, it's 100 point something. I think if you live in Pittsburgh, you can listen to me and I'll be young and say, you listen to me in the morning, Wednesday morning, Thursday morning and Friday morning, and then you come out on the weekend, you check out my show. Just a little love ago. I'd just come onto my goddamn show. Okay. I don't know fucking, I don't want to tell you. Um, please, I don't want to stand there alone. I care that that mall is the most depressing fucking mall in America for those of you who've never been to it. That Pittsburgh Improv is in a mall called the stacks. Um, why did they call it the stacks? Basically? Because I guess the mall used to be a steel mill.

Speaker 9:          00:44:39       Okay. When we used to have industry in this country before they started telling us that everything was too expensive to make in this country. So they had to, you know, ship it to a third world country and have some eight-year-old killed kid make fucking spittoons or whatever the fuck it is. You make an a goddamn steel steel mill, right. Rather than being like, no. All Americans are involved with unions and they want health insurance and they want to get paid for their work. They, they, they just, they, they just fucking picked up and left. But this is what they did. They knocked down the factory, but they, uh, they kept the stacks.

Speaker 10:         00:45:15       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:45:16       Just to remind you that, that people, uh, you know, there's, this reminded me, might even be a Poulter guys. You know, you move the headstones, but you didn't move the bodies. That's what they did at that mall. They moved the factory, but they left the smoke stacks. That's what they did to remind you that hardworking Americans used to have jobs there and they could support their families and they made shit out of steel that other Americans would then buy, okay? And the dollar was worth something, but they got rid of all that. They shifted somewhere else and in its wake they left fucking cheesecake factory's lucky jeans and the fucking cold stone creamery.

Speaker 10:         00:46:07       Okay?

Speaker 9:          00:46:08       But in tribute to all those people that they fucked over, they left the chimneys. Isn't that nice? A little nod to the past and now they're fucking kids. What are they doing? What are they? Where do they work? You haven't noticed that when you meet people and they come up to you, you ask them what the fuck they do? You don't. You can't eat. You don't even know what it is.

Speaker 9:          00:46:31       What do you do? I worked in a steel mill, okay. You work in a mill, there's steel there and you work there. So you work with steel in a mill. I get that. I understand what that job is. What do you do? I'm the Milkman. Okay. You're a man. There's milk and you fucking deliberate, man. You're the milk man. I get it. I fucking get it. You realize how many jobs there are that people actually understand what the fuck it is you do now. There's very few left. I'm a mailman. I'm a man. I deliver mail. I'm the fucking mail man. Back then they was simple, simple fucking names. All right. I'm a silver Smith. All right? Smith meaning, uh, like to, to hit with a hammer like smite. And I would do it with silver. A fucking silversmith. All right. There wasn't any, the uh, the regional director of the fucking, you know, so I can't even, I can't even give you an example of somebody's job.

Speaker 9:          00:47:26       I'm trying to think of the, the, all these computer. I sit in a cubicle and make somebody else's dream happen. I'm telling you right now, man, it's just sitting in a fucking cubicle. Just do something rebellious today. Just take one of the screws out of your fake. I don't really have an office wall that they put in front of you to make you feel like you have half an office. But the reality is they don't want you looking at other people. You know, I think I've talked about this before. Do you guys ever see that movie, the apartment starring a Jack Lemon? If you see the beginning of that movie, that's what the cubicle area used to look like. You still had a sea of people, you know, slugging away looking like a bunch of goddamn salmon swimming upstream with fucking typewriters in front of them. But they didn't have walls around them like they were on punishment. You know, you could look at the person next to you shoot the shit, but then somewhere along the line they're like, oh, the fucking talking. We can't have them looking at themselves. They're literally treating you like children.

Speaker 9:          00:48:28       It's just, I don't know, it's just fucking, it just blows my mind. You know what I mean? I, I, I'd rather sell drugs. All right. Um, so anyways, this is the, yeah, this is the Monday morning podcast and, uh, people send me questions if you new to my page, if you haven't defected to fucking Facebook, like the fact that you are, you know what I mean? I love these people go into Facebook now, like, like the same herd of assholes that went from Friendster to my space. Isn't, isn't gonna, you know, they're not going to eventually end up over there. Like there's not going to be a bunch of spam about ringtones and a bunch of whores with the bud cracks and their titties hanging out, you know, sending you generic emails trying to make it seem like they didn't send it to everybody else, but you realize that they did because rather than calling you by your name, it just says, Hey, you love your page by the way.

Speaker 9:          00:49:26       I'm the fucking Nokia phone whore the month or whatever the hell they, you know, all those stupid beauty contest things that they go to when, um, I'm sticking it out here, man. All right. And all you guys who all going over to Facebook, you know what you're like, you like the, you ever see that movie, that titanic where as those guys, you know who fucking jumped in into the rafts all by themselves, those self, his sons of bitches who were actually smart, who listened to that voice that says I need to fucking survive. Well maybe they are smart, then maybe they realize that my space, maybe my space is a sinking ship. You know, I don't know. That'd be actually kind of funny. No it wouldn't because they've already made their money off it. Rupert Murdoch already brought about the same in $1 billion already fucking content. Um, all right, I answered questions here.

Speaker 9:          00:50:16       I'm really just babbling here. Um, I answered questions here every week. People send me questions. Um, I try to answer them to the best of my ability. And uh, here we go. Here are the, are the podcast for the week. Um, oh and by the way, when you watch my video, could you please send me a comment if you like it or whatever. Cause that's like a new thing that I really want to start doing. Just putting some random moments up there like that. Um, so, so let me, let me know. Let me know what you think. Okay. Question number one. Hey Bill, which one was better? Mike Richters insane. Save against Pavelle bewray that's how you saying Pablo Obra number. Don't want to say these Russian guys names is insane. Save against his penalty shot or Patrick Wall. Mike Vernon going at its center rights. I'm definitely going to say Mike Richter just because, uh, that was, that was one of the best years ever in hockey.

Speaker 9:          00:51:07       That was like 2004 when the red sox finally wanted to watch the ranges. Finally win the cup and everybody go crazy. That was just an amazing moment. And uh, the Patrick Wa my burning thin, you know, I don't know. It's, it was, you know, it was a great fight. It's great to see Patrick while loose. But you know, that other one was for the Stanley Cup. And I remember watching that in 1994 and watching the ranges went. And I remember thinking clearly that's what it's going to be like when the red sox, that they ever get their heads out of their asses and they finally fucking win one. That that's going to be what it's like. So a, I was living vicariously and for some reason I didn't hate the Rangers for the simple fact that I was not old enough when the rangers last time, the range is Bruins rivalry was great, which was back in the 70s.

Speaker 9:          00:51:57       I was still just a, a just a little lad with a big Motha fucking red hair looking like that dude Jody on a family affair. All right. And that's why I became a comedian because that's who the fuck I look like. And I got the shit kicked out of me. Um, all right, question number two, Bill. How the hell does Paris Hilton keep getting movie roles? Well, I actually thought about this one. And I think the reason that she keeps getting movie roles is because, uh, not to be crude, but, uh, she's not afraid to show the clam, you know, and, uh, I think, uh, you know, I think that's how, that's how you gotta deal with sometimes as a woman, you gotta you gotta just every once in a while you just gotta take your pussy out, you know, and, uh, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

Speaker 9:          00:52:48       Sharon Stone did it. Sharon Stone was, you know, meandering around all these fucking B movies. She, you know, she had it halfway decent roll and some sort of Schwartzenegger movie, but it wasn't until she showed the clam that people's, you know, sat up and took notice. Next thing you know, she's in that movie casino and delivered one of the best performances. I thought she, she, she was, she nominated for an Oscar. She should have won one that year. But that's when showing the clam kind of hurt her because all the other women resented her. You know what I mean? They thought that she was a whore rather than she did what she had to do. And I don't understand why women get upset when that like, you know, you're treating me like a a, you know, like a sexual object and it's like you are a sexual object.

Speaker 9:          00:53:39       You know what I mean? That's like you. I, I'm like, oh you're just fucking using me cause I can pick up heavy shit. I can pick up. I mean not extra heavy shit but heavier shit cause I'm a guy, you know, that's where Hillary Clinton fucked up her campaign when she fucking put on the pants suit, you know, she should have sexted up a little vamped it up. God gave you titties, use them, show little cleavage, you know what I mean? That's what she should've done. And people, you know, if you think that's still, that's stupid. You know, guys don't get elected because of their brains. Bill Clinton got elected because he played the saxophone on fucking Arsenio Hall and when our CTO came in to do the black handshake, somehow Bill Clinton was able to do it without fucking breaking his wrist. And I think that right there was, when was, when that was the turning of it.

Speaker 9:          00:54:35       What else did he do? We just sat there smiling with his mouth open going, Jane's American wants change. He didn't say anything. He played the fucking saxophone. So if you're a woman, you know, show little titty, share a little titty, that's all. That's all I could tell you. Oh God, I'm so ignorant. All right. Uh, question number three, uh, Bill, uh, [inaudible]. What the fuck is this one? Um, all right, thanks for answering my questions. Or this is an up and coming comedian. I competed in a funniest person contest in a city that I will not, I'm not gonna name cause I don't get this person in trouble. Just in case one of my 14 listeners is the club owner of that. Anyways, the owner said that he would not hire any of the comedians to work for any of the clubs because we were too vulgar.

Speaker 9:          00:55:22       The crazy thing is I noticed that it was an older crowd, but I was being stubborn and decided to do my normal routine, which was some dirty jokes. In your opinion, do you think you're selling out? If you adjust your comedic style to get into the big corporate clubs? Um, okay. Um, all right. I know what you're saying here. I've done the same thing. Um, I've looked out in the crowd going, okay, this is what I want to talk about. You look at them, you judge them and you go, well, I'm going to be eating my balls, at least 40% of my set if I stick with what I want to do. And um, yeah, when you 100% adjust your act, you yeah. You definitely, yeah. You feel dirty, you know, not, not them, not to use a pun there, but yeah. You don't feel good.

Speaker 9:          00:56:15       But, uh, it isn't 100% selling out if you know, I don't know. It's one of those weird things where it's your own judgment call. You know what I mean? Because I used to do those NACA things for the, for those of you who aren't comedians here, they have these things every year. Um, these, these national showcases for college gigs. And when I used to showcase for them, I would go up and I would just do my act, you know, and I remember one year, something that was going on in my app was the first time I got, you know, an HIV test and I was talking about the fear of it, which is, and it's really not a joke that you want to do on a college showcase. You just want to do you happy shit. And I did. And I was like, fuck dead man, I'm fucking selling out.

Speaker 9:          00:56:58       So I went up there and I did my shit and you know what, I got zero schools and I just got people, they kept coming up to me and going, we think you're hilarious. You know, they kept getting the whole world, who was up to me, I book you but I can't because of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And what I learned was sometimes you got to play the game a little bit. So what I would then do was I would go up, after that, I would go up into a squeaky clean set. Then I would book the colleges. And then when I went to the colleges, I would actually then do my act and then do the shit that I wanted to talk about. So in a weird way, I actually won cause I got the money and I still got to do what I wanted to do.

Speaker 9:          00:57:40       And I got people to hear the material, more people to hear the material that I want them to hear. I just had to be, uh, I had a wore myself out, you know, I had to put it on the Tuxedo for like fucking five, six minutes. Jesus, he just brought up a really bad fucking memory. Um, no, but dude, I would say, you know, on your way up. Yeah. Nobody wants, you know, a lot of headliners don't want to go on in front of a guy who kills. And they also don't want to go on in front of a guy who's, you know, if you, if you're being a little dirty, that gives them an excuse to kind of be like, not just say that I can't follow this guy. There'll be like, oh, he's just being dirty. So, uh, yeah, play the game a little bit.

Speaker 9:          00:58:20       You know, you play the game a little bit and then as people get to know who you are, you get way more leeway and eventually, uh, you get to do your thing. You know what I mean? It's one of those things. You gotta be like a tree, you know, Ben, but don't break, you know, I dunno. Do whatever the fuck you want to do, but you know, uh, I don't know. That's my 2 cents. I don't fucking know. I have no confidence in my goddamn opinion, so I don't know even know why you people ask me questions. All right. Question number four. Uh, Bill, have you been approached about doing any shows since your skits on Chappelle? Um, yeah, catch one every year and I try to get them on TV. But, um, for those of you who always ask me, how come you don't have your own TV show?

Speaker 9:          00:58:59       Because it's really hard. It's all I can tell you. Okay. It's very hard to get a show on TV because believe it or not, a lot of people want to get a show on television because you can make a lot of money. So, uh, I keep getting closer. Keep getting closer. Um, hey bill, what do you think about Shaq's rap about Coby? Who was the bigger d bag and this never ending saga? I think Shaq was just fucking around. I thought he was joking, but he wasn't joking, but he was joking. You know what I mean? I mean, if somebody gets arrested for a potential rape and they bring my name up during it, you know, um, I think I have the license to give him shit for awhile. If I'm in a club and I want to fucking, uh, make fun of him a little bit.

Speaker 9:          00:59:49       Yeah, I dunno. I just looked at chef's face. I thought he was clearly joking around and it was so over the top. Colby had, how's my ass taste? I mean, I dunno. How does it take shack? I don't know. Like you've been running full court for the last 15 years. What a disgusting question. All right. Uh, number five. We got a lot of questions this week and we try to blow through them. Um, but I went to the Tempe Improv, saw this comic. He was good, but the opening Yak was killing it. He was so funny. Do you ever get worried or stressed that your opener's going to be more funny than you? Um, is there any sort of process you go through picking your opener? Am I worried about them being more funny? Uh, well yeah. No I'm not. I'm, they're fucking middle ex for a reason.

Speaker 9:          01:00:35       All right. If you can't follow a middle act and you're, you're not a headliner. I've definitely had some funny guys on in front of me. Um, but I think that's a good thing. You know what I mean? You don't want to be sparring with somebody who sucks because then you're going to end up sucking. So I believe in going out with, uh, you know, bringing in a middle act that's, you know, funny and, and original. And that's my process to picking an opener. I use a Joe to Rosa, Kevin Shay. I'm going to be using this guy, Todd wrecks up in San Francisco. These guys, Todd wrecks, you know, in particular, no disrespect to those other two cops, but he really fucking kills. So I'll let my work cut out for me that week. But uh, yeah, I don't want to be that guy. I don't want to have some guy who just goes up there with like a lampshade on his head and stinks.

Speaker 9:          01:01:20       Um, while these are a lot of questions here, is this podcast getting too long? All right. Uh, April, I've got a question for you. Podcast. You haven't got a chance to meet George Carlin. Um, unfortunately, no, I didn't. I was supposed to meet him. Um, when was it? February or March, right before he did his special, he's supposed to be doing the comedy magic club down on her Moshe Beach. And I had just done a spot down there and they said, hey, he's coming in, whatever, on a Wednesday or a Tuesday, he can come down and watch the show and you can meet him afterwards. And it was going to be a dream come true. But, um, he ended up getting sick. Obviously his health was failing and, uh, he ended up canceling so I never got a chance to meet him, but I did get a chance to see him and, um, he absolutely blew me away and it was actually, it was a long time, was like 20 years ago before I was even doing comedy and, uh, I did at least get to see him cause I never got to see prior.

Speaker 9:          01:02:19       So at least I can say that I saw him and I'm with him. Passing is really making me want to go see Don Rickles because, uh, you know, that guy's in his eighties and he's still fucking hilarious. And uh, I don't know. He should, you know, as a comedian, I think anybody likes comedy should see those guys. So No, I did not get a chance to meet him, but I did get to see him in person and obviously as you can see on my page, he was a huge influence on me obviously. Um, all, all right. What are we doing here? Two more questions and then I'm going to wrap this fucking thing up. Number seven, Bill. Um, do you okay. I actually got a fucking asked advice here on dating. You know, I'm fucking not married at 40 and somebody is asking me advice on relationships.

Speaker 9:          01:03:02       Okay, you really need to consider your sources here. Um, all right. That's like, why don't you go ask somebody on heroin? You think math is bad, you know. Hey man, if you like doing it, you should fucking do it. All right, here we go. Bill, do you think a person deserves more than one date to determine if there is chemistry? I recently went out on a date with a guy. Turns out he wasn't my type. Well, there's your answer right there. But he had a nice personality, but I feel you should know. You should feel something immediately. You're answering your questions. Uh, it's not like he was my friend to begin with or will be my friend that'll have time to grow on me. I feel very mean and superficial. Oh, whoa. Okay. There you go. Right there. There's your first mistake with dating. When you date, you have to be unbelievably selfish, unbelievably selfish, or you're not going to get what you want.

Speaker 9:          01:03:54       And it's not even being selfish because if you settle for something that you don't want, you're not going to be happy. Okay? And then you're going to make the other person miserable. And that's not fair to the other person. So fuck that guy. All right. Fuck him in his nice personality. Hook them up with another one of your friends. Say, Hey, I met a guy that I'm not into, but he has a nice personality. You know what I mean? That's like a, that's like watching a TV show that you don't enjoy, but you really like the look of it. The end of it. You don't like the fucking show. So how long are you going to be interested? You know? You know? I don't know. It's like friends. I used to watch friends when I lived in New York City. I was like, God, look at that apartment, which had a fucking huge apartment like that, but I hated the fucking show.

Speaker 9:          01:04:39       So at the end of the day, I didn't watch the show. How long can you look up the couch? All right, question number eight. This is the final question I built. Why a while? This is a cheesy question. I'm a chef so I always ask. Um, and I, so I always ask and I think the answer says a lot. What is your favorite food slash restaurant? Uh, what is my favorite food? I like steak. Um, and I really liked that steak and shake. You know, it's got two things. I really enjoy. Red Meat and shakes. No. Um, I'm really, I don't know. I like everything. I would say Italian. I think Italians make the best food hands down and uh, it's absolutely delish and um, you know, the olive oil and just, you know, you know what I love about Italians who really know how to cook. They know how to add stuff.

Speaker 9:          01:05:33       Like they, they don't overt. Like I like explain it. Like whatever they add enhances the dish. It doesn't overpower it. You know what I mean? Like take like the art of making pizza somewhere along the line, the cheese on the pizza rather than enhancing the taste of the sauce. The cheese became the focal point. Okay. I can't explain it. Like it became the lead in the movie when it was actually, you know, the, the guy who had two lines in the movie, it's like, Oh look, pizza hut. They got it all over. They got it in the cross. They got it everywhere. You just seen a big brick of cheese and it tastes like fucking shit and you can't move your bottles afterwards. That I like Italian food. I like the olive oil that they cook with. I just, you know, it's very clean. You know, you drink that, you know, it's sip of wine.

Speaker 9:          01:06:25       As long as you don't eat like, like you go into the fucking all of garden, you just feel great. You take your time, the whole thing. That's what I like about Italian food and restaurants, like the whole thing, the lighting, the ambiance, everything. Um, so anyways, with that, my uh, my favorite restaurant when I was in New York was a, I used to really, I liked the lupa. That was my favorite one, the Mario Batali one and out here in la, one of the best ones I went to, I haven't been to a lot out here. I went to a Motsa, which is a another Mario Batali one, but I'm sort of like a hacky restaurant guy where if they have a show on the food network, I ended up going to it like, you know that you know that blonde guy who wears the sunglasses backwards on his head.

Speaker 9:          01:07:12       He's actually a favorite chef of Joe de Rosas. I forget his fucking name, but he just goes around to diners and that type of shit. And I ate at his restaurant in Sacramento and it was one of the worst fucking things I ever went to. He actually had, I think I talked about it, he had, he had this Sushi roll that had pork and French fries in it with some sort of barbecue sauce and it wasn't rice. I don't know what it was. It was some sort of pasty thing. It was absolutely fucking disgusting. And it's in Sacramento. Don't go to it. And a, there you go. That's the end of the fucking podcast questions. Um, um, I think that's it. I think that's it for the week. Also, I trashed best buy last week, said I wasn't going to go there anymore because they had that 15% restocking fee.

Speaker 9:          01:07:59       Somebody sent me an email about that, that if you buy something there and you don't like it and you bring it back, they still charge you 15% of it to just stick it back on the shelf. So some best buy person wrote, why work at best buy and trust me, it's necessary. They do it mainly on computers because when we sell one, we only make about 20 bucks in profit. Really? Is that how you keep that big store open? You make $20 on each laptop. I don't buy that. And when someone decides to return it, if we have to sell it for below cost, no, you don't. I've never gone into best buy and seen a TV or anything that says, uh, everything there is full price. What are you talking about? I don't know. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.

Speaker 9:          01:08:50       Now. I'm not gonna give you the benefit of the doubt cause best buy. I'm not saying it's you sir, who wrote this fucking thing, but you work for an evil fucking place that put mom and pop fucking places out of business. Okay. Back in the day when you return something, they just returned it. They put it back in the fucking box and they stuck it on the shelf. They didn't charge you 15%. Okay. That's one of those exploiting new revenue streams, new way to come up with extra money to fuck the customer. I firmly believe that. I've been in best buy, I've shopped in best buy, I've never seen any use cds, any used computers, everything is brand new. Okay, so maybe you've got to clarify that. Is there some sort of off the rack best buy thing down the street? Uh, best buy part two.

Speaker 9:          01:09:32       I have no idea. But uh, I'm still saying fuck best buy. So why don't you write me a followup. Okay. I know it was a bit of a cut there, so explain it further because I don't get it. So anyways, that's the podcast for the week. Thanks to everybody who sent me in all the Goddamn questions. And, um, what am I going to say here? Uh, yeah, I'm going to be at the, uh, the Improv in Pittsburgh this week for the love of God. Please come out. I got a brand new hour that I'm really proud of and uh, it's really depressing to, to be at that Goddamn mall with the stacks, you know, the poltergeist stacks, just fucking chimneys there. Okay. I'm going to the pirates game Wednesday night. All right. It'll be me and 30 other fucking people there. So you'll be able to see me come up to, to come up to me and say what's up a Wednesday night against the Astros.

Speaker 9:          01:10:20       Um, further news, I'll be in the uh, comedy works in Denver in First Week of August. Um, and what else? I got the Improv in Miami. I got a bunch of gigs coming up. I have an upcoming tour, an upcoming, our special coming out August 23rd on a comedy central. If I had half a brain and would've said that at the beginning of this podcast. I'm am I, new CD is coming out August 3rd. And I think that's it. Please keep the questions coming and, uh, and that is it. Thanks for listening to the podcast. You guys have yourself a great week. All right. Take it easy.
