for a long time i I used to say about

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
for a long time i I used to say about
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.410
for a long time i I used to say about
the Semantic Web that it sounded neat

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
the Semantic Web that it sounded neat
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.480
the Semantic Web that it sounded neat
but I don't understand it and take a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
but I don't understand it and take a
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.640
but I don't understand it and take a
little deeper than that what I found is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
little deeper than that what I found is
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.290
little deeper than that what I found is
every time I would start trying to learn

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
every time I would start trying to learn
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.550
every time I would start trying to learn
something about the Semantic Web I would

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
something about the Semantic Web I would
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560
something about the Semantic Web I would
end up reading these sort of very long

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570

documents that I felt were unrealistic

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
documents that I felt were unrealistic
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.820
documents that I felt were unrealistic
and and didn't tell me what I'm supposed

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830
and and didn't tell me what I'm supposed
 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.530
and and didn't tell me what I'm supposed
to do I always like to say I'm a

carpenter not an architect right and so

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750
carpenter not an architect right and so
 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.420

sort of grand theory of architecture

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
sort of grand theory of architecture
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.490
sort of grand theory of architecture
sounds great and all but I'm a carpenter

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
sounds great and all but I'm a carpenter
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.329
sounds great and all but I'm a carpenter
I don't know what to do with it I

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339
I don't know what to do with it I
 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.819
I don't know what to do with it I
actually need the architects to give me

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829
actually need the architects to give me
 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.350
actually need the architects to give me
something give me a plan so I can start

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
something give me a plan so I can start
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.610
something give me a plan so I can start
hammering and nailing and actually

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
hammering and nailing and actually
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500
hammering and nailing and actually
building the thing and we're actually

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
building the thing and we're actually
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630
building the thing and we're actually
getting closer to that now and I think a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
getting closer to that now and I think a
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.369
getting closer to that now and I think a
lot of the ideas around the Semantic Web

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
lot of the ideas around the Semantic Web
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.090
lot of the ideas around the Semantic Web
are are beginning to come to fruition

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100
are are beginning to come to fruition
 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.130
are are beginning to come to fruition
you know we have people lots of people

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
you know we have people lots of people
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319

doing things like tagging photos at
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.139
doing things like tagging photos at
Flickr or adding articles to categories

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149
Flickr or adding articles to categories
 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.600
Flickr or adding articles to categories
at Wikipedia those are the kinds of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
at Wikipedia those are the kinds of
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760
at Wikipedia those are the kinds of
things that you know people are

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
things that you know people are
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.249
things that you know people are
beginning to generate data metadata

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259
beginning to generate data metadata
 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.969
beginning to generate data metadata
that's machine readable and usable by

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979
that's machine readable and usable by
 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.440
that's machine readable and usable by
computers to help us find and navigate

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
computers to help us find and navigate
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719
computers to help us find and navigate
and do all that kind of cool stuff so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
and do all that kind of cool stuff so
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.730
and do all that kind of cool stuff so
for me I think that's that's the first

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
for me I think that's that's the first
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.199
for me I think that's that's the first
steps in that direction and that's

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209
steps in that direction and that's
 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.510
steps in that direction and that's
hardly that the dream of the Semantic

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
hardly that the dream of the Semantic
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.169
hardly that the dream of the Semantic
Web but at the same time I'm a little

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179
Web but at the same time I'm a little
 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.270
Web but at the same time I'm a little
skeptical of a lot of things in this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
skeptical of a lot of things in this
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.380
skeptical of a lot of things in this
area I know there are a lot of people

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
area I know there are a lot of people
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600
area I know there are a lot of people
who are working on natural language

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
who are working on natural language
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.609
who are working on natural language
processing and semantic search and I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
processing and semantic search and I
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.919
processing and semantic search and I
four right now I haven't seen anything

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929
four right now I haven't seen anything
 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.449
four right now I haven't seen anything
particularly useful about that and I've

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459
particularly useful about that and I've
 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.249
particularly useful about that and I've
actually talked to people I'm speaking

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
actually talked to people I'm speaking
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.630
actually talked to people I'm speaking
now just for the moment from the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
now just for the moment from the
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.029
now just for the moment from the
perspective of search engines I've

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039
perspective of search engines I've
 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.080
perspective of search engines I've
talked to some people at Google who

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
talked to some people at Google who
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.850
talked to some people at Google who
share that sentiment I don't know if

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
share that sentiment I don't know if
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.050
share that sentiment I don't know if
everybody in Google does for all I know

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
everybody in Google does for all I know
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370
everybody in Google does for all I know
they're working on a top-secret natural

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
they're working on a top-secret natural

language processing program but to say

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190
language processing program but to say
 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.070
language processing program but to say
you know keyword based searching where

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080
you know keyword based searching where
 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.389
you know keyword based searching where
the machine doesn't even attempt to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
the machine doesn't even attempt to
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.040
the machine doesn't even attempt to
understand what the document is about

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050
understand what the document is about
 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.219
understand what the document is about
actually works pretty well and it you

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
actually works pretty well and it you
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.290
actually works pretty well and it you
know having the ability for a machine to

know having the ability for a machine to
 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.510
know having the ability for a machine to
read a document and understand it in

read a document and understand it in
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.990
read a document and understand it in
some vague sense doesn't seem to be

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
some vague sense doesn't seem to be
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.059
some vague sense doesn't seem to be
particularly helpful for most of the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069
particularly helpful for most of the
 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.740
particularly helpful for most of the
real problems that we face in search so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
real problems that we face in search so
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.199

at least for right now given that the

at least for right now given that the
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.660
at least for right now given that the
technology is very limited in scope I

technology is very limited in scope I
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.280

just don't see

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
