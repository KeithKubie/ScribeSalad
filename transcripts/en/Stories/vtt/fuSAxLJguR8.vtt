00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.030
SPEAKER 1: For a
split second, it

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.800
kind of looked like
this woman's head had

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.420
been eaten off by a giraffe.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.150
But then I looked
closer and realized

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.990
that this is not a man-eater.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.460
The giraffe is actually eating
out the palm of her hand.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.310
It's a scene that really messes
with your sense of scale,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.174
or, in the words of
the photographer--

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:23.590
ROBIN MOORE: You
really appreciate

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.450
the size of a giraffe's head
when it's in your cereal bowl.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.159
Hi, my name is Robin Moore.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.250
I'm a photographer and
a conservation biologist

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.720
from Scotland, currently
based in Washington, DC.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.720
This photo was taken at a
place called Giraffe Manner.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.120
SPEAKER 1: Set on a
sprawling 150-acre estate,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.920
Giraffe Manner is a
free-roaming sanctuary

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.880
for several endangered
Rothschild's giraffes.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.370
ROBIN MOORE: Giraffe
Manner was built in 1932

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.660
and was modeled on the
Scottish hunting lodge.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.590
It wasn't until
the 1970s, however,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.270
that the manner became involved
in giraffe conservation.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.459
SPEAKER 1: Located in the
suburbs of Nairobi, Kenya,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.630
the sanctuary was
established in 1974.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.220
Today it's still
run as a sanctuary

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.770
with a successful
breeding program

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.850
that supports Rothschild
giraffes in the wild.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.385
To help fund the project,
the sanctuary owners also run

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:18.450
the hotel, where guests like
Robin can share a one-of-a-kind

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.991
breakfast with
long-necked creatures.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.950
ROBIN MOORE: Having the
opportunity to get so up close

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.370
and personal with these
animals is really amazing.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.860
The giraffes have such a
large, expressive eyes,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.160
and they're such
soulful creatures.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.780
You really get a sense of
that when you're up close.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.660
There are nine different
subspecies of giraffes,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.360
and the Rothschilds are
one of the most endangered,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.900
with only a few hundred
individuals left.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.400
We hear a lot about
elephants and rhinos

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.420
being poached in
Africa, and rightly so.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.090
These incredible creatures
are being pushed out

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.510
of existence for their
tusks and for their horns.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.860
But not many people realize
that giraffes are also

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.230
highly endangered,
and their numbers

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.289
have plummeted in recent years.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.470
I think these
incredible animals are

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.660
due their share of the
attention and the conservation

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.430
support that they need,
because it would be incredibly

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.927
sad to leave it too late.

00:02:19.927 --> 00:02:21.760
SPEAKER 1: It was during
one of the manner's

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.520
legendary breakfasts
that Robin snapped

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.220
this shot of a fellow guest.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.110
ROBIN MOORE: I tried to get this
moment where the giraffe was

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.580
obscuring her head.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.410
It wasn't really till after,
when I downloaded my photos,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.220
that I really
realized that I'd got

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.069
the shot that I was hoping for.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.610
SPEAKER 1: And it's
capturing moments

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.079
like this that keeps robin
coming back year after year.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.745
ROBIN MOORE: To
actually travel to Kenya

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:46.410
and to see giraffes
in their home

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.730
is really an
indescribable experience.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.800
And for me, it really
got under my skin,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.880
and I would add this
to your bucket list

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.870
right away, because waking
up to breakfast with giraffes

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.900
has to be one of the most
incredible and unique

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.569
experience that you can have.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.110
SPEAKER 1: Want to see another
episode of this happen to him?

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.470
Watch this one on a photographer
who captures these epic dog

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.004
portraits.

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:13.170
SPEAKER 2: To me, they
represent God's greatest gift

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.180
to humanity-- a species
sagacious and noble,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.210
willing to do whatever
we ask for them

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.320
and only asking for
some food and a pat

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.886
on the head in return.

00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:24.260
SPEAKER 1: And, as always,
don't forget to hit subscribe.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.000
Thanks for watching.
