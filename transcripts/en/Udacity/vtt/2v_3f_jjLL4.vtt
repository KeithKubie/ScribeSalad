00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.660
Virtualization has made
the lives of software developers

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.860
much easier by streamlining
the process to deploy software.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.270
So what's virtualization anyway?

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.550
Virtual machines, also known as virtual
servers, are full-fledged computers with

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.160
CPU, memory, and storage, but it's all
virtual or simulated, not physical.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.990
They have operating systems,
files, and applications.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.010
They don't necessarily live inside
a physical server on a one-to-one ratio.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.500
In fact, several virtual machines can
live within a single physical server.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.630
To the outside world, there's really no
difference between a physical server and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.400
a virtual server.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.730
They both can serve up websites,
host applications, and contain data.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.770
You can spin up a virtual
machine on a desktop PC,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.400
on a server, or in the cloud.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.942
Why would you want to
use virtual machines?

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.980
Let's look at a few use cases.

00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:04.599
Say you want to set up
a testing environment that is

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.160
a mirror image of production.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.970
Virtual machines will allow you
to do this quickly and securely.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.980
You can also run single purpose virtual
machines to support a database,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.570
authentication services,
or log aggregation.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.030
You can use virtual machines to
create high availability clusters and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.940
minimize downtime.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.580
By using virtual machines, you can
allow for the redundancy and failover

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.670
that was previously possible only with
the purchase of additional hardware.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.175
And there are many other possible
applications, these are just a few.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:44.165
Now let's look at the similarities and
differences between servers and

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:44.935
virtual machines.

00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:50.579
Both servers and virtual machines run
operating systems and applications,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.820
serve up websites and respond to pings,
and they can be networked.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.100
In contrast to servers,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.350
virtual machines don't have
a one-to-one relationship to hardware.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.400
You can run several virtual machines
on a single piece of equipment.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.360
They allow you to add hard drive
space or memory much more easily.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.290
You don't have to buy a new
server when you run out of space.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.210
They boot faster and are easier to move.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.600
They require more processing power and
memory.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.140
This is especially true for
hosted virtual machines.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.950
They're easier to troubleshoot, and
they have different requirements for

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.500
security.
