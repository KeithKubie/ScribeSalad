00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.510
Here's a quick overview of what
you'll need to grow your business.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.870
The product you build is going to
involve some combination of three basic

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.350
assets, skills, money, and time.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.040
Let's have a look into some things
you'll need to consider about each of

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.540
these assets.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.770
First, how do you know what skills
you'll need for your business?

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.120
Depending on the goals you set for

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.530
yourself, you'll need a different
set of skills to get the job done.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.470
There are plenty of ways to find the
people you need to get these skills for

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.470
your team.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.950
We'll talk about this later but

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.920
first it's important to define
the skills you'll actually need.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.750
Common skills you need are engineers,
salespeople, marketers and operations.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.610
Try thinking of the goals you set
in terms of the skills it takes to

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.110
complete them.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.970
Once you determine
which skills you need,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.290
you'll need money to get some help.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.240
Common ways to find the skills you need
are through hiring, outsourcing, and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.480
freelancing.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.880
There's a lot that goes into this and

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.080
you don't need to worry about it quite
yet, but try thinking about the skills

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.640
you need in terms of how you
plan to pay someone to get them.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.280
As you build your team,
you're really trading money for time.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.910
Your goal is to reduce the amount of
time it takes to complete your goals.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.970
By getting the right people for

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.310
the job, you also increase how quickly
you provide value to your users.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.800
Your team will help you experiment,
iterate and operate more quickly and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.010
effectively.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.549
This helps keep you innovative and
profitable moving forward.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.380
Take some time to consider how
you'll use these three assets as you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870
continue to grow your business.
