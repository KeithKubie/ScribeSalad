00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.230
So to illustrate
the importance of covariance,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.610
we're going to take a look at
a couple different stocks here.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.530
These are pretend, of course.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.050
So here's one, ABC, it's gone up 10%.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.040
Here's another stock, GHI,
it's also gone up 10%.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.770
But notice it tends
to zig when ABC zags,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.170
so it's not going in lockstep with ABC.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.320
Finally, here's our last stock
that we'll take a look at, DEF.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.050
Note how it goes almost
in lockstep with ABC.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.900
So, three stocks, two that move together
very similarly, and one that moves

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.005
opposite them sometimes, yet
they've all provided about 10% return.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.920
What is the best portfolio

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.590
we can build by combining
these three different stocks?

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.230
So, let's consider their covariance, or
how they move together, for a moment.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.990
So ABC and DEF move very similarly.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.000
And if we were to measure their
covariance, and this is the covariance

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.380
of daily returns, which if you're just
looking at one stock versus another,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.440
that's the same as the correlation
coefficient of their daily returns.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.050
So 0.9 means that they move
very closely to one another.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.220
Now, if we were to look at the
co-variance of daily returns of ABC and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.400
GHI, we would find that they actually
have a negative correlation.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.610
In other words, when ABC goes up,
GHI tends to go down.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.747
So they actually have a negative
correlation, or a negative covariance,

00:01:42.747 --> 00:01:47.870
whereas ABC and
DEF have a positive covariance.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.070
Again now, what's the best
way to blend these together?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.060
So let's consider a couple
different portfolios,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.630
which are just weightings
on these different assets.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.440
Let's look first at one that
is 50% ABC and 50% DEF.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.050
So what's that one going to look like?

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.870
Well, they both move very similarly, so

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.340
this portfolio is going to
track the two of them together.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.930
So the performance of this portfolio
is going to look something like this.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.490
So that's fine, it ends up returning
10%, just like the two major assets that

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.530
it holds, but there's no real advantage
in blending these two assets because

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.890
it just has the same volatility as
each one of them by themselves.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.200
So what if we try something
a little bit different?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.690
What if we take 25% of ABC, 25% of DEF,
so that's going to give us this same

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.100
motion that we saw here when
we combined those two, but,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.910
we put the rest of it in GHI?

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.980
So now we're combining an anticorrelated
asset with these other two.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.530
So what's this portfolio
going to look like?

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.110
Well, it's going to be a nice
blend of them, with very

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.750
low volatility, because when one zigs,
the other zags.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.470
So this portfolio will also have a 10%
return, but look how smooth it is.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.450
And that's because we're blending
anticorrelated assets together.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.780
So we get the same return but lower
volatility than any asset by itself.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.400
So all these assets by themselves
had significant volatility, but

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.630
when we put them together,
we reduced volatility significantly.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.210
That's the magic of what
Markowitz provided, and

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.030
we'll look a little bit more
at that in just a moment.
