independent lab in France that they were

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180
independent lab in France that they were
 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.569
independent lab in France that they were
interested in what would they call at

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579
interested in what would they call at
 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.420
interested in what would they call at
the time automata networks and they gave

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430
the time automata networks and they gave
 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.599
the time automata networks and they gave
me a couple of papers the people on

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609
me a couple of papers the people on
 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.099

was another conference in France that

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080
was another conference in France that
 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.909
was another conference in France that
where Jeff was a keynote speaker and you

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919
where Jeff was a keynote speaker and you
 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.379
where Jeff was a keynote speaker and you
give a talk on Boston machine so of

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389
give a talk on Boston machine so of
 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.180
give a talk on Boston machine so of
course he was working on you know the

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190
course he was working on you know the
 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.080
course he was working on you know the
background paper and give this talk and

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090
background paper and give this talk and
 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.610
background paper and give this talk and
then there is you know 50 people around

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620
then there is you know 50 people around
 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.680
then there is you know 50 people around
even we want to talk to him and the

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690
even we want to talk to him and the
 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.320
even we want to talk to him and the
first thing you said to the organizer is

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330
first thing you said to the organizer is
 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.580
first thing you said to the organizer is
you know this guy yeah Nicole

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590
you know this guy yeah Nicole
 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.430
you know this guy yeah Nicole
it's because he had read my paper in the

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440
it's because he had read my paper in the
 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.480
it's because he had read my paper in the
Proceedings that was returned in French

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490
Proceedings that was returned in French
 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.159
Proceedings that was returned in French
yeah he could sort of read French and he

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169
yeah he could sort of read French and he
 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:48.240
yeah he could sort of read French and he
could see the math and he could figure

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250
could see the math and he could figure
 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.760
could see the math and he could figure
out what sort of background and so so

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770
out what sort of background and so so
 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.170
out what sort of background and so so
we're not together and that's why we

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180
we're not together and that's why we
 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.930
we're not together and that's why we
became friends I see well that's because

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940
became friends I see well that's because
 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.909
became friends I see well that's because

multiple groups independently we
invented or invented back prop pretty

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280
invented or invented back prop pretty
 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.730

that when I was a postdoc a University
of Toronto with Jeff intestine I did the

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:07.450
of Toronto with Jeff intestine I did the
 

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.640
of Toronto with Jeff intestine I did the
first experiment where the code there

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:08.650
first experiment where the code there
 

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.170
first experiment where the code there
and did the first experiments there that

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:10.180
and did the first experiments there that
 

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.640
and did the first experiments there that
showed that if you had a very small data

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:11.650
showed that if you had a very small data
 

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.100
showed that if you had a very small data
set I was you know the data set I was

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.110
set I was you know the data set I was
 

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.779
set I was you know the data set I was
training on there was no end list or

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:15.789
training on there was no end list or
 

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:17.760

anything like that back then so I you

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:17.770
anything like that back then so I you
 

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.290
anything like that back then so I you
know I drew a bunch of characters with

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:19.300

computer which was a bit computer ever
 

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.810
computer which was a bit computer ever
and you know I drew a bunch of

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:24.820
and you know I drew a bunch of
 

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.719
and you know I drew a bunch of
characters and then use that you did

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:27.729
characters and then use that you did
 

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:30.029

it and then use that as a way to test

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840
it and then use that as a way to test
 

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.779
it and then use that as a way to test
performance and I compared things like

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:33.789
performance and I compared things like
 

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.370
performance and I compared things like
you fully connected net locally

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.380
you fully connected net locally
 

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.810
you fully connected net locally
connected that without shared weights

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:36.820
connected that without shared weights
 

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.399
connected that without shared weights
and then shared with networks it was

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:38.409
and then shared with networks it was
 

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.570
and then shared with networks it was
basically the first combat and and that

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:42.580
basically the first combat and and that
 

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.190
basically the first combat and and that

work really well for small relatively
small data sets could you could show

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:45.580
small data sets could you could show
 

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.490
small data sets could you could show
that you get better performance and no

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:47.500

October 1988 the first thing I did was
first scale out the network because we

00:08:59.800 --> 00:08:59.810
first scale out the network because we
 

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.690
first scale out the network because we

Larry Jekyll became my department head

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:06.590
Larry Jekyll became my department head

Larry Jekyll became my department head
at Bell Labs said oh we should order a

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:08.660
at Bell Labs said oh we should order a
 

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.060
at Bell Labs said oh we should order a
computer for you before you come what do

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.070
computer for you before you come what do
 

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.530

you want I say well you know here you

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:11.540
you want I say well you know here you

was the latest greatest stuff it'd be

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040
was the latest greatest stuff it'd be
 

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.660
was the latest greatest stuff it'd be
great if we if we had one and the other

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:19.670
great if we if we had one and the other
 

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.080
great if we if we had one and the other
one and I had one for myself you know it

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.090
one and I had one for myself you know it
 

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.490
one and I had one for myself you know it
was one for the HR department oh yeah

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:24.500
was one for the HR department oh yeah
 

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.080
was one for the HR department oh yeah
when just for me all right

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.090
when just for me all right
 

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.270
when just for me all right
and so what Larry told me he said yeah

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:28.280
and so what Larry told me he said yeah
 

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.470
and so what Larry told me he said yeah
you know why Bala's you don't get famous

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480
you know why Bala's you don't get famous
 

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.800
you know why Bala's you don't get famous
by saving money so so that was like

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:32.810
by saving money so so that was like
 

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.370
by saving money so so that was like
awesome and and they had been working

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:36.380
awesome and and they had been working
 

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.250
awesome and and they had been working
already for for a while on character

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:39.260
already for for a while on character
 

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.290
already for for a while on character
recognition they had this enormous data

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:41.300
recognition they had this enormous data
 

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.930
recognition they had this enormous data
set called USPS that had 5,000 training

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:43.940
set called USPS that had 5,000 training
 

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.010
set called USPS that had 5,000 training
samples and so so immediately I you know

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:47.020
samples and so so immediately I you know
 

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.570
samples and so so immediately I you know
trained a designer commercial net which

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:49.580
trained a designer commercial net which
 

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.620
trained a designer commercial net which
was running at one basically and and

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:53.630
was running at one basically and and
 

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.090
was running at one basically and and
trained it on this data set and got

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.100
trained it on this data set and got
 

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.380
trained it on this data set and got
really good results by you know better

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:56.390
really good results by you know better
 

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.630
really good results by you know better
results than the other methods they had

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640
results than the other methods they had
 

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.910
results than the other methods they had
been had been they had tried on it and

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920
been had been they had tried on it and
 

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.080
been had been they had tried on it and
that other people had tried on this

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.090
that other people had tried on this
 

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.030
that other people had tried on this
dataset so that we knew we had something

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040
dataset so that we knew we had something
 

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.290
dataset so that we knew we had something
fairly early on this is this was within

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:08.300
fairly early on this is this was within
 

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.050
fairly early on this is this was within
three months of me joining joining Bell

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:11.060
three months of me joining joining Bell
 

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.850
three months of me joining joining Bell
Labs and so that was the first version

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:12.860
Labs and so that was the first version
 

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.670
Labs and so that was the first version
of commercial net where we had a

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680
of commercial net where we had a
 

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.010
of commercial net where we had a
completion with tried and we did not

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:18.020
completion with tried and we did not
 

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.170
completion with tried and we did not
have separate subsampling and pulling

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:20.180
have separate subsampling and pulling
 

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.600
have separate subsampling and pulling
layers so each each combination was

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:22.610
layers so each each combination was
 

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.670
layers so each each combination was
actually subsampling directly and the

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680
actually subsampling directly and the
 

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.870
actually subsampling directly and the
reason for this is that we just could

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880
reason for this is that we just could
 

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.440
reason for this is that we just could
not afford to have a coalition at every

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:29.450
not afford to have a coalition at every
 

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.790
not afford to have a coalition at every
location you know there was just too

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800
location you know there was just too
 

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.770
location you know there was just too
much computation so the second version

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:37.780
 
 

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.050
 
had a separate completion and pooling

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:41.060
had a separate completion and pooling
 

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.290
had a separate completion and pooling
layer and sub standing I guess that's

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.300
layer and sub standing I guess that's
 

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.550
layer and sub standing I guess that's
the one that's called the net the net

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560
the one that's called the net the net
 

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.580
the one that's called the net the net
one really we published a couple of

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:48.590
one really we published a couple of
 

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.070
one really we published a couple of
papers on this at indoor computation and

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:51.080
papers on this at indoor computation and
 

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.970
papers on this at indoor computation and
that nibs and so when interesting sorry

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:54.980
that nibs and so when interesting sorry
 

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.950
that nibs and so when interesting sorry
I gave a talk at nibs about but but this

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:56.960
I gave a talk at nibs about but but this
 

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.890
I gave a talk at nibs about but but this
work and Jeff Fenton was in the audience

00:10:59.890 --> 00:10:59.900
work and Jeff Fenton was in the audience
 

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.630
work and Jeff Fenton was in the audience
and then I know I came back to my seat I

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:01.640
and then I know I came back to my seat I
 

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.790
and then I know I came back to my seat I
was sitting next to him and he said you

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800
was sitting next to him and he said you
 

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.310
was sitting next to him and he said you
know there is one bit of information

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320
know there is one bit of information
 

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.410
know there is one bit of information
you're in your talk which is that if you

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.420
you're in your talk which is that if you
 

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.000
you're in your talk which is that if you
do all the sensible things it actually

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.010
do all the sensible things it actually
 

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.740
do all the sensible things it actually
works and then show the after deadline

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:13.750
works and then show the after deadline
 

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.660
works and then show the after deadline
work went on to make history because

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:15.670
work went on to make history because
 

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.430
work went on to make history because
became widely adopted these ideas are

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440
became widely adopted these ideas are
 

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.140
became widely adopted these ideas are
being widely adopted for reading checks

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.150
being widely adopted for reading checks
 

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.810
being widely adopted for reading checks
and yeah so the became ready adopted

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:21.820
and yeah so the became ready adopted
 

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.840
and yeah so the became ready adopted
within AT&amp;T but not not very much

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:24.850
within AT&amp;T but not not very much
 

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.870
within AT&amp;T but not not very much
outside and you know I think it's a

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880
outside and you know I think it's a
 

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.050
outside and you know I think it's a
little difficult for me to really

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060
little difficult for me to really
 

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.380
little difficult for me to really
understand why but the several factors I

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:34.390
understand why but the several factors I
 

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.240
understand why but the several factors I
think so you know this was back in the

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.250
think so you know this was back in the
 

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.810
think so you know this was back in the
late 80s and there was no internet

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:39.820
late 80s and there was no internet
 

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.060
late 80s and there was no internet
you know we had email with FTP but there

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:42.070
you know we had email with FTP but there
 

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.970
you know we had email with FTP but there
was no internet really nobody you know

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:44.980
was no internet really nobody you know
 

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.860
was no internet really nobody you know
no two labs were using the same software

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:46.870
no two labs were using the same software
 

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.630
no two labs were using the same software
or hardware platform right you know some

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640
or hardware platform right you know some
 

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.950
or hardware platform right you know some
people had Sun workstations all that

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:49.960
people had Sun workstations all that
 

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.420
people had Sun workstations all that
said you know other machines you know

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:51.430
said you know other machines you know
 

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.490
said you know other machines you know
using pcs whatever there was no such

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:53.500
using pcs whatever there was no such
 

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.710

like that white people were writing

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:56.980
like that white people were writing
 

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.010
like that white people were writing
their own code I had written I had spent

00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.020
their own code I had written I had spent
 

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.860
their own code I had written I had spent
a year and a half basically writing me

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:01.870
a year and a half basically writing me
 

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.650

and Leon Powe too when it was two

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:04.660
and Leon Powe too when it was two
 

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.980
and Leon Powe too when it was two
students working together and we spent

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:07.990
students working together and we spent
 

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.150

are you gonna have basically just

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160
are you gonna have basically just
 

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.510
are you gonna have basically just
writing a neural net simulator and at at

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:12.520
writing a neural net simulator and at at
 

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.680
writing a neural net simulator and at at
the time you know because there was no

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:13.690
the time you know because there was no
 

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.970
the time you know because there was no
MATLAB or Python you had to write your

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:14.980
MATLAB or Python you had to write your
 

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.710
MATLAB or Python you had to write your
own interpreter right to kind of control

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720
own interpreter right to kind of control
 

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.440
own interpreter right to kind of control
it so we were torn Lisp interpreter and

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:19.450
it so we were torn Lisp interpreter and
 

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.470
it so we were torn Lisp interpreter and
so although Lynette was written in Lisp

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480
so although Lynette was written in Lisp
 

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.600
so although Lynette was written in Lisp
using a numerical back-end very similar

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:24.610
using a numerical back-end very similar
 

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.160
using a numerical back-end very similar
to what we have now with you know blocks

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.170
to what we have now with you know blocks
 

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.080
to what we have now with you know blocks
that you can interconnect and I started

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.090
that you can interconnect and I started
 

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.460
that you can interconnect and I started
magic differentiation and all that stuff

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:29.470
magic differentiation and all that stuff
 

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.860
magic differentiation and all that stuff
that we familiar with now with you know

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:31.870
that we familiar with now with you know
 

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.140

its fortune PI torsion tensorflow and

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.150
its fortune PI torsion tensorflow and
 

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.710

all those things

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720
all those things
 

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.320
all those things
so so then we we developed a bunch of

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.330
so so then we we developed a bunch of
 

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.660
so so then we we developed a bunch of
applications we got together with a

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:42.670
applications we got together with a
 

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:48.080
applications we got together with a
group of engineers very smart people

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.090
group of engineers very smart people
 

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.610
group of engineers very smart people
some of them had you know were like

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:50.620
some of them had you know were like
 

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.250
some of them had you know were like
theoretical physicists who kind of have

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:53.260
theoretical physicists who kind of have
 

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.970
theoretical physicists who kind of have
turned engineer at Bell Labs

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:56.980
turned engineer at Bell Labs
 

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.760
turned engineer at Bell Labs
Chris Burgess was one of them who then

00:12:59.760 --> 00:12:59.770
Chris Burgess was one of them who then
 

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.970
Chris Burgess was one of them who then
had a distinguished career at Microsoft

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:02.980
had a distinguished career at Microsoft
 

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.940

Research afterwards and Craig Knoll and

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:05.950
Research afterwards and Craig Knoll and
 

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.280

verge of a lucky ball and we were

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.290
verge of a lucky ball and we were
 

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.420
verge of a lucky ball and we were
collaborating with them to kind of make

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:09.430
collaborating with them to kind of make
 

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.990
collaborating with them to kind of make
the distinct notion practical and so

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000
the distinct notion practical and so
 

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the distinct notion practical and so
they developed together we developed

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.010
they developed together we developed
 

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.640
they developed together we developed
those your character education systems

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:17.650
those your character education systems
 

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.360
those your character education systems
and

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.370
and
 

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.920
and
that met integrating commercial Nets

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:19.930
that met integrating commercial Nets
 

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.730
that met integrating commercial Nets
with things like similar to things that

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:23.740
with things like similar to things that
 

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.400
with things like similar to things that
we now call CRFs for interpreting

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:26.410
we now call CRFs for interpreting
 

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.220
we now call CRFs for interpreting
sequences of characters not just to read

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:29.230
sequences of characters not just to read
 

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.050
sequences of characters not just to read
usually individual actors yeah right the

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:31.060
usually individual actors yeah right the
 

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.910
usually individual actors yeah right the
Lynette paper had passed the under

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920
Lynette paper had passed the under
 

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.280
Lynette paper had passed the under
neural network and partially on the

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.290
neural network and partially on the
 

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.170

autonomy to machinery right to put it

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:37.180
autonomy to machinery right to put it
 

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.550
autonomy to machinery right to put it
together yeah that's right that's so the

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560
together yeah that's right that's so the
 

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.200
together yeah that's right that's so the
first the first half of the paper is on

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.210
first the first half of the paper is on
 

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.730
first the first half of the paper is on
is on commercial Nets and the paper is

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:41.740
is on commercial Nets and the paper is
 

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.500
is on commercial Nets and the paper is
most excited with for that and then the

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:43.510
most excited with for that and then the
 

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.970
most excited with for that and then the
second half very few people have read it

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:44.980
second half very few people have read it
 

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.820
second half very few people have read it
and it's about you know sort of sequence

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:47.830
and it's about you know sort of sequence
 

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.350
and it's about you know sort of sequence
level discriminative running and

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360
level discriminative running and
 

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.110
level discriminative running and
basically structure prediction we you

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120
basically structure prediction we you
 

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.060
basically structure prediction we you
know with that normalization so it's

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.070
know with that normalization so it's
 

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.769
know with that normalization so it's
very similar to where to CRF in fact it

00:13:58.769 --> 00:13:58.779
very similar to where to CRF in fact it
 

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:02.370
very similar to where to CRF in fact it
would be CCRI for several years so that

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:02.380
would be CCRI for several years so that
 

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.240
would be CCRI for several years so that
was very successful except that today we

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.250
was very successful except that today we
 

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.079
was very successful except that today we
were celebrating the deployment of that

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:10.089
were celebrating the deployment of that
 

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:14.329
were celebrating the deployment of that

kind of doing the engineering of the
 

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.090
kind of doing the engineering of the
whole system and then another product

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:21.100

machines and they be a large check

00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:34.779
machines and they be a large check
 

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:36.570
machines and they be a large check
reading machines for banks so there were

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:36.580
reading machines for banks so there were
 

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.400
reading machines for banks so there were
the customers if you want they were

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:38.410
the customers if you want they were
 

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.280
the customers if you want they were
using our check reading systems and they

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.290
using our check reading systems and they
 

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.199
using our check reading systems and they
deployed it in you know in the bank it

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:43.209
deployed it in you know in the bank it
 

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:45.570
deployed it in you know in the bank it
was a camera which bank it was the

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:45.580
was a camera which bank it was the
 

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.980
was a camera which bank it was the
deployed also the ATM machines in a

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:46.990
deployed also the ATM machines in a
 

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.750
deployed also the ATM machines in a
French bank so they could read the

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:48.760
French bank so they could read the
 

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.380
French bank so they could read the
cheque you would deposit and we were all

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:52.390
cheque you would deposit and we were all
 

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.860
cheque you would deposit and we were all
at a fancy restaurant celebrating the

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:55.870
at a fancy restaurant celebrating the
 

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.350
at a fancy restaurant celebrating the
deployment of this thing where when the

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360
deployment of this thing where when the
 

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.640
deployment of this thing where when the
company announced that it was breaking

00:14:59.640 --> 00:14:59.650
company announced that it was breaking
 

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.960
company announced that it was breaking
itself up so this was 1995 and AT&amp;T

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:03.970
itself up so this was 1995 and AT&amp;T
 

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.010
itself up so this was 1995 and AT&amp;T
announced that he was breaking his cell

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.020
announced that he was breaking his cell
 

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.010
announced that he was breaking his cell
phone companies so you know there was

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:08.020
phone companies so you know there was
 

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.870
phone companies so you know there was
AT&amp;T and then I was losing technologies

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880
AT&amp;T and then I was losing technologies
 

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.079
AT&amp;T and then I was losing technologies
and NCR so NCR was spun off and recent

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:13.089
and NCR so NCR was spun off and recent
 

00:15:13.089 --> 00:15:14.790
and NCR so NCR was spun off and recent
technologies was spun off and the

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800
technologies was spun off and the
 

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.930
technologies was spun off and the
engineering group went with listen

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:15.940
engineering group went with listen
 

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.070
engineering group went with listen
technologies and the poor a group of

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:17.080
technologies and the poor a group of
 

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.460
technologies and the poor a group of
course with with NCR and the sudden the

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:20.470
course with with NCR and the sudden the
 

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.519
course with with NCR and the sudden the
sad thing is that the AT&amp;T lawyers in

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:23.529
sad thing is that the AT&amp;T lawyers in
 

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:25.140
sad thing is that the AT&amp;T lawyers in
their infinite wisdom assigned the

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.150
their infinite wisdom assigned the
 

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.569
their infinite wisdom assigned the
patterns of there was a patent on

00:15:27.569 --> 00:15:27.579
patterns of there was a patent on
 

00:15:27.579 --> 00:15:30.000
patterns of there was a patent on
congressional Nets I see which is

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.010
congressional Nets I see which is
 

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.970
congressional Nets I see which is
thankfully expired they see expired in

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:32.980
thankfully expired they see expired in
 

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.440
thankfully expired they see expired in
2007 and years ago and this antipattern

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:37.450
2007 and years ago and this antipattern
 

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.300
2007 and years ago and this antipattern
to NCR but there was nobody in the NCR

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:39.310
to NCR but there was nobody in the NCR
 

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.330
to NCR but there was nobody in the NCR
who actually knew well even what

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:42.340
who actually knew well even what
 

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.460
who actually knew well even what
accomplished on it was really icy

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:44.470
accomplished on it was really icy
 

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.050
accomplished on it was really icy
and so the patent was in the hands of

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:46.060
and so the patent was in the hands of
 

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.440
and so the patent was in the hands of
people with no idea what they had and we

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:49.450
people with no idea what they had and we
 

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.730
people with no idea what they had and we
were in a different company that now

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:50.740
were in a different company that now
 

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.560
were in a different company that now
could not really develop the technology

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:52.570
could not really develop the technology
 

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.150
could not really develop the technology
and then our engineering team was in a

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160
and then our engineering team was in a
 

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.410
and then our engineering team was in a
separate company because we went with

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:55.420
separate company because we went with
 

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.150
separate company because we went with
AT&amp;T the engineering went with result

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160
AT&amp;T the engineering went with result
 

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.250
AT&amp;T the engineering went with result
and the product worked with NCR so it

00:15:59.250 --> 00:15:59.260
and the product worked with NCR so it
 

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.560
and the product worked with NCR so it
was a little depressing

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:00.570
was a little depressing
 

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.110
was a little depressing
so in addition to your early work you

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120
so in addition to your early work you
 

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.020
so in addition to your early work you
know when your networks were were hot

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:06.030
know when your networks were were hot
 

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.400
know when your networks were were hot
you kept persisting on neuro networks

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:08.410
you kept persisting on neuro networks
 

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.280
you kept persisting on neuro networks
even when there was some sort of winter

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:11.290
even when there was some sort of winter
 

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.800
even when there was some sort of winter
for your knee so what was that like well

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:13.810
for your knee so what was that like well
 

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.960
for your knee so what was that like well
so I persisted and didn't persist in

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:15.970
so I persisted and didn't persist in
 

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.090
so I persisted and didn't persist in
some ways I was always convinced that

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:18.100
some ways I was always convinced that
 

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.710
some ways I was always convinced that
eventually those those techniques would

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720
eventually those those techniques would
 

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.050
eventually those those techniques would
come back to the fore and sort of you

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:22.060
come back to the fore and sort of you
 

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.750
come back to the fore and sort of you
know people would figure out how to use

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:24.760
know people would figure out how to use
 

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.360
know people would figure out how to use
them in practice and it would be useful

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:27.370
them in practice and it would be useful
 

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.190
them in practice and it would be useful
so I always had that in the back of my

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:29.200
so I always had that in the back of my
 

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.240
so I always had that in the back of my
mind but but in 1996 when AT&amp;T broke

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:33.250
mind but but in 1996 when AT&amp;T broke
 

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.310
mind but but in 1996 when AT&amp;T broke
itself up and all of our work on

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:35.320
itself up and all of our work on
 

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.470
itself up and all of our work on
character recognition basically was kind

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480
character recognition basically was kind
 

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.790
character recognition basically was kind
of working out because the polygroups

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800
of working out because the polygroups
 

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.430
of working out because the polygroups
was you know went in separate way i was

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440
was you know went in separate way i was
 

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.740
was you know went in separate way i was
also promoted to department head and i

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:43.750
also promoted to department head and i
 

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.570
also promoted to department head and i
had to figure out what to work on and

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:45.580
had to figure out what to work on and
 

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.460
had to figure out what to work on and
this was the early days of the internet

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:47.470
this was the early days of the internet
 

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.300
this was the early days of the internet
we took in 1995 and I had the idea

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:51.310
we took in 1995 and I had the idea
 

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.800
we took in 1995 and I had the idea
somehow that one big problem about the

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:55.810
somehow that one big problem about the
 

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.300
somehow that one big problem about the
emergence of the internet was going to

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:57.310
emergence of the internet was going to
 

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.270
emergence of the internet was going to
be to bring all the knowledge that we

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:00.280
be to bring all the knowledge that we
 

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.390
be to bring all the knowledge that we
had on paper to the digital world and so

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:03.400
had on paper to the digital world and so
 

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.760
had on paper to the digital world and so
I started actually a project called

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:05.770
I started actually a project called
 

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.240
I started actually a project called
digital DJ vu which was to you know

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.250
digital DJ vu which was to you know
 

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.710
digital DJ vu which was to you know
compressed scanned documents and she

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720
compressed scanned documents and she
 

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.120
compressed scanned documents and she
essentially so they could they could be

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:12.130
essentially so they could they could be
 

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.920
essentially so they could they could be
distributed over the Internet this

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:13.930
distributed over the Internet this
 

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.990
distributed over the Internet this
project was really fun for a while and

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000
project was really fun for a while and
 

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.329
project was really fun for a while and
you know had some success although AT&amp;T

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:18.339
you know had some success although AT&amp;T
 

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.380
you know had some success although AT&amp;T
really didn't know what to do with it

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:19.390
really didn't know what to do with it
 

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.460
really didn't know what to do with it
yeah I remember that

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:20.470
yeah I remember that
 

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.650
yeah I remember that
helping dissemination of online research

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:22.660
helping dissemination of online research
 

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.410
helping dissemination of online research
papers yeah that's right exactly and you

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:25.420
papers yeah that's right exactly and you
 

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.030
papers yeah that's right exactly and you
we scanned the entire proceedings of

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:27.040
we scanned the entire proceedings of
 

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.150
we scanned the entire proceedings of
nips and we made them available online

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160
nips and we made them available online
 

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.350
nips and we made them available online
to kind of demonstrate how that worked

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360
to kind of demonstrate how that worked
 

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.270
to kind of demonstrate how that worked
and you know we could compress like you

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280
and you know we could compress like you
 

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.740
and you know we could compress like you
know high-resolution pages to transfer

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:34.750
know high-resolution pages to transfer
 

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.080
know high-resolution pages to transfer
kilobytes so confidence starting from

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.090
kilobytes so confidence starting from
 

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.060
kilobytes so confidence starting from
you know some of your much early work

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:39.070
you know some of your much early work
 

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.460
you know some of your much early work
has now

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:40.470
has now
 

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.350
has now
I'm pretty much taken over the field of

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360
I'm pretty much taken over the field of
 

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.510
I'm pretty much taken over the field of
computer vision and starting to you know

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520
computer vision and starting to you know
 

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.940
computer vision and starting to you know
encroach significantly even other fields

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:46.950
encroach significantly even other fields
 

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.370
encroach significantly even other fields
over this tell me about how you saw that

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:49.380
over this tell me about how you saw that
 

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.789
over this tell me about how you saw that
whole process so I tell you how I I

00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799
whole process so I tell you how I I
 

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:54.770
whole process so I tell you how I I
thought this was gonna happen early on

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780
thought this was gonna happen early on
 

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.570
thought this was gonna happen early on
so first of all I always believed that

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580
so first of all I always believed that
 

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.140
so first of all I always believed that
this was gonna work it required you know

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:00.150
this was gonna work it required you know
 

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.760
this was gonna work it required you know

always believed somehow that this was
 

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.440
always believed somehow that this was
gonna be the right thing to do

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.450
gonna be the right thing to do
 

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.570
gonna be the right thing to do
what I thought originally when I was at

what I thought originally when I was at
 

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.799
what I thought originally when I was at
Bell Labs that there was going to be

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:09.809
Bell Labs that there was going to be
 

00:18:09.809 --> 00:18:11.149

interest and and sort of you know

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120
interest and and sort of you know
 

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.919
interest and and sort of you know
continuous progress for it but in fact

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:39.929
continuous progress for it but in fact
 

00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:42.950
continuous progress for it but in fact
because of the the sort of interest for

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960
because of the the sort of interest for
 

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.539

other small work for like face detection
 

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.120
other small work for like face detection
and things like this in France and in

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:17.130
and things like this in France and in
 

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.430
and things like this in France and in
various other places it was very small I

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440
various other places it was very small I

discovered actually recently that

00:19:21.399 --> 00:19:21.409
discovered actually recently that
 

00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:24.470
discovered actually recently that
there's a couple groups that came up

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480
there's a couple groups that came up
 

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.000
there's a couple groups that came up
with ideas that are essentially very

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.010
with ideas that are essentially very
 

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.560
with ideas that are essentially very
similar to commercial nets but never

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:27.570
similar to commercial nets but never
 

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.149
similar to commercial nets but never
quite published it you know the same way

00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159
quite published it you know the same way
 

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:31.820
quite published it you know the same way
for medical image analysis and those

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:31.830
for medical image analysis and those
 

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.440
for medical image analysis and those
were mostly in the context of commercial

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:33.450
were mostly in the context of commercial
 

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.539
were mostly in the context of commercial
systems and so it never kept quite made

00:19:35.539 --> 00:19:35.549
systems and so it never kept quite made
 

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.909
systems and so it never kept quite made
it to the profession I mean it was after

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919
it to the profession I mean it was after
 

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:40.070
it to the profession I mean it was after
the office to work on on commercial Nets

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080
the office to work on on commercial Nets
 

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.390
the office to work on on commercial Nets
and they were not really aware of it but

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400
and they were not really aware of it but
 

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.460
and they were not really aware of it but
but it sort of developed in parallel a

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:43.470
but it sort of developed in parallel a
 

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.730
but it sort of developed in parallel a
little bit so you know several people

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740
little bit so you know several people
 

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.220
little bit so you know several people
got chemistry ideas

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:49.230
got chemistry ideas
 

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.210
got chemistry ideas
you know several years interval but then

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220
you know several years interval but then
 

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.190
you know several years interval but then
it was really surprised by how fast

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200
it was really surprised by how fast
 

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.150
it was really surprised by how fast
interest picked up after you know the

00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.160
interest picked up after you know the
 

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.120
interest picked up after you know the
imagenet cycle 12 from 2012 so it's the

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.130
imagenet cycle 12 from 2012 so it's the
 

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.850
imagenet cycle 12 from 2012 so it's the
end of 2012 it was kind of a very

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860
end of 2012 it was kind of a very
 

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.180

where there was a workshop on imagenet

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:10.410
where there was a workshop on imagenet
 

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.270
where there was a workshop on imagenet
and everybody knew that you know

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280
and everybody knew that you know
 

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.890
and everybody knew that you know
Jacqueline's team Alex crew jetski and

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900
Jacqueline's team Alex crew jetski and
 

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.830
Jacqueline's team Alex crew jetski and
SOC ever had had won by a large margin

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840
SOC ever had had won by a large margin
 

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.990

and so everybody was waiting for an

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000
and so everybody was waiting for an
 

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.270
and so everybody was waiting for an
extra desk is talk and most people in

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280
extra desk is talk and most people in
 

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.470

paid much attention to it senior people

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.090
paid much attention to it senior people
 

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.370
paid much attention to it senior people
did you know they knew what it was but

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380
did you know they knew what it was but
 

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.440
did you know they knew what it was but
the more junior people in the community

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:39.450
the more junior people in the community
 

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.360
the more junior people in the community
were really had no idea what it was and

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:41.370
were really had no idea what it was and
 

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.580
were really had no idea what it was and
so an extra Jeske just you give this

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:43.590
so an extra Jeske just you give this
 

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.870
so an extra Jeske just you give this
talk and it doesn't explain what the

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880
talk and it doesn't explain what the
 

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.190

everybody knows because he comes from

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360
everybody knows because he comes from
 

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.900
everybody knows because he comes from
machine learning so he says you know

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:50.910
machine learning so he says you know
 

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.060
machine learning so he says you know
here is a we everything is connected and

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.070
here is a we everything is connected and
 

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.710
here is a we everything is connected and
the you know how we transform the data

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720
the you know how we transform the data
 

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.770
the you know how we transform the data
and results we get can assuming that

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780
and results we get can assuming that
 

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.750

workshop was the defining moment that

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.010
workshop was the defining moment that
 

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.350
workshop was the defining moment that
swayed a lot of computer vision

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360
swayed a lot of computer vision
 

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.049
swayed a lot of computer vision
community yeah definitely that's that's

00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059
community yeah definitely that's that's

thoughts on that yeah so I mean one of

00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059
thoughts on that yeah so I mean one of
 

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:40.640
thoughts on that yeah so I mean one of
the beautiful things that you know that

four years is that I was I was given a

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700
four years is that I was I was given a
 

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.620
four years is that I was I was given a
lot of freedom to set up fair the way I

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:48.630
lot of freedom to set up fair the way I
 

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.760

thought was the most appropriate because

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:52.770
thought was the most appropriate because
 

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.250
thought was the most appropriate because
this was the first research organization

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260
this was the first research organization
 

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.539

years and and the survival of the
 

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.290
years and and the survival of the
company was not in question anymore so

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:22.300
company was not in question anymore so
 

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.510

kind of setting setting up a research
 

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.240
kind of setting setting up a research
organization and and it was a bit of a

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.250
organization and and it was a bit of a
 

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.550
organization and and it was a bit of a
culture shock initially because the way

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:23.560

you have longer timescales and horizon

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840
you have longer timescales and horizon
 

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.480
you have longer timescales and horizon
and researchers tend to be very

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:30.490
and researchers tend to be very
 

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.250
and researchers tend to be very
conservative about the choice of places

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:32.260

before that and a lot of people came

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:20.710
before that and a lot of people came
 

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.320
before that and a lot of people came
from that world so that was in the DNA

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:22.330
from that world so that was in the DNA
 

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.509

confident that we could kind of set up

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:26.049
confident that we could kind of set up
 

00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:29.000
confident that we could kind of set up
open research organization and then the

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.010
open research organization and then the
 

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.970
open research organization and then the
fact that the the company is not

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:31.980
fact that the the company is not
 

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.710
