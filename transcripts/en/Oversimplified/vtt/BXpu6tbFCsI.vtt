00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
This, is Australia. (nooo really)

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.340
For the man who imagines being strangled by a tarantula while a kangaroo breaks his kneecaps and things,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.340
Mmm. Yes please.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.400
For the man who pictures himself being eaten by a snake in the burning Outback while eating a Vegemite sandwich and thinks:

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.020
"MMM YES, PLEASE!"

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.280
And that man was governor Arthur Phillip who landed in eastern Australia in 1788.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.840
Presumably saw a dingo being eaten by a crocodile, being eaten by a Death Adder, being eaten by a koala, being eaten by Mel Gibson, (lol)

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.860
and thought to himself:

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.700
"Yes,"

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.180
"G o o d."

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.940
Now I know what you're thinking,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.180
but OverSimpified (what)

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.700
the British didn't discover Australia. (rly?)

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.600
The vikings did (are you sure about that)

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.940
And you'd be wrong. (HAHAHAHAH)

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.440
I'm not sure why you'd think that, but hey! If you love Vikings so much

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.900
THEN why don't you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.980
Check out today's sponsor?

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.060
Vikings War of Clans was inspired by the PC (and mobile)

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.340
strategy and RPG games of the 90s we all love,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.940
like Age of Empires, and Civilization.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.140
If you, like me, want to relive those memories again with a new experience, then this mobile game is for you.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.840
Vikings lets you choose your own play style. And what makes its world so addictive

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.480
is that more than 20 million online players are constantly changing the way it evolves by never-ending fighting over resources,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.220
forging new alliances, and competing in live events.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.320
 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.240
[meanwhile in the brexit kingdom]

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.140
"Buy! Buy! Man, this is great! The market will continue to grow forever!"

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.100
"but what if it dosen't?"

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.680
"OH CRAP! I never thought of that. SELL! SELL!

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.060
And the stock market crashed,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.280
which led to economic downturn,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.000
which meant that banks wouldn't lend anyone any money,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.120
which led to MORE economic downturn, (more?)

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.920
which meant everyone stopped buying stuff,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.840
which led to MORE economic downturn, and-- (are you ok...)

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.340
Hey!

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.740
What if all the crops in the Great Plains were destroyed in a drought and then a big dust storm engulfed the area?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.640
That's right!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.100
More economic downturn.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.780
And in an effort to combat the crisis,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.180
America began imposing tariffs on foreign imports,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.180
which made the economic downturn go global,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.820
and the Earth got really depressed.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.520
But one nation that was hit harder than most by the whole affair:

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.720
Australia.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.200
The problem for Australia was that it relied heavily on its export industries,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.920
and in the current economic climate, no one was buying.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920
To make things worse:

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.900
Australia had introduced its own currency, and picked it onto the gold standard by the British pound.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.060
But then the UK started messing with its own take on the gold standard, and if this is starting to sound confusing,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.740
then let me Oversimplify it for you.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.820
"Hey, UK. Looks like my car is broken down. Want to give me a tow?"

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.180
"No problem, friend,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.740
I got you."

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.480
*british puts the hook to put australia home*

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.460
*walks in british*

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.040
*opens car door*

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.820
*close car door*

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.260
10/10 british no need help to australia

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.460
oof

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.860
More economic downturn! (how much did you say?)

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.940
The point I'm trying to make is things weren't good.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.460
And in particular, it was Australia's farmers that were suffering most.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.540
After the First World War,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.100
Australia had given returning veterans land for farming.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.540
But with the current economic crisis, the farmers just weren't making enough money.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.580
And many left to go find work in the cities, but for those who remained, things were about to get even worse.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.560
THAT EMU BOI

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.760
Before we get into that, it's time for some cultural exchange.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.600
"My national bird is the bald eagle."

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.760
"It's a strong patriotic symbol of America and a deeply valued and protected species." (that's ok)

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.080
"My national bird is the peafowl."

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.780
"It's a beautiful creature whose vivid colors represent India. So we list it as a protected species." (wow i love that!)

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.180
"My national bird is the emu and it's a PEST. (wut)

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.200
Also bloody delicious!" (made with bleach)

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.320
Emus, six feet tall,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.800
9 to 120 pounds

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.720
and able to run speed after 40 mph

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.920
usually return to the coast after their breeding season, but suddenly they found Western Australia full of lush, wet, farmland.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.440
"Oh my!"

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.940
"Look at all this delicious wheat that just so happens to be growing here in large quantities."

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.940
"Hey guys, get a load of this!"

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.260
*Emus enjoying wheat* (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH)

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:46.340
(that's a lot of crop damage)

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.100
"Hey! Who left this big hole in the fence?"

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.700
"Guys, get a load of this!"

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.380
*Rabbits enjoying wheat* (*dies from laughter*)

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.880
"the rabbits did it some more"

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.340
"What a lovely morning for some farmi-"

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.660
"WHAT!?"

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.060
"Those damned emus!"

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.080
"They have it in for me!

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.140
"They're bullies!"

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.560
"They're nothing but bullies!"

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.040
"Calm down Bruce. They're just animals. It's not personal."

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.860
"Hey farmer Bruce! Where did you find that hat? The toilet?"

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.860
bruce: *thinks*

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.180
"yes..." (OHH)

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.540
20,000 emus cost the already struggling farmers millions more pounds in lost crops and damages.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.180
The situation couldn't continue like this.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.580
Something had to be done.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.520
So in 1932, the farmers turned to the government for help.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.340
You think they'd go to the Minister of Agriculture, but these farmers said "No!"

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.580
"This is a job for the military."

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.640
So they went to George Pearce, the Minister of Defense.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.780
That's right. Australia was to go to war with the emus, but not everyone was happy with the idea.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.680
"This is barbaric! We can't go slaughtering thousands of our own national bird."

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.500
"Oh, come on guys!"

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.560
"The machine guns will make it quick and painless!"

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.280
"Machine Guns!? You're using machine guns!? This is animal cruelty!"

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.800
"Look, I know it's unusual, but it's not like we're poachers turning the birds into feather hats. Think of the benefits!"

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.049
"It'll be good target practice for our boys, the government can show it took action! Plus I can get myself a nice new feather hat!"

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:08.630
*GASP*

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.220
"Did I say feather hat? I meant I want to--gether chat. With you!"

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.340
"About getting you all some nice new feather hats!"

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.840
*GASP*

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.360
"Uhhh, did I say feather hats?"

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.180
"I meant I want to wage--terror at--these emus and turn them all into feather hats!"

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.720
*GASP*

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.920
"DAMNIT!"

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.620
Of course, Pearce first made the farmers sign an agreement saying that:

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.800
They would pay for the whole thing, and that Pearce wouldn't take any of the blame,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.140
if the operation, that was clearly very stupid, turned out to indeed, be stupid.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.580
And the operation went ahead.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.500
Major G.P.W. Meredith and his men were sent with two Lewis machine guns to hunt down and take out the evil emu population in Western Australia.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.320
"Target spotted!"

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.580
"Well, was it an emu?"

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.400
"No, sir. It's an emO." (who the hell is emO)

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.400
"Damn it Jones! Learn your vowels!"

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.540
"I'm surry.."

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.270
"Okay, it looks like the humans are coming for us. But check this out. I've come up with an amazing plan. (wheres that emu get that soldier hat)

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.340
See if you can follow me here okay? When they approach, we run away."

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.220
seems stupid

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.180
"Sir,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.880
You're a genius."

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.240
Pearce sent a camera crew along with the machine gunners to capture some good ol' propaganda for the government,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.920
and the first battle took place in November at Campion.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.760
The men spotted a mob of emus from a distance,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.340
so they set up the guns and opened fire. The emus split up into smaller groups and ran in every direction.

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:25.759
The men were only able to kill what they called "a number of birds" but the vast majority got away.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.920
"CUT!" (where that camera man came from?)

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.600
Surprisingly, many of the emus were able to take multiple bullets, but still run at full speed to safety,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.240
causing Meredith to compare them to tanks saying,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.080
"If we had a military division with the bullet carrying capacity of these birds, it would face any army in the world."

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.640
"Okay, we need to get closer."

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.080
"No, you idiots, not to me, to the emus!" (wtf)

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.260
"Oh, sorry."

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.820
"No, no!"

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.280
"I like it."

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.160
So next, they tried sneaking up on a large number of emus near a local dam, and firing at short range.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.919
Maybe the men were just unlucky, but my professional opinion says the emus were magic, because both guns jammed after just 12 emus were killed.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.919
And once again, the rest got away.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.840
"CUT!"

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.120
The men were feeling a little humiliated after losing to a pack of discount ostriches.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.640
So they decided to move further South, where the emus were said to be tamer.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.540
And this time, they had a new strategy.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.820
"Okay Jones. Here's the plan. You mount the machine gun in the back. I'll chase the emus. You shoot got it. Got it?"

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.680
"Got it."

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.300
but they can't the car was so bumpy

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.300
one emu caught at the driver

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.300
dat explosion tho

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.620
"I'm gonna shove that camera up your- "

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.080
The operation was a fiasco and the press had a field day.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.000
In Parliament, Pearce was lambasted.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.460
And the opposition party members suggested that medals should be handed out to the emus,

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:49.280
who'd won every round so far.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.100
Pearce, feeling quite humiliated, called the operation off,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.200
but four days later the farmers approached again, and said,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.620
"Hey man, the emus are still eating all our crops. Can you send the army back out here?"

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.020
And Pearce was like:

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.800
"Yeah, okay"

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.240
So the operation was back on for Round 2.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.800
And this time, Meredith and his men had learned the emus' guerrilla tactics,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.800
and were much more successful, with reports suggesting the men were cutting down 300 emus every week.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.040
"I hope you boys are getting great footage of this. What on earth are you filming?"

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.759
Despite the success, the media have lost interest in the whole thing.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:24.369
But with 1,000 emus killed, Pearce finally ended the operation, and returned to Parliament declaring victory for the humans.

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:28.120
"So there were 20,000 emus out there destroying crops and you've killed 1000."

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.840
"Mm-hmm."

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.840
"Meaning there's still 19,000 emus out there."

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.340
"Yep."

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.080
"And in addition you've burned through 10,000 rounds of ammunition."

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.580
"Uh-huh."

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.680
"Meaning you wasted 10 rounds per confirmed kill."

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.640
"Thaat's right!"

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.820
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and call this one for the emus."

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.660
"at least i got a feather hat..."

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.160
"What?"

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:43.720
"What?"

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.120
So in the end the emus won the Great Emu War of 1932,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.280
and the emus continued to wreak havoc on the farmers for years to come.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.780
The government introduced a bounty system, which saw some success,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.780
But for a moment,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.160
let's take some time to remember the brave men, who said goodbye to their families,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:06.460
and risked their lives to take on the great, evil emu population in Western Australia.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:13.200
But even more importantly, let's think of the friends they made, the bond they created, and the memories they shared.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.900

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.220
I solved the emu crisis."

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.340
"Really?"

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.420
"How?"

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.000
"I just made some better fences."

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.260
