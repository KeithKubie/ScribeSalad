companies set up these data sets in ways

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
companies set up these data sets in ways
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.799
companies set up these data sets in ways
that really slowed down rather than

speeds up the progress of the team let's
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.210
speeds up the progress of the team let's
take a look at how you can set up these

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
take a look at how you can set up these
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.920

efficiency in this video I want to focus

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
efficiency in this video I want to focus
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.500
efficiency in this video I want to focus
on how you set up your depth and test

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
on how you set up your depth and test
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.490
on how you set up your depth and test
set so the depth set is also called the

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500
set so the depth set is also called the
 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.520
set so the depth set is also called the
development set or sometimes called the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
development set or sometimes called the
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.389
development set or sometimes called the
holdout cross validation set and

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399
holdout cross validation set and
 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.940
holdout cross validation set and
workflow in machine learning is that you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
workflow in machine learning is that you
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.920
workflow in machine learning is that you
try all of ideas train up different

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
try all of ideas train up different
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720
try all of ideas train up different
models on the training set and then use

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
models on the training set and then use
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490
models on the training set and then use
the depth set to evaluate the different

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
the depth set to evaluate the different
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.400
the depth set to evaluate the different
ideas and pick one and keep iterating to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
ideas and pick one and keep iterating to
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.779
ideas and pick one and keep iterating to
improve dead-set performance until

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
improve dead-set performance until
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.400
improve dead-set performance until
finally you have one classifier you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
finally you have one classifier you
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.529
finally you have one classifier you
happy with that you then evaluate on

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
happy with that you then evaluate on
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.119
happy with that you then evaluate on
your test set now let's say by way of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
your test set now let's say by way of
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.500
your test set now let's say by way of
example that you're building a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
example that you're building a
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.070
example that you're building a
classifier and you are operating in

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
classifier and you are operating in
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.500
classifier and you are operating in
these regions in the US UK or the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
these regions in the US UK or the
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.030
these regions in the US UK or the
European countries of America India

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
European countries of America India
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.789

China of Asian countries in Australia so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
China of Asian countries in Australia so
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.340
China of Asian countries in Australia so
how do you set up your deaf set or and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
how do you set up your deaf set or and
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.280
how do you set up your deaf set or and
your test set well one way you could do

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
your test set well one way you could do
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.190
your test set well one way you could do
so is to pick four of these regions I'm

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
so is to pick four of these regions I'm
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870
so is to pick four of these regions I'm
gonna use bespoke but it could be for

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
gonna use bespoke but it could be for
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240
gonna use bespoke but it could be for
randomly chosen regions and say that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
randomly chosen regions and say that
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.679
randomly chosen regions and say that
data from these four regions will go

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
data from these four regions will go
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.929
data from these four regions will go
into the deaf set and the other four

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
into the deaf set and the other four
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.490
into the deaf set and the other four
regions I'm going to use these four

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
regions I'm going to use these four
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170
regions I'm going to use these four
complete randomly children for as well

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
complete randomly children for as well
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.380
complete randomly children for as well
that those who go into the test set it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
that those who go into the test set it
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149
that those who go into the test set it
turns out this is a very bad idea

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
turns out this is a very bad idea
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.550
turns out this is a very bad idea
because in this example your depth and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
because in this example your depth and
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960
because in this example your depth and
test sets come from different

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
test sets come from different
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.740
test sets come from different
distributions

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
distributions
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.289
distributions
I wouldn't instead recommend that you

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
I wouldn't instead recommend that you
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.569
I wouldn't instead recommend that you
find a way to make your depth and test

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
find a way to make your depth and test
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.780
find a way to make your depth and test
sets come from the same distribution so

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
sets come from the same distribution so
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.359
sets come from the same distribution so
here's what I mean one picture to keep

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
here's what I mean one picture to keep
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.160
here's what I mean one picture to keep
in mind is that I think setting up your

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
in mind is that I think setting up your
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.060
in mind is that I think setting up your
just yet plus your single real number

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
just yet plus your single real number
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.999
just yet plus your single real number
evaluation metric that's like placing a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
evaluation metric that's like placing a
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.160
evaluation metric that's like placing a
target and telling your team where you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
target and telling your team where you
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.719
target and telling your team where you
think of the Bulls are you want to aim

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
think of the Bulls are you want to aim
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.940
think of the Bulls are you want to aim
at because what happen once you've

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
at because what happen once you've
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.709
at because what happen once you've
established a depth set in metric is

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719
established a depth set in metric is
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540
established a depth set in metric is
that the team can iterate very quickly

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
that the team can iterate very quickly
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.850
that the team can iterate very quickly
how different ideas run experiments and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
how different ideas run experiments and
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.430
how different ideas run experiments and
very quickly use the DEF set and the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
very quickly use the DEF set and the
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.470
very quickly use the DEF set and the
to evaluate classifiers and try to pick

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
to evaluate classifiers and try to pick
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.590
to evaluate classifiers and try to pick
the best one so machine learning teams

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
the best one so machine learning teams
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.780
the best one so machine learning teams
are often very good at your shooting

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
are often very good at your shooting
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.570
are often very good at your shooting
different areas of the target and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580
different areas of the target and

the bottom might be very different than
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.640
the bottom might be very different than
the regions in the dead sets so you

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650
the regions in the dead sets so you
 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.990
the regions in the dead sets so you
might have an office of cards and

realize that all the months of work you
spend optimizing to the death set it's

can move the bullseye to a different
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.850
can move the bullseye to a different
location somewhere else so to avoid this

what I recommend instead is that you

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630
what I recommend instead is that you
 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.260
what I recommend instead is that you
take all this data preventing the

shuffle data into the depth and template
 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.000
shuffle data into the depth and template
so that both the dev and test sets have

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010
so that both the dev and test sets have
 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.760
so that both the dev and test sets have
data from all eight regions and that the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770
data from all eight regions and that the
 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.400

here's another example this is a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410
here's another example this is a
 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.380
here's another example this is a
actually true story or some details

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390
actually true story or some details
 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.300
actually true story or some details
changed so I know machine learning teams

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310
changed so I know machine learning teams
 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.850
changed so I know machine learning teams
actually spent several months optimizing

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860
actually spent several months optimizing
 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.009
actually spent several months optimizing
on a death set which was comprised of

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019
on a death set which was comprised of
 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.860
on a death set which was comprised of
loan approvals for medium income zip

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870
loan approvals for medium income zip
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.540
loan approvals for medium income zip
codes so the specific machine learning

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550
codes so the specific machine learning
 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.120

loan application can you predict Y which

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459
loan application can you predict Y which
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.040
loan application can you predict Y which
is whether or not they'll be paying

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050
is whether or not they'll be paying
 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.290
is whether or not they'll be paying
alone so this helps you decide whether

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300
alone so this helps you decide whether
 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.750
alone so this helps you decide whether
or not to approve a loan and so the DEF

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760
or not to approve a loan and so the DEF
 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.420
or not to approve a loan and so the DEF
sets came from loan applications they

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430
sets came from loan applications they
 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.460
sets came from loan applications they
came from medium income zip codes

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470
came from medium income zip codes
 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.530
came from medium income zip codes
Zucco's is what we call postal codes in

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
Zucco's is what we call postal codes in

the United States but I've been working

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640
the United States but I've been working
 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.920
the United States but I've been working
on this for a few months the team then

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930
on this for a few months the team then
 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.860
on this for a few months the team then
suddenly decided to test this on data

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870
suddenly decided to test this on data
 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.020
suddenly decided to test this on data
from low-income zip codes or low-income

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030
from low-income zip codes or low-income
 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.670
from low-income zip codes or low-income
postal codes and of course the district

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680
postal codes and of course the district
 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.560
postal codes and of course the district
ocean of data for medium income and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570
ocean of data for medium income and
 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.629
ocean of data for medium income and
lower-income zip codes is very different

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639
lower-income zip codes is very different
 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.330
lower-income zip codes is very different
than the cost failure then they spend so

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340
than the cost failure then they spend so
 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.010
than the cost failure then they spend so
much time optimizing in the former case

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020
much time optimizing in the former case
 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.320
much time optimizing in the former case
just didn't work well at all on the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330
just didn't work well at all on the
 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.469
just didn't work well at all on the
latter case and so this took our team

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479
latter case and so this took our team
 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.659
latter case and so this took our team
actually wasted about three months of

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669
actually wasted about three months of
 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.900
actually wasted about three months of
time and had to go back and really do a

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910
time and had to go back and really do a
 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.480
time and had to go back and really do a
lot of work and what happened here what

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490
lot of work and what happened here what
 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.939
lot of work and what happened here what
the team spent three months aiming for

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949
the team spent three months aiming for
 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.029
the team spent three months aiming for
one target and then after three months

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039
one target and then after three months
 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.159
one target and then after three months
the manager asked oh how are you doing

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169
the manager asked oh how are you doing
 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.020
the manager asked oh how are you doing
on setting this other target is in a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030
on setting this other target is in a
 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.790
on setting this other target is in a
totally different location and it just

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800
totally different location and it just
 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.500
totally different location and it just
was a very frustrating experience for

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510
was a very frustrating experience for
 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.420
was a very frustrating experience for
the team so what I recommend for

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430
the team so what I recommend for
 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.159
the team so what I recommend for
celebrate death set and test set is

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169
celebrate death set and test set is
 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.529
celebrate death set and test set is
choose a definite test set to reflect

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539
choose a definite test set to reflect
 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.060
choose a definite test set to reflect
data you expect to get in the future and

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070
data you expect to get in the future and
 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.640
data you expect to get in the future and
consider important to do well on and in

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650
consider important to do well on and in
 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.010
consider important to do well on and in
particular the death set and the test

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020
particular the death set and the test
 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.879
particular the death set and the test
set here should come from the same

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889
set here should come from the same
 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.839
set here should come from the same
distribution so whatever type of data

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849
distribution so whatever type of data
 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.089
distribution so whatever type of data
you expect to get in the future and want

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099
you expect to get in the future and want
 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.029
you expect to get in the future and want
to do well on try to get data that looks

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039
to do well on try to get data that looks
 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.339
to do well on try to get data that looks
like that and whatever that data is put

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349
like that and whatever that data is put
 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.080
like that and whatever that data is put
it into both your death set and your

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090
it into both your death set and your
 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.870
it into both your death set and your
test set because that way you're putting

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880
test set because that way you're putting
 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.520
test set because that way you're putting
the target where you actually want to

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530
the target where you actually want to
 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.110
the target where you actually want to
hit and you having the team iterate very

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120
hit and you having the team iterate very
 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.529
hit and you having the team iterate very
efficiently to hitting that same target

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539
efficiently to hitting that same target
 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.870
efficiently to hitting that same target
hopefully the same target well you

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880
hopefully the same target well you
 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.339
hopefully the same target well you
notice we haven't talked yet about how

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349
notice we haven't talked yet about how
 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.560
notice we haven't talked yet about how
to set up a training set we'll talk

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570
to set up a training set we'll talk
 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.240
to set up a training set we'll talk
about the training sets in a later video

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250
about the training sets in a later video
 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.219
about the training sets in a later video
but the important takeaway from this

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229
but the important takeaway from this
 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.939
but the important takeaway from this
video is that setting up the dev set as

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949
video is that setting up the dev set as
 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.240
video is that setting up the dev set as
well as the evaluation metric is really

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250
well as the evaluation metric is really
 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.250
well as the evaluation metric is really
defining what targets you want to aim at

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260
defining what targets you want to aim at
 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.830
defining what targets you want to aim at
and hopefully by setting the death set

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840
and hopefully by setting the death set
 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.240
and hopefully by setting the death set
and the test set to the same

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250
and the test set to the same
 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.159
and the test set to the same
distribution you're really aiming at

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169
distribution you're really aiming at
 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.990
distribution you're really aiming at
whatever target you hope your machine

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000
whatever target you hope your machine
 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.450
whatever target you hope your machine
learning team will hit the way you

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460
learning team will hit the way you
 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.390
learning team will hit the way you
choose your training set will affect how

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400
choose your training set will affect how
 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.010
choose your training set will affect how
long you can actually hit that target

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020
long you can actually hit that target
 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.140
long you can actually hit that target
but we can talk about that separately in

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150
but we can talk about that separately in
 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.080
but we can talk about that separately in
a later video so I know some machine

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090
a later video so I know some machine
 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.550
a later video so I know some machine
learning teams that could literally have

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560
learning teams that could literally have
 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.110
learning teams that could literally have
saved themselves months of work they

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120
saved themselves months of work they
 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.060
saved themselves months of work they
follow the guidelines in this video so

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070
follow the guidelines in this video so
 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.469
follow the guidelines in this video so
how these guidelines will help you to

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479
how these guidelines will help you to
 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.500
how these guidelines will help you to
mix it turns out that the size of the

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010
of them is also changing a few Gurney
 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.960
of them is also changing a few Gurney
let's talk about that in the next video
