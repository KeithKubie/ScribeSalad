00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it-

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.940
Evilina: My Little Pony!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.120
I used to wonder what frendship could be! My Little-

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.120
NC: We're not turning this video into another Brony message board!

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.840
Now sit down!

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.420
If you haven't noticed, I have been roped in to babysitting this week,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.780
and all because I owe a certain someone a certain favor.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.840
NC: Hey Mr. Zebub, you almost done?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.780
Devil: Almost. I'm finalizing the plans for my next movie deal.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.660
NC: That's what I get for trading my soul for a good Zod impression.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.720
So what do kids normally do? They make tofu or something?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.840
Evilina: Well, you could read me a story.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.540
Yeah. Okay.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.360
NC: Okay, this one's a classic. *clears throat*

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.820
"We looked! Then we saw him step in on the mat!

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.800
We looked! And we saw him! The Cat in the Hat!"

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.340
Evilina: Wait. Why does he look like a cat?

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.780
NC: Because he's a cat.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.660
Evilina: No, that's not what he looks like. He's supposed to be scary and weird and constantly out of breath.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.320
NC: What?

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.820
Evilina: And, why is it all in rhyme?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.760
NC: Because it's Dr. Seuss; everything he does is in rhyme.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.280
Evilina: No, he's only supposed to rhyme once in a while,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.280
And where's all the subplots? And in-jokes?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.280
And advertisements? And forced morals? And penis innuendos?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.300
NC: What the fuck are you talking about?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.960
Evilina: This.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.960
NC: This isn't Dr. Seuss; it's not even close!

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.920
NC: It's evil, corporate pandering with freaky imagery that's promoting everything that's wrong with humanity!

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.200
NC: This was next to Son of the Mask, wasn't it?

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.100
Evilina &amp; NC: Yeah.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.300
NC: Who would think in any way this innocent little story would be connected to this big budget sellout?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.420
???: I would!

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.100
NC: Oh, no, it's Peter Soulless.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.240
Evilina: Who?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.680
NC: The Hollywood executive who bought all the film rights to Dr. Seuss. Call him "The Ass with the Cash."

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.660
Peter Souless: I see you're young and impressionable, too. So I have a jiggy load of "crunk" here for you!

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.460
With modern jokes, adult jokes, and poop jokes galore. References kids won't get, who could ask for more?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.200
It's totally "boss" and with the "in crowd," is there any "pwnage" this funkiness allows?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.920
NC: Stop it! Stop it! Stop trying to sound cool!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.260
Peter Soulless: Is my hizzy in a nizzy?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.080
NC: Look, you clearly have no idea how people talk and you clearly have no idea what made Dr. Seuss a great author.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.460
Peter Soulless: Whatever do you mean?

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.120
NC: Alright, if I can take this chance to enlighten you on how Dr. Seuss is being butchered nowadays, maybe some good can come of this,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.080
What do you say, kiddo? You ready to take a trip into some awkward humor?

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.900
Evilina: With Mike Myers? Of course!

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.380
NC: Let us journey into "Dr. Seuss's" The Cat in the Hat.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.320
NC(vo): It's important to note that the director of this movie is Bo Welch,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.020
a world famous production designer on a lot of Tim Burton movies and Barry Sonnenfeld productions.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.760
NC:(vo): I say this because clearly he as much better at directing the set than he is at directing his actors.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.360
NC:(vo): Although as you can see, even that can get a little extreme.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.100
NC:(vo): I feel like I'm at the beginning of a "Doublemint Gum" commercial.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.980
(The Doublemint Gum commercial)

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.620
We see the mother works at a hand sanitizer factory also known as "Howie Mandel's candy store"

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.500
Where we see one of the many reoccurring themes in current Dr.Seuss productions : Weak suburban commentary

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.040
Mr. Humberfloob : Tonight is our bi-monthly meet and greet party. Tonight's host is...! Joan Walden.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.400
Joan, if your house is as messy as last time...

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.400
YOU'RE FIIIIRRRREED!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.440
NC :...So what level of "not caring" are actors at in this movie?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.340
Uh... Let's see, we passed Dennis Hopper from Super Mario Brothers

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.960
Uh, passed Russell Crowe from anything he is in

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.400
And we're right up to... *Ding sound* Jeremy Irons from Dungeons and Dragons!

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.800
Together : Tatata!

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.620
Joan : My kids will be on their best behavior

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.540
Mr. Humberfloob : Great.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.800
NC (vo): We then see her two kids at home played by Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.520
Who's best known for playing a strange looking lifeless puppet.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.240
Oh, and Coraline. * Badum tss*

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.980
They spend most of their time setting up their story arcs, that will obviously be changed by our thankfully neutered protagonist.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.600
He's a messy troublemaker, she's a control freak and neither of them puts any emotion into their performances.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.000
Conrad : This was all Sally's fault.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.700
Sally : I tried to tell him, Mom.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.580
Conrad : Why don't you go upstairs?

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.860
Sally : This is just as much my fault.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.380
Conrad : I thought they always landed on their feet.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.220
Sally : Have to add this one to my list.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.200
Conrad : This is my fault.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.060
NC (vo) : Stephen Hawking's voice box emotes more than them!

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.800
Conrad : Why do I always have to do the opposite of what I'm supposed to?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.580
[Computer generated voice] : God, put some fucking emotion into it.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.040
NC (vo) : And speaking of actors who just gave up

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.860
Alec Baldwin plays the evil neighbour who wants to marry the mother and send her son Conrad off to military school.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.500
Why? I don't know!

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.260
Something has to acount for this uncomfortably forced conflict here, though!

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.980
Joan : Maybe if you'd just behave, I wouldn't have to consider military school!

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.620
I wish I could trust you!

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.240
Conrad : I wish I had a different mom.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.360
Joan : Well, sometimes I wish the same thing.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.620
NC (vo) : Okay, Souless- Here's one of the big problems here.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.980
If you're going to show family dilemmas and conflicts, try actually showing it!

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.140
The kid and mother snapping at each other; if you can even call it that it's so unemotional.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.540
Seems needlessly mean and unjustified.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.520
There's little to no build-up to such harshness being delivered from both of them.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.860
Souless: Well, we needed to add some extra morals.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.420
NC: Why? The one in the book is fine!

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.640
As well as unique!

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.280
Sometimes a little rule-breaking is ok as long as it doesn't go too far.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.980
That's a rare message for kids.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.980
And Seuss delivered it in a balanced way because the kids were normal kids!

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.540
Here, the boy is already out of control,

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.680
and the girl is the other extreme.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.140
So the message is already getting confused!

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.600
Souless: Well, we needed to change it around for the longer running time!

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.620
NC: Polar Express kept the message focused with a longer running time; Mary Poppins kept the message focused with a  longer running time.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.900
Why couldn't this?

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.000
Souless: Oh what good are those movies anyway!

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.140
They don't even have pop cultural references!

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.740
That! and we knew Mike Myers would only be funny for one more year and

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.480
we had to cash in on him as quickly as possible, speaking of which

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.120
NC: ...yeah it's just about that time isn't it?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.220
After a shockingly offensive stereotype comes to babysit they start watching TV

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.300
[stock shouting and punching sounds]

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.580
Conrad &amp; Sally: Taiwanese Parliament.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.360
Racist Babysitter: You tell them, Qai Jung. No more big government.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.260
NC: Okay, movie, that was like five racist jokes at time.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.660
We are losing track of what qualities we are supposed to not like about them.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.440
Evilina: Am I suppose to hate how they talk different or how they look different?

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.960
NC: As she falls asleep, we finally get the appearance of our geisha covered in pubes...

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.740
Mike Myers.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.160
[children screaming]

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.140
Mike Myers Nightmare "Cat": That could've gone better.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.560
Evilina: Mr. Critic, is that what happens when Pepe La Pew "makes whoopee" with Ronald McDonald?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.880
NC: Yes. Yes, it is.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.140
Evilina: [whispering] I'm afraid.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.840
NC: [also whispering] We all are.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.460
Cat: "Now what are we hiding from? nyuhuhuhu~"
Children: [screaming]

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:52.120
NC: Now, for those who don't remember, there was a time when Mike Myers ruled the FUCKING world.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.920
He was a hit on Saturday Night Live, grew a cult following with Austin Powers, resulting in a

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.080
monster hit with its sequel, landed another big hit with Shrek, killed as a host of the MTV Movie Awards...

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.400
And I'm just gonna say it.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.400
He may not have been that funny.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.880
[gasp]

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.400
[ringtone]

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.440
Devil: WHAT?!

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.160
NC: Alright, maybe not as funny as we built him up to be.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.860
He had some good characters, he had some good bits, and he seemed to have a likeable personality.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.840
But after a while, people started to catch on to the repetition of his humor.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.780
That, without proper support, couldn't keep everybody laughing for very long.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.640
And nowhere is that more PAINFULLY spotlighted than in this flick.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.480
Look at this scene, where he has to keep you entertained for a good solid minute just on his own.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:50.240
Cat: "Why, I'm the Cat in the Hat! There's no doubt about that! I'm a supah-fun-diferous feline,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.240
who's here to make sure that you're..."

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.040
"...me-line? Key lime?"

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.320
"...Tur

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.280
pen

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:00.780
tine?"

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.940
"I got nothin'. I'm not so good with the rhyming. Not really. No."

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:13.760
NC: Yeah. The Cat in the Hat, the most famous Dr. Seuss character of all time, is not good at rhyming.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Start to see what I'm talking about?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.380
His shtick seems to be acknowledging that what he's saying isn't funny, which at first IS funny.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.040
But then you realize constantly acknowledging what he's saying isn't funny suddenly results in thinking

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.740
what he's saying isn't funny.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.740
Conrad: "Where did you come from?"

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.680
Cat: "My place, whaddaya think?" [dying hyena breath]

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.480
NC: On top of that, he doesn't really have much of a character. I mean, I guess it's trying to be Bugs Bunny...

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.540
...ish. But he never really seems to care about what his motivation is, or how to carry it out.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.460
He just seems more concerned about making bad jokes and winking to the camera than he does actually

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.600
interacting with the kids. Half the time, he doesn't even look them in the face.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.180
Peter Soulless: Oh, but come on, Critic! He has this laugh!

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.760
Cat: "nyuhuhuhu"

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.780
NC: Okay, that doesn't create a three dimensional character.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.760
Peter: What if he did it again?

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.920
"huhuhahahaha"

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.040
NC: Doing it again isn't gonna change anything-

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.740
Peter: What about again?

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.820
"hyuhuauhahaha"

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.140
NC: No!
Peter: And again!
[cat laugh]

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.780
NC: No!!
Peter: And again...
[cat laugh]

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.420
NC: No.
Peter: And again!
[cat laugh]

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:21.600
[Peter and NC fighting over Mike Myers' death rattle of a laugh]

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.360
{i'm doing this for free and you couldn't pay me enough to hear Mike Myers "laugh" ever again}

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.340
NC: STOP IT!!!!!!

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.320
Having him laugh again and again does not give him an identity.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.960
I mean, he's not as good as...

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.560
Peter: What?

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.700
NC: Don't make me say it.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.320
Peter: Say what?

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.860
NC: Please, don't.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.720
Peter: What were you going to say?

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.220
NC: I can't.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:36.720
Peter: What is it?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.600
NC: Please don't make me say it.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.760
Peter: What is it?

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.080
NC: He's not as good as Jim Carrey in "The Grinch."

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.440
Soulless and Evilina: Ahhh!

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.120
NC: Shut up!

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:53.160
NC: (vo) It doesn't mean it was good, but Carrey had a clear character: an eccentric grump.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.480
And his face was expressive enough to work its way through all that make-up.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.520
Myers seems to have two expressions: "pedo smile" and "happy-I-shit-my-pants".

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.640
On top of that, Carrey had enough energy to become one with the costume.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.520
He can work with it to show how fully animated his body could be.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.340
With Myers, it always looks like he's restrained by it like he's fighting against it.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.820
Every time he's done with a take, it looks like he's gonna pass out on Dakota Fanning.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.060
Even the costume just looks like a cheap cut out you stick your face into.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.740
Except it's being worn by one of the Wayans brothers from White Chicks.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.520
I don't necessarily blame Myers for this. It's just, it wasn't the right casting.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.660
And to be fair, how can anyone make a joke like this in a Dr. Seuss movie work?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:47.420
"Humina humina humina humina! Who is this?" [dying hyena breath] "Oooh!" [excited (?) gasp]

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.200
Conrad: "That's my mom."

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.900
*record scratch*

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.800
"Awkward. Yeah."

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.080
NC: Really, Soulless? A dick innuendo joke?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.260
Soulless: Well, that was just to throw in a little dirty humor for the adults.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.400
NC: Why do you need to insert dirty humor into a Dr. Seuss film?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.880
Soulless: Well, if you want the answer, and I know that you do, here's Analyst 1 and Analyst 2!

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.320
NC: Hey, how come you keep going in and out of rhyming? It's pretty inconsistent.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.420
Analyst 2: Well, it's a lazy way of connecting to the source material.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.820
Soulless: *AHEM!*

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.100
Analyst 2: Oh! Oh, I mean, artistically, it seemed to make the most sense.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.880
Analyst 1: You see, Critic, according to polls, or so we've been told, when kids hear adult jokes,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.560
A1: it makes them feel old. They feel more grown up to be in on the gag.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.520
A1: Once seen in the trailer, it's cash in the bag.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.880
Analyst 2: The same goes for butt jokes and modern slang, too.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.400
A2: It makes the crowd think we're on the same level as you. We talk the same lingo and reference pop culture.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.460
A 1: Yes, focus groups make us more profitable vultures.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.360
NC: But Seuss got popular because he wrote what he wanted to see, not what focus groups wanted to see.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.760
Have you ever considered the possibility that maybe people don't know what's best for them?

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:58.520
And by continually giving them the same crap they'll never know what's different so they'll just keep asking for the same crap?

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.900
Analyst 1: Well, the chart says...

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.460
NC: I'm not asking the charts, I'm asking you!

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.020
Analyst 1: Well, the chart says...

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.240
NC: YOU ARE EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG WITH ENTERTAINMENT!

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.400
Analyst 1: But the chart says...

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.620
Analyst 1: There's no focus groups! No numbers! The only thing a corporate tool can do when he doesn't have a boss! And that's...

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.000
*BANG*

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.400
Analyst 2: I'm coming with you!

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.940
*BANG*

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.580
Evilina: *adorable little giggle* That was funny!

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.840
Soulless: Who turned off the charts?! Did you turn off the charts?! I didn't turn off the charts!

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.900
NC (vo): So the Cat whips out a device called a "Phunometer", which you would think would shows how "phunominally" annoying he is,

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.180
but instead restates what we already knew.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:50.160
Cat: "You're a control freak and you're a rule breaker. That'll be $700, who's your insurance carrier?"

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.020
Fish: "Stop this right now!"

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.700
[annoying Meyers sound]

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.300
Conrad: "Who said that?"

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.700
Fish: Me! Remember the fish?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.660
NC (vo): Actually, no! We don't remember because this is the first time you've been introduced.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
Kind of late in the game to bring this character in out of nowhere, isn't it?

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.120
NC (vo): AAH! When did the Chiquita Banana become a mime?

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.860
Cat: (singing) "There was this cat I knew back where I was bred/He never listened to a single thing his mother said..."

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:23.160
NC (vo): You know, I sometimes wonder if this is all just a really wacky episode of To Catch A Predator.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:29.220
Cat: [still singing] "So have fun, fun, fun/Go insane and have some fun, fun, fun. Just look at me!"

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:42.740
NC (vo): No, I got it. I know what this is: this is one of those fake trailers before Tropic Thunder. The one that looks real but is so goddamn stupid it couldn't possibly exist, except this one actually exists and you should cry because of it.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.280
Kids: THAT'S MOM'S DRESS!!!!!!

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.680
Cat: This filthy thing?

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.160
Sally: She was gonna wear that tonight and you ruined it.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.900
Cat: Honey, it was ruined when she bought it. *finger snaps* Mmm hmm, Yeah. *finger snaps*

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:04.700
NC: ...You know, whenever I have too much hope, I'll just remember to play that scene to remind me that all is lost.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.180
NC: All is lost.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:18.000
Cat: These Things will not bite you, they wanna have fun. So without further ado, meet Thing 2 and Thing 1!

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.780
[ominous electronic hum]

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.540
Things: Ta-da!

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.660
*screaming*

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.700
NC (vo): When did Marge Simpson mutate with Alfred E. Neuman? Those are hideous!

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.960
Soulless: What? They look like the Dr. Seuss book!

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.920
NC: Alright, first of all, when did you start following anything from the Dr. Seuss book?

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.580
NC (vo): Second, what makes something cute in a drawing doesn't necessarily make it cute in real life.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:48.460
In drawing, you can get away with leaving certain things out, like upper lips, per se.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:54.340
They would look like wrinkles if you put them in a drawing, but in real life, it looks fucking scary!

00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.900
NC (vo): The reason Cindy Lou was the only cute character in the Grinch was because she's the only one who was allowed to have an upper lip.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.280
Everyone else looked like a demon possessed Hungry Hungry Hippo!

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.200
And these two look like the Shining girls if Bozo the Clown gave them Jager bombs!

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.420
Conrad: Don't catch him! Aaah!

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.580
NC (vo): But, uh-oh, the dog gets away and they have to get it back!

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.900
Cat: (holds a hoe) Time to die.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.880
Conrad: Cat, you scared him away!

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.040
Cat: Dirty hoe.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:31.160
Count: 8! That's 8 times Dr. Seuss rolled in his grave. Ah ah ah ah!

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.500
Conrad: Cat, get down! They're gonna see you! Hide!

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.320
NC (vo): Oh, so they finally hanged him. That's nice.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.380
*WHACK* *CRUNCH* *CAT SCREAMS*

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:54.080
(According to the script, this was the Cat's "happy place".)

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.080
*YELLING*

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.460
Evilina: Critic?

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:47.740
(Borodin's Nocturne in D plays while NC contemplates the meaning of life.)

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.840
We'll be right back after these messages.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.340
NC: Hello?

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.080
Evilina: Hello, Critic? Are you coming back?

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:14.360
NC: (sighs) I don't know, child... It's just... that last scene... what can somebody say to that?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.920
Evilina: I don't know...

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:22.520
NC: I mean, does it make any sense at all? Cat gets hit in the balls, he's in a dress, and on a swing...

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.300
Evilina: With a unicorn...

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:30.520
NC: I have nothing for it... I have no jokes at all...  Have I lost my mind, Evilina?

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.420
Could it be that... I've lost my touch at making fun of scenes like this?

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.280
Could it be that... "The Cat in the Hat" has broken me?

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.140
Evilina: I don't know, but my dad will kill you if he knows that you left me alone instead of babysitting.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.940
NC: Yeah, I guess you're right... I'll be back soon.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.800
NC: So, after that scene...

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.060
NC (vo): Baldwin chases after them, but they escape through a kiosk where a party is going on...

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.360
Yeah, that's... never explained - in fact, it's forgotten just as quickly as it's discovered - as they make their way back home.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.800
Cat: Here she is, the "Super-Luxurious, Omnidirectional Whatchamajigger."

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.020
Sally: S-L-O-W?

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:41.560
Cat: Yeah, S.L.O.W. It's better than the last name we had. "Super-Hydraulic, Instantaneous Transporter."

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.440
Conrad: Oh! You mean...

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.420
Cat: OH! Quick to the S.L.O.W.! Hueahaha

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:54.440
Count: 9! That's 9 times Dr. Seuss rolled in his grave! Ah ah ah ah!

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:00.180
NC (vo): Only to discover that the Cat's magic box has been left open and is spreading chaos everywhere.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:05.120
But, let's be really honest, it's just trying to look like one of the Seuss attractions at Universal Studios.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.860
Don't believe me? They literally say it.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.800
Conrad: THIS IS AMAZING! IT'S LIKE A RIDE AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK!!!

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.160
Cat: You mean like at... Universal Studios? Cha-ching.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:26.080
NC (vo): Yes, you just saw that: He literally directly advertised to you Universal Studios.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:35.320
I don't think the entire running time of "The Wizard" is as big a sellout as that mere couple of seconds of Mike Myers winking.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.760
In fact, I think every Dr. Seuss movie can be summed up in that one gesture.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.700
NC (vo): Painfully obvious references? [one cha-ching] Totally unneeded adult jokes? [two cha-ching]

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:51.700
Appealing desperately to the lowest common denominator the same way Michael Bay appeals to penises and Stephanie Meyer appeals to vaginas? [Red cha-ching, blue cha-ching]

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.800
In fact, why don't we just make this the new Dr. Seuss logo?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.360
NC (vo): Dr. Seuss!

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.800
Lickboot: We've GOT to have... MONEY!

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:07.580
NC (vo): So they find the crate and finally close it. All's awful that ends awful. But, wait! The place is still a mess!

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.540
Conrad: You need to get out.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.200
Cat: But I thought you two wanted to have fun today.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:18.180
Conrad: Look around, Cat. You were right. It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. And you don't know when enough is enough.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.300
Cat: Please.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.620
Kids: OUT!

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:26.880
NC (vo): Finally! The only justified moment in this film! I just wish it happened an hour and a half ago.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:35.960
NC (vo): But, if you know the story - oh, let's face it, it doesn't matter if you do; they follow it so rarely - the Cat comes in and fixes everything.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:41.660
And it wouldn't be a shitty Dr. Seuss movie if we didn't have a shitty pop song for the soundtrack.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:48.120
("Getting Better" by Smash Mouth)

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.380
NC (vo): And you're not gonna believe it...but, they literally reference that selling point, too

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.200
Cat: We even managed to work in an up-tempo pop tune for the soundtrack. That's important.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.100
NC: Oh, for God's sake... Soulless, why are you being so obvious with how evil you are?!

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:08.780
Soulless: Well, it's Hit Writing Fact #1: "If you say you're doing something painful and stupid, it's immediately no longer painful and stupid."

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.300
Evilina: Oh, I see. Critic, I'm going to hit you.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.900
NC: OW!

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.720
Evilina: You can't scream. It's no longer painful and stupid.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.840
NC: YES, IT IS! This whole movie is!  (Evilina is on the verge of crying) SHUT UP!

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:29.380
NC (vo): Even with its dumbass ending of Mom happily returning, Baldwin being dumped, and the party going great!

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:36.740
Soulless: But... by having grown-up humor, we make it more adult. By modernizing the dialogue, we make it more timeless.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.580
And by changing the source material, we show how much we want to make it even better.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.600
NC: No. Every single thing you said, you got backwards.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:52.000
NC (vo): By having grown-up humor, you make it more childish. By modernizing the dialogue, you make it more dated.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.200
And by changing the source material, you show how much you don't respect what's already perfect.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:03.040
I'm not going to act like everything Seuss wrote was a masterpiece, but when he got it right, he got it right.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:09.040
They don't need to be updated. They don't need to be fixed. They don't even really need to have movies made about them!

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.600
NC: But if you're going to do it, the very least you can do is understand the source material.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.840
Soulless: Well, of course I understand the source material! (scoffs) They're just simple kid's books!

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:27.100
NC: No. They're NOT just simple kid's books. They're stories that we are continuing to read even today.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.540
They're stories that we remember years later, even when other stories fade from our memory.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.820
They're stories we will never forget - and for good reason!

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:42.940
They're stories that helped shape our childhoods, through well thought-out writing, imaginative drawings and endearing morals.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:52.760
And the idea of this... shaping somebody's childhood, the fact that it even has the same name... just makes me sick to my stomach!

00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.320
Maybe these "simple kids books" are far more adult than you give them credit for.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:06.780
And I guarantee that'll show, when years later, both children and adults will still be reading these "simple kids books"

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:12.660
while pandering bullshit like this disappears out of people's consciousness - also for good reason!

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.980
Good art doesn't come from focus groups and statistics.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.760
It comes from people who share how they see things in their own unique way.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.700
Evilina: Critic? I think I like your book better than I like the movie.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.400
NC: So do I, kiddo. So do I.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:40.800
Soulless: No. No, you're wrong! YOU'RE ALL WRONG! I'm going to show you ALL the Seuss movies until you appreciate them!

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.540
"The Grinch" with dog butt-kissing...

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.040
NC and Evilina: NO!

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.480
Soulless: "Horton Hears a Who" with anime references!

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.200
NC and Evilina: NO!

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.220
Soulless: "THE LORAX" WITH TAYLOR SWIFT! AND ZAC EFRON!!!!!

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.080
NC and Evilina: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!

00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:05.680
Satan: Did somebody miss her daddy? How's my little-? Hey...I know you. You're that executive that sold his soul to make those horrible Dr. Seuss movies!

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.280
NC: What?!

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.960
Satan: Oh, yeah... I rigged it so that each of them would be a hit. No person in their logical mind would willingly go see that shit.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.280
Evilina: That almost rhymes!

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.140
Soulless: It's not true. It's simply not true!

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.420
Satan: And now, it's time to return the favor.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.100
Soulless: Wha-?! AAAAAAH!!!!

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.660
NC: Hey, uh... I know it's not my place or anything, but, uh, could I throw in a suggestion torture?

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.060
Satan: Sure. What?

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.160
Satan: You want me to do what with the fork?

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.320
Satan: Buddy, I like the way you think.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.040
NC: Well, you gave me a lot to work with.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.960
Satan: Come, my little hellspawn!

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:54.600
NC: Enjoy that book! Well, maybe there's some hope after all. I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it--

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.380
Soulless: HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT FORK?! AAAAAAH!! AH! AAAAH! AH!!!

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.300
NC: While others would like to forget.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.720
Cat: Cha-ching.
