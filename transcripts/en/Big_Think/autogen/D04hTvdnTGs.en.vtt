00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.110
 
let me outline on four different

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120
let me outline on four different
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.080
let me outline on four different
possible explanations one can give and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
possible explanations one can give and
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.810
possible explanations one can give and
and I will just leave it leave it to the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
and I will just leave it leave it to the
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.090
and I will just leave it leave it to the
audience to reflect on on these four

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
audience to reflect on on these four
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800
audience to reflect on on these four
possible explanations for why we've had

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
possible explanations for why we've had
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.640
possible explanations for why we've had
this extraordinary run of bubbles and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
this extraordinary run of bubbles and
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.179
this extraordinary run of bubbles and
busts over the last number of decades

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189
busts over the last number of decades
 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.890
busts over the last number of decades
the first one which one might describe

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
the first one which one might describe
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.349
the first one which one might describe
is sort of the the left-wing or liberal

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
is sort of the the left-wing or liberal
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.110
is sort of the the left-wing or liberal
answer is that it has it has basically

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
answer is that it has it has basically
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.650
answer is that it has it has basically
been driven by reckless lending lack of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
been driven by reckless lending lack of
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.650
been driven by reckless lending lack of
regulation and greed and that and that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
regulation and greed and that and that
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.639
regulation and greed and that and that
in effect of the entire boom since the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
in effect of the entire boom since the
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.490
in effect of the entire boom since the
early Reagan years in 1982 was basically

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
early Reagan years in 1982 was basically
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.080
early Reagan years in 1982 was basically
driven by by by this escalating leverage

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
driven by by by this escalating leverage
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600
driven by by by this escalating leverage
that in effect was more fake than real

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
that in effect was more fake than real
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.049
that in effect was more fake than real
and and that it has basically come to an

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
and and that it has basically come to an
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.290
and and that it has basically come to an
end and that it worked what it did but

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
end and that it worked what it did but
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000
end and that it worked what it did but
it was basically the fault of the of the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
it was basically the fault of the of the
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.340
it was basically the fault of the of the
lenders and all kinds of agency problems

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
lenders and all kinds of agency problems
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.359
lenders and all kinds of agency problems
associated with them there's a there's a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
associated with them there's a there's a
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310
associated with them there's a there's a
second type of political ants which is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
second type of political ants which is
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.870
second type of political ants which is
the right-wing or conservative answer

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
the right-wing or conservative answer
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760
the right-wing or conservative answer
which is that it basically was the fault

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
which is that it basically was the fault
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.039
which is that it basically was the fault
of the borrowers that they were

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049
of the borrowers that they were
 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.179
of the borrowers that they were
recklessly borrowing all this money and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
recklessly borrowing all this money and
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.490
recklessly borrowing all this money and
it was it was people who were too greedy

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
it was it was people who were too greedy
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.910
it was it was people who were too greedy
in buying houses and going on credit and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920
in buying houses and going on credit and
 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.780
in buying houses and going on credit and
and that it was sort of the product of a

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790
and that it was sort of the product of a
 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.880
and that it was sort of the product of a
narcissistic and selfish generation that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
narcissistic and selfish generation that
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.069
narcissistic and selfish generation that
was not was short-sighted and not

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
was not was short-sighted and not
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200
was not was short-sighted and not
thinking about the future and under that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
thinking about the future and under that
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.520
thinking about the future and under that
sort of a narrative you might trace

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
sort of a narrative you might trace
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.550
sort of a narrative you might trace
things back to say 1968 and say that was

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
things back to say 1968 and say that was
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.660
things back to say 1968 and say that was
the year that everything went downhill

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
the year that everything went downhill
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490
the year that everything went downhill
in the US and the hippies took over or

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
in the US and the hippies took over or
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080
in the US and the hippies took over or
something something along those lines

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
something something along those lines
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.380
something something along those lines
now I think there's it is of course the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
now I think there's it is of course the
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999
now I think there's it is of course the
case these two explanations are not

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
case these two explanations are not
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889
case these two explanations are not
inconsistent and it is possible that

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
inconsistent and it is possible that
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810
inconsistent and it is possible that
there were problems with both the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
there were problems with both the
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.480
there were problems with both the
lenders and the borrowers and that in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
lenders and the borrowers and that in
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.190
lenders and the borrowers and that in
some sense there was something about

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200
some sense there was something about
 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.240
some sense there was something about
something deeper about the whole

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
something deeper about the whole
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520
something deeper about the whole
political system which failed to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
political system which failed to
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.319
political system which failed to
proactively deal with these things and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
proactively deal with these things and
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.660
proactively deal with these things and
just speaking up speaking on my own

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
just speaking up speaking on my own
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.800
just speaking up speaking on my own
context

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
context
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.389
context
you know it was obvious that there was

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
you know it was obvious that there was
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669
you know it was obvious that there was
an insane housing bubble three years ago

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
an insane housing bubble three years ago
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.910
an insane housing bubble three years ago
and you could talk about it you could

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920
and you could talk about it you could
 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.800
and you could talk about it you could
scream about it you could go on CNBC and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810
scream about it you could go on CNBC and
 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.690
scream about it you could go on CNBC and
tell people there was a housing bubble

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700
tell people there was a housing bubble
 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.820
tell people there was a housing bubble
they should not buy houses and it was

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830
they should not buy houses and it was
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.010
they should not buy houses and it was
like shouting into a hurricane nobody

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020
like shouting into a hurricane nobody
 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.440
like shouting into a hurricane nobody
was willing to listen and and there is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450
was willing to listen and and there is
 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.380
was willing to listen and and there is
something about the nature of these

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390
something about the nature of these
 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.390
something about the nature of these
things that is extraordinarily a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
things that is extraordinarily a
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.550
things that is extraordinarily a
procyclical in a bad way in terms of our

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560
procyclical in a bad way in terms of our
 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.440
procyclical in a bad way in terms of our
political system where when there is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450
political system where when there is
 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.270
political system where when there is
when there is when everything's going

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280
when there is when everything's going
 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.790
when there is when everything's going
well the regulations get loosened when

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800
well the regulations get loosened when
 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.740
well the regulations get loosened when
things are going badly they get

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750
things are going badly they get
 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.960
things are going badly they get
tightened so that in effect the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970
tightened so that in effect the
 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.880
tightened so that in effect the
political process has had the effect not

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
political process has had the effect not
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.970
political process has had the effect not
of dampening these bubbles and booms but

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
of dampening these bubbles and booms but
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.250
of dampening these bubbles and booms but
actually exacerbating them tremendously

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260
actually exacerbating them tremendously
 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.570
actually exacerbating them tremendously
and I think that is going to be one of

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580
and I think that is going to be one of
 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.720
and I think that is going to be one of
the real serious challenges we face in

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730
the real serious challenges we face in
 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.370
the real serious challenges we face in
the years ahead in the technology

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380
the years ahead in the technology
 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.590
the years ahead in the technology
context for example in the late 90s out

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600
context for example in the late 90s out
 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.270
context for example in the late 90s out
which you know they were obviously

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280
which you know they were obviously
 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.270
which you know they were obviously
tremendous abuses we dealt with the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
tremendous abuses we dealt with the
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.759
tremendous abuses we dealt with the
abuses with sarbanes-oxley and they've

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769
abuses with sarbanes-oxley and they've
 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.920
abuses with sarbanes-oxley and they've
been basically no more AI tech IPOs or

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930
been basically no more AI tech IPOs or
 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.229
been basically no more AI tech IPOs or
virtually no tech IPOs in six years so

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239
virtually no tech IPOs in six years so
 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.860
virtually no tech IPOs in six years so
we had we had an excessive boom the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870
we had we had an excessive boom the
 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.080
we had we had an excessive boom the
regulators did nothing and then we had

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090
regulators did nothing and then we had
 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.580
regulators did nothing and then we had
an excessive bust and we had an

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590
an excessive bust and we had an
 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.220
an excessive bust and we had an
overreaction and and again you can blame

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230
overreaction and and again you can blame
 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.259
overreaction and and again you can blame
it on special interest groups that are

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269
it on special interest groups that are
 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.810
it on special interest groups that are
serving the lenders you can blame it on

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820
serving the lenders you can blame it on
 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.560
serving the lenders you can blame it on
on on the desire of the borrowers to

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570
on on the desire of the borrowers to
 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.240
on on the desire of the borrowers to
keep the easy money going

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250
keep the easy money going
 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.509
keep the easy money going
but when basically both of them end you

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
but when basically both of them end you
 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.789
but when basically both of them end you
have to wonder how how this how this can

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799
have to wonder how how this how this can
 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.590
have to wonder how how this how this can
better be handled I think one of the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600
better be handled I think one of the
 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.560
better be handled I think one of the
challenges the that is happening on a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570
challenges the that is happening on a
 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.930
challenges the that is happening on a
global scale is that the inability of

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940
global scale is that the inability of
 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.479
global scale is that the inability of
our political system to proactively deal

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489
our political system to proactively deal
 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.720
our political system to proactively deal
with these bubbles is calling into

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730
with these bubbles is calling into
 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.759
with these bubbles is calling into
question the very concept of democratic

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769
question the very concept of democratic
 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.770
question the very concept of democratic
capitalism and I think one of the one of

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780
capitalism and I think one of the one of
 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.530
capitalism and I think one of the one of
the challenges in the next next four to

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540
the challenges in the next next four to
 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.720
the challenges in the next next four to
five years is that a sort of a more

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730
five years is that a sort of a more
 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.849
five years is that a sort of a more
authoritarian version of capitalism of

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859
authoritarian version of capitalism of
 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.430
authoritarian version of capitalism of
the sort that one sees in China will get

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440
the sort that one sees in China will get
 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.949
the sort that one sees in China will get
a lot more appeal because the argument

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959
a lot more appeal because the argument
 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.860
a lot more appeal because the argument
will be that it is able to to resist the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870
will be that it is able to to resist the
 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.129
will be that it is able to to resist the
the appeal of people and special

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139
the appeal of people and special
 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.140

interest groups and sort of act on

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150
interest groups and sort of act on
 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.970
interest groups and sort of act on
behalf of the whole society and I think

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980
behalf of the whole society and I think
 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.680

the challenge for the next president is

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690
the challenge for the next president is
 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.770
the challenge for the next president is
going to be to somehow rehabilitate of

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780
going to be to somehow rehabilitate of
 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.629
going to be to somehow rehabilitate of
the good name of democratic capitalism

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639

and it will be Italy quite a big
challenge and I certainly hope that

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000
challenge and I certainly hope that
 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.360

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.080
