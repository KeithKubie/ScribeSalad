 Hi, I'm Marti's grandson and today's 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.219
 next level chips is about how to change the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.859
 location of your application installation 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.869
 knows when the user tries to install the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.630
 application and even having a good 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.980
 an SD card ends up receiving an error 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.779
 Lack of memory 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.640
 this happens because the application does not 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.920
 is configured to allow 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.199
 installation other than the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.130
 phone's internal memory from the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.230
 android 2.2 the pelÃ© v8 is possible to place 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.140
 a parameter in your manifest for 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 change this location to this parameter 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.789
 called android 2.1 installed complaint ' 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.379
 where you can specify some 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.320
 parameters to change your configuration 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.840
 as a glance at these options the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.120
 the equivalent of not placing 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.739
 no configuration since it is the default 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 will cause the application to be 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.090
 installed internal memory only 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.590
 device and also does not allow you to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.719
 on sd card 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.150
 then there is an external super flex where 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.610
 you give the option of preference is for 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.530
 sd card installation and also allows 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.020
 that the user moves the phone to a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.720
 new back psd if you find it 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.750
 necessary and lastly we have the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.880
 where you delegate the decision to 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.220
 where the application should be installed on 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.290
 if by default the first attempt is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.619
 always the internal memory of the device 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.450
 and then try in the external memory that 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.400
 available if available 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.020
 here we see an example of a 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.720
 Manifest where I put the option 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.310
 android 2.1 installed keys as you prefer 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.259
 external or will first try 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.329
 to install in cairo st 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.810
 This is the tip of today. 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810
 close
