[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:06.888
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:09.675
SPEAKER 1: Thank you to Hannah.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:10.800
HANNAH RICHARDS: Thank you.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.177
So I just thought I'd
kick off with a little bit

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:14.760
from the book.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.980
So the book goes through every
organ in your body one by one.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.520
And obviously my favorite
organ is the gut.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.150
And one of the things we,
maybe as humans but definitely

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.230
as British people, don't like
talking about, other than sex,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.300
are the state of our bowels.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.860
So.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
"The gastrointestinal system is
a long and winding road housed

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.890
between the mouth and anus.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.530
Chemical reactions take
care to break down the food

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.940
that you eat and the liquid
you drink into small particles

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.950
to be absorbed by
the bloodstream

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.920
and to be used by energy by you.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.530
When ill health arises,
the gut is the first place

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.300
I look for answers.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.720
Our gut takes on wear and tear
from the stresses of life,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.170
and how we feel plays an
important part in how we eat.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.320
And how we feel depends
largely on the amount of stress

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.420
that we have in our lives.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.770
Eating is the most emotional
thing that we as humans do,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.170
sometimes seven or
more times a day.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.800
And the food we eat
or don't eat makes up

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.170
the health of your gut.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.370
It is said that you
are what you eat,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.510
and more recently, you
are what you don't absorb.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.930
But I like to say a more
accurate description would be

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.660
you are what you don't excrete.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.180
Flashback to the
Gillian McKeith days

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.990
when she was scraping around
in plastic boxes full of poo,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.590
shouting at overweight mortified
souls who probably wished

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.920
they'd read the contract small
print before their poo became

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.900
household viewing.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.030
Until Gillian
McKeith came along,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.550
poo was a subject as taboo
as sex, especially in the UK.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.100
And just as sex is certainly a
never easy subject to discuss,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.430
your bowels and their
regularity take on much

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.040
of the same awkward tone.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.220
To help me with my
clients, I have two charts.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.039
One's called the
Bristol Stool Chart,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.560
and the other is from
a book by Paul Chek

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.410
called "How to Eat,
Move and Be Healthy."

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.000
It gives names and faces to all
the potential states of bowels

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.980
and the consistency,
and they're all

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.870
dressed up in little outfits.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.900
It's called the Poopie
Policemen lineup.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.840
A lot of people do not know
what their bowels look like

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.150
or how often they go.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.820
Being regular by
whose standards?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.580
I remember a lady once
proudly telling me

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.010
of her regularity
of bowel movement.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.450
It was only when
I asked her what

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.750
her regular was, that we
discovered she was chronically

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.520
constipated.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.860
Twice a week is regular if
that's what you do every week,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.460
but it's certainly not normal.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.370
The bowel should move
roughly 30 centimeters--

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.470
12 inches-- of feces every day.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.760
That's the optimum regularity
we should all be striving for.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.950
So if you are moving your bowels
once or three times a day,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.260
if you've been moving
your bowels less than this

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.690
and you've been told
it's normal, it isn't.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.578
It's just very, very common."

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:16.870
And my name is Hannah Richards.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.980
I'm the author of "The
Best Possible You."

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.020
It's a unique guide
to being able to heal

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.910
your body nutritionally.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.370
So one of the things I
always ask people is,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.750
have you got the
guts for good skin?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.280
The skin is one of the-- is
the largest organ in your body,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.210
and it's a really good mirror as
to what's going on inside you.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.528
Inside you and with you and
for you, and all those things.

00:03:39.528 --> 00:03:41.070
So when we talk
about the human body,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.070
I'm talking about the physical,
the mental, the emotional,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.450
and the physical.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.750
And they all sing
and dance together.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.230
You can't single one
thing out in the body.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.090
Some types of medicine
try to do that,

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.810
but really, it's about looking
at all those different bodies

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.160
as a whole.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.230
And as Adriana said, I work as
a nutritionist and lifestyle

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.180
coach on South Molton Street.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.290
I used to run a health
clinic in Hampstead

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.130
called Move Three Sixty.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.730
I founded a juice company
for medicinal juicing

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.169
which ran a range
of juices and shots

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.169
which were all for different
organs and systems.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.070
And so I'm mainly in
Somerset now, and in London.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.930
So today, I'm going to try and
be a little bit interactive

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.910
if you're all up for being
a bit of a health detective

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.920
with each other.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.460
You certainly don't
have to at all.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.040
You can opt out.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.100
But the best thing about
being a nutritionist is really

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.860
is that it's just a bit of--
it's like being a detective.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.580
I look at a person
and try and figure out

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.350
what's going on with them.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.520
I do this by the way they
email me, the way they fill

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.150
in their paperwork, the
timings that they do that with,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.550
the language they use,
what their skin looks like,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.662
what their hair looks like, what
their fingernails look like.

00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:06.370
I even get them to
stick their tongue out

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.710
to me because I can
tell a lot from organ

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.980
systems with the tongue.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.270
And so it's really sort of
mapping all these things to be

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.690
able to find out what
is the etiology, what

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.790
is the root cause
of the ill health

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.470
that a person is experiencing.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.040
It's worth just
saying at this point

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.380
that they're all
just little signs.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.070
So if you have dark
circle under your eyes

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.140
and we say that's
the detoxification

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.030
system and the liver, you don't
have a chronic liver disorder.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.650
It's just one pathway
in the right direction.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.130
So the skin is a great
insight into your gut.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.620
And the face gives us--

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.520
has anyone heard of face mapping
or done sort of acupuncture?

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.020
And so a lot of this is all
very Eastern medicine as well.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.940
In Western medicine, we
tend to look through a hole

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.170
and see one thing and fix
that one thing without trying

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.990
to look at the reasons
as to why we got there

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.310
in the first place.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.020
And so this is all about looking
at the signs and symptoms

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.980
before disease
rears its ugly head.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.050
I'm sure we've all
got symptoms here.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.540
I'm not going to ask you
to put your hands up,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.090
but we collect them on
a daily, yearly basis.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.040
And the problem
is, with symptoms,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.800
is that they just fall into
this place of normality.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.430
So we put up with them for
so long, they become normal.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.460
Then we play the genetic card.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.390
My mom has it.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.200
My dad has it.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.560
It's in the family.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.480
It's part of us.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.800
It's who we are.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.040
And that's all very
true, but it's also quite

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.510
a nice, convenient excuse
not to take responsibility

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.740
for our own health.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.880
So your tongue is--

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.270
again, it's going to show
you where all the organs are.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.420
I'm going to show you
exactly the markings

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.130
and the colorations
of your tongue

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.980
so you can go and
have a look at it

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.700
and see how you could improve,
and whether those markings

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.320
match the symptoms that
you're experiencing, as well.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.300
Hair is a great
one for absorption.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.830
It's cool for men
to lose their hair.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.590
It's not so cool for
women to lose their hair.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.450
And yet, it's one of
the biggest things

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.130
I see in clinic more than--

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.360
probably after constipation
is hair thinning.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.600
And that's got to do with
our digestive systems.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.420
Our digestive capabilities
are so poor these days,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.240
and that's because of stress.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.690
And it's because of the bad
food choices that we have,

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.440
because the way the world has
made us into little robots,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.400
and it's basically stress.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.710
And stress, as we'll learn a bit
later, the biggest impact of it

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.620
is on our digestive system.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.420
Nails.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.030
Lucky for you if you've
got nail polish on.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.740
If you haven't, we're going to
go through some nail things,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.400
and we can look at
each other's nails.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.890
So really easy things to look
at as well, look out for.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.050
Bowels.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.630
You know, if you don't look at
them, start looking at them.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.640
They're the biggest
predictors of health.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.860
They tell you so much about
what's going on in you.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.070
Urine, and then
viscerosomatic pain patterns.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.309
That's sort of like--

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.179
has anyone ever been to--

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.400
had an injury?

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.080
Of course.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.100
And you go to the physio or the
osteopath, and you keep going,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.460
and you don't really feel
like you're getting anywhere.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.340
Well, when that
happens, what we need

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.090
to start doing is looking at
the nerve feeds to the organ.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.490
So if your spine
is a long column,

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:00.600
all the nerves feed off the
vertebrae into your organs.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.290
So when your right shoulder
hurts, for example,

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.690
and you can't--

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.450
no mechanical
therapy was working,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.740
you need to start
looking at the liver,

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.730
whether it's sluggish,
whether it needs detoxing,

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.640
whether it's got fibrosis,
all these sorts of things.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.987
So it's the organ systems that
need to start to be looked at.

00:09:21.987 --> 00:09:23.570
The other thing to
say about the book,

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.320
as well, is that every organ
takes you through an emotion.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.240
Again, in Chinese
traditional medicine,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.200
we believe that every organ
is associated with an emotion.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.720
So sometimes the reason that
initially there is a problem

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.550
can be an emotional issue
rather than anything else.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.390
The liver, for example,
is anger and frustration.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.140
And again, it's the one that
I work with most in clinic

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.500
because we're all stressed,
tired, and little addicts.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.720
We're always sort of profiling
each other all the time

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.270
in your jobs.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.020
You all work here because you're
really good at what you do.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.610
And it's the same in
being a nutritionist.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.290
I'm just looking at
people and going,

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.110
what is going on
with this person?

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.830
Why is their skin presenting
with a big red flush

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.090
on their cheeks?

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:24.465
Why does their face look like
it has this hue of tiredness?

00:10:24.465 --> 00:10:26.090
And so you've just
looked at each other

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.610
and you've probably
spotted things.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.810
And that's what I want
you to do to yourselves.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.020
Start noticing what's
changing in you.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.590
Because when things change,
they are signs and symptoms

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.720
of whether you're going
to go towards health

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.410
or whether you're going to move
towards a state of dis-ease.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:50.660
Symptoms live next to the door
of disease and not health.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.330
So the more symptoms
you start collecting

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.050
that you decide to call
normal, the further and longer

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.930
it takes to move
away and get better.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.370
So that's just
worth remembering.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.600
So, fingernails.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.900
Has anyone had, like,
split fingernails?

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.190
This is a really easy one.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.180
So sometimes your
fingernails get a bit brittle

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.080
and they break.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.260
Now, for ladies, it can be
because we use nail polish.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.550
I've got nail polish on.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.060
Can't see mine.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:24.117
It can be because we-- acetone
is such a horrible thing

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:25.700
to put on our nails,
so it breaks them

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.810
and makes them weak.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.240
But if they do
break all the time,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.690
it can be a sign that you're not
absorbing protein well enough.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.510
So we might be eating
enough protein,

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.330
and we can eat all the best
organic food in the world,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.120
but another question is
whether we absorb it.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.620
And that's the
biggest relationship

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.960
with digestion and hormones.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.860
We can eat all the best things,
but if we don't absorb it,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:55.610
it almost doesn't
make any difference.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.390
Lunars.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.700
Anyone know what
your lunars are?

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.600
The lunars are like
the little half-moons.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.360
So just look right at the
bottom of your nail beds.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.880
You should have almost-- you
should have about eight lunars.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.840
Sometimes people don't
have any lunars at all.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.990
Sometimes it can be a
sign of B12 deficiency.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.260
And again, that
can come and maybe

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.670
tie in with a brittle nail and
protein absorption as well.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.330
Sometimes people have
longitudinal lines

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.430
along the nail bed.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:34.170
This can be an iron deficiency,
a folic acid deficiency.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.730
Sometimes you can
have fallen over,

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.530
had a trauma to the nail bed,
and then they never grow back.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.210
So that's something
to consider as well.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.790
Sometimes if you have a red
line by the top of the nail--

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.290
sort of on all of them where
it looks a little bit red--

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.030
that's a sign of a kidney
detoxification issue,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:59.080
or certainly needs a bit of
help in those organs as well.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.200
And then probably one
of the most common ones,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.410
those little white
pittings on the nail.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.232
Yeah?

00:13:05.232 --> 00:13:06.940
And people, probably
growing up, everyone

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.108
was like, oh, it's calcium.

00:13:08.108 --> 00:13:09.150
Didn't drink enough milk.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.710
Because milk is the
only source of calcium.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.990
It's actually a zinc deficiency.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.530
And zinc is one of my favorite
supplements of all time.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.230
It's responsible for so much.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:27.270
Zinc is one of the cofactors for
making hydrochloric acid, which

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.570
lives in your stomach, which
helps you do everything,

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.370
basically, in your world.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.700
And we see more acid reflux--

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.310
we'll probably get on to this
a bit later, but acid reflux--

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.790
anyone with indigestion is a--

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.820
it's because of a deficiency
in hydrochloric acid.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.050
Adult-onset acne, for example,
is a deficiency in zinc.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.125
So zinc only likes to
be uptaken by itself.

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.000
So if you're thinking
about getting some zinc

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.290
or you have zinc, you should
take it last thing at night,

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.880
not with anything else.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.300
If you feel sick whenever taking
a supplement, or especially

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.370
zinc, because
sometimes you can, then

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.650
it's a sign that your
digestive capabilities,

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.220
the enzymes are quite low,
so you can't break it down.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.750
If you can't break
down food, you

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.300
can't break down a supplement.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.800
So you can take a
whole load of things,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.830
but again, if you don't
have the enzymes or the bile

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.400
or the acids to break
things down, then again,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.900
it's a little bit pointless.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.500
So obviously, healthy
nails, you should

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.690
be able to hold them down
and the blood disappears

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.200
and it pops back up.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.330
And if that happens,
that's great.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:43.460
If not-- another little trick,
if you're dehydrated, maybe

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.210
on a Friday morning, you
can pick your skin up

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.250
and it should hold.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.490
If there's enough water in you,
it should hold a little bit.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.430
So you should be able to see
the skin fall, as opposed

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.292
to completely disappear.

00:14:58.292 --> 00:15:00.500
So if it disappears without
you being able to see it,

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.900
drink some more water.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.210
So I'm just going to give
you a bit of a warning

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.215
about the next slide.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:18.200
So these are-- so this is
the longitudinal one, which

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.020
is maybe sometimes
the iron deficiency.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.540
And sometimes nails
also quite give you

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.250
big signs about cardiovascular.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.330
Like some of these nails
look very white and a pale.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.490
You know, the blood isn't
pumping around the body enough.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.800
And at the surface of the
skin are all the capillaries.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.890
So we should always
see this redness.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.950
Which is why, if you
do the nail test,

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.930
you should be able to
see a lot of redness.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.900
It disappears and then
pops back up again.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.410
That's the pitting, which
is the zinc deficiency.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.980
This is the brittle nails.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.780
So if you have got this, it
could be a protein deficient--

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.500
malabsorption, then
things like taking

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.900
in proteins in a more digestible
form, like chicken soup,

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.590
like bone broth, like
collagen, all these things--

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.010
it's almost like someone's
done the chewing for you.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.690
So it's less stress on the body.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.580
You're just going
to take it all in.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.750
Now, the toe.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.450
This is like a systemic
fungal infection.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:29.570
And often you see this in people
with Alzheimer's and dementia,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.260
where the body is just
constantly breaking down.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.630
Sometimes the beginning
of a fungal infection

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.660
can present with maybe a
black spot on a toenail.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.425
It's normally always the
toenails and not the fingers.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.490
But this is when the--

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.460
whether the fungal infection,
which is a yeast overgrowth,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.350
has really gotten out of hand.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:56.000
So sometimes we might see a
yeast overgrowth on a tongue.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.830
You might see it vaginally.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.070
You might see-- feel it,
like in the nasal area.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.849
Basically, every orifice
we have, if it's inflamed,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.708
the body's inflamed and unhappy,
it will try and excrete.

00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:11.150
It wants to get stuff out.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:16.010
And it does that by getting rid
of mucus and things like that.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.910
So all these, also, like the
flakiness around the cuticle,

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.630
these are deficiencies in
things like essential fatty

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.750
acids, your omegas that
you get from your fish

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.790
and your avocados, and
all these things as well.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.380
So everything is giving
you an indication

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.360
that not all is well.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.330
And the longer you
put up with stuff--

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.860
you know, there's that saying,
the longer you put off health,

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.620
you're going to have to find
time later to make it up.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.033
So it's really
worthwhile looking out

00:17:52.033 --> 00:17:54.200
for these signs and symptoms,
because they're really

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.790
easy to fix.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.000
I think with people
with adult-onset acne,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.180
zinc is a really easy way
to improve that, for sure,

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.430
because it's the start
of the digestive process.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.000
So yeah.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.750
I mean, anything gut-related,
within two to four weeks

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.570
if you do it all
sort of 95%, you're

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.500
going to see differences
because of the cell turnover.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.270
It's only when people commit
to things like 60% or 70%,

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.410
then results don't really show.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.490
OK.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:32.780
So face mapping.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.340
Apologies if you--
can you see that?

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.020
I'll point through it.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.210
So we probably all know
that when we've gone out

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.630
and had a bit too much to drink,
we wake up in the morning,

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.250
we've got bloodshot eyes.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.320
Certainly if you've
got Caucasian skin,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.180
it is a thankless--

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.580
it shows everything, you know?

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.990
That no amount of
makeup is going

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.810
to cover up a big night out.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.170
And mainly we see it
right under the eyes here.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.200
And they either-- they're very
black, they're sort of purple.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.490
You can see all
the tones in them.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.390
And that is because you've
overloaded the detoxification

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.790
system and the
kidneys and the liver

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.310
are under a bit of stress.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.460
You'll also notice that when
you're on a really nice health

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.590
cleanse and you're
feeling really good,

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.830
that you don't have those
dark circles under your eyes.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.520
Now, if you always have the
dark circles under your eyes,

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.730
then that's definitely one
of those sort of markers

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.030
to go, oh, maybe I need to look
at my kidney, my gallbladder,

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.810
my liver, the detoxification
system, because maybe it's

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.170
not functioning as
well as it could.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.180
In the book,
there's a case study

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.660
on the kidneys with a
friend I got to know,

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.960
and I always thought that he
just didn't look very well.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.280
And it was only later
that we discovered-- well,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.220
he told me because he only
discovered it late in life--

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.100
that he only had one kidney.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.920
And he only found out
when he was sort of 44.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.640
I have another friend who
has like four kidneys.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.390
So sometimes you just
don't know what's

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.600
going on if you don't ask
the questions or investigate

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.580
or are aware of your
signs and symptoms.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.600
Down here is another
place of kidneys.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.120
I actually probably see
it more in men than women,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.930
like sometimes a bit
of cracking here.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.110
Hormonally for women under
the chin-- and for men,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.650
but obviously women will see it
through the cycle, the changes.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.260
Sort of spots or
things around here.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.780
If you have any sort
of pussy sort of spots,

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.190
then that's your
lymphatic system.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.810
It's got too much
toxicity in it.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.650
And your lymph system
is like a system

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:47.710
all over the body that's
designed to drive toxicity out.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.720
You know, like the motility
of the peristalsis.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.970
Red cheeks.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:21:01.570
Sometimes they call it the
butterfly effect or rosacea.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.640
But for me, it's low
hydrochloric acid.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.860
So the acid lives
in your stomach.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.630
It breaks down protein.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.380
And when you struggle with--

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.280
let's say you had acid reflux,
for example, or indigestion,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.860
that would be a sign
that your acid was low.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.090
If the acid is low
in the stomach,

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:25.330
then you have got more chance of
picking up pathogens, antigens

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.310
crossing over into
the bloodstream

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.050
because it hasn't been
washed by the acid.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.780
It's a bit like
the theory of why

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.870
we have to wash before we go
into a public swimming pool

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.540
full of chlorine.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.580
But it's the same thing.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.820
If there's no acid
in your stomach,

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.080
then nothing gets washed.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.280
It's the first line of defense.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.580
So if you suddenly
feel like maybe you

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.040
can't eat meat as
well as you used to,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.530
or fat makes you feel
a little bit sick,

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.030
these could all be
signs that you've

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.160
got a low hydrochloric acid.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.240
Or equally, if you do have acid
reflux or indigestion, again,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.290
that's low hydrochloric acid.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.960
Now, some of you
may be thinking,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.720
she's got that completely
the wrong way around,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.420
because the medical industry
think that that is true.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.840
And so what they do is
give you Rennie tablets

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.630
to dampen down a level of
acid that you don't already

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.360
have, thereby depleting the
acid levels that you have,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.600
thereby not giving
you a line of defense.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.720
So if you have any questions
about that, let me know.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.900
But it's a-- and
Rennies are never

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.730
going to solve the problem.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.100
They are a plaster
to not really getting

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.030
to the etiology of why we have
acid reflux in the first place.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.050
The other reason it could
be because it's a bacteria

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:43.070
called Helicobacter pylori,
which will, again, only exists,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.520
only can survive if there
is no acid in the stomach.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.070
Otherwise the acid
would kill it.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.250
So if I took some acid
out of your stomach,

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.320
it would burn a
hole in your jeans.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.760
I mean, it's that potent.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.690
So if your stomach is
an alkaline environment,

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.830
it's not going to be
breaking down any food.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.610
That's why we feel
full, we feel bloated,

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.600
we create fermentation.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.030
We get SIBO.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.430
And you can see how it's
just a knock-on effect.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.920
Sometimes here,
they call the lines

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.350
down here sort of the liver,
angry lines, alcohol--

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.610
maybe an addiction to alcohol.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.570
The nose, we say is the--

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.270
when it sort of flares
up red is the pancreas,

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.530
the sweetness of life,
blood handling issues

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.800
are always looked at there.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.680
So there's lots of
reasons and there's

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.110
lots of signs and
symptoms on your face.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.270
And it's good to be always
looking at those changes

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:46.770
as well.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.930
On the skin, anyone ever
got light little pimply bits

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.610
on their arms?

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:59.560
That's something called
keratosis pilaris.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.050
Sometimes you can get it
on the back of your legs.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:06.610
It's essential fatty
acid deficiency.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.040
Really easy to get rid of, or--

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.788
well, I say easy.

00:24:10.788 --> 00:24:12.580
The thing is with
supplements is you've got

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.750
to force a change in the body.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.180
So if you're taking one omega-3
every day, or one probiotic,

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.360
you're not really going to
change the status in what's

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.710
going on in your body.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.130
And that's why, if you're
not testing for things, then

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.750
we're just guessing
with a dosage

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.020
that someone somewhere
has recommended to take.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.870
We really want to get everything
we-- all our nutrients

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.590
in through our food.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.500
But keratosis pilaris, you'd
need a really high amount

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:48.160
of omega-3s, essential fatty
acids, to shift that condition.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:54.110
OK, so here we go to the tongue.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.760
So I'll just do the
digestive system mainly.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.100
So when you stick your tongue
out, A, you want it to hold.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.170
Some people's tongues shake.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.360
That's a magnesium deficiency.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.460
It's stress.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.630
We have this autonomic
nervous system--

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.430
has anyone heard of that?

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.870
A little bit.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.230
On one side, you have the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.590
The other side, you have the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.470
For example, the
digestive system

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.150
has to be parasympathetic
to not be constipated,

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.760
to move freely
through the intestines

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.390
out through the colon.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.230
So all the stressed
people you know,

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.970
they're probably constipated.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:41.090
All the happy-go-lucky,
yeah, let's-- no problem.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.300
They're never going
to be constipated.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.205
They're like, hold on,
I just need the loo.

00:25:45.205 --> 00:25:48.220
Whereas the stressed
people, you know,

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.920
they're living in the
sympathetic zone all the time.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.760
Everything's tight.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.700
Everything's shortened.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.260
And so it's just
a knock-on effect.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.730
The breathing changes.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.530
The posture changes.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:01.600
The musculoskeletal
system changes.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.860
They're-- you know.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.680
And so there are
signs and symptoms

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.520
and organs and diseases that
live on the sympathetic side,

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.700
and others that live on
the parasympathetic side.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.100
So the digestive system.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.870
Right down the middle
of your tongue,

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.240
if there are any
cracks in it, then this

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.450
is definitely looking at
a digestive issue here.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.790
Sometimes, then, you'll have
these little fissures that

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.280
come off that big
ridge in the middle,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.360
and you might have
gas, bloating, colitis.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.810
Colitis is a condition I
see more than anything.

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:38.930
And it's really
an emotional issue

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.460
that comes from high
levels of stress.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:49.220
Colitis can-- presents
in the large intestines,

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.210
whereas Crohn's presents
in the whole gastro tract.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.580
And all that is happening is
that nothing is being absorbed,

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.370
so people find themselves going
to the bathroom up to 20 times

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.460
a day.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.890
So if they're always excreting,
then they're not hanging--

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.200
they're not taking in
any vitamins, minerals,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.520
any nutrition.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.870
So they're always drained.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.610
They're always tired.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.460
And then that has a knock-on
effect to the emotional status

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.570
of anxiety--

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.630
not wanting to eat, not
wanting to go out, because you

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.940
have this chronic bowel issue.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.600
So the other really
obvious one, I guess,

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.090
would be a white tongue.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:33.230
Obviously, you can eat foods
and see different colors,

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.910
but a white tongue,
again, that would

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.870
be looking at potentially
a yeast infection.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.890
Sometimes it can change the
times of the month as well.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.040
So right down at the front,
the tip of the tongue,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.580
you've got the heart.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.930
Either side are the
left and the right lung.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.610
Right in the middle
is the stomach,

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:58.560
so that's why you mainly see
the fissures splitting off

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.305
and the longitudinal
ridge down the middle.

00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:02.680
And that's because
so many people

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.140
have issues with
hydrochloric acid production.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.950
And then the intestines
at the back as well.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.440
So, what a good thing to do
is, stick your tongue out

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.650
when you get home,
take a picture of it.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.150
And if you're going to change
your nutrition or some things

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.820
in life, then
that's a good marker

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.440
of how things have changed.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.800
So this is a nice,
healthy tongue.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.110
It doesn't have that
longitudinal ridge right

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.130
down the middle.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.070
It's not scalloped
down the side.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.530
Sometimes you can see
these sort of teeth marks

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.440
in the side of people's tongues.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.230
This is a beefy tongue,
which is a B12 deficiency.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.700
Like sometimes people's
tongues are a bit too big

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.070
for their mouths.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.970
That's a big beefy tongue.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:59.420
This is-- the papillae in this
one is a bacterial infection.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.660
So when the papillae
open, when the fissures

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.560
have been open for too long,
then it collects bacteria

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.090
and it looks like it's
a bit black like that.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:12.310
And so you're constantly
carrying around toxicity.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.590
It's like people who smoke
and chew gum at the same time.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:20.260
You know, it's like the
quickest way to have a problem.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.660
This is-- I always
call-- this is called

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.490
a geographical
tongue, but I like

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.833
to see it as-- you know when
you cut open a red cabbage?

00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:29.250
Looks a bit like
that, doesn't it?

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:34.250
So this is like a huge,
long-time metabolic syndrome.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.610
So there are lots of
issues going on there.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:42.280
You don't see it a lot,
but you definitely see it.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.100
So tongue health is
really important.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.440
Chinese traditional
medicine swears by it

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.690
and they live by it
and they are constantly

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:50.860
checking tongue health.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.970
And then we've got the
referred pain patterns.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.550
In the book there's
a chart to tell you

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.820
which organs belong to which
parts of the vertebrae.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.390
So if you do have an
injury or a chronic pain

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.040
and you haven't
been able to fix it,

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.123
it's definitely time to
look at your organ system.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.050
Just checking the time.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:17.590
OK.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.360
So I'm going to
really quickly go

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.840
through one organ with you all.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.230
And I picked the
liver because it's

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.570
the grandfather of all organs.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.490
And we're all such
workaholics these days,

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:33.170
and we probably do things
to excess, I'm guessing.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.780
So I thought I'd go
through the liver

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.180
and tell you what
the job of it is.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.220
So the liver is a little
bit like a Hoover.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.450
Who here Hoovers?

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.180
All you men.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.080
And when your Hoover bag
gets full, what do you do?

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.210
Empty it.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.170
Absolutely.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.060
Because it can't pick up the
dirt on the floor anymore.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.690
Now, if you think of your
liver a bit like a Hoover,

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:01.330
when it gets full,
what do we do?

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.290
Carry on.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.600
Because we're not listening
to the signs and the symptoms.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.200
So when those dark
circles don't go,

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.560
when your back,
upper back hurts,

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.990
when your urine is
constantly dark,

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.840
when you feel a bit
knocky more than usual,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.260
you have a bit of anger,
frustration, all these things

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.170
going on, you're sort
reaching for the biscuit more

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.720
than the fruit,
these are all signs

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.300
that the liver is a
little bit overloaded

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.520
and needs filtering out.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.980
Now, green juice will help, but
it's definitely not a detox.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.100
Because if the liver isn't
working, what happens

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.680
is a re-hepatic circulation.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.260
So it's what I call ghetto gut.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.920
You do a cleanse for two weeks,
but because no filtration

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.790
is happening, you're just
circulating the toxins back

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.980
from the digestive
system to the liver

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.730
and back, and
they're not leaving.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.400
Does that makes sense?

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.420
So if you feel like
you can't lose weight,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.060
if you feel like you're
fat, fed up, and fatigued,

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.720
or any one of those, and you've
looked at lots of things.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.280
The gym stopped working,
the salmon and green lettuce

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.960
isn't working either.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.660
You know, getting into bed, not
going out with your friends,

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.840
you feel like you're in a
bit of a conundrum, it's time

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.550
to look at your liver because
it just gets a bit sluggish.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.360
And like everyone in
life, when we're sluggish,

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.540
we don't really
perform very well.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.020
And those are all the things
you might start seeing.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.750
Again, in the book, every organ
gives you this kind of chart.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:45.130
So the liver is a yin
organ, it's a female organ.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.740
If you know about chakras,
then the main sort

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.780
of purpose of the liver is
personal power and self will,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.870
which is why I often
see with people

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.990
the anger and frustration comes
out in its addictive nature.

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:01.990
So you can be
addicted to anything.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:06.580
You can be addicted to alcohol,
you can be addicted to health.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:12.620
But that normally
comes out in the liver.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.120
So those are just, in
the book, all the organs

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.550
have that meridian chart.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.920
There you go.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.720
Henry the Hoover.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.910
So, how do you start
fixing your liver,

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.520
or how do you help it along?

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.680
All your green foods
are the best things.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.570
They're full of magnesium.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.760
If you're tired and
stressed, magnesium

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.820
is one of the best
supplements you can take.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.600
Obviously, internally it's
going to help the bowels move.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.690
It creates diarrhea,
if you like.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:48.620
If you overdose with magnesium,
expect to see some diarrhea.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.360
Everyone's dosage is different
so you just have to titrate,

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.290
which means take one tablet
one day, the next day up,

00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:00.040
regulate to two, and so on until
you get the desired effect.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.630
If you start taking
supplements all at once,

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.090
you'll have no idea what
works and what doesn't.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.630
So always take
them one at a time.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:11.500
So all your green foods,
it's worth saying as well,

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.510
that without green
vegetables and everything--

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:17.380
we're also into raw these
days, raw and vegan,

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.679
and that's great.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.739
But if you have a
digestive issue,

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:23.409
your body does not want
to break down raw food.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:24.790
It wants it steamed.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.949
It wants it cooked
because it's easier

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:28.750
for the digestive system.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.739
So if you blow after a
salad, stop eating salads

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.350
and go to steamed vegetables.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.199
I work in Cairo at
a place over there,

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:41.800
and everyone is bloated
and constipated.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:46.300
It's because when they eat well,
they eat salad and chicken,

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:51.560
and when they don't, they're
doing everything else.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.280
So when I take them off
the salad and the raw food,

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.350
their digestive
capabilities get better

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.570
and their bloating comes down.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:06.040
Bloating is just a symptom
of the gut being weak.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.770
Food intolerances.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:15.940
The major five intolerances are
cow's milk, egg, nut, wheat,

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.910
and gluten.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.160
And so these are the
things we eat more--

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.480
all the time.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.580
I grew up on cereal,
which is basically

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.370
wheat, gluten, and milk, so
there's three straightaway.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.930
So the more you
eat of something,

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.800
the more you wear down
the digestive enzymes that

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.750
get to break down that food.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.670
And then you end
up with a bloating.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:39.800
If I took out your gut and
I laid it on the floor,

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.950
it would cover half
a tennis court.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:44.560
And the whole gut is
covered in microvilli.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.350
And at the top of the villi are
villi and they excrete enzymes.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:51.340
So if you overdo
milk your whole life,

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.310
then you wear out the enzymes
that break down the milk.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.710
And then when you put
milk back into the gut,

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:00.040
it bloats out because the
gut is almost like bald.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.460
It's like a bald head.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.660
There's no means to
break the food down

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.090
into smaller particles
to cross over and be

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.520
absorbed and digested.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.070
So food intolerance,
when you feel

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.390
like you bloat, and you can't
pinpoint what you bloat at,

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.300
and you now feel like
it's just everything,

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.750
that's when we need to start
repairing the permeability

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.480
of the gut lining.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.460
So if you bloat with a
certain food, it's easy.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.310
Take it out.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.580
But if it feels like suddenly
it becomes everything

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.230
you're bloating
at, then you need

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.810
to start fixing the
inside of the lining.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.020
So sometimes the
liver is all about--

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.780
it's about anger and jealousy.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.560
Obviously we see
lots of addictions.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.110
Depression as well, which
is linked to the bacteria

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:59.570
in the microbiome,
which is a huge subject.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.180
But one thing I would
say quickly about probi--

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.450
bacteria, if you eat a
really good varied diet,

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.020
you don't really need them.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.840
If you are taking them and
you're taking one a day,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.610
it's a bit of a waste of time.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.530
You need to make sure
they're multi-strained,

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.310
and every three months
you change your probiotic.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:21.050
You know, your microbiome is
full of bacteria-- billions,

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.040
trillions.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.470
So if you're just putting
one lactobacillus in,

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.360
it's hard work.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.270
So you need to be putting
a multitude of bacteria

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.350
back in the gut.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.000
And why not do that with food?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.150
Why not do that with kefir,
with kombucha, with sauerkraut,

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:40.420
with kimchi, with fermented
things with soy, rather than

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.940
very expensive probiotics?

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.100
If you've been on antibiotics
or you've had trauma,

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.255
then absolutely there's
a need for them.

00:37:47.255 --> 00:37:49.505
But if you are a healthy
looking person, which you all

00:37:49.505 --> 00:37:52.917
look like to me, and you are
spending money on probiotics

00:37:52.917 --> 00:37:54.500
and they're not
really doing anything,

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.583
then they're probably not.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.770
Here are some supplements
for your liver.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.330
One of my favorite is B6.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.610
If women, for example, get
tender breasts the week

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:09.870
before their period, that's
definitely a deficiency in B6.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.970
B6 is like the
little cofactor guy

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.167
that makes everything
in the body work.

00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:16.000
So you can't go wrong
by taking a bit of B6.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.840
NAC-- N-acetyl cysteine--

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.490
is a really potent antioxidant.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.180
It's a precursor
of a glutathione.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:35.350
If you were to take any
of these before you drank,

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.080
and the day after, you
would repair your hangover

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.770
quite well because it helps--

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:48.720
everyone's going-- because it
helps do the detoxification.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.480
It's always best to take
herbs naturally as opposed

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.770
to in a supplementation form.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:59.040
But NAC or glutathione
is exponentially

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.540
one of the best
things you can take.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.840
You can get glutathione
in a shot form

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.190
and have it injected into the
muscle, and it completely--

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.100
you know, if you're
in drug rehab therapy,

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.990
you'd be on shots
of NAC all the time.

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:19.350
And glutathione-- it's
just more expensive.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.160
Magnesium.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.410
If you're stressed, it's
the biggest supplement

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.310
for your heart, especially men.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.820
So if you feel like you're
always running uphill

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.400
against the tide, then
make sure you've got

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.500
some magnesium in your life.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.720
If you're chronically
constipated

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.300
and you drink enough water and
you eat your steamed greens,

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.950
take some magnesium.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.990
If you don't eat enough
greens and drink water,

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.815
then do that first.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:55.540
So here's a big tip if you
have got digestive issues.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.310
Always eat at the
same time every day.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.500
Your body's a bit like a baby.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.040
When a baby cries,
what does it need?

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:10.640
He either needs some love,
needs some food, or needs a poo.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.350
And we are no different.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:17.000
And what we do all the time is
we keep our bodies guessing.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.030
We wake up in the morning,
we go straight to hit.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.150
We don't give it any water,
we don't give it any food.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:24.890
We keep it up till 2:00 AM.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.410
We wake up at 6:00,
we go to work.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.710
You know, the amount of
clients I see who go,

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.460
god, I haven't got
any water today,

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.430
and they're fishing around
in the room for water.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.290
We've got to look
after our bodies

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:39.090
if we want them to work for us.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.710
And the signs and the
symptoms are the easiest way

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.420
that you can do this.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.030
Our health is our
responsibility.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:51.080
Yeah, there are genetic,
chronic, life-defying diseases

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.280
that we get in the world.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.420
But most of the
time, it's up to us.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.130
And if you're looking
at all the things

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:02.360
that we've been through today,
if you're aware when things

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:08.000
don't work or do work, if you're
aware of your emotional status

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.150
and your physicality
and how you eat,

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.860
then you'll probably be OK.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.640
And if you're not, then you've
got some tools in your toolbox

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.750
now to start being even more
optimum than you probably are.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:27.020
So my challenge to you
all is, spend tomorrow--

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.720
I know you all eat
here, so it's not really

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.890
a challenge for you guys.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:31.630
At the weekend.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.920
Here we go, at the weekend--

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.150
you can't eat anything that's
been packaged, wrapped,

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.245
or sold in plastic.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.090
Sounds easy.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:46.170
But report back.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.600
And that means it's the
easiest thing to do,

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.450
because then we have
to prepare our food.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.670
And I'm just going
to do one last thing.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.690
So if you could
open them that way.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.270
And what I want you both
to do is just open them

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.180
and smell them.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.810
And then pass them around.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.460
Everyone smell these crisps.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.230
AUDIENCE: We don't eat these.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.272
HANNAH RICHARDS: You can.

00:42:16.272 --> 00:42:16.772
You can.

00:42:16.772 --> 00:42:17.460
They're Burts.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.640
They're quite good crisps.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.120
So is anyone feeling like
they've got more saliva

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.680
going around in their mouth?

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.660
So, what you've just created
is the most essential thing

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:32.040
you need to create
for digestion,

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.490
and it's called the
cephalic response.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:37.010
If you don't create
the cephalic response,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.290
then you do not
create the enzymes

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:43.110
that are required to
break the food down.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.620
And because we're
all on our computers

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.350
and we're always
working from our desk,

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.960
we don't create the
cephalic response,

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.860
and that is the major reason
why people find their way to me.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.800
And so sometimes I say,
are you a fast eater?

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.630
And they go, yeah, yeah,
no, I'm really fast.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.890
And I'm like, well, come
back when you slow down.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:07.220
Because it's the only thing
people need to do, is chew.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.070
If you don't prepare yourself,
it's like anything in life.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:15.530
If you don't prepare, then you
don't get the desired effects.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:18.340
So the cephalic response
is the start and end

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.470
of optimum digestion.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:27.070
And it gets created when
we smell vinegar and salt.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.790
So, some top tips.

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.930
10 minutes before
you eat, obviously

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.670
think about what
you want to eat.

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:37.510
Also, we have to get off
these machines to eat.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:41.320
You know, the body is in this
hierarchical state of survival.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.950
And more energy gets
diverted to our eyes,

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.920
because it's the-- our eyes are
always looking out for safety.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.370
And so when you're
eating, reading a report,

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.880
more energy is going
to the optical nerves

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.890
than it is to your
digestive system.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:59.360
So you're not going
to digest very well.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.750
So the easiest
thing, and I don't

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:06.550
understand why human beings
can't do it, is have a break!

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:10.750
Take an hour off for
lunch, or half an hour,

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:14.260
and sit down and enjoy the
food with your friends.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.480
If you've got digestive
issues and you do that,

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.430
you probably won't have them.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:23.440
So create the cephalic
response, turn your phone off,

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.850
and enjoy food.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.270
Because by all means, we're all
eating it a lot during the day,

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.000
aren't we?

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.400
You know, we're like--

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.920
we're little guzzlers
who are always looking.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.880
And here, there's food
everywhere, right?

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.880
There's food everywhere.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.810
I mean, you guys are eating
whether you're hungry or not.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.720
So we need to make sure that
we're hungry for the food,

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.600
and you do that by
creating mealtimes.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.658
So anyway, I hope
you found it useful,

00:44:48.658 --> 00:44:50.200
and if you've got
any questions here,

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.310
I'm more than happy
to answer them.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.010
I know some people have to go.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:58.892
I'm going to be around for next
half an hour, so fire away.

00:44:58.892 --> 00:45:01.282
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:07.023 --> 00:45:08.440
AUDIENCE: So, thank
you very much.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.910
A really great talk.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:11.920
Really enjoyed all of that.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.692
My question was, you
spoke a lot about food.

00:45:14.692 --> 00:45:16.150
I know you're
probably going to say

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:20.440
it's bad, but just interested
to get your thoughts on caffeine

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.353
and caffeine levels
that are suitable.

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:24.270
HANNAH RICHARDS: Yeah.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:25.370
You know, good question.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.230
I love coffee.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:30.130
It's the question of
why you need coffee.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:32.370
So if you wake up in
the morning and you go,

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.380
oh, I can't wait
for coffee, then

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:39.592
you might have a bit of
an energy issue there.

00:45:39.592 --> 00:45:41.050
If you drink instant
coffee, you're

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:45.650
going to rip your gut up in one
fell smoo-- and really easily.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:48.250
So instant coffee
is one of the worst

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.950
things you can do for your gut.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:55.330
If you have coffee after you
eat-- water, food, and then

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:58.330
coffee, that's my general rule.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.070
Never have coffee between
the hours of 11:00 and 1:00,

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.100
because it's the
hours of the heart,

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.250
and the heart is all about
hate and love and shock.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:07.900
And just as much as we can--

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.190
the heart can get shocked
through a good thing

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.460
and a bad thing, you don't
really want those hours to be.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.280
That's why it's lunchtime.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.680
Yeah, and that's why we want
to be sat down, relaxed,

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.210
in a relaxed state.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.760
And coffee perks you up and
send shocks around the body.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.580
So if you're hydrated
enough, drink it.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.630
But drink it away from food.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:32.020
And if you've got more than two
a day, three a day, you know,

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.430
you're masking something.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:34.140
So.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.700
But yeah, it's essentially--

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.030
if you drink coffee and
you get heart palpitations,

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.350
then put some fat in it.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:44.170
Like put some coconut oil
in it, some butter in it,

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:45.670
you know, good milk in it.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:49.450
That's the fat that makes
the energy go for longer.

00:47:02.698 --> 00:47:03.740
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.195
Really interesting.

00:47:05.195 --> 00:47:07.070
I was just curious if
you could talk anything

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.563
about the Ayurvedic system.

00:47:09.563 --> 00:47:11.480
You'd mentioned, you
know, steaming vegetables

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.445
versus eating them raw.

00:47:12.445 --> 00:47:13.820
And I was just
curious if you see

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:17.255
that kind of in the practice, or
if you think it's a good idea,

00:47:17.255 --> 00:47:19.200
or kind of people should
steer away from it?

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.080
HANNAH RICHARDS: Yeah,
and a good question.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.130
So, Ayurveda is like an old
Indian-wisdom traditional

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:31.640
system of nutrition and yoga,
essentially, and a way of life.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.140
They call the agni--

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.390
the agni is your
digestive system,

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.475
so it's always about lighting
the fire in the body.

00:47:38.475 --> 00:47:40.610
If your agni is
strong, then you'll

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.630
be able to break down foods.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.720
So I always see the
digestive system a little bit

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.910
like a fire.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:49.460
If you don't know how your
body works-- like in Ayurveda,

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.377
there's three doshas--

00:47:50.377 --> 00:47:54.233
Kapha, Pitta, Vata.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.530
And it's all about
whether you're

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:00.660
putting in cooling
foods or warming foods,

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.420
but foods that stimulate
that digestive fire.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.540
So if you're always
putting in paper to a fire,

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.330
what essentially
happens to the fire?

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:10.540
It goes out.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.950
So if you're always putting
Haribos into your body

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:15.990
because you constantly
need energy,

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:18.130
you'll always be
crashing and burning.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.590
If you put wood into that
fire, it burns for a long time,

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:25.330
you can get on with your
day, and it's sustainable.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.710
And that's about Ayurveda,
finding the right mix

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.050
of foods or metabolic typing.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:33.930
Once you've found your
own individual makeup,

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:35.820
then you understand
how to feed your body

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.760
to keep the acne, the fire, in.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.322
I follow it a lot, yeah.

00:48:42.322 --> 00:48:44.790
AUDIENCE: I guess in the
back of her question,

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.380
would you recommend
one versus the other,

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.050
or is it all personal?

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:52.140
Should I have steamed or raw,
or is it a rule of thumb?

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.020
HANNAH RICHARDS:
Yeah, it's very much--

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.540
when I first got
into nutrition, I

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.730
found it pretty
illogical and a bit green

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.590
farmerish, how, I have bad skin.

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:05.110
OK, take this
pharmaceutical drug.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:08.295
I have bad skin,
take some vitamin E.

00:49:08.295 --> 00:49:10.260
And so I found a
type of nutrition

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.510
called metabolic
typing, which basically

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.380
says that we're all different.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.910
So you can be a fast
oxidizer, slow oxidizer,

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.910
or mixed oxidizer,
and some people burn--

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:23.770
if you go back to your biology
lessons at school and you go

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:27.630
back to the Krebs cycle,
beta oxidation, all that--

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.600
yeah, you've all wiped
it out, I can see.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.360
It's all about how we burn
different fuels for energy.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.820
I burn fat and protein
quite sustainably.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.380
Carbohydrates I
burn really quickly.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.950
Some people use-- so I
don't use them very well.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:47.140
You might use
carbohydrates really well.

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:51.630
And so once you find
your mix, then you're

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:55.990
feeling more optimal
all the time.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:00.340
So it is very individual.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.550
But essentially, if you're
a fully functional--

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.040
if you have a fully
functional gut,

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.770
you should be able to
take-- eat anything.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.060
You know, we're not
designed to be gluten-free.

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.840
It's because our guts are
a bit mucked up these days,

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.660
that we're all now--

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.530
got, you know,
[INAUDIBLE] over us,

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:20.410
that we've all got
these conditions, that

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:22.750
have may just gone a bit crazy.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.520
AUDIENCE: You mentioned about
keeping ourselves hydrated

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.700
and that's good for
our digestive systems.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.470
So do you have any
recommendations

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.380
about the temperature
of the water?

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.297
HANNAH RICHARDS: Yeah.

00:50:32.297 --> 00:50:36.310
So, water should always be room
temperature because the sta--

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:40.390
anything like really ice-cold,
certainly in Ayurveda,

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:41.950
but the stomach doesn't want--

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.200
Chinese traditional
medicine, cold water

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.330
is just a shock to the body.

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:48.440
Like, it's OK outside.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.000
I do a lot of
cold-water swimming,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.620
swim in Hampstead
Heath, and that--

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.840
because that stimulates
your vagus nerve.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.690
And the vagus nerve is
the 10th cranial nerve

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:02.330
that is responsible for
the digestion in your body.

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.500
But when the water's
going into you,

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.440
then it's too much of a shock
and a sympathetic response,

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.820
a stress release to the body.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.067
So room temperature
all the time.

00:51:13.067 --> 00:51:13.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.955
HANNAH RICHARDS: Yeah.

00:51:15.955 --> 00:51:18.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for the inspirational talk.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.130
And my question
is on superfoods.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:21.538
They are super popular nowadays.

00:51:21.538 --> 00:51:22.830
How much do you recommend them?

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.230
How much should we
take on a daily basis?

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:27.163
And how much should we
avoid them, if at all?

00:51:27.163 --> 00:51:28.080
HANNAH RICHARDS: Sure.

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.500
I always think that, I don't
know, a group of journalists

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.720
would sit around a
table, or PR people,

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.080
and they'd be like, what should
we call a superfood today?

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.450
Shall it be kiwis?

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:40.260
Shall it be apples?

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:45.030
I mean, they have this sort of
hierarchical status when they

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.870
shouldn't.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:50.070
All food is fairly equal
when it's seasonal,

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:53.740
when it's organic, when it's
from the country of origin.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:58.620
So superfoods, for me,
a bit of a phenomenon

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.770
that I don't really understand.

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:05.760
And a bit-- the press have
made them to be gimmicky.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.095
So blueberries are a superfood.

00:52:07.095 --> 00:52:09.585
Why is blueberry a superfood
and not a strawberry?

00:52:09.585 --> 00:52:11.100
You know?

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.800
I think that's the point.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.940
And if I've answered your
question well enough,

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.800
I think if you're
eating seasonally,

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.300
then you're doing
a really good job.

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:21.167
And therefore, everything
is superfood in that season.

00:52:21.167 --> 00:52:22.161
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:31.120
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:31.720
HANNAH RICHARDS: Well done.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.290
SPEAKER 1: Well,
thank you, Hannah.

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:34.000
And if you have questions
to her individually,

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.900
if you don't want
to talk out loud,

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.173
I'm sure she'd be open to--

00:52:36.173 --> 00:52:37.090
HANNAH RICHARDS: Yeah.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.290
I've got some cards and
some little book things

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.110
there, but absolutely.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.990
If you have any questions
about your bowels

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:46.780
and you want to private
email me, I'm very--

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.060
I'm all ears.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.810
[APPLAUSE]
