&gt;&gt;Shula: Rolling out a game
in the classroom is more

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:08.376
than just explaining the rules
and handing out materials.

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:10.536
It's how you get students playing fast.

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:15.676
In a successful rollout, students get
into the game quickly, learn by doing

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:17.516
and take ownership of
their learning process.

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:23.846
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, roll it again.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:24.856
Ten.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:27.926
&gt;&gt;Shula: So how do you roll out a game?

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:30.346
Step one, know the game.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.656
It's important that you know
the game well and you've thought

00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:35.536
about how to explain it to others.

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:38.926
Succeeding at this means
knowing your students well

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:40.736
and how your classroom already runs.

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:45.846
Step two, choose a method for
modeling how to play the game.

00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:49.546
For board games or card
games, try a fishbowl format.

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:53.246
A fishbowl is when you demonstrate
the game with a small group

00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:55.816
of students while the
rest of the class watches.

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:57.946
For tablet or computer games,

00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:01.256
have one student play the game while
displaying it on a large screen

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:04.566
and ask the rest of the class to
identify the rules and the goals.

00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:07.966
For complex games, demo the
game with a few students

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.016
who have played the game before,
then break your class up into groups

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:13.636
and assign each experienced
student their own group.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:17.776
For even more complex games, introduce
a simplified version of the game

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.936
to get students playing,
then add more parts

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:22.076
of the game as comfort levels rise.

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:26.066
Step one, set ground rules.

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:29.406
Playing games works best
when everyone has fun.

00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:33.146
Create a stress free atmosphere by
making agreements with your students

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:36.786
to play fair and respect all
players before cranking up the fun.

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:40.296
Step two, explain the
game, but keep it brief.

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:43.556
That way, you'll allow more
time for students to play,

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:45.676
ask questions and learn by doing.

00:01:46.216 --> 00:01:49.236
Step three, play the game and have fun.

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:50.806
Thanks for watching.

00:01:51.146 --> 00:01:54.316
Next, to learn how to manage the
game once you've rolled it out,
