hello and welcome to another course in
 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.850
hello and welcome to another course in
native language six lessons for language

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860
native language six lessons for language
 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.190
native language six lessons for language
learners this time around we're going to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200
learners this time around we're going to
 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.290
learners this time around we're going to
look at how languages change over time

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300
look at how languages change over time
 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.300
look at how languages change over time
as well as how they're related to each

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310
as well as how they're related to each
 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.080
as well as how they're related to each
other there's something on the order of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
other there's something on the order of
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.670
other there's something on the order of
6,000 languages spoken around the world

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680
6,000 languages spoken around the world
 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.220
6,000 languages spoken around the world
depending on how exactly we would define

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230
depending on how exactly we would define
 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.950
depending on how exactly we would define
and count individual languages that

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960
and count individual languages that
 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.170
and count individual languages that
brings up a really good question how

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180
brings up a really good question how
 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.299
brings up a really good question how
would we define language how would we

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309
would we define language how would we
 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.120
would we define language how would we
define individual human languages that's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130
define individual human languages that's
 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.890
define individual human languages that's
actually a tough definition to give

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900
actually a tough definition to give
 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.190
actually a tough definition to give
here's one possible scenario let's say

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200
here's one possible scenario let's say
 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.940
here's one possible scenario let's say
that we have a speaker person one who

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950
that we have a speaker person one who
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.560
that we have a speaker person one who
comes into contact with another speaker

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570
comes into contact with another speaker
 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.470
comes into contact with another speaker
person two and speaker one is able to

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480
person two and speaker one is able to
 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.410
person two and speaker one is able to
speak to person two and be understood by

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420
speak to person two and be understood by
 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.900
speak to person two and be understood by
person two and the same goes in Reverse

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910
person two and the same goes in Reverse
 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.840
person two and the same goes in Reverse
person two is able to speak with and be

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850
person two is able to speak with and be
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.840
person two is able to speak with and be
understood by person one in that case we

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850
understood by person one in that case we
 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.520
understood by person one in that case we
have grounds for establishing mutual

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530
have grounds for establishing mutual
 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.760
have grounds for establishing mutual
intelligibility in other words the two

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770
intelligibility in other words the two
 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.709
intelligibility in other words the two
people can speak with and understand

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719
people can speak with and understand
 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.899
people can speak with and understand
each other and this is potentially

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909
each other and this is potentially
 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.209
each other and this is potentially
something we might call a language they

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219
something we might call a language they
 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.580
something we might call a language they
share a common language now they also

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
share a common language now they also
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.319
share a common language now they also
share a common language with the speaker

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329
share a common language with the speaker
 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.139
share a common language with the speaker
3 if person 3 comes meet speakers one

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149
3 if person 3 comes meet speakers one
 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.300
3 if person 3 comes meet speakers one
and two and is able to speak with and be

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310
and two and is able to speak with and be
 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.270
and two and is able to speak with and be
understood by both all three of these

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280
understood by both all three of these
 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.399
understood by both all three of these
people share a common language there's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409
people share a common language there's
 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.069
people share a common language there's
mutual intelligibility

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
mutual intelligibility
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.870
mutual intelligibility
now what if speakers one two and three

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880
now what if speakers one two and three
 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.569
now what if speakers one two and three
visit a new area a new region where they

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579
visit a new area a new region where they
 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.489
visit a new area a new region where they
can understand the people and be

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:38.499
can understand the people and be
 

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:40.050
can understand the people and be
understood by the people in this new

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060
understood by the people in this new
 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.929
understood by the people in this new
region but the speech differs somewhat

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939
region but the speech differs somewhat
 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.760
region but the speech differs somewhat
the speech of the people in this new

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770
the speech of the people in this new
 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.440
the speech of the people in this new
region differs from the speech of

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
region differs from the speech of
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.270
region differs from the speech of
speakers one two and three in some

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280
speakers one two and three in some
 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.359
speakers one two and three in some
notable way well we would say that

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369
notable way well we would say that
 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.999
notable way well we would say that
speakers one two and three and the

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009
speakers one two and three and the
 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.620
speakers one two and three and the
speakers in this new region have

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630
speakers in this new region have
 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.649
speakers in this new region have
differing dialects but the speech of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659
differing dialects but the speech of
 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.209
differing dialects but the speech of
these different speakers doesn't just

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219
these different speakers doesn't just
 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.580
these different speakers doesn't just
vary depending on the region it also

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590
vary depending on the region it also
 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.300
vary depending on the region it also
varies depending on the social situation

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
varies depending on the social situation
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.499
varies depending on the social situation
so we might find that all of these

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509
so we might find that all of these
 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.900
so we might find that all of these
people speakers one two and three use a

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910
people speakers one two and three use a
 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.790
people speakers one two and three use a
different form of their language when

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800
different form of their language when
 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.690
different form of their language when
they're speaking at home or at

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700
they're speaking at home or at
 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.210
they're speaking at home or at
work or in an official capacity with say

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220
work or in an official capacity with say
 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.880
work or in an official capacity with say
a government representative in all of

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890
a government representative in all of
 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.460
a government representative in all of
these cases we find different registers

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470
these cases we find different registers
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.490
these cases we find different registers
in other words different social forms of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500
in other words different social forms of
 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.640
in other words different social forms of
the language there's also room for

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650
the language there's also room for
 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.960
the language there's also room for
individual speech patterns and this

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970
individual speech patterns and this
 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.660
individual speech patterns and this
would define an idio lect this is on the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670
would define an idio lect this is on the
 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.720
would define an idio lect this is on the
personal individual level in all of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730
personal individual level in all of
 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.390
personal individual level in all of
these instances speakers still share

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400
these instances speakers still share
 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.850
these instances speakers still share
mutual intelligibility and a common

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860
mutual intelligibility and a common
 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.880
mutual intelligibility and a common
language so there's something like 6,000

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
language so there's something like 6,000
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.410
language so there's something like 6,000
of these languages spoken around the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
of these languages spoken around the
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.990
of these languages spoken around the
world these languages don't differ from

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000
world these languages don't differ from
 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.220
world these languages don't differ from
each other at random

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
each other at random
 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.100
each other at random
instead some languages are related to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
instead some languages are related to
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.890
instead some languages are related to
some other languages and unrelated to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900
some other languages and unrelated to
 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.979
some other languages and unrelated to
other languages it works a lot like

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989
other languages it works a lot like
 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.479
other languages it works a lot like
genetic relationships like family trees

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489
genetic relationships like family trees
 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.009
genetic relationships like family trees
during the rest of this course will

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019
during the rest of this course will
 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.170
during the rest of this course will
consider methods for comparing any two

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180
consider methods for comparing any two
 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.180
consider methods for comparing any two
languages or multiple languages and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190
languages or multiple languages and
 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.190
languages or multiple languages and
seeing how closely they're related to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200
seeing how closely they're related to
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.410
seeing how closely they're related to
each other as well as how to look back

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420
each other as well as how to look back
 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.449
each other as well as how to look back
in time to extend that relationship into

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459
in time to extend that relationship into
 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.640
in time to extend that relationship into
the past and consider how we would

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
the past and consider how we would
 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.520
the past and consider how we would
determine or even reconstruct the parent

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530
determine or even reconstruct the parent
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.910
determine or even reconstruct the parent
or ultimate ancestor language so I hope

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920
or ultimate ancestor language so I hope
 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.199
or ultimate ancestor language so I hope
you'll stick with me as we work through

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209
you'll stick with me as we work through
 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.599
you'll stick with me as we work through
these next three lessons learning how to

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609
these next three lessons learning how to
 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.030
these next three lessons learning how to
use the historical comparative method to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040
use the historical comparative method to
 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.039
use the historical comparative method to
look back in time into individual

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049
look back in time into individual
 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.639
look back in time into individual
languages and language relatedness
