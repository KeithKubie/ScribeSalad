00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
Hey guys, I'm Nate, welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.220
Today we've got a few different experiments that a ton of people have asked to see

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.620
using our vacuum chamber. None of them were quite big enough to make a whole video about.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.000
But we're gonna try combining three together and see if we get any cool results from it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.880
So the three things we're gonna be trying today... We're going to try putting bubble wrap in our vacuum

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.320
chamber, and sucking all the air out, see if the bubble expand, maybe pop.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.540
We're gonna be trying putting a watermelon in, both the cut open varieties, and the completely sealed

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.660
up varieties. Obviously, we are going to be using a slightly smaller watermelon, since a whole one will

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.620
not fit in the chamber.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.540
And then a large number of people also asked to see soap in the vacuum chamber.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.360
And I wasn't sure if they were asking about bar soap or dish soap, so we're gonna try both.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360
Let's get started.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.340
Ivory soap in a microwave is an experiment you may have seen before.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.000
It weirdly expands and grows like some sort of grotesque monster...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.940
...escaped from the deep. So I'm going to be trying Ivory soap as our bar soap in the vacuum chamber.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.000
There's our Ivory soap after being microwaved and as soon as it cools down

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.660
you can see it starts shrinking quite a bit. We'll put this in the vacuum chamber, we'll see if anything happens to it.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.920
Maybe it will expand the same way it does in the microwave. That's a result of either the heat

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.360
or the radiation hitting it.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.220
We'll see what happens in the vacuum chamber.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's sliding...?

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.940
I don't know if that counts as a result, but it's moving a little bit.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.580
That could just be the vibration from the pump running.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.280
Nope. I'm gonna say that a bar of soap in a vacuum is not exciting.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.160
Just to block the soap and nothing happened to it.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.780
Alright, well. Let's take the soap that we microwaved and put that in the vacuum chamber and see if that does anything?

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.460
Soap cloud here.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.850
See a little bit of movement.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.180
Interestingly, that movement is coming off of the block of soap that didn't really go anywhere in the microwave.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.640
The part that was uncooked...

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.540
That's the part that started expanding a little bit.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.789
Seems to have calmed down, though. It's not really going much more yet.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.140
That was not much more exciting than our whole block of soap. You get a little bit of expansion.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.060
Right down here, and I bet that collapses down a little as we reintroduce pressure, but for the most part...

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.430
...that wasn't very exciting.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.440
Ivory soap is more entertaining to just put in the microwave; the vacuum chamber doesn't do as much.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.460
Our bar soap didn't give us a great result, so let's move on to trying some dish soap.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.380
Let's pour some off into a cup, put that in the vacuum chamber, see what happens.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.880
Now there are quite a few bubbles suspended in that soap, so I bet those are gonna expand somewhat,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.780
and we might get a nice foam effect as those bubbles grow and move out of the top.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.820
And...I dunno, let's find out.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.200
The bubbles are moving! They're already expanding!

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.940
A whole level of the soap is rising slightly in the cup as well.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.409
Now it's rising not so slightly. Which is rising.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.249
And we have blue foam.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.240
See how long this will keep goin'!

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.389
We've got some really big bubbles down on the sides. Those are getting so big that they're rupturing.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.380
Still got tons of tiny, tiny little bubbles with room to expand.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.440
I might have to add pressure back in if it gets so high that it's gonna start filling the chamber all the way.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.920
Think I am...

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.060
Woo!

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.920
That was just a tiny, tiny bit of air and just dropped it all down.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.980
Pressure barely rose even a tiniest bit. It was still enough to just pop tons of bubbles.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.070
Going back up for round two!

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.330
I suspect that I could be filling this thing and dropping pressure back in on and off for hours before I really got all of the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.259
bubbles out of the soap the soap holds bubbles so well that I don't really think they're ever just gonna completely disappear

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.040
well

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.929
We definitely get a good result out of the liquid soap there are bubbles in it and more bubbles form as you

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.920
pull a vacuum

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.539
And then those bubbles just become soap bubbles and turn into foam and it really expands

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.899
Beautifully and want to add pressure, and it just all collapses this

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.289
Maybe that just turns back into regular soap

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.159
Moving on to our next experiment

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.688
Let's see what happens if we take this half watermelon throw it into our container and suck out all the air

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.240
Will it do anything? I don't know?

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.109
Bubbles kind of forming all over the surface of our watermelon

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.779
even on the green part of the rind

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.220
Has a lot of juice being pulled out of that watermelon?

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:03.040
Had some cracks forming too at this point of course a lot of the water that has seeped out is boiling and low pressure

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.420
All right

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:11.329
That definitely did something to our watermelon oh

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.378
Wow that changed it almost even more our vacuumed watermelon

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.080
scooped a little bit out of this and

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.419
See how it tastes

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.109
This tastes like watermelon it's not really any different not noticeably I

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.620
Want to try this again

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.630
I've got the other half of this watermelon

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.140
Let's cut it in half again, so we have more exposed surface area

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.449
and then I'll also keep a piece of it cut off so we can compare our before and we're after a a

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.850
lot of bubbling going on

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.849
It doesn't look like it's changing a whole lot at this point though

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.790
Without dark that turned. It's pretty impressive

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:04.719
So it doesn't look incredibly changed for the most part. It still just looks like a watermelon some of the colors

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.020
I think we definitely have some darker richer shades of red and

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.730
Maybe even it's brought out a little bit more of the white to give it a higher contrast

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.700
So here's our vacuum tank with water on

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.400
Vacuum chambers water

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.980
Mostly the same

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.980
I think we can see a little bit more

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.209
Fiber on the inside of the one that we've run through the vacuum chamber a little bit less on the other side

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.630
Let's do a taste test non vacuumed regular watermelon

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.490
Vacuum bottle

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.460
I can't tell the difference it's the same thing so it's doing something. I think it's just not doing a lot as

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.489
one final watermelon test let's take a whole

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.689
Sealed up watermelon put that in and pull a vacuum and see if it does anything

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:08.389
I rather doubt there will be a pressure difference great enough for the watermelon to crack or start leaking or anything like that

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.490
But there's only one way to be sure

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.569
All right pulling the vacuum on a whole watermelon three two one

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.940
I don't see any cracks or leaks or spots where it's popping open

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:41.059
Pretty much the same to me one other test though is I'm gonna open the valve that lets all the pressure flood in really quickly

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:47.839
And we'll see if there's any movement, maybe the watermelon has grown slightly as the depressurized around it

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.779
Let's see if it shrinks at all when I put the pressure back in oh

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.029
It did it did shrink it's not a big change

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.370
It doesn't do anything really crazy

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.200
But the watermelon definitely does grow in the vacuum and then shrink when we put the pressure back in

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:08.119
So I think that's pretty fun suppose now. We got to crack it open and see if it looks any different I bet it won't

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.289
How surprising it looks like a watermelon I

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.000
Don't really have a good sense of how much of this to use, but I don't know that looks

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.880
Wow looks like a pretty good amount

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.070
It's just a small piece

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.749
We'll probably move on to doing larger pieces later, but to start out. We'll use that

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.250
I think that'll really let us see what's going on with Mitch individual bubble all right here goes

00:09:42.189 --> 00:09:48.239
It all tightened up as the bubbles like really filled their spot. Oh, I think a couple of them have started leaking

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.590
And they're all gone

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.250
Every single one is popped

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.890
All right, that was really entertaining now. Let's just try putting a whole bunch of what we're wrapping and once and see what happens

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.879
In this piece of the sheet pop them all ha ha ha ha

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:48.689
While they're all going off really fast like that it kind of sounds like popcorn popping in a frying pan or something

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.560
I think that's it. I think they've all popped

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.039
It's probably the most efficient way to

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:13.529
Waste large bubble-wrap just pops every single one try like this half a little roll

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:19.469
Squish that down in there now. This is rolled up tight so I don't know what its gonna

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.170
Do because the bubbles don't have as much space to expand

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.720
Let's find out

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.850
Oh tearing at the seams

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.180
The roll is pulled itself open

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:51.810
This bubble wrap roll comes perforated. So you can separate off just sheets about one foot long and

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.140
The pressure has just ripped it along those perforations

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800
Alright, I think once you get to that pressure

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.860
It's just about all gone

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.479
Well there you have it bubble wrap watermelon and a couple of types of soap in a vacuum chamber

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.719
We got some fairly fun reactions the bubble wrap all expanded and then popped the watermelon just kind of leaked a little bit of juice

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.849
The bar soap wasn't very exciting

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:26.610
But the liquid soap really foamed and bubbled up quite a bit every one of these experiments were things that dozens

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.390
If not hundreds of people commented asking for us to do so guys

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.309
We are using your ideas if you've got something you want to see us, try let us know down in the comments below

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:40.379

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.450
Calm see you there

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.170
Very weirdly powdery at this point
