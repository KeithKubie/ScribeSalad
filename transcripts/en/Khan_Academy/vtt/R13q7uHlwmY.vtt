00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.460
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.600
and today, I'm learning more
about the Third Amendment

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.370
to the U.S. Constitution,
which states that

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.460
no soldier shall, in time of peace,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.160
be quartered in any house
without the consent of the owner,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.760
nor in time of war, but in a
manner to be prescribed by law.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.370
This amendment clearly
draws its inspiration

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.470
from the Quartering Acts that
caused a great deal of tension

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.830
between the American
colonies and Great Britain

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.700
leading up to the American Revolution.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.700
But does it have any
relevance to our lives today?

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.820
To learn more, I sought out
the help of two experts.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.940
Jay Wexler is a Professor of Law

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.330
at Boston University School of Law

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.170
specializing in Constitutional
Law and the Supreme Court.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.520
Glenn Reynolds is the Beauchamp Brogan

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.030
Distinguished Professor of Law

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.010
at the University of
Tennessee College of Law.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.710
So Professor Reynolds, why did the framers

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.560
feel it was necessary
to put this amendment

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.520
in the Bill of Rights?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.550
- [Glenn] Well, we don't
think of quartering of troops

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.950
in people's homes as a
very big issue these days,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.920
and of course, some people would say

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.030
that's because the Third
Amendment's worked perfectly.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.320
If only the rest of the Bill
of Rights worked so well.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.070
But it was a big issue for the framers

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.300
because it had happened a lot.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.210
To the framers, the English civil wars

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.650
of the 17th century were recent history,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.360
and their attitudes were
very much shaped by that.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.220
And the Stuart kings, in particular,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.560
used quartering of troops

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.970
as a way to punish towns and
areas that they didn't like.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.239
The soldiers back then were
basically jail sweepings.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:33.530
They had a tendency to steal and to rape

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.220
and to get into fights

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.270
even with the people
they were quartered with.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.800
So to have troops quartered upon a town

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.160
was a way of sort of mass punishment,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.270
and that made the English rather unhappy.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.210
And after the Glorious Revolution,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.110
they banned the practice in England,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.010
but they did not ban it in the colony.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.750
- [Jay] The king had quartered troops

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.960
in the private homes in the colonies

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.090
in what became the United States

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.630
for a long time before the Revolution,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.120
since at least 1670 and,
as it's easy to imagine,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.710
this caused a lot of tension
between the homeowners

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.670
in the colonies and the British troops.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.470
And then it got even worse
as we found ourselves

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.870
in the French and Indian
War in the 1750s and 1760s.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.570
'Cause nobody wants the government

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.100
to put troops in their house.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.400
The house is the place where people

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.690
live their most private lives,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.390
and to have the government
come in and then say,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.980
here, the soldiers are gonna
live here with you now,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.470
is something that, understandably,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.640
the colonists were very worried about

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.900
and didn't like very much.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.870
So, things got worse in the 1760s,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.890
when England passed the
first Quartering Act,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.550
which basically required that colonies

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.990
had to provide barracks
for the king's troops

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.920
and if there weren't barracks,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.570
then the soldiers were
authorized to live in

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.733
inns and alehouses and houses,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.540
this is right from the Act itself,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.730
selling rum and brandy and strong water.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.900
And then, if there weren't
enough of those around,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.740
they could live in private buildings,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.270
uninhabited houses and
barns and things like this

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.880
and then that requirement
resulted, in part,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.150
in the Stamp Act of 1765 which led then

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.070
to the Tea Party, which
everybody knows about,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.410
and the Tea Party really
made the king angry.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.960
After that, the king passed,
or the parliament passed

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.000
the second Quartering Act of 1774

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.540
which required colonists to allow

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.040
the king's troops to live in their homes

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.690
which was, of course, something

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.980
that the colonists
absolutely couldn't stand.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.650
So, when we got our independence,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.780
it was one of the most important goals

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.620
of the framers to make sure

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.700
that this kind of thing could not happen.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.780
- [Kim] So, what was so problematic

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.760
about the possibility of having a soldier

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.870
quartered in your home,
or multiple soldiers

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.630
quartered in your home?

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.500
- [Jay] Well, some of us
don't particularly like

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.980
having house guests in
general, (chuckling)

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.960
but they're not house guests.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.300
I mean, the problem is, troops back then

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.340
were not like, we think of soldiers today

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.950
in the American army, it's
hard to get in the army.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.600
You know, people try to get in the army

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.470
and they're told, go away,
your grades aren't good enough

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.120
and you're not smart enough.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.130
And if you have a criminal
record, they don't want you.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.950
It wasn't like that back then.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.810
Warfare was bloody and awful.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.020
The troops stood in masses a
hundred yards from each other

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.700
and blasted away with
these Brown Bess muskets.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.430
Actually the most common injury then was

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.550
when pieces of the soldier next to you

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.820
were driven into you,
jawbone and stuff like that.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.140
So, it was pretty nasty and the discipline

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.430
that it took to make people
do that was pretty harsh

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.960
and it wasn't very appealing
to the better sort,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.170
so, literally, a lot of these soldiers

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.580
were people who would sent
there straight from jail.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.160
So, they were not very nice people to have

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.600
living in your house and they didn't

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.660
have a very good attitude when they did.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.300
- [Jay] I think they were widely viewed

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.150
as being cruel, as being unfriendly,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.600
maybe even drunk a lot, but
it was certainly not the case

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.360
that they were making their own beds

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.050
and cleaning up after their
dinner and such like that.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.580
So, they were not guests.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.890
So, they were people who
were living in the houses,

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.700
taking liberties any way they wanted

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.320
and making a basically a
nuisance of themselves, for sure.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.160
So, I mean, imagine if some
soldier you didn't know

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.830
and you didn't invite into your house

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.550
was all of a sudden staying
in your living room,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.590
and then multiply that
by however many soldiers

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.593
it might be, 10, who knows,
living in your living room

00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:35.250
while you're trying to carry out

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.100
the daily tasks of your life
and talking with your children

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.630
and making plans about dinner and

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.390
can you imagine how
offensive that would be

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.890
and how problematic that would be

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.610
to have the government's troops

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.620
hanging out in your living room.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.750
It would be pretty awful,
so it's no surprise

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.480
that the framers, I
think, objected to this

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.500
and put this amendment
into the Constitution.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.520
- [Kim] So, do you think that
the Quartering Act of 1774,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.730
do you think that was the straw

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.320
that broke the camel's back
in the American Revolution?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.740
Was it that living with soldiers

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.730
was so noxious that it
propelled the colonists

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.110
over the edge into the Revolution?

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.510
- [Jay] Well, there were a lot of straws

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.780
that broke that camel's
back so it's hard to say

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.590
which one, but I think one of the things

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.700
that the colonists hated about it was

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.940
that they were being subjected to a rule

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.380
that didn't apply in England

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.680
and one of things they
revolted for, remember,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.740
was they thought they'd been
deprived of what they called

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.110
the rights of Englishmen and
this was just another example

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.400
of the crown feeling free
to do things in the colonies

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.850
that he wouldn't do at home and

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.510
that sent a signal to the colonists

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.820
that you're not as important,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.410
you're not full blown citizens,

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.780
we don't care about you as much

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.290
and you don't have the same rights.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.620
And I think that was what
was intolerable about it.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.330
- [Kim] So this seems like an amendment

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.430
that has this very specific
historical background,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.130
but how does this kind of
play forward into the future?

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.350
Was there any danger
that there might be later

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.840
quartering of soldiers

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.010
after the framing of the Constitution?

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.550
- [Jay] Well, there was always the risk,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.910
there was always the risk
that even in the independent

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.680
United States that the
government might, at some point,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.560
require homeowners to put up soldiers

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.820
and, in fact, there is some evidence

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.080
that during the Civil War this happened.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.120
I think the evidence is a little foggy,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.300
but there is certainly a
suggesting in the literature

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.990
that the Union government
required homeowners

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.920
to put up Union troops.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.450
And so, it could have been a problem.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.470
It's not something that has, in fact,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.040
turned into a huge issue over time,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.840
which might say something
about how successful

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.393
the Third Amendment has
been in our history.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.000
But, it was always a risk
and I think it was never far

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.850
from the minds of the
framers, this possibility

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.010
that the government might
decide to put its soldiers

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.470
into people's private homes.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.890
- [Kim] I think, at the
time of the Revolution

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.580
and when the framers were putting
together the Constitution,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.580
they had a real fear of
standing armies, right?

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.190
They didn't want a standing army

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.820
in the United States and, in fact,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.230
there wasn't one in the
United States at all,

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:14.230
a professional army until
after the Civil War, I believe.

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:18.300
And now we see a standing army,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.020
a very large standing army

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.280
of the United States
as being pretty normal.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.780
How do you think the Third Amendment

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.190
shows how our ideas of standing armies

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.810
have changed over time?

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.180
- [Glenn] You know, one historian said

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.790
that our framers had an almost panic fear

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.840
of standing armies and
that was based, again,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.420
on the history of the English
civil wars in the 17th century

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.050
where standing armies, the tradition was,

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.670
the king would disarm
people he didn't like

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.580
and then use the army against them

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.330
and that was seen as very bad,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.600
the standing armies were seen
as somebody whose loyalty,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.280
who paid them, not to the country.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.980
I think our army has had
a different trajectory.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.870
I mean, really we didn't
have a large standing army

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.920
in the United States on a regular basis

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.750
until after World War II.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.210
So, I think we're just less afraid of it

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.580
because our army has
been more professional,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.890
maybe because we feel like the army

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.163
is more loyal to citizens
than it is to who pays it.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.440
Or maybe because we've just lost, perhaps,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.860
a vital edge of paranoia
that the framers had.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.440
- [Kim] Has there ever
been a Supreme Court case

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.960
that ruled based on the Third Amendment?

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.740
- [Glenn] There's a single
federal court of appeals case

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.057
called Engblomb against Carey where the

00:09:30.057 --> 00:09:33.592
federal court of appeals
applied the Third Amendment

00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:36.280
in a New York prison riot case where

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.500
guards were pushed out of their barracks

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.890
and National Guardsmen were put in.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.290
But the Supreme Court's never done it.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.170
But the Supreme Court has
relied on the Third Amendment.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.410
In fact, one of the most famous cases

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.120
of the second half of the 20th century

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.850
from the Warren Court was
Griswold against Connecticut.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.750
That was actually a
case striking down laws

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.030
against birth control.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.040
- [Jay] Which is one of the forerunners

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.160
to Roe vs Wade and in that
case, the Supreme Court

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.184
was trying to figure
out if the Constitution

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.970
encompassed a right to privacy

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.480
and Justice Douglass wrote this opinion

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.970
which said that there
were kind of penumbras

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.870
or emanations from a variety of amendments

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.510
in the Bill of Rights,
the Fourth Amendment,

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.140
the First Amendment, and
importantly, the Third Amendment,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.850
that suggested that the Constitution

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.740
does protect privacy
rights to some degree.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.058
That was kind of the high point

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:27.950
for the Third Amendment
in Supreme Court history

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.575
and even in the cases that
followed the Griswold decision,

00:10:31.575 --> 00:10:35.820
which found, for example,
the right to an abortion,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.530
et cetera, the Court did not rely on

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.280
that Third Amendment penumbra theory.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.730
So, it was one case the Supreme Court

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.550
cited the Third Amendment
as being the source

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.550
of a sort of enigmatic privacy right.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.390
Other than that, the
Supreme Court has really not

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.840
touched the Third Amendment ever.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.400
- [Kim] So, there's kind of a suggestion

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.190
of the right to privacy

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.010
that goes along with the Third Amendment

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.520
and also, perhaps, the Fourth Amendment.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.370
Do you think that's the way

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.480
that the Third Amendment is, perhaps,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.173
most relevant to us now?

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.110
- [Glenn] Well, it could be.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.270
I mean, there's been some thought,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.110
there've been some law review articles

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.700
and other speculation on
this that, for example,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.710
when the government installs spyware

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.040
on your computer at home,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.080
that's the equivalent of
quartering troops in your house

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.690
because somebody is inside
your house spying on you

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.950
and breaking the privacy, sort of like

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.450
having to have a soldier at home.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.480
No court's held that, as far as I know,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.640
but it's not crazy and there
have been a few other cases

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.600
more on point where people claim

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.020
that when police SWAT
teams took over their homes

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.900
to look down on the neighbors and such,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.120
that that was troop quartering,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.380
but courts so far have said
that that's not the same thing

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.500
since they're not actually sleeping there.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.050
- [Jay] One possibility is to say, hey,

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.103
the Third Amendment really plays no role.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.890
The courts don't talk
about it, nobody really

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.670
knows much about what it says.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.150
And so it's really not important.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.480
On the other hand, you could argue,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.530
and I'd suggest that this is
probably a plausible argument,

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.060
that, in fact, the Third
Amendment has done a lot.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.020
The fact that you don't see cases

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.310
about quartering of troops
may very well indicate

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.000
how well the Third Amendment is serving.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.210
So, the Third Amendment just is quiet

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.398
but that's because it's
doing its job so well.

00:12:24.398 --> 00:12:26.850
And that nobody comes and tries
to quarter troops in there,

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.450
in anybody's houses and if they did,

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.080
they would immediately lose.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.970
So, you could argue from that perspective

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.970
that the Third Amendment
is one of the most powerful

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.130
and well working amendments

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.819
that we have in the Constitution.

00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:38.652
One thing that's interesting

00:12:38.652 --> 00:12:40.060
about the Constitutional history

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.830
is that sometimes we see
parts of the Constitution

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.950
that have been dormant
for a really long time

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.530
all of a sudden pop up into consciousness

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.146
either because the courts
have started reading them

00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:53.160
differently or because the
facts of the world change

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.890
and so all of a sudden the amendment

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.550
or other Constitutional
provision seems relevant.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.150
And that could potentially
happen with the Third Amendment

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.900
and what I would site here

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.790
are two developments in the world.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.470
One is that we see these days the police

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.010
becoming more militarized and so it looks

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.010
kind of like the police
are soldiers in a way

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.140
when they come all armed and with their,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.050
and armored vehicles and such.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.490
And the second phenomenon is kind of the

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.200
increased surveillance that we're seeing

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.740
from the government into
private phone conversations,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.927
private computer files,
and things like that,

00:13:28.927 --> 00:13:31.620
and so it's possible that we, a court

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.990
at some point, might
think that the government

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.080
is violating if not the
letter, but then the spirit

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.430
of the Third Amendment by basically

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.300
engaging in the 21st century
version of quartering

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.000
by monitoring people's communications

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.540
within the home in a
kind of militaristic way.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.630
- [Kim] So, we've learned
that the Third Amendment

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.200
prevents the government
from quartering soldiers

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.350
in the homes of American
citizens and that, in fact,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.720
it does such a good the Supreme Court

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.610
has only made one decision
using the Third Amendment

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.660
as its primary basis.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.510
But, the Third Amendment's
implied guarantee of privacy

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.310
in the home may come to be more important

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.560
as we debate the limits

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.180
of government surveillance
of our computers.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.200
