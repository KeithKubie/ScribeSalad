00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.330
We're almost there
with our tablet layout.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.430
It's time to get this done.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.100
We have two problems.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.400
First, if you've tried this on
a Nexus 7, or other seven-inch tablet,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
there's a good chance the detail view
isn't rendering in landscape mode.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.470
The reason for this,
is that the grid view cannot solve for

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.430
the constraints we've given it.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.420
And the reason why we don't have
enough room is that the design for

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.320
this view calls for

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.390
the toolbar to be placed in line with
the detailed grid, rather than above it.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.270
The second problem is
a problem with elevation.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.420
Our design calls for a shadow around our
detail view, but it's just not there.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.150
Since we'd like this to have a shadow
on all platforms, not just Android L,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.830
we can introduce another widget
from the support library, CardView.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.580
CardView is a container that
casts a shadow around a view.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.985
When we change the elevation of
the card, it casts a larger shadow.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:52.610
Note that card view has its own
version of the elevation parameter.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.000
We can also change the radius of
the corners of the card view to make

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.330
rounded shadowed rectangles.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.830
Note that this works best on L,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.510
due to the way we handle clipping
on the compatible version.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.900
Because the card view is a layout that
draws stuff around other layouts,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.520
it works a bit differently than others.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.480
You can control the background
color of the layout,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.250
the background color of the card,
the padding around the card frame,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.120
and the padding inside the card frame,
between the card and its contents.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.910
Since CardView is rendered in
Android L using elevation,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.930
it's important to understand how
this impacts the rendering of views.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.180
First of all,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.670
a view at a higher elevation
obscures views at lower elevations.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.900
If you have nested views,
if a view will obscure the parent,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.230
you will also obscure all
children of the view.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.230
Views that have transparent
backgrounds don't cast shadows.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.870
Views that are contained within these
transparent views will also not cast

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.260
shadows.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.030
Given these constraints, it's relatively
easy to create a view with elevation

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.700
that doesn't render the way one expects.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.980
We're going to make extensive
use of relative layout,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.970
to avoid having to add extra hierarchy,
which would prevent us from creating

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.729
the kind of shadows that
the design requires.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.960
One more thing,
on pre-L versions of android,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.450
card view doesn't clip contents to
the bounds of the curved rectangle, but

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.300
instead adds padding to avoid having
that content overlap the shadow area.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.260
Since we have a dark background
on part of our card,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.220
this makes a little white line show up.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.120
Since the corner overlap looks more
benign than these white lines,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.160
I recommend setting
cardPreventCornerOverlap = "false"

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.080
on our card views.
