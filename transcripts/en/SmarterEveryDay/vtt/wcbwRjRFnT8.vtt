00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.780
Hey it's me Destin

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.719
We like to do a lot of weird things with our cameras.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.900
So one thing I was going to show you is how to do some real neat things with open-shutter photography.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.040
Basically, you open the shutter for an extended period of time

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.720
and then you do something neat

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.320
and then you close the shutter and then you look at your image.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.700
So you can compile a bunch of different things.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.700
So, we're out here in my driveway, it's very dark, as you can see.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.501
My brother in law, Shawn, he's got a light on me so you can see me.

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:29.373
We have a few things we can play with

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.420
we've got a frisbee that changes colors.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.060
We're going to do some open-shutter photography with that.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.195
That will be really neat.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.440
We have a ball.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.758
A pretty neat ball, that you'll see

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.220
It's a light-up ball that when you bounce it it turns on

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.580
So we will get to see some nice parabolic motion with that, that'll be neat.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.519
And we have one other thing you might have never heard of.

00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:55.052
It's called an X-Zylo

00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:58.566
It has these little glow sticks that I'm activating here

00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.380
[Glowstick cracking]

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.000
It's like a gyroscope that you throw though the air like a football. It's pretty neat.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.699
So, we're going to do some open-shutter photography, show you some neat things

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.359
And afterwards, we're going to show you some things you can do in your own house.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.020
Anyway, we'll see how it goes.

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:11.820
Let's check it out

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.220
OK, we're going to start off just showing you what we're doing

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.420
I'm wearing a white LED on my head so you can see me.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.960
Hey, Shawn, wave the frisbee!

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.040
Shawn's wearing red so you can see him.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.700
This is kind of how it looks like... normal, this is how dark it is.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:51.160

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.000
That was pretty cool! Now we're going to go and start some open-shutter photography.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:19.460
♫Lightout by Anthony Raijekov♫

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.420
(Shawn) Are you ready for conic sections?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.080
And parabolic motion?

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:26.263
(Destin) Yeah baby!

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:27.240
(Shawn) Oh Yeah!

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:40.800

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720
Next phase is the X-Zylo

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.860
It's just like the other ones except instead of just gravity that we're going to play with

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.260
now we're going to throw in a tourqe vector.

00:02:52.513 --> 00:02:56.513
So, spin stabilized and also aerodynamically stabilized.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.540
This should do some strange things.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.535
We'll check it out -How 'bout it Shawn?

00:03:01.701 --> 00:03:02.821
(Shawn) Oh yeah!

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:27.780
