00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Guantanamo has been built on how to destroy a human being totally –

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.900
how to damage him mentally, physically, spiritually.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.520
This is the story of 779 Muslim men and boys who were held at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.460
– and of them, the 40 who still remain there to this day.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.180
9/11 was difficult for all of us, for all Americans.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.420
But I think what the intervening 17 years now have shown is that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.840
abandoning our long-standing legal systems and our values are not rewarding for us.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.140
They don't strengthen national security.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.500
In the 17 years since hundreds of noncitizen Muslim men and boys were sold into U.S. imprisonment,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.940
kept without charge and tortured, there has yet to be any accountability – and any real justice.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.220
We, the United States, have done such a good job of convincing our population and the entire world

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:08.620
that these men are terrorists that it is impossible for men to escape Guantanamo when they're released.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.660
And that's their biggest complaint,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.300
is that everybody thinks they're a terrorist.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.720
I try so hard to act – to be – normal, but it is hard.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.020
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.480
In order to understand how and why there are still men held without charge in Guantanamo,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.400
we have start at the beginning of the long history the United States has in Guantanamo Bay.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.520
In 1898, following the Spanish–American war, the United States took control of several territories previously controlled by Spain

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.320
– including 45 square miles of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.480
And even after Cuban independence,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.480
the U.S. maintained control through leasing the land. And it became a naval base.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.660
In 1991, during a coup d'etat in Haiti, refugees set out on makeshift rafts and boats to claim asylum in Florida.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.080
But the U.S. had other plans for the Haitians.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.860
President George H.W. Bush found that he couldn’t send them back home,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.260
so the Coast Guard started rerouting the refugees to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.720
In less than a year, nearly 37,000 people were living in tent cities ringed with barbed wire.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.640
Back in the U.S., a district court judge condemned the conditions and ordered the camp closed

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.620
– a decision that was later reversed.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.140
Shayana Kadidal of the Center for Constitutional Rights was at Yale Law School at the time

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.800
and was part of the group of professors and students that worked on the Haitian Guantanamo case.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.320
So you have people who are not American citizens, these Haitian refugees, landing in a place that

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.700
technically is Cuban but in every other practical respect belongs to the United States of America.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.180
And then the question is, do they have full asylum rights

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.440
under United States law? And maybe even a preliminary

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.000
question – do they have the right to even set foot in American federal courts

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.380
and make arguments about what rights they do have?

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.320
And it’s that line of questioning and that legal framework that forms the basis of how the U.S government

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.480
would treat detainees arrested during the so-called “War on Terror.”

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.560
Our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.500
but it does not end there.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.820
On October 7, 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan, in search of Osama bin Laden

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.180
and other Al Qaeda operatives believed to be behind the 9/11 attacks

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.880
and believed to be under the protection of the Taliban.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.840
And there was a big push to capture anyone alleged to be an Al Qaeda operative,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.040
as Alka Pradhan, a lawyer on the Guantanamo military commissions who represents several current and former detainees, explains.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.080
What we actually did is we dropped flyers over the tribal areas

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.460
and the border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan, saying, if you give us members of Al Qaeda,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.740
we will pay you anywhere from – I think it was up to – $5,000. President Musharraf of Pakistan is on the record

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.120
as gloating about how much money the Pakistani government made

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.480
from turning over people to the United States, whom they just labeled as terrorists.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.140
Pretty much anybody who is an Arab in Afghanistan after 9/11 was worth 20 years' salary

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.220
to hungry villagers, to corrupt warlords, to corrupt Pakistani policemen manning the border.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.780
And so with bounties ranging from $3,000 to $25,000,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.720
the United States begins piling up these men really quickly

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.260
– who are held without charge and without proof.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.320
Many were picked up for just being at the wrong place at the wrong time, or even wearing the wrong kind of watch.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.860
One of our counsel likes to say that being foreign in Afghanistan after 9/11 was like driving while black.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.660
One example of this was Pradhan’s client Emad Hassan, a Yemeni student in Pakistan who, when he was sold,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.540
was asked by U.S. military officials if he knew Al Qaeda, to which he responded “yes.”

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.760
And they said, OK, all right, well, you're coming with us. And he was sent to one of the camps, where he was just

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.520
brutally tortured. He was stripped naked, he was beaten, he was subjected to freezing temperatures.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.160
And during this time, he was interrogated again and he was asked, do you know Al Qaeda?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.960
And he at this point realized that perhaps there was some mix-up.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.920
And it turns out that the Al-Qa’idah Hassan knew was a small village in Yemen.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.860
Hassan, told he’d be let go, would remain in Guantanamo until 2015

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.580
– 13 years after he was sold to the U.S. military.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.800
Now, with all these men who had been rounded up, they needed to be kept somewhere.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.000
Having the detainees on U.S. soil was quickly discarded as an option,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.500
since that would give them certain rights and privileges.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.500
The thought process at that time that Rumsfeld and others at the Department of Defense are going through

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.840
is, “Where can we hold them where we don't have to apply U.S. law

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.540
– where we don't have to apply the Constitution but they are still going to be under our complete control?”

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.040
That brings us to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.940
The first detainees arrived there from Afghanistan and Pakistan in January 2002.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.780
They get off the airplane and we have no idea who they are, where they're from, what they're alleged to have

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.040
done, anything like that. We, in some cases, don't even have names for them.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.740
Despite not knowing much about who they had captured,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.860
the U.S. government had to build a case against each individual.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.220
They don't approach it as, “You're innocent until you're proven guilty.” They approach it as,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.480
“These men are all enemies of the United States.” And so they start interrogating them.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.460
Once [they] were brought to Guantanamo, [they] were chained in what we called stress positions,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:40.280
which are essentially chained from their wrists, from the ceiling, or had their wrists and their ankles chained

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.340
together, or had dog collars placed around their necks and chained to the walls.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.920
Some of them had those dog collars actually attached to leashes and

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.520
were then dragged around floors while being quote “interrogated.”

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.740
For Shaker Aamer, a British resident who spent 14 years in Guantanamo without charge,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.620
there was something worse than the physical torture he endured.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.380
Once you get beaten up, once you get hanged, once you get all these, whatever they call it, hog-tied

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:16.140
and all these things, pain, physical pain, then it goes away. But when they try to play with you mentally,

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:22.560
and psychologically, all kind of manipulation, you feel like every time they find something new.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.940
As word started to leak about the conditions in Guantanamo, groups like

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.660
the Center for Constitutional Rights started to petition to have the detainees’ cases heard in federal courts.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.900
To Kadidal’s surprise, they won the landmark case Rasul v. Bush:

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.420
We win the Supreme Court case in late June of 2004, and suddenly the government realizes that

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.180
it's going to have to go in and defend its detention of each one of these individuals in federal court.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.180
So immediately they started having to pull together files on people.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.180
Those “files” the government was putting together were the biographies that would come to define these men.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.580
And they were based on evidence obtained from the so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques”

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.760
– which, by the way, is considered “coerced evidence” and is inadmissible under international law,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.020
and even U.S. law.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.920
The biographies were also based on information gathered by former detainees turned informants.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.800
We know now from reporting in the Washington Post that there were individual detainees who got their own

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.780
separate housing, electronic sound systems and little TVs to watch movies on,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.620
in exchange for informing on their fellow detainees.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:34.080
Not only is this false evidence probably the most important evidence that the U.S has, according to Pradhan,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.180
it’s also on the public record. The “biographies” were leaked by WikiLeaks

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.900
as part of the Guantanamo Files in 2011.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:47.540
To this day, if you Google, you know, Emad Hassan or Abu Wa'el Dhiab or any of my former clients,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.620
the first thing I think that comes up are these biographies, many of the facts in which

00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:00.980
we proved to be false. They all sound very, very similar. It seems like every detainee at Guantanamo

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.660
was Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law and every detainee at Guantanamo

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.260
fought with bin Laden at Tora Bora.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.080
And these false biographies continue to haunt them today, even after they’ve been released.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.660
In total, the United States would come to imprison 779 detainees,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:23.340
with 21 being children, under the age of 18 when they were caught – the youngest believed to be 13 years old.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.652
Of those 779, to this day, 732 have been released – many of them many years after they were first detained,

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.800
and without a single charge having been brought against them.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.320
The Bush administration oversaw the release of 532 detainees,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.260
either back to their home countries or to another country willing to accept them.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.820
And when Barack Obama was campaigning for the presidency in 2008, one of his major campaign promises

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.660
was to shut down Guantanamo.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.980
We did see, when he came into office, within the first day, again,

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.340
we have that executive order that comes down to close Guantanamo Bay.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.000
Guantanamo will be closed no later than one year from now.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.120
Things go south very, very quickly.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.180
Despite the Democrats having control of the House and Senate, the Obama administration didn’t follow through

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.280
on the promise of shutting down Guantanamo,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.100
and didn’t even try to clear the names of all those wrongfully detained and tortured.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:21.800
That’s what I find to be just absolutely unforgivable, is that we know all of this false information is there,

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:30.140
but President Obama will not stand up and say, “Hey, we got it wrong, these were all mistakes made.”

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:36.240
And solely because we were not willing to face up to our own mistakes as a country,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.560
we continue to perpetrate torture at Guantanamo.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:45.220
And that lack of reeducation and accountability has had an impact on the men who were released.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.420
The same guard who will attack you and fight you and choke you,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:57.360
the same guard, in another occasion, will pretend he’s your friend. You don’t know how to feel,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.860
you don’t know the difference between hate and love, you don’t know. Really, you don’t know.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.600
Your feelings is all jumbled together.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.200
They can't get jobs, they can't get education. People won't befriend them.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.080
Having detained these men for years upon years

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:22.000
– taken decades of their lives, taken them away from their families, mentally debilitated them, really

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.680
– and then release them to places where they don't know how to get by.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:33.700
It's a human rights and humanitarian crisis of enormous, enormous order.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.040
Today, 40 men remain in Guantanamo, with only 7 having been charged.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.440
And even their charges depend on weak information and questionable links.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.800
For Pradhan, who represents detainee Ammar al Baluchi, the nephew of alleged 9/11 mastermind

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.840
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the question of injustice faced by detainees past and present

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.740
is a question of injustice that impacts American citizens as well.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:05.280
Americans should care about it, again, because it is so much more than just those 40 men.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:12.560
Guantanamo is the root of all of the national security debates that we have now.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:21.140
The utter disregard for people of color because they are people of color? That colors our debates on immigration,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:27.200
on the refugee crisis, on prison reform here in the United States.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:39.740
So Guantanamo really is sort of – and continues to be – the crucible where all of these violations really

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.690
were born, and they continue to spin out from Guantanamo.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.640
It's sort of the crucible, the epicenter, of all of that.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.800
Hey guys, thanks for watching.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.360
Guantanamo is a really tough subject to tackle, and we only scratched the surface in our story.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.040
Let us know in the comments what you think, and don't forget to like, share and follow.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.360
And we'll see you next week.
