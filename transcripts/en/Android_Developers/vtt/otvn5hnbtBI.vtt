00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.420
SHANNON LOW: Welcome
to Playtime 2018.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.668
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.750
It's amazing to see
all of you here today

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.760
in this incredible space.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.560
I look out, and I
see familiar faces,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.180
people I'm going to
meet, new friends today.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.980
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.920
It's 10 years of Android.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.240
5 years of Playtime EMEA.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.100
I'm thinking, look how
we've all grown up.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
Thank you for joining us
from over 40 countries

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.380
across Europe, Middle
East, and Africa.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.940
My name is Shannon Low.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.580
I head up the apps and games
business development team

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.020
for Google Play in EMEA.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.090
We wanted to kick
off today with this

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.600
I Make Apps film because
this campaign and Playtime

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.790
both share the same spirit.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.770
They're both about
celebrating you,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.600
the people behind
apps and games,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.300
the Android and Play community.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.010
We all know that it's
the community that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.990
powers any platform.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.390
Without you, we wouldn't
be where we are today.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.850
2018 is an incredibly
important milestone for us

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.620
because, as I said before,
Android debuted 10 years ago

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.490
on a single device.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.800
Everyone remember
Android Market?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.810
We had 50 apps in total.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.150
And of course, those
important barcode scanners

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.002
and ringtone editors
that everybody needed.

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.960
I'm sure there are some
folks in this room here

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.335
who were working on barcode
scanners and ringtone editors

00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:28.050
10 years ago.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.150
Those were humble
beginnings for all of us.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.400
But it set us on a good path.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.240
A path for Android to become
the most powerful and important

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.450
popular computing platform
on Earth, with devices

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.330
available in every shape,
size, and price point

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.550
around the world.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.600
As connectivity has become
near the ubiquitous,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.127
we use our devices
everywhere for things

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:52.960
that we couldn't have
imagined 10 years ago.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.650
And that's all thanks to you.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.720
You have changed how we
interact with each other,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.240
how we get things done, and
how we even spend our time.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.979
You created new experiences,
new industries, new economies

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.050
thriving in communities
all over the world.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.960
Simulating employment.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.470
Inspiring entrepreneurship.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.270
Our team is especially
proud of the work

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.920
that you do here in EMEA.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.080
And it's great to see
that it's all paying off.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.470
Since the beginning of the
year, the number of you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.510
based in our region
who are making

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.390
$1 million dollars or more
per month on Google Play

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.550
has grown by 54%.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.420
54%.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.640
That's a huge leap.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.430
And one business model that's
working well for many of you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.080
is subscriptions.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.230
Subscriptions revenue has
doubled in the past year,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.380
and grown four times since 2016.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.200
At Play, we view
ourselves as your partner

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.620
in helping you grow your
apps and games business.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.070
We've made huge investments
in people, technology,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.222
processes to help you
succeed on Android.

00:03:05.222 --> 00:03:06.680
We're very proud
of what we've been

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.945
able to accomplish together.

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:10.820
But at the same time,
we realize that there's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.290
much more to be done.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.930
That's one of the reasons
we are here today--

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.500
to continue listening to your
feedback, to share experiences,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.875
and to learn more
from each other.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:23.250
To tell you more
about what we're

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.340
doing to continue helping you
grow your business on Android

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.300
and Play, please welcome
our keynote speaker,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.220
Tian Lim, our Vice
President of UX and Product

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.270
from Google Play.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.770
Tian.

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:42.680
TIAN LIM: Hi, everyone.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.373
Good morning.

00:03:44.373 --> 00:03:45.040
My name is Tian.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.740
And I run Product and
UX for Google Play.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.190
I'm super excited to share
a little of what we've

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.070
been doing to help
you reach more users

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.620
and build successful businesses.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.020
I'm actually still
pretty new to Google.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.100
In literally five days time
will be my one year anniversary

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.120
at Google.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.180
And I joined because it's
just an incredible opportunity

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.630
to help so many people
around the world, both users

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.770
and developers.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.230
One unique experience
I want to share

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.149
with you that I had this year
was my short time in Nigeria.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.360
We went to Nigeria for the
Google for Nigeria event.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.610
We were rolling
out Google Station.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.190
Free Wi-Fi for everyone.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.100
And I had the opportunity to
meet developers and influencers

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.610
there.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.150
And I have to say, it was
just absolutely inspiring.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.060
I met developers
that Google trained.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.010
And once they became
certified Android developers,

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.370
they were making 10
times more than what

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.290
they used to make before.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.450
Or they were building companies.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.420
Local companies solving
real local issues.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.970
The kinds of problems
that you can only

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.600
solve if you're
living in that market.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.800
And here there's
a game developer

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.830
nestled between the
YouTube and movie stars.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.610
And he has a small
game for kids teaching

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.440
them African languages.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.070
And he found a global audience.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.610
Basically, the African
diaspora trying to reconnect

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.010
with their cultural heritage.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.050
These are some
inspirational stories

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.160
that I came away with
in my short time there.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.020
Now, this is just one small trip
talking to a few developers.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.360
But here at Google
Play, every month

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.640
we talk to thousands of you.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.580
Listening to you helps us
focus on what's important.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.440
I wanted to start the date by
focusing on the user and three

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.480
things that they care about--

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.440
quality, safety, and well-being.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.070
Everybody here represents some
of the highest quality apps

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.560
and games in the Play Store.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.170
You know that your
investments in quality

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.260
pay off with highly
engaged users.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.570
The flip side, of course,
is a high crash rate

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.038
tends to lead to more
one star ratings.

00:06:06.038 --> 00:06:08.330
On the Play Store, we want
to recognize your commitment

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.320
to quality.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.350
And that's why our search
and discovery algorithms now

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.540
consider app quality
and user engagement.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.580
This means that apps and games
with better retention, fewer

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.550
crashes, and fewer
uninstalls get

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.490
recommended more frequently.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.610
To help you measure app
quality and improve it,

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.390
we have been investing
heavily in Android vitals.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.900
And we have seen that developers
that engage with vitals

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.050
can dramatically improve
their crash rates, which

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.160
directly leads to better
ratings and better engagement.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.810
Now, we've heard your feedback.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.300
We've heard the feedback
that the data's great.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.140
But it's not super actionable.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.390
So today, we are linking
fully pre-launch reports

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.550
with Android vitals.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.880
You'll hear a lot more about
this from Fergus and Gavin.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.670
But I have to say,
this is amazing stuff.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.970
What's going to happen is
when Vital sees crashes out

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.995
in the field that we've already
seen in the pre-launch report,

00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:13.120
you can now connect these
two pieces of information

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.140
together and see videos and logs
of exactly the kinds of issues

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.930
that users are seeing
out in the wild.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.720
And so this can directly
help you prioritize

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.610
which issues in the
pre-launch report

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.003
to focus on because
you know that users

00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:28.045
are hitting these issues.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.630
Let's talk user safety.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.640
Another very interesting aspect
of my short time at Google

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.010
is seeing the many
new and creative ways

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.550
that our adversaries have come
up with to abuse our users

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.950
or exploit our ecosystem.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.800
Well, let me tell you, we're
not having any more of this.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.592
We're working super hard to
turn the tide on this problem.

00:07:52.592 --> 00:07:54.050
And this is an area
that I actually

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.880
had to get personally
extremely deep on.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.060
And I'm very proud
of the team and both

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.570
the automated and manual
ways in which we fight

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.060
this problem every single day.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.930
It's really tough work.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.440
But it's really good work.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.570
Android and Google
Play have always

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.900
taken security and privacy
extremely seriously.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.570
It's simply not negotiable.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.990
Every app and game undergoes
an extensive security review

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.840
before they are published, using
a combination of both machine

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.520
learning automation and humans.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.680
And as a result, 99% of
apps with abusive content

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.400
are identified before
people can ever

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.650
have a chance to install them.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.320
Even after publishing,
Google Play Protect

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.440
scans every app installed
on the Android fleet.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.260
That's 50 billion
apps every single day

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.540
that we're looking at
and checking for anything

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.640
out of the ordinary.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.480
As a result of
all these efforts,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.300
people who download
apps exclusively

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.240
from the Google Play
Store are nine times less

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.750
likely to install a
potentially harmful app.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.210
So that's a little of
what we do for the safety

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.500
of the ecosystem.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.050
But we need your help.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.530
Our policies are constantly
changing and adapting,

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.280
working to keep the ecosystem
safe for you and your users.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.670
Your input is critical.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.050
And my team and I are
extremely grateful

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.150
for the active
dialogue that helps

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.570
us strike the right
balance between user safety

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.420
and your ability to innovate.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.460
Our goal is to
ensure that users are

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.430
aware of how their
data is being used

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.790
and that that access
is reasonable.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.880
So last week, we
announced a set of changes

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.910
around the SMS and
call log permissions.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.750
This is to make
sure that developers

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.090
who request these
permissions only

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.760
do so when it is
absolutely necessary.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.180
And we spoke with many of you
to understand your concerns.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.220
And I can guarantee that our
final decisions were heavily

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.440
influenced by all
these conversations.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.110
You can expect us to
continue to review

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.110
all the various permissions
and these types of changes

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.667
with the community
in the months ahead.

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:15.750
We will also be working
to ensure that we give you

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.410
sufficient notice to make these
changes and details on how

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.880
to implement them.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.620
For example, on November 1-- and
a not so subtle reminder that

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.800
we will require all apps
and updates to target API

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.020
level 26 or higher.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.200
This helps bring security
and battery life improvements

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.772
to all our users.

00:10:35.772 --> 00:10:37.230
And these are the
kinds of benefits

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.100
that can only be realized in
the ecosystem when all of us

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.960
get on board.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.080
We announced this 10 months
ago with explicit instructions

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.940
on how to comply.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.110
We need you to be on top of
these and future changes.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.630
So please make sure that
you have the right contact

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.080
information on the Play
Console, read our updates,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.585
and engage with us as we
roll through these changes.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.730
Now, we've talked
about high quality

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.775
apps in a safe environment.

00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:09.150
But increasingly
people have been

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.390
thinking about striking the
right balance with technology

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.070
as well.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.120
I, for one, escape my
technology by subjecting myself

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.560
to extreme endurance
sports and extreme amounts

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.122
of physical abuse.

00:11:24.122 --> 00:11:26.580
This is literally what happens
when I'm not out here trying

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.960
to help users and developers.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.100
I get shocked with 10,000
volts of electricity.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.990
Now, our research
shows that while much

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.460
of the time that we spend on
phones is useful and valuable,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.170
many of us still wish that we
could disconnect more easily.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.600
That's why at IO this
year, we announced

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.240
our digital
well-being initiative.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.510
We added capabilities
directly into Android P

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.740
to help expose and control
our digital habits.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.540
We added a usage dashboard,
daily app limits,

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.250
the shush gesture,
and wind down,

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.190
and many other features
all to help people find

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.800
the balance that they need.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.580
As businesses, we all
need to think critically

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.400
about the longevity
of our apps and games

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.460
and how we can sustainably
engage our users

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.470
without burning them out.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.750
Yesterday, I was
very lucky to attend

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.730
a meetup for the Sustainable
Engagement Forum.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.820
This is was extremely
robust conversation

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.960
with great cross-pollination
between different kinds of apps

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.180
and between game developers
and app developers.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.530
It was really, really exciting
to see the community rally

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:45.560
around the cause for
sustainable engagement.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.230
So to recap, we've talked
about important ways which

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.780
we are improving the user
experience through quality,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.570
safety, and digital well-being.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.180
But how do we connect
more of them to you?

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.300
So let's dive into some of
the new tools and features

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.590
that we've built after
listening to you.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.550
In particular, the amazing
potential of our new

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.740
app distribution model.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.910
Some new features to help
attract and engage new users.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.880
And tools to help you
monetize your business.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.950
App sizes.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.170
They've grown dramatically.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.230
Over the past four years,
they have tripled in size.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.350
But as you know,
larger apps reduce

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:33.180
install conversion and
increase in uninstall rates.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.770
And that's one reason we
built the Android App Bundle.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.010
With our new format, we're
able to serve only exactly

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.380
the code and resources
that a user needs

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.475
for their specific device.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:51.840
Since launching in IO in May,
several thousand app bundles

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.060
have been deployed
to production.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:59.280
And on average, those apps are
seeing a 35% reduction in size

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.480
compared to universal APK.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.100
We are really excited
about its potential.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.350
And you'll hear a lot
more about the bundle

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.530
and the benefits of
smaller modular apps

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.430
in the next session.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.340
So we just re-architected the
entire distribution pipeline

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.490
to deliver your apps
more efficiently.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.380
But we've also
introduced new features

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.540
to help you attract
and engage new users.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.920
Pre-registration lets you gather
interest for an upcoming launch

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.950
in order to help boost
your day one installs.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.010
And since we launched
in early access,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.570
we've generated
more than a quarter

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.510
billion pre-registrations.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.310
We're excited that
the program is now

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.060
available to all our
app and games partners

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.343
and is fully self-serviced
in the Play Console.

00:14:53.343 --> 00:14:54.760
You will also now
have the ability

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.560
to grant user rewards
to those early users.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.240
And we've integrated
pre-registration with Google

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.710
Play Instant, letting your users
try a product before it even

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.222
launches.

00:15:07.222 --> 00:15:08.680
You can see an
example of that here

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.580
on the left with Looney
Tunes World of Mayhem.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.700
Google Play Instant also
supports premium applications.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.800
As you can see here on
the right with Umiro.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.380
We've also made these
instant experiences easier

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.830
to build with integrations
into Cocos Creator and a Unity

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.663
plugin that is now available.

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:32.080
And we've done all
this because we

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.390
know that Google Play
Instant can help you

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.360
with user acquisition.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.810
We also have another
new launch that

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.190
will help with your conversion.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.870
It's been one of
the top requests

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.920
from developers
around the world.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.580
And that's to modify
store listing pages based

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.920
on user country, not language.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.070
So now you can do this.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.900
Quick example here.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:00.580
Halloween in the US, coming up
next week, and Diwali in India.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.020
They're each about a week apart.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.900
But users in both countries
tend to have their devices set

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.250
to US English.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.430
So targeting by
language is not helpful.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.530
With country star
listing targeting,

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.900
you can now change the
store listing content

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.800
based on the user's country.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.480
So here the icons and photos
are not only different,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.590
but the descriptions can now
highlight different features

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.917
or talk about different events
in the different regions.

00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:30.000
So now that we've covered
some of the new features

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.500
to help bring users
into your app,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.120
let's talk about helping
you monetize your business.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.430
Our commerce platform
makes it easy for people

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:45.120
to securely purchase on Play
in over 150 markets via credit

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.680
card, direct carrier billing,
PayPal, and gift cards

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.860
that are available in over
800,000 retail locations.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.510
Subscriptions, as
mentioned, continue

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.410
to be a rapidly growing trend.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.960
And we have a lot of
features in the pipeline.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.349
But here's a taste of
just a few of them.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:09.510
On left, in early access,
is subscribe and install

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.380
on details page.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.720
So as you can see, this combines
the free trial, sign up,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.130
and the install button.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.220
And it captures user intent
to subscribe without having

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.859
to wait for the install.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.339
In the middle, you'll
see the EAP for pause.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.490
So a user may be
going on vacation.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.998
And rather than let that
user cancel and churn out,

00:17:31.998 --> 00:17:34.290
this gives them some control
to put their subscriptions

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.090
on pause and helps
keep them with you.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.690
On the far right, you can
see plan change support.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.270
With price changes
for existing SKUs.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.471
With deferred upgrade
and downgrades.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.850
Along with a strong
growth in subscriptions,

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.090
we're seeing more developers
adopt a hybrid approach

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.800
to monetization.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.730
And one trend has been to
reward users for an action

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.700
like watching a video
ad with in-game currency

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.900
or other benefits.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.470
So today, we're excited to
announce a new monetization

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.990
type called rewarded products.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.030
The first offering being
a rewarded video format.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.820
Users can elect to
watch a short video.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.160
And upon completion,
are rewarded

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.310
by the developer with
either virtual goods

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.560
or in-game currency.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.010
This new offering is powered
by Google Ads technology.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.040
And it uses the same API calls
for in app purchases on Google

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.240
Play today.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.820
No third party SDKs required.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.520
We're currently in closed beta.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.020
But we will share more details
with you in the coming weeks.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.570
So I've covered a lot
in about 15 minutes.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.070
And as you know, there is a
huge range of existing features.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.620
It can be extremely
tricky for any of us

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.260
to keep it all in our heads.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.880
So to help you take advantage
of all the tools and programs,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.430
we're launching the
Academy for App Success.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.440
Today, there are now 10
courses with information

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.750
ranging from managing your apps
release to granting refunds.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.630
And going forward, we'll be
supporting more languages

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.400
and adding more
content to help you

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.193
take advantage of everything
that Play has to offer.

00:19:22.193 --> 00:19:23.360
So we hope you check it out.

00:19:26.162 --> 00:19:28.620
So now that we've talked about
some of the tools for growth

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.360
on mobile, I wanted to touch on
the broader Android landscape.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.410
As you know, we continue to
push our apps to many devices

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.260
with Wear OS,
Android TV, and Auto.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.070
And across even more
surfaces with Assistant.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.790
Today, I'd like to focus
briefly on Chrome OS

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.180
and how this growing ecosystem
is an exciting opportunity

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.060
for developers.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.800
So, Chromebooks
have gone from what

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.930
seems like a small
experiment to being

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.210
available throughout the world.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.490
They range from traditional
laptops to convertibles.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.870
And we've built all of
these in partnership

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.730
with some of the best OEMs.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.090
Like Samsung, HP, and Dell.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.880
They're available in over
10,000 stores worldwide.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.350
And we continue to explore
and expand our footprint.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.170
Last week, we announced
exciting an new device.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.210
The Google Pixel Slate.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.970
It's a great example of our
commitment to the Chrome OS

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.590
ecosystem.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.020
It was designed to bring
games and apps to life

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.180
with a brilliant screen
and great performance.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.590
So let's take a closer look
at a couple of great app

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.830
experiences optimized for
Chromebooks and Pixel Slate.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.830
Gameloft wanted Asphalt
8 Airborne to give users

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.060
more precise control.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.860
And because Chrome OS
treats its physical keyboard

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.100
just like an external
keyboard on an Android phone,

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.090
Asphalt 8 was able to support
keyboard controls using APIs

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.935
from Android Platform SDK 26.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.830
The result was pretty amazing.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.350
A whopping 6x increase
in daily access

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.060
for users on Chromebooks.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.670
And a 9x boost in revenue.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.090
The Gameloft team was so
excited by the strong results

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.010
that optimizing
for larger screens

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.210
is now standard
operating practice.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.710
And they've just
finished optimizing

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.330
their latest addition in the
series, Asphalt 9 Legends.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.680
Another app is Evernote.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.620
The Evernote team was extremely
excited to use low latency

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.150
stylus APIs to quickly implement
touchscreen handwriting

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.065
and enhance layouts for
those wider screens.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.180
Now, without the
latency, their users

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.280
can really feel like
they're drawing on paper.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.160
The result?

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.878
Users of Evernote on
Pixelbook spent 4x more time

00:22:01.878 --> 00:22:02.795
than on other devices.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.920
So these developers went
beyond a mobile-only strategy.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.200
And they adapted their
products to serve consumers

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.340
on a larger variety of devices.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.420
And as a result, saw massive
increases in user engagement.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.660
So perhaps you have
the same opportunities.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.980
And because Android apps
are available on Chrome OS,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.940
you can take your app, and
with very few adjustments,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.620
optimize it for these larger
screens and form factors.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.810
So it's really easy.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.710
More surfaces.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.770
A larger creative canvas for
you from the same binary.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:43.240
I can't wait to see what amazing
stuff you all come up with.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.120
So that's about it for me today.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.120
Although I talked about user
needs and some new things

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.760
to help you connect
those users to you,

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.614
the bigger theme to all this
is that we are here for you.

00:22:54.614 --> 00:22:57.600
You are all the
inspiration for our work.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.030
So please use this
opportunity to talk to us

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:03.090
and give us feedback so that
next year we can bring forth

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.660
even more announcements and
features based on your ideas

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.080
and inspiration.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.360
Thank you so much.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.010
[APPLAUSE]
