00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
What's up guys

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.120
I'm Grant Thompson

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.980
the king of random and

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.100
I am Stuart Edge, today I am the apprentice of random

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.320
There you go, and today we're taking some copper tubing

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.500
cutting it up, throwing it into a backyard foundry to see

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.540
if we can liquefy copper.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.360
the purpose of today's experiment is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.880
to see if we can melt down some copper.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.760
we have played with metals like aluminum

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.240
brass, they have a little bit lower melting points

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.380
I've never done copper before

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.160
and so I really want to know

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.480
does this backyard foundry actually melt copper?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.940
So i got Stuart Edge and a dull hacksaw blade

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.180
I'm going to put him to work chopping this copper up

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.980
into little pieces, and I'm going to fire up the metal foundry

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.920
and see if we can get this to work.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.000
Copper is pretty expensive stuff, I went down to the home depot and picked up

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.860
these two foot lengths and they were almost eight dollars each.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.980
I got four of them because I'm not exactly sure how much copper we're going to get,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.300
but this stuff is pricey and we're going to reduce it from a stand down into a little ingot

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.460
that we can work with a little easier

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.000
we're going to do that using this bench vise.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.020
This is going to be a team effort Stuart.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.520
yea

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.380
Dude, you just took that out

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.160
No time flat we got the hacksaw master

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.220
Here we go, master Edge

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.180
I can use your back for leverage.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.780
This is like yoga.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.220
I'm just not that flexible.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.140
How you doing? How am i doing your highness?

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.940
It's looking good to me, let's see the spoils of our labors, right here.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.480
Yeah

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.400
check this out

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.720
Stuart, you're doing a mighty fine job my friend

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.360
Thank you

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.020
Ready, ready? Here we go watch this.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.140
Where'd it go?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.660
I don't even know where it went. Where did it go?

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.760
oh oh oh

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.380
Quick update guys, we got everything cut. How does that feel weight wise?

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.440
Uh, probably about one and a half pounds right there

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.680
like a box of butter

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.160
Copper is a relatively heavy metal, especially once you shrink it down in size

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.920
and make it an ingot like we're about to do

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.540
not so heavy when it's in tube form, but very heavy once we conglobulate it together

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.880
and make it into an ingot

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.120
What you're looking at right here is about thirty dollars worth of copper

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.120
People legitimately make businesses out of scrapping copper. Like wires, tubes,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.740
this is like plumbing line

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.240
if you salvage that and take it into a metal recycling place, you can make money

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.720
recycling copper

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.740
exactly! What about pennies?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.060
Pennies are zinc, they're just copper coated

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.000
zinc is pretty worthless

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.540
Now the reason we shrunk this down in size is because

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.040
when we put this in the crucible we want more surface area exposed

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.620
so we can get this melting

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.360
Once we get a molten pool of copper, it's gonna be a lot easier to start melting the rest of it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.900
so smaller pieces are going to get the process moving a little bit faster

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.480
at least, thats the idea.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.560
Now, in yesterdays video we tried

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.480
casting metal fidget spinners

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.480
and we made ingots.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480
Now we've got some left over junk in our crucible but

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.480
we are gonna set this down in here, fire it up, get it nice and hot

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480
and I think that's cleaned out enough

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.480
that we can get relatively pure copper.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480
Alright, i'm gonna give you the barbecue igniter.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.480
I'm gonna go pump in some gas

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.360
here we go

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.180
Whoa!!!

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.000
I was waiting for that!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I was waiting for that.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040
That is awesome dude hahaha nicely done

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.320
hanging out with the king of random
random happen okay were you expecting

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.470
that well a little bit my mind was like
this is going to go big well I can now

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.350
Grant want it just like having me light
something and have it well done I think

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:27.200
ok so we're just going to take that lid
rolled on top the quick update guys our

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.200
furnace has been running for about 10
minutes now the crucible is glowing

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.590
red-hot so it's time to take the lid off
we're gonna start throwing these things

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.820
in one by one and see if they melt a
copper like this has a melting point of

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.290
almost 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit
something like 1984 Fahrenheit so the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.290
purpose of this experiment is to see if
this backyard boundary gets hot enough

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.100
to liquefy copper I've never tried
anything with a melting point this high

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.610
but if it will it will also melt gold
silver and everything else because

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.690
they're all the same melting points it
won't do steel but it will do everything

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.350
else so this is the moment of truth this
is where we find out if our crude

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.540
backyard boundary that took 10 minutes
to slap together is robust enough to

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.260
take down copper

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.560
wowww

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.620
look at all the medals from our previous
burn are like boiling in there we've got

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.820
fired vapors zinc fumes burning off all
right here we go we got our first piece

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.590
of copper ready for the drop let's do it

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.650
it is going to melt I'm thinking
probably in the next 30 seconds or so it

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.979
is exploding really I don't think so
I'd be highly surprised but I wouldn't

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.539
rule it out
oh look at that the copper is changing

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.949
color now you see a certain glow red
that's a good sign all right that

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.539
thing's getting pretty hot I'm going to
press it down we're quick Peck there we

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.509
go like that just flatten right out
it's not melted yet but it's pretty dang

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:57.910
hot just put the lid on for a second so
I just put the lid back on so we can

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.360
contain some of that heat because we
have this open to expose the air gets to

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.620
and cools it down our copper is so hot I
could flatten it out no problem so I'm

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.530
thinking I'm actually very hopeful so
this is going to work and then we can

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.590
throw in the rest
oh look look actually is liquefying it

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:22.479
is liquefying that oh where to go that's
really hot okay this is going to work

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.320
let's throw in a bunch more okay let's
get like I don't know ten pieces in

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.340
there here we go

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.340
He scores

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:42.820
nice shootin Tex
oh that that he like get it

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.389
all right there we go look at that a few
minutes so here's the deal guys the

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.229
copper is going to be so hot we can't
use a traditional muffin tin to use as

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.409
an ingot mold because it will actually
fuse to the steel the temperature ranges

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.400
are so close they'll bind together so we
have to find some kind of improvised way

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.639
of making an ingot mold and that's why
we're bringing out the standby the

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.669
reason we're using stand is because
stand is mostly made of silica which has

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.479
an extremely a high melting point and
even if the ingot did stick to it we

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.860
could just brush the sand off
dual-purpose let's get busy

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.780
so we've got a flat sandy surface now
I'm going to take a spoon I'm just going

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.710
to carve out little ingot mold that we
can pour our copper into to work in

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.200
theory right yeah in theory

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.400
so now hopefully it all stays in one
piece you can go out

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.200
That's scary what if it were to just fall out

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.600
Then it wouldn't be very good sand, I'd have to make some more

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.020
or add some more water at least
there we go it provides ingot mold out

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:15.080
of sand
oh yeah it's melting gosh that's looking

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.470
good okay we got some slag in there
obviously you're going to be very gentle

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.880
here I see some liquid it's looking good
and we're going to make the pour this

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.680
wood copper my friends there you go this
is working

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.340
you'd be full okay so I just knelt down
on some kind of slag and a burned a hole

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.150
right through my jeans there whoa it
felt like kneeling on a rock but quickly

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.810
started burning
oh wow these things are still fiery hot

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.020
look at the way it's still glowing
orange its incandescent it's actually

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.240
emitting light at this point these are
cooling down pretty fast yeah just about 30

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.449
seconds to go these were glowing orange
and you can see they're already turning

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:59.800
kind of like a charcoal gray color that
top layer is probably oxidizing and I

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.120
touch it now
No can you touch it now let's grab a

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.500
piece of paper and see exactly what
happens if you do that you know okay

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:16.330
yeah it's on fire like that one second
ignition pretty sweet huh see that nice

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.990
little rainbow like a little metallic
rainbow sweet stuff dude sweet stuff

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.860
here we go

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:28.840
that's looking good
hot hot hot here's molten copper

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.720
everybody looking good

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.940
Look at the way the slag flips in the  top we will figure that out

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.900
doing that is beautiful there's actually
not a whole lot of slag in the Copper it seems

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.960
It is I don't know why it is

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.420
Clean

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.020
here you can definitely see the

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.730
difference these are glowing orange and
actually emitting light and they're

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.450
extremely hot I can feel the heat radiating
right there now you can see these ones

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.580
have been sitting here for a little
while they've cooled down quite a bit

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.640
more than these have these are still a
bit shiny a little bit glossy and we're

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.360
very very hot so I'm just going to use
these tongs to dig down to the sand pop

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.370
them free and then quench them in a
bucket of water yep they're definitely

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.000
hardened up here's our makeshift ingot
oh that is a cool noise that's not it

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.220
Oh that is a cool noise

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.760
amazing
oh wow look at the color color-changing

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:39.580
top it's like fuschia cool you have the
next one grab a little time

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.440
look at the way that changes color is
interesting

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.100
you can see how cool the system is
because not only do the ingots not stick

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.910
to the sand but we can very easily move
the sand back to the bucket and reuse it

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.480
for another casting at this point these
ingots are cool enough I can grab them

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.629
by hand I'm just going to use a little
wire brush here to take off the sand

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:08.420
around the edges just clean them up a
little bit

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.000
you can see they very nicely took the shape that we carved out with  our spoon a little copper nugget and

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:21.089
here's the finished result four little
copper nuggets which looks absolutely

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:25.589
like the holes we carved out in the tin
it is interesting that magenta color on

00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:30.839
the top go very pretty so this is pretty
exciting for me guys I know other people

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.540
have melted copper before but this is
the first time I've tried it for myself

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.720
which means our backyard foundry is
getting well over 2,000 degrees

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.079
Fahrenheit to be able to liquefy this
stuff and this means now we can cast

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:43.350
things out of copper which i think is
very exciting the other thing I thought

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.170
was interesting and kind of a
coincidence we had four stands of copper

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.529
pipe and we made four makeshift ingot
it also means these are worth about

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:52.709
seven and half dollars each this is
super good news guys this means our

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:56.160
metal foundry takes down copper without
any problem at all I'm very excited

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.199
about that
what are something you can make so what

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:01.110
we want to make out of copper we could
really make anything I mean fidgets

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.899
spinners were going to be the original
idea but I think that trend is kind of

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:06.420
played out
copper is heavy and it looks cool so

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.300
