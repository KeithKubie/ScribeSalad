that's really where cling to a scale so
 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.590
that's really where cling to a scale so
the important part moving forward needs

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600
the important part moving forward needs
 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.189
the important part moving forward needs
to plant the seed so that social

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199

further communities in the region so
 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.390
further communities in the region so
that homegrown solutions can be can be

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400
that homegrown solutions can be can be
 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.680
that homegrown solutions can be can be
innovative in clinical scales
