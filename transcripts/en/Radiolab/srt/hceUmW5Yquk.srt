1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,610
This is Radiolab. I'm Robert
Krulwich and Jad Abumrad,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:04,530
and this hour I'm going to curse you dad.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,690
I'm going to ask you to just
simply do this final thing.

4
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:11,520
You know that song that we both hate?
Oh, which one? Pump pump, pump pump.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,820
God. It's like the moment you start that
and keep going here, he can. You think

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,980
there are some songs that I can stick
in your head and they just won't leave.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,030
There's somebody of course who's head
who got this song somehow stuck in her

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,380
head and then his songs that just won't
go away because you didn't even invite

9
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:36,750
them and they stay. This is an
hour on the music in our heads.

10
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:38,130
Where does the songs come from?

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,690
Why do they stay our whole
hour without Suzanne Vega?

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,250
Thankfully on radio lab.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,680
Let me ask you a question that
could get us started here.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,420
When a song gets stuck in your head,

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,630
do you even have one in there
right now by any chance? Oliver,

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,710
the Broadway show tune of course. What
does it sound like when it's in there?

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,580
What does it sound like? Yeah, but
it just think before you answered.

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,740
What does it really sound like?
Describe it a musically. Um, well,

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,840
it does. Well, it's funny that you
mentioned this. It, it's doesn't actually,

20
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:14,700
I don't hear any musician because it
loud. No, it's nothing. It's not loud.

21
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:19,590
It's like a location. No.
Tambour no, it just has a melody.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,790
A vague foggy. Like a shadow
email. Yes, exactly. Okay. Well,

23
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,160
so that's our starting point. You know,
most of us get a song in our head.

24
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:28,350
It's kind of like what
you described, vague,

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,260
but there are people who when they get
songs stuck in our head, it's a whole,

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,920
it's a whole different experience.
It is not vague. In fact,

27
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,020
they wish it were vague.
They wish we're a shadow

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,680
and you'll know what I mean. In a
second, let me introduce you to someone.

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,260
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,310
Little lamb always has songs
running through his head
everywhere that Mary went,

31
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:52,400
the lamb was sure to go. He's
plagued by them actually.

32
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,170
Then he spoke with our
producer, Lulu Miller.

33
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,440
That was going through your
head just now. That's right.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,470
Mary heard a little loud
over and over again.

35
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,610
Let me have you just introduce
yourself really quick. Oh, I'm uh,

36
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,220
my name is Leo rang girl
and I'm a not young.

37
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:11,450
I just had my 94th birthday.
I've been in la since I was in

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,430
the War World War II as a psychoanalyst.
Oh yeah. I'm still in practice.

39
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:21,320
We find everything that's been going
on in his own head sort of intriguing,

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,300
like from a professional standpoint.

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,040
I'm trying to think what
the hell am I doing? Anyway,

42
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,520
this whole thing started
for him about 12 years ago.

43
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:32,690
He had just had major heart surgery
and he wakes up in his hospital bed.

44
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,930
I wake up in the ICU and almost as soon
as I'm conscious outside my hospital

45
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:43,130
window, I hear music and there was this,

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,800
it sounded few near-real like
hymns. I hear these songs.

47
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,710
I look out the window. I thought,
Geez, a rabbi is out there.

48
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,060
I say to my kids, I casually
say, uh, hey, there's a,

49
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,220
there's a rabbi this singing.

50
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:00,840
Yeah.

51
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,410
They said, what do you mean? So I said,

52
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,510
there must be as rabbi school and he
must be teaching young people how to be

53
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:10,900
rabbis. And they, the
kids looked at each other,

54
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,013
the [inaudible]

55
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,140
because they weren't hearing
anything. But at that moment,

56
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:20,430
that didn't matter to Leo because the
music was so loud and vivid to him.

57
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:23,600
So totally coming through that window that

58
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,650
I dismissed them as, oh well they
could have their opinion if they want.

59
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,290
I didn't think anything of it.

60
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,060
Uh, Duh, Duh, Duh.

61
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,320
And then the rest of the week
in the hospital, uh, you know,

62
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:39,450
I'm getting better and better and as I
get better, the music changes, right.

63
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,600
I started being a much
more perky and the songs,

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,400
the music out the window changes
to Chattanooga, Choo Choo.

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,820
Did Dod do the chat? The new to
Chattanooga Choo Choo did you Julie?

66
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,890
Well, one of the morning, two in the
morning, I'm waking up with these songs

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,690
always coming in from right outside
that window. Then I thought,

68
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,570
Jesus isn't pretty energetic
group. They're across the street

69
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,271
at this point.

70
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:13,660
Leo was beginning to suspect that
something a little weird was going on.

71
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,080
But the real coup,

72
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:19,030
the grog came when I was
going to leave the hospital.

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,270
There were a week or
so and the this tunes,

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,420
I didn't know the words at first, but I
started to hear that that Dah, Dah, Dah,

75
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,330
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,950
Z. Packed up, signed out of the hospital
and got into his car. I was reflecting.

77
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,860
That's when it hit him. I
still was hearing the song.

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,570
The song was still coming from outside a
window, but now the scenery was moving.

79
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,990
I thought it was related to the hospital
until the thing across the street.

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,690
Here I am in the car
listening to this. Oh,

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,990
and that's when the lyrics appear. Yeah.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,660
Finally the words come when
Johnny comes marching home again.

83
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,990
Oh Rah Rah. He couldn't ignore it anymore.

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,820
Not only was the song following him
home, it's like the song was about him.

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,480
He was the Johnny. The girls
would here with marching home,

86
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,950
coming home from the hospital.

87
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,260
I realized I am listening to me.

88
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,510
I am listening to me.

89
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,740
Okay. Is He really though? I mean,

90
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:22,700
is he really listening to anything or
is he just think he's hearing something?

91
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,880
Well, there's nothing out there for
him to hear right from the inside.

92
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:28,970
Like is this brain actually
hearing music? [inaudible]

93
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,770
he for us, there's a professor in
England who had the exact same question.

94
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,663
I called him up.

95
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,160
Hello.

96
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,910
Hi. Can I speak to professor Griffith
please? Okay. Tim Griffith is his name.

97
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,150
He is a professor of cognitive
neurology at New Castle University.

98
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,691
Here's what he did.

99
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:48,640
He took 35 people who are likely a who
claim to be hallucinating music. Yeah.

100
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,200
And he scanned their brains,
right? Simple experiment.

101
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,940
I just put people on a scan run
and said, what are you hearing now?

102
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:57,590
What are you hearing now when
they told him, uh, there,

103
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,061
there,

104
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm hearing music that that moment he
would snap a picture of their brain,

105
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,230
right? Then he took a different group
of people who have no hallucinations,

106
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,380
played them real music, [inaudible]
music, scan their brains,

107
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,000
and then he compared the pictures.

108
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,270
And if you look,

109
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,600
they look virtually identical.

110
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,450
Know if you would've put those
in front of me and say ones,

111
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:18,840
people hallucinating the others,
people being played, music I,

112
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,760
I wouldn't be able to
tell you, which was weird,

113
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,920
which tells you two things.
First, this condition is real.

114
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:26,170
These people are not
making it up. And second,

115
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,440
this goes way beyond the
ordinary experience that
the rest of us have where we

116
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,490
get a song stuck in our head.

117
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,230
These people are getting the full high
Phi experience of listening to music.

118
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,670
Their entire brain is lit up.

119
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,590
The music sounds so convincingly
like real life music.

120
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,830
What are you to think when it suddenly
appears? That's Diana Deutsch,

121
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,830
a psychologist at the University
of California, San Diego,

122
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,190
who's been collecting emails from hundreds
of different people who hallucinate

123
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:56,060
music. One person described it
in the following way. He said,

124
00:06:56,061 --> 00:07:01,061
imagine that you were at a rock
concert standing right by loudspeaker.

125
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,930
Well, it's louder than that.

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,640
At the beginning when I didn't
know what was going to happen,

127
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,740
I thought it was going to take over my
mind. It started interfering with sleep.

128
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,340
It's the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe.

129
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,930
[inaudible]

130
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,350
well night. Oh and I, I got mad.
I used to say stop it already.

131
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,980
[inaudible] cut it out. Come on enough.
Enough. Enough. But you never know.

132
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,790
[inaudible]

133
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,770
yes, I never sleep. Yes. That
was the low point. I thought,

134
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,010
I've got to get help for this. At what
point did you bring it up with doctors?

135
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,180
Oh, the doctors completely impotent.
To this day, they rolled their eyes.

136
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:44,050
When I tell them about it,

137
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,920
one doctor told him that maybe it was
the fillings in his teeth picking up the

138
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:52,150
radio. Okay. I hoped it was right,
but it wasn't, it continued forever.

139
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,000
Nothing he could do could
make it stop. I don't have any

140
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,980
off button.

141
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,810
It's like there was a jukebox in his
head run by an evil Gremlin and the worst

142
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:03,180
part, the Gremlin would
mess with the tempo.

143
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,020
Like, uh, okay, uh, [inaudible] that
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

144
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:09,670
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

145
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,630
Dah, Dah, and love the men on the flight.

146
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,420
Daring young man, only the flagging
[inaudible] Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

147
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:21,740
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah. That's the worst.

148
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,920
When that started to happen,

149
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:27,921
I really was getting close to panic as
I have the feeling that it could go at

150
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,250
its rate and I couldn't stop it.

151
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,240
It's like you're on a galloping horse.
The horse is running away with you. Dude.

152
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,870
I once told that to my
daughter. She said, dad,

153
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,780
why don't you just
instead think of the song?

154
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,250
No. And I could control the
tempo and I end instead.

155
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,120
When that was galloping,
I would go, uh, I did, uh,

156
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,950
uh, the

157
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,823
[inaudible]

158
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,780
an immediately up, completely relaxed,

159
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,020
and the Gallup is

160
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,770
completely gone and I
couldn't even let it come

161
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,250
back. And it would
start now being, Oh God,

162
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,150
no, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

163
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,523
Yeah.

164
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,160
[inaudible]

165
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,020
and that was no longer ever a problem
of the tempo running away with me.

166
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,920
Okay. So let's just
assume Leo is not crazy.

167
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,900
I never thought I was psychotic.
Never. Never. Because most people,

168
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,140
it turns out with this
condition are not crazy.

169
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,560
There's nothing else wrong with
them. According to Diana Deutsch.

170
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,920
So then the question becomes,

171
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,880
how can a person who is
otherwise sane hallucinate

172
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,500
to such a crazy degree? Well,

173
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,250
in the 60s there was a Polish psychologist
named Jersey Konarski who thought

174
00:09:56,251 --> 00:10:01,251
about this and and he came up with a
simple kind of beautiful idea based on an

175
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:03,840
assumption that he couldn't prove yet,

176
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,250
which was that between the ears and
the brain, there are some connections.

177
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:13,251
He thought just a few stray connections
that run backwards brain back to ear,

178
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,100
which would allow sound to run in
reverse. Now, this was just an idea.

179
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,070
He couldn't really test
it, but many years later,

180
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,670
neuroscientists like Tim Griffith
start to poke around in the brain.

181
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:26,510
They start to explore and what
they find is that he was right.

182
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,220
Yes, daily, right? Do you look at the
pathway between the years and the brain?

183
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,060
Probably about 70% of the fibers
don't actually go up. They go down,

184
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,440
they go the other way. Towards the end,

185
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,540
70% go. 70% go from the
brain to the ears. Yeah.

186
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,040
It's like our ears are literally wired
to hear our brains now. Konarski.

187
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,010
His idea was that normally our ears
wouldn't hear what the brain was saying

188
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:51,650
because it was too busy. You taking
in all the sounds from the outside,

189
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,800
but what if he thought this
sound from the outside stopped?

190
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,160
Maybe then there would
be a kind of backflow

191
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,650
sound stored in your brain would
start to flow backwards. Now again,

192
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:07,760
this is just an idea,

193
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:12,140
but there might be something to this
because it would explain why most of the

194
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:14,510
people who suffer from
musical hallucinations,

195
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,030
according to Tim Griffith
have one thing in common

196
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,631
by far and away.

197
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:22,631
The common situation you see it in is
in people who have deafness usually in

198
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:23,870
middle or later life,

199
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,240
and you have to take his word for it.
Nearly the instant that I went deaf,

200
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,970
I started experiencing round the clock,

201
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:32,940
24 seven auditory hallucinations.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,320
This is Michael Cora's twin.

203
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:38,240
He was 36 he lost all of his hearing
and he remembers the moment that it

204
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,641
happened.

205
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:42,960
He was in the emergency room talking to
a nurse and suddenly the sound started

206
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:43,350
to go.

207
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,720
It was like going from talking
like this to talking like this,

208
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:46,620
to talking like this,

209
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,540
to talk like my ears were just draining
out like water draining out of the,

210
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,700
uh, of about, uh, I just king
devore endeavor endeavor.

211
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,970
And at the same time I was dying to hear

212
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,350
a very loud ringing sound in my ears.

213
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,730
It was gradually morphing
prints of sort of formless Erie,

214
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,200
ethereal music,

215
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,380
music of the spheres really.

216
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,980
And you could slowly more

217
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,930
into some version of the Aven Maria

218
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,170
[inaudible].

219
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,980
It was almost as if as a sort
of recompense to being deaf,

220
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:38,981
I was like plugged into some sort of
deep background Melly and the cosmos.

221
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,593
Now here's the question.

222
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,280
What would happen if Michael
suddenly got his hearing back? Well,

223
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,700
a couple of months later, Michael
got a cochlear implant installed.

224
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,980
This is a little chip.
It's put into his brain,

225
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,250
which promised to return at least
part of his hearing. And he says,

226
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,600
when the doctor's turns on, the
moment he says they turned it on,

227
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,130
it sounds from the world
came rushing in and the music

228
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,033
stopped,

229
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,800
stopped, called just went away
almost instantaneously. Huh?

230
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,120
There you go. Well, but I happen
to know a woman who had a very,

231
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:23,630
very different experience. What do
you mean is she had the same problem.

232
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:28,050
She went deaf, she started hearing music.
What's, what kind of music was it? Um,

233
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,780
Hans spirituals, patriotic
songs are her name.

234
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,010
This is actually her real name.

235
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:36,080
It's Cheryl C's or we're
going to call her sheet.

236
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,800
Wanted the music in her head to stop.
And she'd heard about a patient,

237
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,050
like your friend there who had musical,

238
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,090
whose nation's received a cochlear implant
and her hallucinations disappeared.

239
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,650
So I wanted to do it. So she
did it. She got the implant,

240
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:56,651
she wakes up on the operating
table and I heard the music.

241
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:01,280
It was inside me still
there. Just was there.

242
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,090
I can't stop it. Why in the
first case? And they're,

243
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,670
they're kind of the same situation.
They are very much the same.

244
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:08,870
Why would there be that difference?

245
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,170
I don't know why there is this
difference between those. So I asked, uh,

246
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,050
Dr. Oliver Sacks, who we often
talk to on these questions.

247
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,930
How do you explain the difference
as a physician? Um, you know, um,

248
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,140
one sees patients that you
ask about their symptoms,

249
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:25,460
they produce their symptoms,

250
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,560
but it is equally important to see the
relation of the symptoms of the disease

251
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,500
to the person themselves,
to their identity.

252
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,330
He's discovered over the years that the
problem is expressed in the patient is

253
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:41,870
partly a disease. I mean, the person
is sick or in trouble in some way.

254
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,190
At the same time,

255
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,220
the disease is reflecting something
about the person in front of him and sees

256
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,420
interaction and a liaison,
a collusion, the condition,

257
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,400
I don't know what word to use between
the self and a symptom can sometimes it

258
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:00,800
can come out. So strangely,
for example, there is a,

259
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,700
a patient he has who was a Jewish,
he was a Jewish boy who, who to who?

260
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:09,701
Them grown up in Hamburg in the 1920s and
1930s and he had been terrified by the

261
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,791
Nazi youth and for some horrible reason
he hallucinated Nazi marching songs.

262
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,690
He was tormented. But on the other hand,

263
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,890
Oliver told me about an old woman he
wants made in a nursing home who was

264
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:29,170
haunted by lullabies, one
after the other nonstop at sea.

265
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:30,050
She was an orphan.

266
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:34,850
Father died before she was born and
her mother before she was five orphaned

267
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,750
alone.

268
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,310
She found the songs in her head
deeply comforting the music and the

269
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:45,311
hallucinations in fact seem to be a
door into a lost part of childhood.

270
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,040
So then the differences between people
and music floods into their head.

271
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,750
What's going on says Oliver is the
disease and the person they're talking to

272
00:15:56,751 --> 00:16:00,860
each other, the, the self can
be molded by hallucination,

273
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,720
but it can mold them in turn. I
wonder where Leo fits into this. Lulu,

274
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,360
how would you say that Leo self interacts
with his symptoms or vice versa?

275
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,790
Well, uh, he's a psychoanalyst, so
whenever he gets a song stuck in his head,

276
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,170
which is like all the
time, he analyzes it,

277
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,610
he looks for a hidden
meaning and [inaudible]

278
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,730
like, you know the way dreams reveal your
inner life. The same thing with songs.

279
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,770
Leo will tell you that every song
is a message from his subconscious.

280
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,570
Everything has an unconscious
connection, pleasant or unpleasant,

281
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,760
and he's just got to
figure out what it is.

282
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,730
I'm analyzing me like I have a
patient in front of me. Like when I,

283
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,933
I called him up, he had,

284
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,450
Mary had a little lamb stuck in his
head that he told me it was because he'd

285
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:45,480
been thinking about, Yep.

286
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Passivity of the American people in
following a leader that misleads them.

287
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,040
And everywhere that Mary went,
the lambs was sure to go,

288
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,810
I'm in and the connection is obvious.

289
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,510
Or when he first got home from the
hospital, he always had America.

290
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:02,950
The beautiful stuck in his head.

291
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,740
And I'm certainly not a raving patriot,

292
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:08,300
but what this meant was homes,

293
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,500
sweet America to me was home.

294
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,920
It's easy to think that
this is kind of a stretch.

295
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:20,180
I mean every song has some
very specific meaning for him,

296
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,190
but I dunno,

297
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,880
there was this one time he told me about
where he woke up with a song in his

298
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:26,240
head.

299
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,190
I stopped going to brush my teeth. I'm
singing along as I go to the bathroom.

300
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,820
This is what it was. It's just a
few years after his wife had died,

301
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,670
my Barney lows over the ocean.

302
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,730
My Bernie lies over the sea.

303
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,100
My Bernie lies over the ocean that
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

304
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,220
Dah. Bring back, bring back,

305
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,830
bring back my Bonnie to me. To me. Yeah.

306
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,093
And um,

307
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,470
I realized when I, I, why
am I singing that song?

308
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:11,730
And then suddenly I realized it was
our wedding anniversary that week.

309
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:15,000
That was one of our major
anniversaries. You know,

310
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,740
that song can kill me when I hear it.

311
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,140
Even so he told me that when that
song comes, he doesn't want it to go.

312
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,220
I found that when the song disappeared
that I didn't want it to disappear.

313
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,010
It's now been over a decade of
hallucinating music for Leo.

314
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,220
And he found that at some point the
music switched and went from intruder to

315
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:35,980
friend

316
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,560
that Duh, Duh, Duh Duh.

317
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,240
Now he looks forward to the song stoves
and still guitars at the company to Dah,

318
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,430
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

319
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,000
He finds himself alone
that the the in Monterey.

320
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,900
It's true that one of the things about
being 94 is that when you look at your

321
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:55,290
telephone address book, the half
of them are not there anymore.

322
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,980
You scratch out the name and
that's not easy. No, no, no.

323
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Just Molly and me and baby
makes three all happy.

324
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:10,250
And uh, the loo heaven [inaudible]

325
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,760
radio labs. Lulu Miller. Thanks
Lulu. Yep, thanks to Leo.

326
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,000
Leo has a book out about living
with musical hallucinations.

327
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:21,300
It's called music in the head,
living at the brain mind border.

328
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,920
And so does Michael [inaudible]. He's
the guy with the cochlear implant.

329
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:27,370
His book is called rebuilt my
journey back to the hearing world.

330
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,560
You can find links to all
of those on our website.

331
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Radio lab.org special thanks to Oliver
Sacks who basically gave us his Rolodex

332
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:38,170
and we were able to combine all these
people that interview that while thanks to

333
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:40,960
LRA and Kate Edgar, here's a
system. Absolutely no Robert,

334
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:43,420
before we go to break, I just don't play
it. One more clip, if you don't mind,

335
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,750
couldn't figure out a place to put it.
From my interview with Diana Deutsch,

336
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:50,020
I was asking her about
musical hallucinations and
where this stuff comes from,

337
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:52,060
like where does the music
come from, what triggers it?

338
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,810
And she told me basically,
well, it can be anything.

339
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,400
A striking example was somebody who
wanted very much for her hallucinations to

340
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:03,640
go and suddenly they did go
away. And so she said, oh great.

341
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:05,680
This is the sound of
silence. And immediately

342
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,130
song Sandra silence darkness.

343
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,150
Simon and Garfunkel
started at our glued. So

344
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,720
Radiolab will continue in a month.
