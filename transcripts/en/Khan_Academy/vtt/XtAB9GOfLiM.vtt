00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.420
Let's figure out how long this
object is going to be in the

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.590
air given that its vertical
velocity, or the magnitude of

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.370
the vertical velocity
is s sine of theta.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.540
So its speed in the vertical
direction is s sine of theta.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.440
So how long is it going
to be in the air?

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.620
Well if I told you that
something is going upwards at

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.030
10 meters per second and gravity
is decelerating it at

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.160
10 meters per second squared.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.420
So every second it's going to
slow it down by 10 meters per

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.240
second, how long will it take
for that object to get to 0,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.020
to stop moving?

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.810
Let me write that down.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.460
Let's say that some object is
moving upwards at 10 meters

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.780
per second.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.196
And let's say that the gravity
is slowing it down.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.320
Slowing it down at 10
meters per second.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.540
So every second that goes by,
it'll slow this thing down by

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.130
10 meters per second.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.820
Well, it'll take it exactly 1
second to make it go from 10

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.620
meters per second to 0
meters per second.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.840
And then it's going to be at
some height in the air, and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.320
then the thing's going to
start accelerating.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.640
Gravity is going to start
accelerating it downward.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.690
And then it'll take another
second for it to go from 0--

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.170
from having no velocity,
to having 10

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.610
meters per second again.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.760
So in this case, it'll take the
time in the air-- we could

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.960
say time sub air, I guess, is
going to be equal to this 10

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.650
meters per second,
your velocity.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.530
10 meters per second divided
by the acceleration.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.250
Divided by this 10 meters
per second.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.140
10 meters per second times 2.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.880
This is how long it'll take for
the object to go from 10

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.610
meters per second to 0 at
some point in the air.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.050
And then it's going to take the
exact same amount of time

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.910
for it to fall back
to the ground.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.340
So times 2.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.350
If the object was moving upwards
at 20 meters per

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.080
second and gravity is still
slowing it down at 10 meters

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.330
per second per second, then it's
going to take 2 seconds.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.610
If this was 20, then
this would be 20.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.950
And it'll take 2 seconds to slow
it down to 0 and then 2

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.670
more seconds until it hits
the ground again.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.560
For it to speed back up as
it approaches the ground.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.660
So no matter what your upward
velocity, the time in the air

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.550
is going to be your speed, your
vertical speed, divided

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.690
by the acceleration
of gravity.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.820
And this is the amount of time
it's going to take you to go

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.660
from this point to that point.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.000
To have some vertical velocity
and then slow down to 0.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.960
And it's going to take the exact
same amount of time for

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.400
you to speed back up by gravity
and get to your

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.200
original speed.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.730
We're assuming no
air resistance.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.520
So it's kind of a
pure problem.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.860
So this is the time up, the time
down is going to be the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.350
same thing.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.900
So we can multiply that by 2.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.850
Now, we already know what the
vertical component for our

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.710
problem is.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.960
It is s sine of theta.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.240
So we could just substitute
that back in there.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.260
And we know how long we're
going to be in the air.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.040
The time in the air is going to
be our speed-- or I should

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.130
maybe put the 2 out front.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.665
2 times s sine theta.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.080
Let me make it clear.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.730
This 2 right here is
this 2 right there.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.550
All of that over the
acceleration of gravity.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.520
So if you told me that I'm
shooting this object off at--

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.710
I don't know-- 100 meters
per second.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.660
So if this is 100 meters per
second and if theta were-- I

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.390
don't know-- let's say theta
were 30 degrees, then sine of

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.550
theta would be 1/2.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.120
So it'd be 100 meters per second
times 1/2 divided by

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.960
the acceleration of gravity
times 2 would tell you exactly

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.500
how long you would
be in the air.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.420
How long it takes to go up all
the way, become stationery,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.530
and then fall back down
to the ground.
