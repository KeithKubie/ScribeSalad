00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.520
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.830
In the video today, we're looking at why July
4th was ultimately chosen as Independence

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.530
Day in the United States.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.789
While it is often said that the Declaration
of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.189
this isn't actually correct.

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.060
In fact, nobody signed it on the 4th.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.079
This is contradictory to Thomas Jefferson’s,
John Adams’, and Benjamin Franklin’s account

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.079
of events.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.560
On top of their accounts, the public congressional
record of events back their story.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.659
So how do we know it didn't happen this way?

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.270
To begin with, the Secret Journals of Congress
that were eventually made public in 1821 paint

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.649
a different story.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.410
They contain an entry stating, on August 2nd:
“The declaration of independence being engrossed

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.179
&amp; compared at the table was signed by the
Members.”

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.170
Now if this was the only evidence, one might
lean towards a typo in the journal and believing

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.429
the aforementioned three individuals and public
congressional record.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.239
However, one of the other signers of the declaration,
Thomas McKean, denied the July 4th signing

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.649
date and backed it up by illustrating a glaring
flaw in Jefferson’s, Adams’, and Franklin’s

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.240
argument- namely, that most of the signers
were not members of congress on July 4th and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.380
thus wouldn’t have been there to sign it.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.600
As McKean said in 1796: “No person signed
it on that day nor for many days after."

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.780
Further evidence comes from the interesting
fact that the parchment version of the Declaration

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.100
of Independence that is on display and kept
in the United States National Archives wasn’t

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.590
actually written until July 19th; this being
a copy of the approved text that was announced

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.040
to the world on July 4th, with about 150-200
copies being made on paper and distributed

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.450
on that date (26 of which are still around
today, thus pre-dating what is now generally

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.740
thought of by most as the “original”).

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.490
This little tidbit also came from the Secret
Journals of Congress which has an entry on

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.050
July 19th stating: “Resolved that the Declaration
passed on the 4th be fairly engrossed on parchment

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.060
with the title and stile of 'The unanimous
declaration of the thirteen united states

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.120
of America' &amp; that the same when engrossed
be signed by every member of Congress.”

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.120
So, in the end, this signed document probably
would have been copied by Timothy Matlack,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.120
Jefferson’s clerk, rather than penned by
Jefferson himself, and certainly couldn’t

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120
have been signed on July 4th.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.869
It's also interesting to note that John Adams
thought that July 2nd, not July 4th, would

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.380
be ultimately celebrated in the United States
as Independence Day.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.769
On July 3, 1776, in a letter to his wife,
Abigail, Adams noted:

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.570
"The second day of July, 1776, will be the
most memorable epoch in the history of America.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.340
I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated
by succeeding generations as the great anniversary

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.340
festival.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.870
It ought to be commemorated as the day of
deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.129
God Almighty.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.319
It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade,
with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires,

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.590
and illuminations, from one end of this continent
to the other, from this time forward forever

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.590
more."

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.340
So why did he think July 2nd would be Independence
Day and how did July 4th end up getting the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.500
nod instead?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.310
Because July 2nd is when the Second Continental
Congress voted to approved a resolution of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.310
independence.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.720
Although nobody voted on or signed the Declaration
of Independence on July 4th, that was the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.349
date the Declaration was announced to the
world, and why it was ultimately chosen as

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.450
Independence Day.
