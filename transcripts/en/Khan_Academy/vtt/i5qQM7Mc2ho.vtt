00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.085
- [Instructor] In this video
we are going to talk about

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:05.359
one of the most important
US Supreme Court cases

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.203
that has helped determined
the balance of power

00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:11.154
between the federal
government and the states.

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:13.989
And that's McCulloch versus Maryland.

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:18.402
So the year is 1816, we're
after the War of 1812.

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.233
Wars are expensive.

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.666
The United States, the federal government,

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.336
wants to create the Second
Bank of the United States.

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:27.244
The charter for the First
Bank of the United States

00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:30.415
had ended a few years ago
and had not been extended.

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:32.281
And the reason why a bank is useful

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.149
for a federal government,
a bank can be a place

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.161
to store taxes that are
collected from people.

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.842
It could be a place to issue
debts, to issue bank notes.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.076
Think paper currency.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.750
And so the Second Bank of
the United States is created.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.446
It is headquartered in Philadelphia
right over here in 1816

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:54.613
and then in 1817 they open
up a branch in Baltimore

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:58.579
right over there and this is where things

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.185
get a little bit messy
because it turns out

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:04.583
that the Maryland legislature,
Baltimore is in Maryland

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:08.287
decides to pass a law to tax any banks

00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:11.149
that have charters from
outside of Maryland.

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.544
Well, it turns out that the branch

00:01:12.544 --> 00:01:14.866
of the Second Bank of the United States

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.169
was the only bank in Maryland

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:19.598
that was chartered outside of Maryland

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:24.114
and the law itself seems to
be targeted at that bank.

00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:27.364
The law taxes notes issued by the bank.

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:31.003
The head of that branch
of the Baltimore branch

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:34.578
of the Second Bank of the
United States James McCulloch,

00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:36.839
he refuses to pay this tax.

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:39.307
He says hey, we are a
federally chartered bank.

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:42.190
You have no right to tax us.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.370
Eventually it gets appealed all the way

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.336
to the United States Supreme Court.

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:51.422
And there are two main questions
that need to be answered.

00:01:51.422 --> 00:01:54.126
The first is, does the federal government

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:56.831
have the power to charter a national bank?

00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:59.463
Where is that in the
United States Constitution?

00:01:59.463 --> 00:02:01.242
By the time it got to the Supreme Court,

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:03.507
Maryland was arguing that, hey,

00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:05.090
we don't even think that
the federal government

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.712
has the right to charter a bank.

00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:10.557
We don't see that enumerated
in the Constitution

00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:12.402
and then if the bank can exist,

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:15.069
can a state tax a national bank?

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:17.542
The US Supreme Court at this time

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:20.432
is headed by Chief Justice John Marshall,

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.821
who was a federalist, and as we will see,

00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:26.940
they vote strongly in favor
of the federal government.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.332
They decide unanimously that yes,

00:02:29.332 --> 00:02:32.420
the federal government does
have the power to charter a bank

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.831
and they say no, a state
actually cannot tax it.

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:39.230
And so, what do they
cite in the Constitution

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.613
to back up that decision?

00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:43.926
So this right over here is
an excerpt of article one,

00:02:43.926 --> 00:02:46.154
section eight of the
United States Constitution.

00:02:46.154 --> 00:02:47.647
We've covered it in other videos

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:50.103
when we talk about enumerated powers

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.744
and it lists a bunch of powers.

00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:52.901
Enumerated just means things

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:54.651
that are very explicitly defined.

00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:56.593
They've been listed,
they've been enumerated.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:59.005
Congress has the power to lay
and collect taxes, duties,

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:00.703
imposts and excises, borrow money,

00:03:00.703 --> 00:03:02.683
regulate commerce with foreign nations

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.635
among the several states
with the Indian tribes.

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:07.845
And it goes on and on and
on, but the 18th clause here

00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:08.918
is really interesting.

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:11.338
It's known as the
necessary and proper clause

00:03:11.338 --> 00:03:13.069
and we cover it in several other videos,

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.324
but it says that Congress has the power

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:19.387
to make all laws which shall
be necessary and proper

00:03:19.387 --> 00:03:22.889
for carrying into execution
the foregoing powers.

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.662
And so John Marshall the
chief justice in his decision

00:03:26.662 --> 00:03:30.851
says look, even though the
power to create a national bank,

00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.618
to charter a national bank,
even though it isn't enumerated

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:35.795
here in article one section eight,

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:40.128
this clause 18, this
necessary and proper clause

00:03:40.128 --> 00:03:42.250
says that look, the federal government

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.957
also can make laws that allow it,

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:47.864
that are necessary and proper
for doing the other things.

00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:50.288
For example, borrowing
money or issuing currency

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:51.743
and so they're saying that look,

00:03:51.743 --> 00:03:54.418
this bank is a means to an end.

00:03:54.418 --> 00:03:57.127
And because it is a means
to an enumerated end,

00:03:57.127 --> 00:04:00.201
they're saying that there
is an implied power here.

00:04:00.201 --> 00:04:02.624
And so the whole notion of implied powers

00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:04.052
that we talk about in other videos,

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:07.085
it really strongly
stems from this decision

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:09.817
on McCulloch versus Maryland.

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:12.046
Now, Maryland argued a narrow reading

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:14.069
of this necessary and proper clause.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.789
They're like, well is a
bank absolutely necessary?

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.737
Couldn't you do some of these other things

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:20.357
without having a bank?

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:22.859
And the Supreme Court
said, well, no, no, no,

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:24.679
this isn't to limit
the federal government,

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:27.835
that this whole section is
all about enumerating powers

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:30.546
to say what the federal government can do,

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:32.339
not what they can't do,

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.544
so does not have to be
absolutely necessary.

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.811
And on the second question of, well,

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.157
if this bank's going
to exist can the state

00:04:40.157 --> 00:04:43.329
where the branch is, can the state tax it?

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:46.505
That's where what's known
as the Supremacy Clause

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:48.247
came in to effect.

00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:51.114
This right over here is an excerpt.

00:04:51.114 --> 00:04:53.354
Article six, clause two, this Constitution

00:04:53.354 --> 00:04:55.138
and the laws of the United States

00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:58.269
which shall be made in pursuance thereof;

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:01.387
and all treaties made,
or which shall be made

00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:03.831
under the authority of the United States,

00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:08.578
the federal government, shall
be the supreme law of the land

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:12.745
and the judges in every
state shall be bound thereby.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.866
And so the argument that
the justice has made is,

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:18.606
well if you don't like something,

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:21.817
if we allow the states to
tax this national bank,

00:05:21.817 --> 00:05:25.073
well, the power to tax
is the power to destroy,

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:29.460
then you could tax it so much
that it can't even operate.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.801
But this is saying that the authority

00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:33.757
of the federal government,
of the United States,

00:05:33.757 --> 00:05:36.151
shall be the supreme law of the land.

00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:39.505
So a state can't get in the
way of the federal government

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.834
and to hear it in John
Marshall's own words,

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:44.875
he wrote a very long decision

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:47.279
about McCulloch versus Maryland,

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.677
but here is just a few excerpts

00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:50.840
that speak to each of these points.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.020
So first of all, implied powers.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.420
Let the end be legitimate,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.131
let it be within the
scope of the Constitution,

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:03.812
and all means which are appropriate,

00:06:03.812 --> 00:06:06.132
which are plainly adapted to that end,

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:07.606
which are not prohibited,

00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:10.529
but consist with the letter
and spirit of the Constitution

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.647
are constitutional, this is a big deal.

00:06:13.647 --> 00:06:16.389
He's saying look, if the end is legitimate

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.754
and if the means is not prohibited.

00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:20.128
So nowhere in the Constitution does it say

00:06:20.128 --> 00:06:22.808
that the federal government
can't start a national bank,

00:06:22.808 --> 00:06:25.556
so it's not prohibited,
and if the end is to do

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:28.716
some of the enumerated
powers that are legitimate,

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:30.975
then it is constitutional.

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:34.735
So this is really a strong
wording around implied powers

00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:36.764
and using the necessary and proper clause

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:38.370
as the backing for it.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.642
And in terms of supremacy,
it is of the very essence

00:06:42.642 --> 00:06:46.809
of supremacy to remove all
obstacles to its action

00:06:47.677 --> 00:06:51.139
within its own sphere, and
so to modify every power

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.602
vested in subordinate governments,

00:06:53.602 --> 00:06:57.537
as to exempt its own operations
from their influence.

00:06:57.537 --> 00:06:59.496
So it's saying, hey,
we're not going to allow

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:01.978
subordinate governments, the
states, to get in the way.

00:07:01.978 --> 00:07:04.342
That's the essence of
the Supremacy Clause.

00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:07.703
This effect need not be stated in terms.

00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:10.906
It is so involved in the
declaration of supremacy,

00:07:10.906 --> 00:07:13.171
so necessarily implied in it,

00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:17.188
that the expression of it
could not make it more certain.

00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:19.679
So once again, John
Marshall clearly saying

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:23.254
the Supremacy Clause, in order
for it to make any sense,

00:07:23.254 --> 00:07:26.252
the subordinate governments, the states,

00:07:26.252 --> 00:07:28.117
should not be able to interfere

00:07:28.117 --> 00:07:31.700
with the operations of
the federal government.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.785
If their ends are legitimate,
it's constitutional

00:07:34.785 --> 00:07:37.007
and the states cannot get in the way.

00:07:37.007 --> 00:07:40.419
In the example of McCulloch
versus Maryland by taxing.

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:42.385
So as you can imagine, this decision

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:45.031
clarified the shifting of a lot of power

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.994
towards the federal government
and away from the states.
