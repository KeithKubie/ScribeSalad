00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:02.033
Let's see what it's like to add

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:04.500
multi-digit numbers in binary.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.100
So let's say I had the
number one, zero, one, one.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.100
And to that I wanted to add
the number one, one, one.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.500
What is that going to be?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.300
And I encourage you to pause this video,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.100
and try to work through it on your own.

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:22.300
So the key here is this is
just a standard algorithm,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.433
and we're adding numbers.

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:24.767
But remind yourself you're only restricted

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:26.833
to the zero and one digits.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:28.433
So let's do that.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.167
So we have one plus one.

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:31.700
Well, you might say that's two

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.500
but you can't write a two here.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.034
We can only write a zero or a one.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.540
And we have to remind ourselves that two

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:41.633
in decimal is represented
as one zero in binary.

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.233
It's one two and zero ones.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:49.367
So you write the zero,
zero ones, and one two.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.301
You essentially carry the one.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.600
And now you have one plus one, plus one.

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.233
Well that's going to be three,

00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:58.566
but you can't write three.

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:03.566
Once again, three in decimal
is equal to one one in binary.

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:09.666
It's one two, plus, one one is three.

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:12.033
And so you just have to realize that.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.900
So one plus one plus one is three,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.633
which in binary is one one.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:20.233
So you write one in the ones
place and then you carry it.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:23.933
And then we want to add what
we're doing in the fours place.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.300
And over here, I have a one and a one,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.967
which is going to be two

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:30.566
which we already know we
represent as one zero.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.834
So you write zero here and
then you carry the one.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.566
And then once again, one and one is two.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.966
Which is one zero in
binary, and we're done.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.633
We just added these numbers.

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:42.900
Now, you might be saying,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.600
"Hey, let me make sure
this actually makes sense."

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.636
And we can verify that
this actually makes sense

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:50.700
by thinking about what these numbers are.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.966
Remember, this is going to be
this number right over here.

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:56.033
If we wanted to think of it in decimal.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.233
It's going to be one plus two,

00:01:59.356 --> 00:02:01.500
plus not four but plus eight.

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:06.233
So this is 11 if we were
to write it in decimal.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:11.233
And this right over here
is one plus two plus four.

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:18.900
Which is equal to seven if we
were to write it in decimal.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.633
And now what's this right over here?

00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:23.300
This is equal to one two.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.866
This is four, eight, 16.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.567
So and this right over here.

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.900
So we have one 16 plus one two.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.900
Is going to be equal to 18
if we write it in decimal.

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:41.800
And we see that, 11 plus
seven is indeed equal to 18.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.533
11 plus seven is indeed equal to 18.
