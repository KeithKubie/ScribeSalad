00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.620
This right here is a
picture of Rene Descartes.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.400
Once again, one
of the great minds

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.240
in both math and philosophy.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.490
And I think you're seeing
a little bit of a trend

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.520
here, that the great
philosophers were also

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.639
great mathematicians
and vice versa.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.680
And he was somewhat of a
contemporary of Galileo.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.270
He was 32 years younger,
although he died shortly

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.140
after Galileo died.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.900
This guy died at a
much younger age.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.960
Galileo was well into his 70s.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.900
Descartes died at what
is only 54 years old.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.349
And he's probably most known in
popular culture for this quote

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.890
right over here, a
very philosophical

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.454
quote. "I think,
therefore I am."

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:37.870
But I also wanted to throw in,
and this isn't that related

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.570
to algebra, but I just thought
it was a really neat quote,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.032
probably his least famous
quote, this one right over here.

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:45.990
And I like it just because
it's very practical,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.610
and it makes you realize
that these great minds,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.210
these pillars of
philosophy and mathematics,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.320
at the end of the day, they
really were just human beings.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.160
And he said, "You
just keep pushing.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.410
You just keep pushing.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.740
I made every mistake
that could be made.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.490
But I just kept pushing."

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.400
Which I think is very,
very good life advice.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.431
Now, he did many things in
philosophy and mathematics.

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:09.930
But the reason why
I'm including him

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.570
here as we build our
foundations of algebra

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.630
is that he is the
individual most responsible

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.420
for a very strong connection
between algebra and geometry.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.460
So on the left over here, you
have the world of algebra,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.240
and we've discussed
it a little bit.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.230
You have equations
that deal with symbols,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.860
and these symbols
are essentially

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.730
they can take on values.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.290
So you could have something
like y is equal to 2x minus 1.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.030
This gives us a relationship
between whatever x is

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.720
and whatever y is.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.960
And we can even set up a table
here and pick values for x

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.090
and see what the
values of y would be.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.211
And I could just pick
random values for x,

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.460
and then figure out what y is.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.080
But I'll pick relatively
straightforward values

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.680
just so that the math
doesn't get too complicated.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.230
So for example, if
x is negative 2,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.110
then y is going to
be 2 times negative

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:11.770
2 minus 1, which is negative 4
minus 1, which is negative 5.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.130
If x is negative
1, then y is going

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.440
to be 2 times negative
1 minus 1, which

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.100
is equal to-- this is negative
2 minus 1, which is negative 3.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.880
If x is equal to 0, then y is
going to be 2 times 0 minus 1.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.710
2 times 0 is 0 minus
1 is just negative 1.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.494
I'll do a couple more.

00:02:37.494 --> 00:02:39.160
And I could have
picked any values here.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.020
I could have said,
well, what happens

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.603
if x is the negative
square root of 2,

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:47.014
or what happens if x is
negative 5/2, or positive 6/7?

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:48.430
But I'm just picking
these numbers

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.221
because it makes the
math a lot easier when

00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:52.110
I try to figure out
what y is going to be.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.610
But when x is 1, y is going
to be 2 times 1 minus 1.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.115
2 times 1 is 2 minus 1 is 1.

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:01.030
And I'll do one more.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.470
I'll do one more in a color
that I have not used yet.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.180
Let's see, this purple.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.560
If x is 2, then y is
going to be 2 times 2--

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.730
now our x is 2-- minus 1.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.200
So that is 4 minus
1 is equal to 3.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.990
So fair enough.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.440
I just kind of sampled
this relationship.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.080
I said, OK, this describes
the general relationship

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.415
between a variable
y and a variable x.

00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:26.540
And then I just made it a
little bit more concrete.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.150
I said, OK, well, then
for each of these values

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.550
of x, what would be the
corresponding value of y?

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.210
And what Descartes
realized is is

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.820
that you could visualize this.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.830
One, you could visualize
these individual points,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.130
but that could also
help you, in general,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.135
to visualize this relationship.

00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:46.510
And so what he
essentially did is

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.870
he bridged the worlds
of this kind of very

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.740
abstract, symbolic algebra
and that and geometry,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.290
which was concerned with
shapes and sizes and angles.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.667
So over here you have
the world of geometry.

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:05.250
And obviously, there are people
in history, maybe many people,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.370
who history may have forgotten
who might have dabbled in this.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.990
But before Descartes,
it's generally

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.644
viewed that geometry
was Euclidean geometry,

00:04:13.644 --> 00:04:15.810
and that's essentially the
geometry that you studied

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.490
in a geometry class in
eighth or ninth grade

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.910
or 10th grade in a traditional
high school curriculum.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.740
And that's the
geometry of studying

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.940
the relationships between
triangles and their angles,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.830
and the relationships between
circles and you have radii,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.822
and then you have triangles
inscribed in circles,

00:04:34.822 --> 00:04:35.530
and all the rest.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.896
And we go into some depth in
that in the geometry playlist.

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:40.270
But Descartes
said, well, I think

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.500
I can represent this visually
the same way that you could

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.400
with studying these
triangles and these circles.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.260
He said, well, if we
view a piece of paper,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.010
if we think about a
two-dimensional plane,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.635
you could view a
piece of paper as kind

00:04:53.635 --> 00:04:55.685
of a section of a
two-dimensional plane.

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:57.560
And we call it two
dimensions because there's

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.270
two directions that
you could go in.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.780
There's the up/down direction.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.090
That's one direction.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.450
So let me draw that.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.210
I'll do it in blue because we're
starting to visualize things,

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.050
so I'll do it in
the geometry color.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.630
So you have the
up/down direction.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.990
And you have the
left/right direction.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.149
That's why it's called
a two-dimensional plane.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.690
If we're dealing in
three dimensions,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.870
you would have an
in/out dimension.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.140
And it's very easy to do
two dimensions on the screen

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.230
because the screen
is two dimensional.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.920
And he, says, well, you know,
there are two variables here,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.520
and they have this relationship.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.900
So why don't I associate
each of these variables

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.380
with one of these
dimensions over here?

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.975
And by convention, let's make
the y variable, which is really

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:39.990
the dependent variable--
the way we did it,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.056
it depends on what x is-- let's
put that on the vertical axis.

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:44.680
And let's put our
independent variable,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.490
the one where I just
randomly picked values for it

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.990
to see what y
would become, let's

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.290
put that on the horizontal axis.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.190
And it actually
was Descartes who

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.650
came up with the convention of
using x's and y's, and we'll

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.320
see later z's, in
algebra so extensively

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.480
as unknown variables
or the variables

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.750
that you're manipulating.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.791
But he says, well, if we
think about it this way,

00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:07.330
if we number these
dimensions-- so let's

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.270
say that in the x direction,
let's make this right over here

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.450
is negative 3.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.570
Let's make this negative 2.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.950
This is negative 1.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.260
This is 0.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.290
Now, I'm just numbering
the x direction,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.810
the left/right direction.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.450
Now this is positive 1.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.830
This is positive 2.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.660
This is positive 3.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.930
And we could do the
same in the y direction.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.200
So let's see, so this could be,
let's say this is negative 5,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.560
negative 4, negative
3, negative-- actually,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.010
let me do it a little
bit neater than that.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.070
Let me clean this
up a little bit.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.369
So let me erase this
and extend this down

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:48.660
a little bit so I can go all
the way down to negative 5

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.180
without making it
look too messy.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.240
So let's go all
the way down here.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.240
And so we can number it.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.580
This is 1.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.650
This is 2.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.770
This is 3.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.872
And then this could be
negative 1, negative 2.

00:07:00.872 --> 00:07:02.330
And these are all
just conventions.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.660
It could have been
labeled the other way.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.909
We could've decided to put
the x there and the y there

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.500
and make this the
positive direction

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.870
and make this the
negative direction.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.661
But this is just the
convention that people

00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:12.300
adopted starting with Descartes.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.740
Negative 2, negative 3,
negative 4, and negative 5.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.760
And he says, well, I
think I can associate

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.110
each of these pairs of values
with a point in two dimensions.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.280
I can take the x-coordinate, I
can take the x value right over

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.090
here, and I say, OK,
that's a negative 2.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.480
That would be right over there
along the left/right direction.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.370
I'm going to the left
because it's negative.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.420
And that's associated
with negative 5

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.040
in the vertical direction.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.550
So I say the y
value is negative 5,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.350
and so if I go 2 to
the left and 5 down,

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.780
I get to this point
right over there.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.090
So he says, these two values,
negative 2 and negative 5,

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.270
I can associate it with
this point in this plane

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.630
right over here, in this
two-dimensional plane.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.640
So I'll say that point has
the coordinates, tells me

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.700
where to find that point,
negative 2, negative 5.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.360
And these coordinates are
called Cartesian coordinates,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.677
named for Rene
Descartes because he's

00:08:11.677 --> 00:08:13.010
the guy that came up with these.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.260
He's associating, all of a
sudden, these relationships

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.060
with points on a
coordinate plane.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.440
And then he said, well,
OK, let's do another one.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.050
There's this other
relationship, where

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.385
I have when x is
equal to negative 1,

00:08:25.385 --> 00:08:27.160
y is equal to negative 3.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.692
So x is negative
1, y is negative 3.

00:08:29.692 --> 00:08:31.150
That's that point
right over there.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.730
And the convention
is, once again,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.146
when you list the
coordinates, you

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:36.169
list the x-coordinate,
then the y-coordinate.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.440
And that's just what
people decided to do.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.900
Negative 1, negative
3, that would

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.039
be that point right over there.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.040
And then you have the point
when x is 0, y is negative 1.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.630
When x is 0 right
over here, which

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.630
means I don't go to the left
or the right, y is negative 1,

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.847
which means I go 1 down.

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:53.430
So that's that point
right over there,

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.000
0, negative 1, right over there.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.620
And I could keep doing this.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.430
When x is 1, y is 1.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.595
When x is 2, y is 3.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.430
Actually, let me do it in
that same purple color.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.220
When x is 2, y is 3, 2 comma 3.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.390
And then this one right over
here in orange was 1 comma 1.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.820
And this is neat by itself.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.131
I essentially just
sampled possible x's.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:25.630
But what he realized
is, not only do

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.920
you sample these possible
x's, but if you just

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.150
kept sampling x's, if you
tried sampling all the x's

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.630
in between, you would actually
end up plotting out a line.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.840
So if you were to
do every possible x,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.130
you would end up getting a
line that looks something

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:44.560
like that right over there.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.450
And any relation, if you
pick any x and find any y,

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.800
it really represents
a point on this line.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.380
Or another way to think about
it, any point on this line

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.781
represents a solution to this
equation right over here.

00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:58.530
So if you have this
point right over here,

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.090
which looks like it's about
x is 1 and 1/2, y is 2.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.400
So me write that, 1.5 comma 2.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.470
That is a solution
to this equation.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.360
When x is 1.5, 2 times
1.5 is 3 minus 1 is 2.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.980
That is right over there.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.810
So all of a sudden,
he was able to bridge

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:22.140
this gap or this relationship
between algebra and geometry.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.690
We can now visualize
all of the x and y pairs

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.140
that satisfy this
equation right over here.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.587
And so he is responsible
for making this bridge,

00:10:35.587 --> 00:10:37.170
and that's why the
coordinates that we

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.170
use to specify these points are
called Cartesian coordinates.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.770
And as we'll see, the first
type of equations we will study

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.000
are equations of
this form over here.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.010
And in a traditional
algebra curriculum,

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.370
they're called linear equations.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.540
And you might be saying,
well, OK, this is an equation.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.100
I see that this
is equal to that.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.605
But what's so linear about them?

00:11:00.605 --> 00:11:02.110
What makes them
look like a line?

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.720
And to realize why
they are linear,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.070
you have to make this jump
that Rene Descartes made,

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.480
because if you were to plot
this using Cartesian coordinates

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.622
on a Euclidean plane,
you will get a line.

00:11:13.622 --> 00:11:15.330
And in the future,
we'll see that there's

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.746
other types of equations where
you won't get a line, where

00:11:17.746 --> 00:11:21.870
you'll get a curve or something
kind of crazy or funky.
