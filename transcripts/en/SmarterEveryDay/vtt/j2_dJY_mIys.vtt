00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.880
- It is Laminar Flow day
and you know this about me,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.240
I love Laminar Flow.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.010
There's a cool video on Smarter Every Day

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.450
that talks about how Laminar Flow works

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.020
but we're doing what I call
today, Ultra Laminar Flow!

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.660
It's not really called
that, I just made this sign

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.730
to try to make it a thing.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.860
But, check this out!

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.630
We're gonna look at something
called Taylor-Couette Flow.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.940
My man here, Maurice Couette, French guy.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.200
He came up with a device,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.300
so you could quantify the viscosity

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.480
of a fluid, by a cylinder rotating

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.250
on the inside of another
cylinder, it's really cool work.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
My dude here, Sir Taylor, he
expanded on Couette's work

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.690
and he measured stability
inside Couette Flow.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.600
So you combine the two, you
get Taylor-Couette Flow.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.220
What we're gonna look
at today, if it works,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.780
I really want this to work,
I've been wanting to do

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.580
this experiment for a long
time, we're gonna look at

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.580
ultra low Reynolds Number's
Flow, and hopefully, hopefully,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.770
we get reversible flow.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.603
Let's do this.

00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:55.750
First things first, we've
gotta fill up the tank.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.800
This is corn syrup, which
is a very viscous fluid.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.450
Here we go, it's gonna take quite a while,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.760
this is a lot of corn syrup.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.330
Liquid rope coiling effect.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.010
We should revisit that.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.950
That's a topic for another video.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.810
Okay, here's the magic
of Taylor-Couette Flow.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.930
You have something called a
no slip boundary condition.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.500
So on this inner cylinder here,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.120
the corn syrup wants to stick to it,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.320
and on the outer cylinder,
it also wants to stick there.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.190
So, if I'm rotating that inner cylinder,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.360
what's happening is it will
try to move along with it.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.240
So if we were to draw a
line across the gap there

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.600
and we were to rotate it,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.310
the inner cylinder would pull
(bright guitar music)

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.010
along the inner corn syrup,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.880
and the outer corn syrup would stay there.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.130
And so what would happen
is, you would create

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.580
this spiral pattern.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.900
In fact, if you look down through there,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.850
you can kinda see it
happening in the clear fluid.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.870
So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna put

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.940
this colored corn syrup in there,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.260
and because we have so such
a low Reynolds Number here,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.790
that's Laminar Flow, and it
should, should, be reversible.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.620
Okay, so as I put this color in here,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.920
I wanna recommend something.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.650
What you're about to see
is absolutely incredible

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.610
and you're only gonna get
to unwrap this present once.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.770
So if you would, please trust me

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.990
and don't fast forward this video.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.750
In order to fully appreciate
what you're about to see,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.170
you need to watch it unfold in real time.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.080
Okay, here we go.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.140
We're gonna go for seven rotations,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.130
everything I've seen on
the internet does five.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.393
And, go.

00:02:27.824 --> 00:02:31.403
So you should see the
spiral start to happen.

00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:34.570
(bright guitar music)

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.713
One.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.583
Two.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.083
I see the spirals.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.283
Three.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.560
Is your heart pounding?

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.880
- [Trent] That is amazing.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.870
- Can you see the spirals in there?

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.703
- [Trent] Yeah.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.343
Four, it's like making
candy cane lookin' things.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.880
I don't think it's linear.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.340
Like, I think the gradient of the flow

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.720
across the entire thing.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.290
- [Trent] Dude, that is beautiful man.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.293
- Is this six?

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.743
- I think it's seven.
- I think it's six,

00:03:47.743 --> 00:03:49.310
I don't know. (laughs)

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.543
Got so excited!

00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:52.953
Oh dude.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.150
Look at that.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.140
It's like a marble.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.973
Can you see it?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.800
Focus further down in there, seven!

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.853
Okay, here we go.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.630
Seven, it looks like it's
completely just all mixed up.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.010
Oh man, it looks like you could never

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.843
get that back together.

00:04:22.843 --> 00:04:23.676
Okay, here we go.

00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:24.610
This should work.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.150
Reversible Flow.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.523
Ultra Laminar Flow, Taylor-Couette.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.740
We'll see what you got boys.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.573
You ready?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.090
Here we go.
(upbeat music)

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.781
I'm nervous it's not gonna work.

00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:37.963
Oh golly.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.910
(video fast forwarding tone)

00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:53.632
We should have four spirals after this.

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:55.840
(video fast forwarding tone)

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.723
I have lost count because
(laughs) I'm so excited.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.810
I think it's coming up on five.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.690
That's five.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.390
Get in there tight, it's
about to start getting crazy.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.173
We got two more.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.690
Come on baby, I'm so worried
that the red and the blue

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.470
are gonna mix because they were very,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.320
very close to each other, like radially.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.173
Six, okay.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.910
This should be it.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.143
Please work.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.423
I want you to work so bad.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.693
Is it working?

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.195
Did it work?

00:05:36.195 --> 00:05:37.945
- [Trent] I think so.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.893
- Yes!

00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:41.925
(laughs)

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.510
That's awesome.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.350
So it worked.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.810
Oh, you can see shear thinning in there.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.590
Okay, look, the, can I see that?

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.290
So the, the different
levels of, look at that.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.830
So if you get way down in there, look.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.910
You see all those striations, that happens

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.630
because of the way we were mixing it.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.600
It looks like different layers
sheared at different rates.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.340
So we had different
viscosities at different times

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.450
and so we get this striated pattern.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.410
But we did it!

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.720
My boys!

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.450
My boys, what ya got?

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.020
Taylor and Couette.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.910
Hi-five, yeah, yeah!

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.980
What do you do when you do the thing

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.950
you've always wanted to do?

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:21.970
I don't know what to do.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.790
Do we go the other way?

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.623
Let's do it.
(bright guitar music)

00:06:24.623 --> 00:06:28.100
Okay, so this is an awesome
fluid mechanics demonstration.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.040
But for me, there's a
metaphor to all this.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.160
Sometimes it feels like life is turbulent,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.710
like everything is jumbled
up and there's no way

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.920
you're ever gonna get things set straight.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.760
But I believe, if you
slowly and methodically

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.210
think about the way you got
yourself into the situation

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.050
and start thinking about how
to get out of that situation,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.320
and take slow, deliberate
steps, hopefully, hopefully,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.950
I know it's not possible for everyone,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.300
something that looks
like, is a complete mess

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.660
and it'll never be set
straight, hopefully, one day,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.470
you will actually be able
to get out of the situation.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.650
But, it requires patience
and deliberate thinking

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.250
to get it all straightened out.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.470
Anyway, I wanted to tell you about a book

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.510
that makes me think about
this principal for life.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.350
I'll do that now.
(beep)

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.980
Okay, this episode of Smarter Every Day,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.650
was sponsored by Audible.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.827
As you know, Audible is a great
way to listen to audio books

00:07:21.827 --> 00:07:24.500
and I spend the bulk of my time on the go

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.558
and it is a way for me
to reclaim that time

00:07:26.558 --> 00:07:27.890
in order to learn.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.130
So you can get an audio book

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.280
by going to audible.com/smarter,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.060
or texting the word, Smarter, to 500-500.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.380
The book I wanna talk to you today about

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.090
is called the Sun Does
Shine, by Anthony Ray Hinton,

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.540
who was wrongly convicted of murder

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.990
and served on death row for decades.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.100
Anthony Ray Hinton is an amazing writer

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.940
and it's told from his perspective

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.820
from many years living on death row.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.393
This has changed the
way I look at the world

00:07:50.393 --> 00:07:52.740
and I want you to listen to this book.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.924
I gotta go to the airport.

00:07:53.924 --> 00:07:56.174
(thudding)

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:00.520
All right, let's go.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.700
My wife books my seats.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.463
Thank you very much wife.

00:08:03.463 --> 00:08:06.213
(engine roaring)

00:08:10.358 --> 00:08:11.710
- [Anthony Ray Hinton]
If I could put my heart

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.060
in the judges heart, he
would know I didn't do it.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.710
- So one thing I really like about the app

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.840
is you can click this little
Clip button right here

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.550
and you can add a note in the book

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.380
and you can go back and listen to it later

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.162
and you can bring back all
those thoughts and memories

00:08:24.162 --> 00:08:27.000
and think more deeply
about the subject at hand.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.210
It's a really cool feature.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.960
(engine humming)

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.650
You can get a free audio book
and two Audible originals

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.660
by going to audible.com/smarter

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.320
or texting the word, Smarter, to 500-500.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.030
You're gonna enjoy audio books.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.900
I get smarter when I travel.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.580
This is time that feels
that I'm kinda wasting it,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.450
but when you're listening to
audio books, you get smarter.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.980
So, again, text Smarter to 500-500

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.007

00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:57.120
If you wanna see just the tripod shot,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.880
and that being sped up,
go check out that video

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.830
I'm putting over on the second channel.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.790
I think you'll like that.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.720
Thank you if you decided to
actually watch this video

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.200
and learn about these principals with me,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.930
instead of just watching
a GIF on the internet

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.420
and not, like, diving into the
science of what's going on.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.330
So thank you.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.340
If you're interested in
subscribing to Smarter Every Day,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.380
like if you feel like this
kinda content earns it,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.910
then thanks, that'd be awesome.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.660
Feel free to ring the bell,
if that's what you're into.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.330
If you're not into that, no big deal,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.710
but I'm just happy that you're here.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.160
Thanks for doing this with me.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.993
Let's do it one more time, and,

00:09:27.819 --> 00:09:30.253
boom, (laughs) that's awesome.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.523
Dude, that works well!
