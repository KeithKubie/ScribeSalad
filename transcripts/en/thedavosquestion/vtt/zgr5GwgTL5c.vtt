William: Hi Corey, I'm Bill Brody I'm the
president of the John Hopkins University in

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.110
Baltimore Maryland in the United States
I want to thank you for your very moving video

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.900
showing the pictures of wanton destruction
from war and various forms of internal conflict.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.140
I think the one thing that I would like to
convince our leaders of around the world is

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.560
to learn the power of non-violent resistance
like Martin Luther King in the United States

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.270
did so profoundly.
Or Muhatma Ghandi did in India

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.130
If we could convince our leaders that whenever
they use force there's countervailing force

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.080
and wanton destruction of innocent civilians
and bystanders.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.120
That war is never the way to go.
And we need to push more towards peaceful

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.160
resistance.
Thank you so much for your video and good

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.660
luck and let's work together on this.
