00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.710
&gt;&gt;Lealea Jones responds to the Davos Question

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.390
Hi, I'm Lealea Jones and I'm with everyone
on this table but particularly Jan. Coming

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.269
from Hackney, I think that it would be an
amazing thing for the world leaders to go,

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.869
not only to Hackney, but somewhere that is
less fortunate and really see the lives of

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.679
people and what they're going through, you
know. I've been brought up in a place, like,

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.560
well in Hackney, where a lot of youths right
now are dying, babies, children are killing

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.449
children. It's ridiculous and I think they
need to see that. They need to be there and

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.579
be able to see and see what they're going
through and the reasons why they're doing

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.989
it and put that support into it. They need
to know and to understand why, why are they

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.809
doing this and I think that's the only way
they'll really be able to gain that knowledge

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.859
is to go and experience it for themselves.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:48.859
&gt;&gt;Jan

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:49.859
Stop the violence.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:50.859
&gt;&gt;Lealea Jones

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.460
Stop the violence. Exactly, but not just in
Hackney, but everywhere in the world that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.450
is affected by that sort of problem.
