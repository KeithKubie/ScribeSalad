00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.170
The sun is hot.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.950
Well, YEAH, ‘cuz it’s the sun!

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.370
But its atmosphere is too hot.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.410
What’s going on?

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.710
Hello!

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.690
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News and today I want to take you on a journey

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.470
deep into the sun’s atmosphere.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.850
As you’d expect the solar atmosphere or
the “solar corona” is hot.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.330
But it’s TOO hot -- a problem that solar
physicists have been trying to solve for decades.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.859
In fact, my own solar physics PhD thesis was
based on this very same solar conundrum.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.850
From observations we know that the sun’s
outer layer, the photosphere, is around 6,000

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.749
degrees Kelvin or Celsius.

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.940
We also know that the core of the sun is a
nuclear furnace bubbling away at tens of MILLIONS

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.940
of degrees.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.410
So, you’d expect the sun’s corona to be
cooler than the photosphere since it’s further

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.659
away from the core, right?

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:46.659
Wrong.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.519
Just above the photosphere is the chromosphere
which extends into the lower corona and something

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:51.699
weird happens.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.179
The temperature of coronal plasma skyrockets
to millions of degrees.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.569
It just makes no logical sense and seems to
violate some hefty laws of thermodynamics!

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.050
If you put your hand next to a hot lightbulb,
you wouldn’t expect that, as you move your

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.030
hand away from the bulb, that the air would
get HOTTER.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.119
But with the sun, as you leave the photosphere
and enter the corona, that’s EXACTLY what

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.060
happens, it gets hotter, not cooler.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.060
So what’s going on?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.219
And perhaps most importantly: why should we
care?

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.420
The first theory is that magnetic waves travel
from the sun’s interior, ripple through

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.689
the corona like vibrations along a guitar
string and resonate with the solar plasma.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.820
We’ve observed these waves in the corona
and we have a pretty good idea that they have

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.899
a significant heating effect, but they’re
not the whole story.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.759
Another heating mechanism seems to be down
to countless explosions in the corona, known

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.140
as “nanoflares”.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.859
Although they are tiny when compared with
solar flares like the X-class flare that caused

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.159
a radio blackout on Earth earlier this month,
nanoflares certainly aren’t insignificant.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.790
Each nanoflare is thought to explode with
the energy of 240 megatons of TNT, which is

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.039
equivalent to 10,000 nuclear weapons going
off at once!

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.650
Regardless of how active the sun is, countless
millions of these eruptions are thought to

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.479
be crackling in the corona all the time, undoubtedly
cooking the sun’s atmosphere.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.569
But how much cooking is going on?

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.259
Researchers have now turned NASA’s NuSTAR
X-ray observatory for help.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.590
NuSTAR is designed to look for the highest-energy
X-rays generated in the furthest-most reaches

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.040
of the universe by black holes and other crazy
energetic phenomena.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.069
It just so happens that, by pure luck, NuSTAR
is also finely tuned to detect the X-ray signature

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.260
of nanoflares inside the sun’s corona.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.819
Early NuSTAR results have produced one of
the most beautiful images in modern astronomy

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.849
[[insert: http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia18906-nustarsun.jpg]],
proving that nanoflares crackle throughout

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:25.849
the corona.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.409
Only time will tell whether these “nano”
explosions have the oomph to bake the corona

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.720
to millions of degrees.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.730
But why does all of this matter?

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.989
Space weather is born deep inside the corona.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.540
Solar flares erupt and huge bubbles of magnetized
plasma -- called coronal mass ejections -- are

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.569
launched from this region.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.849
The more we understand the nature of the corona,
the better we can understand how the sun’s

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.090
most violent explosive events impact Earth.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.819
After all, solar storms are known to knock
out satellites, garble communications and

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.970
even knock out power grids, wouldn’t it
be nice to properly get to know where and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.510
why these eruptions are born?

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.130
