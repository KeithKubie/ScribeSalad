00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:13.261
The city has just opened its
one-of-a-kind FabergÃ© Egg Museum

00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:18.832
with a single egg displayed on each floor
of a 100-story building.

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:24.571
And the world's most notorious jewel thief
already has her eyes on the prize.

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:27.962
Because security is tight
and the eggs are so large,

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.762
she'll only get the chance to steal one

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:33.812
by dropping it out the window
into her waiting truck

00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:37.854
and repelling down 
before the police can arrive.

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:41.253
All eggs are identical in weight
and construction,

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:47.153
but each floor's egg is more rare 
and valuable than the one below it.

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:50.931
While the thief would naturally like
to take the priceless egg at the top,

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:54.992
she suspects it won't survive
a 100-story drop.

00:00:54.992 --> 00:01:00.472
Being pragmatic, she decides to settle
for the most expensive egg she can get.

00:01:00.472 --> 00:01:04.394
In the museum's gift shop, 
she finds two souvenir eggs,

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:07.973
perfect replicas 
that are perfectly worthless.

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:10.031
The plan is to test drop them

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:14.566
to find the highest floor 
at which an egg will survive the fall

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.914
without breaking.

00:01:15.914 --> 00:01:18.443
Of course, the experiment 
can only be repeated

00:01:18.443 --> 00:01:21.913
until both replica eggs are smashed.

00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:24.703
And throwing souvenirs out the window
too many times

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:28.224
is probably going to draw 
the guards' attention.

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:30.684
What's the least number of tries
it would take

00:01:30.684 --> 00:01:34.234
to guarantee that 
she find the right floor?

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:37.519
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:38.954
Answer in: 3

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:40.388
Answer in: 2

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:41.827
Answer in: 1

00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:44.558
If you're having trouble getting started
on the solution,

00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:47.394
it might help to start 
with a simpler scenario.

00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:50.663
Imagine our thief only 
had one replica egg.

00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:52.659
She'd have a single option:

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.175
To start by dropping it 
from the first floor

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:58.517
and go up one by one until it breaks.

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:00.956
Then she'd know that the floor below that

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:04.185
is the one she needs 
to target for the real heist.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:07.166
But this could require 
as many as 100 tries.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:12.065
Having an additional replica egg
gives the thief a better option.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:16.217
She can drop the first egg from different
floors at larger intervals

00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:21.125
in order to narrow down the range
where the critical floor can be found.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:22.787
And once the first breaks,

00:02:22.787 --> 00:02:28.047
she can use the second egg to explore
that interval floor by floor.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.509
Large floor intervals don't work great.

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:36.336
In the worst case scenario, they require
many tests with the second egg.

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:39.077
Smaller intervals work much better.

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:43.577
For example, if she starts by dropping
the first egg from every 10th floor,

00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:48.258
once it breaks, she'll only have to test
the nine floors below.

00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:54.538
That means it'll take at most
19 tries to find the right floor.

00:02:54.538 --> 00:02:56.824
But can she do even better?

00:02:56.824 --> 00:03:01.591
After all, there's no reason 
every interval has to be the same size.

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:03.960
Let's say there were only ten floors.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.175
The thief could test this whole building
with just four total throws

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:10.670
by dropping the first egg
at floors four,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.819
seven,

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.270
and nine.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.915
If it broke at floor four, it would take
up to three throws of the second egg

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:19.774
to find the exact floor.

00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:21.010
If it broke at seven,

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.962
it would take up to two throws
with the second egg.

00:03:23.962 --> 00:03:26.140
And if it broke at floor nine,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.980
it would take just one more
throw of the second egg.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.720
Intuitively, what we're trying to do here
is divide the building into sections

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.172
where no matter which floor is correct,

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:41.312
it takes up to the same number
of throws to find it.

00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:46.411
We want each interval to be one floor
smaller than the last.

00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:50.552
This equation can help us solve
for the first floor we need to start with

00:03:50.552 --> 00:03:53.607
in the 100 floor building.

00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:56.733
There are several ways 
to solve this equation,

00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:58.426
including trial and error.

00:03:58.426 --> 00:04:02.677
If we plug in two for n,
that equation would look like this.

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:05.233
If we plug in three, we get this.

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:08.963
So we can find the first n to pass 100

00:04:08.963 --> 00:04:12.462
by adding more terms 
until we get to our answer,

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:14.723
which is 14.

00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:17.694
And so our thief starts on the 14th floor,

00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:19.295
moving up to the 27th,

00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:20.424
the 39th,

00:04:20.424 --> 00:04:21.533
and so on,

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:24.572
for a maximum of 14 drops.

00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:29.094
Like the old saying goes, you can't 
pull a heist without breaking a few eggs.
