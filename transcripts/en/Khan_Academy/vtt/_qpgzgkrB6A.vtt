00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.760
- [Instructor] The CPI,
or Consumer Price Index,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.500
is used to measure the cost
of a typical basket of goods.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.910
The typical household in
the nation of Jacksonia

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.670
buys four loaves of bread,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.530
three pounds of cream cheese,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.750
and eight books each week.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.583
The prices of these goods in years 2015,

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:21.800
2016,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.900
and 2017 are given in the table below.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.560
And then they ask us some questions.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.300
Calculate the CPI in 2017,
using 2016 as the base year.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.730
Calculate the CPI in 2015,
using 2016 as the base year.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.320
Calculate the rate of inflation
between 2015 and 2016.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.920
Calculate the rate of inflation
between 2016 and 2017.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.020
And then describe a reason
why the inflation rate

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.730
between 2016 and 2017
might overstate the changes

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.980
in cost of living.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.960
So pause this video,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.040
and see if you can work through
it before I do it with you.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.440
All right, now let's
just do it step by step.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.930
So these first two letters,
they want us to calculate

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.610
the CPIs in 2017 and 2015,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.180
using 2016 as a base year.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.350
So the way I'm going to do it,

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.190
I'm going to set up a new
column here, which is cost of

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.720
the weekly basket,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.780
and they tell us how
much they buy each week,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.210
cost of weekly,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.740
weekly

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.270
basket.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.970
Let's see, in 2015,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.550
they buy four loaves of bread at $1 each.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.210
So it's going to be four times one,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.810
plus they buy three pounds of
cream cheese at $3 a pound,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.230
plus three times three,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.440
plus they buy eight books a week,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.270
these people like to read, and so,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.320
and each book in 2015 is
$10, so eight times 10,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.410
eight times 10.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.590
And this is going to be equal
to four times one is four,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.160
plus nine is 13,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.670
plus 80

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.430
is going to be $93.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.500
Now, that same basket,
that weekly basket in 2016,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.440
where we're buying four
loves of bread at $2 now,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.090
four times two,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.010
plus we're buying three pounds

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.400
of cream cheese at $6 a pound now,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.110
plus three times six,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.430
plus eight books per week at $20 per book,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.600
eight times 20.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.300
This is going to be equal to
eight plus 18, which is 26,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.520
plus 160

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.830
is 186.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.890
So this is going to be $186.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.430
And now we're going to do
the same thing in 2017.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.280
Each week, you're going to
get four loaves of bread.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.340
Now it's $3 per loaf,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.980
plus we're buying three pounds
of cream cheese per week,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.670
three, it's still at $6 per pound,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.720
plus eight books per week at $25 per book.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.270
And so this is going to be equal
to 12 plus 18, which is 30,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.830
plus 200, which is going to be $230.

00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:57.100
And now we can calculate the CPIs.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.470
So the CPI,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.330
it's typical that it's going
to be 100 in your base year,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.830
should be 100, so I could
just put that there.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.040
And for the other years, you
could say the basket cost,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.650
cost in year,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.800
divided by the cost in base year,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.960
cost in base year,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.793
year,

00:03:18.793 --> 00:03:20.460
times 100.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.100
So obviously, in 2016, that's
going to be the cost in 2016

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.760
divided by the cost in 2016 times 100.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.970
You'll get 100.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.740
But for 2015, it will be the
cost of the basket in 2015,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.300
which is $93,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.080
divided by the cost in
2016, which is $186,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.820
times 100.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.420
This one is actually
pretty straightforward.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.650
93 is half of 186, so this
is going to be equal to 50.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.240
And then in 2017,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.950
it's going to be the cost
of the basket in 2017

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.140
divided by

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.800
the cost of the basket in 2016,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.800
times 100, which is going to be equal to,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.300
I'm going to use the
calculator for this one.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.130
230

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.320
divided by 186

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.090
is equal to approximately 1.24.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.970
If we multiply that times 100,
we'll say it's approximately,

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.670
it is approximately

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.620
124.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.570
So calculate the CPI in 2017,
using 2016 as the base year.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.880
It would be 124.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.010
Calculate the CPI in 2015,
using 2016 as the base year.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.290
That is 50.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.290
Calculate the rate of inflation
between 2015 and 2016.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.520
So how much do prices grow

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.520
if we take this basket of
goods from 2015 to 2016?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.800
Well, you could look at your CPI.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.100
It went from 50 to 100, so prices doubled.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.030
And so if something is
double, it grew by 100%.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.220
And the rate of inflation
is the growth in prices.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.150
And so this is 100% inflation.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.240
Things doubled in price,
and you could see it here.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.970
Everything doubled in
price right over here.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.970
Calculate the rate of inflation
between 2016 and 2017.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.860
Well, if you start at
100 and you grow to 124,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.630
you have just grown by 24%.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.190
One way to think about it
is you multiply by 1.24,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.070
which is the same thing as growing by 24%.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.090
So that 24% growth is
the rate of inflation.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.190
Describe a reason why the inflation rate

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.080
between 2016 and 2017,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.660
so that's what we answered
right here in part d,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.850
might overstate changes
in the cost of living.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.180
And if you haven't answered
that part yet, I encourage you,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.030
given all that we've done,
try to pause the video,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.890
and try to think about that.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.130
So let's look at what
happened from 2016 to 2017.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.840
The price of a loaf of
bread increases by 50%.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.010
The price of a book increases
by $5 on a base of 20.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.490
That's an increase of 25%.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.970
But the price of cream cheese
does not change, plus 0%.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.020
It experiences no inflation
from 2016 to 2017.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.950
And so you could imagine a
scenario where if some goods,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.870
their prices increased a
lot while others don't,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.940
the basket of goods might change.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.100
People might buy less
bread and fewer books

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.110
and more cream cheese.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.500
And so we could say the typical

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.663
basket

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.433
might

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.050
get

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.060
more

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.963
weighted

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.200
to goods

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.150
that

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.400
had less inflation,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.490
had

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.050
less

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.980
inflation,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.240
example, in this case,
would be cream cheese,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.030
cream cheese

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.090
because

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.690
they

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.130
look relatively,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.190
relatively cheaper

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.680
to the goods that had more inflation.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.680
And if that happened, you would
have a lower actual growth,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.730
actual growth

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.530
in cost

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.370
of living.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.430
And this last question
really alludes to the fact

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.840
that the CPI isn't necessarily
a perfect indicator,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.400
that as different goods in the basket

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.990
have a price inflation at different rates,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.610
you could have a substitution effect

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.390
between the various goods.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.600
Now, in countries, they try to
rebalance the basket of goods

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.160
based on a perception of what is typical.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.170
But once again, that is not
necessarily going to be perfect.
