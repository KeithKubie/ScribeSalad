last one 400 bucks tail yeah it is a
 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:41.810
last one 400 bucks tail yeah it is a
tail that was expensive you should have

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820
tail that was expensive you should have
 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.130
tail that was expensive you should have
listened to the way I said this you've

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140
listened to the way I said this you've
 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.320
listened to the way I said this you've
done something fantastic for me you have

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330
done something fantastic for me you have
 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.449
done something fantastic for me you have
been really bad at creating random

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
been really bad at creating random
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.330
been really bad at creating random
sequences as I can see here the longest

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340
sequences as I can see here the longest
 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.770
sequences as I can see here the longest
run that you've had is right at the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780
run that you've had is right at the
 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.720
run that you've had is right at the
beginning it was three heads and then

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730
beginning it was three heads and then
 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.920
beginning it was three heads and then
you've pretty much alternated between

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930
you've pretty much alternated between
 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.440
you've pretty much alternated between
tails and heads tails and heads the most

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450
tails and heads tails and heads the most
 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.740
tails and heads tails and heads the most
run that you've had of tails or heads is

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
run that you've had of tails or heads is
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.930
run that you've had of tails or heads is
two in a row and you showed a pattern

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940
two in a row and you showed a pattern
 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.030
two in a row and you showed a pattern
there let's demonstrate something called

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
there let's demonstrate something called
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.100
there let's demonstrate something called
the gamblers fallacy the gamblers

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110
the gamblers fallacy the gamblers
 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.620
the gamblers fallacy the gamblers
fallacy is says that what's happened

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630
fallacy is says that what's happened
 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.890
fallacy is says that what's happened
before has an impact of what will happen

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900
before has an impact of what will happen
 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.280
before has an impact of what will happen
next if we were using a coin every time

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290
next if we were using a coin every time
 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.870
next if we were using a coin every time
you flip it there's an equal probability

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880
you flip it there's an equal probability
 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.789
you flip it there's an equal probability
that you've only get a head or a tail

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799
that you've only get a head or a tail
 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.800
that you've only get a head or a tail
now other people think well how does

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810
now other people think well how does
 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.690
now other people think well how does
that work because you know you're

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700
that work because you know you're
 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.330
that work because you know you're
flipping coins surely it's not very

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
flipping coins surely it's not very
 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.620
flipping coins surely it's not very
likely to have

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630
likely to have
 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.930
likely to have
you know five heads in a row six heads

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940
you know five heads in a row six heads
 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.850
you know five heads in a row six heads
in a row but this is the nature of

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860
in a row but this is the nature of
 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.310
in a row but this is the nature of
randomness randomness is very lumpy

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320
randomness randomness is very lumpy
 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.400
randomness randomness is very lumpy
right and lumpiness means that you do

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410
right and lumpiness means that you do
 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.490
right and lumpiness means that you do
get streaks which is part of the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500
get streaks which is part of the
 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.830

gamblers lexicon you know there's like

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840
gamblers lexicon you know there's like

we have a gambling streak so you
 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.700
we have a gambling streak so you
actually have not produced a very good

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710
actually have not produced a very good
 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.790
actually have not produced a very good

streaks in nine this this is actually

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900
streaks in nine this this is actually
 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.730
streaks in nine this this is actually
would be termed homogeneous because it's

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740
would be termed homogeneous because it's
 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.130
would be termed homogeneous because it's
actually quite mixed the number of ways

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140
actually quite mixed the number of ways
 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.200
actually quite mixed the number of ways
that we can have twenty heads or tails

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210
that we can have twenty heads or tails
 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.970
that we can have twenty heads or tails
the number of permutations we can have

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980
the number of permutations we can have
 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.430
the number of permutations we can have
is pretty big so we can basically get a

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440
is pretty big so we can basically get a
 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.650
is pretty big so we can basically get a
head or a tail in each position and

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660
head or a tail in each position and
 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.530
head or a tail in each position and
there's 20 positions so the total number

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540
there's 20 positions so the total number
 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.720
there's 20 positions so the total number
of permutations not combinations like

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730
of permutations not combinations like
 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.920
of permutations not combinations like
fixed order is 2 to the power 20 and

fixed order is 2 to the power 20 and
 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.840
fixed order is 2 to the power 20 and
that turns out to be 1,048,576 because

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850
that turns out to be 1,048,576 because
 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.260
that turns out to be 1,048,576 because
you've done a permutation which has a

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270
you've done a permutation which has a
 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.650
you've done a permutation which has a
maximum streak of either three heads or

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660
maximum streak of either three heads or
 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.900
maximum streak of either three heads or
three tails you only had one little tiny

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910
three tails you only had one little tiny
 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.010
three tails you only had one little tiny
streak right at the beginning which is

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020
streak right at the beginning which is
 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.680
streak right at the beginning which is
quite interesting that is a subset of

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690
quite interesting that is a subset of
 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.620
quite interesting that is a subset of
every single permutation but this is

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630
every single permutation but this is
 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.000
every single permutation but this is
actually representative of the way you

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010
actually representative of the way you
 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.250
actually representative of the way you
think and not just you brady a lot of

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.110

people think exactly like you if they

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120
people think exactly like you if they
 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.210
people think exactly like you if they
were to do random they think mixed up

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220
were to do random they think mixed up
 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.710
were to do random they think mixed up
right that's what people think but

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720
right that's what people think but
 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.760
right that's what people think but
random is it mixed up it random is

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770
random is it mixed up it random is
 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.740
random is it mixed up it random is
what's random in actual fact it has a

what's random in actual fact it has a
 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.720
what's random in actual fact it has a
different nature to the idea of being

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730
different nature to the idea of being
 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.670
different nature to the idea of being
mixed up because if it was evenly mixed

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680
mixed up because if it was evenly mixed
 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.230
mixed up because if it was evenly mixed
up as I've just shown I've made a lot of

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240
up as I've just shown I've made a lot of
 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.760
up as I've just shown I've made a lot of
money off you you end up being

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770
money off you you end up being
 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.380
money off you you end up being
predictable and randomness is

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390
predictable and randomness is
 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.960
predictable and randomness is
unpredictable so I've actually crunched

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970
unpredictable so I've actually crunched
 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.690
unpredictable so I've actually crunched
the numbers and I can tell you how many

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700
the numbers and I can tell you how many
 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.170
the numbers and I can tell you how many
permutations have a maximum of three

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180
permutations have a maximum of three
 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.960
permutations have a maximum of three
heads or three tails as a streak 240

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970
heads or three tails as a streak 240
 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.550
heads or three tails as a streak 240
2830 so you can see that's a much

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560
2830 so you can see that's a much
 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.280
2830 so you can see that's a much
smaller number than this and an actual

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290
smaller number than this and an actual
 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.300
smaller number than this and an actual
fact it turns out to be 23.2%

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310
fact it turns out to be 23.2%
 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.110
fact it turns out to be 23.2%
of all possible permutations it's less

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120
of all possible permutations it's less
 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.570
of all possible permutations it's less
than 1/4 so out of all the possible

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580
than 1/4 so out of all the possible
 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.150
than 1/4 so out of all the possible
permutations you can have the pool that

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160
permutations you can have the pool that
 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.510
permutations you can have the pool that
you would choose from okay only is

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520
you would choose from okay only is
 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.910
you would choose from okay only is
you're only getting one in four so

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920
you're only getting one in four so
 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.550
you're only getting one in four so
can see just by that logic alone why

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560
can see just by that logic alone why
 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.410
can see just by that logic alone why
this well it's not random all right of

I guess my brain was somehow well that's

I guess my brain was somehow well that's
a natural thing to do it because we

a natural thing to do it because we

very small mindedly so if you were just

four heads or four tails in a row is
 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.090
four heads or four tails in a row is
actually in the minority because there's

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100
actually in the minority because there's
 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.590
actually in the minority because there's
only one way you can get four heads in a

only one way you can get four heads in a

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.410
tails in a row but we did 20 and so
straight after you did four heads or

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.420
straight after you did four heads or

now that's part of how randomness works

now that's part of how randomness works
is the fact that sure if you're dealing

with a small sample you can expect
things to be quite mixed up but that's

things to be quite mixed up but that's
 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.380
things to be quite mixed up but that's
because there's not many permutations

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:39.390

you're dealing with very long streaks

you're dealing with very long streaks
 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.140
you're dealing with very long streaks
then you could have head head head head

evidence all right is that you do have

do a maximum once so I actually crunched

do a maximum once so I actually crunched
 

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.410
do a maximum once so I actually crunched

percent of all permutations it is bigger
but it's still less than half so this is

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:16.899
but it's still less than half so this is
 

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:19.229

about it is how predictable is your
sequence really all you need to know is

00:10:13.109 --> 00:10:13.119
sequence really all you need to know is
 

00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:15.470
sequence really all you need to know is
is there a way that you can write your

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480
is there a way that you can write your
 

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.939
is there a way that you can write your
sequence down of heads and tails is

00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:17.949
sequence down of heads and tails is
 

00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:20.129
sequence down of heads and tails is
there a way to do it that it's simpler

00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:20.139
there a way to do it that it's simpler
 

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:22.619
there a way to do it that it's simpler
and if there is some sort of order or

00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:22.629
and if there is some sort of order or
 

00:10:22.629 --> 00:10:24.929
and if there is some sort of order or
pattern to it then you can actually make

00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:24.939
pattern to it then you can actually make
 

00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:26.850
pattern to it then you can actually make
it simpler but if your sequence is

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:26.860
it simpler but if your sequence is
 

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.189
it simpler but if your sequence is
actually very complicated it's actually

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:29.199
actually very complicated it's actually
 

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:31.379
actually very complicated it's actually
harder to write it any smaller than it

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:31.389
harder to write it any smaller than it
 

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:34.079
harder to write it any smaller than it
is and there is a way of categorizing a

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:34.089
is and there is a way of categorizing a
 

00:10:34.089 --> 00:10:36.269
is and there is a way of categorizing a
random sequence by saying the easiest

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279
random sequence by saying the easiest
 

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.949
random sequence by saying the easiest
way to write this sequence down is just

00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959
way to write this sequence down is just
 

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:40.259
way to write this sequence down is just
write it the DNA sequence which makes up

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:40.269
write it the DNA sequence which makes up
 

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:43.199
write it the DNA sequence which makes up
me and the fabulous person you are Brady

00:10:43.199 --> 00:10:43.209
me and the fabulous person you are Brady
 

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.629
me and the fabulous person you are Brady
is actually a near random sequence

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639
is actually a near random sequence
 

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:47.369
is actually a near random sequence
because the DNA sequence contains so

00:10:47.369 --> 00:10:47.379
because the DNA sequence contains so
 

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:49.439
because the DNA sequence contains so
much information it actually in a way

00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:49.449
much information it actually in a way
 

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:52.559
much information it actually in a way
contains lots of patterns so the way you

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:52.569
contains lots of patterns so the way you
 

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.600
contains lots of patterns so the way you
can think of randomness is it's

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:54.610
can think of randomness is it's
 

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.150
can think of randomness is it's
something that actually has patterns on

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160
something that actually has patterns on
 

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.230
something that actually has patterns on
patterns on patterns on patents

00:10:59.230 --> 00:10:59.240
patterns on patterns on patents
 

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.119
patterns on patterns on patents
and actually fits in very much with the

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:01.129
and actually fits in very much with the
 

00:11:01.129 --> 00:11:03.759
and actually fits in very much with the
way gamblers think where they say oh I

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:03.769
way gamblers think where they say oh I
 

00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:05.980

can see a pattern here I can predict

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:05.990
can see a pattern here I can predict
 

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.079
can see a pattern here I can predict
what's going to happen next but that's

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:08.089
what's going to happen next but that's
 

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:09.720
what's going to happen next but that's
that's just randomness at work

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:09.730
that's just randomness at work
 

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.730
that's just randomness at work
randomness shows patterns but there's no

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:12.740
randomness shows patterns but there's no
 

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.949
randomness shows patterns but there's no
logic to it it's not following rules of

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959
logic to it it's not following rules of

Hollywood script you start with a big

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:48.529
Hollywood script you start with a big
