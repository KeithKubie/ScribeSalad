00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.560
- [Instructor] Sarah Swift
got a speeding ticket

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.600
on her way home from work.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.730
If she pays her fine now there
will be no added penalty.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.650
If she delays her payment then
a penalty will be assessed

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.900
for the number of months, t,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.120
that she delays paying her fine.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.390
Her total fine, F, in euros,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.240
is indicated in the table below.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.320
These numbers represent an exponential,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.660
an exponential function.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.670
So they give us the number of months

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.150
that the payment is delayed

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.930
and then the amount of fine.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.470
And this is essentially data points

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.330
from an exponential function.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.870
Just to remind ourselves
what an exponential function

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.900
would look like,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.280
this tells us that our fine

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.520
as our function of the months delayed

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.620
is going to be equal to some number

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.620
times some common ratio to the t power.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.090
This telling us this exponential function

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.060
is essentially telling
us that our function

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.140
is going to have this
form right over here.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.300
So let's see if we can
answer their questions.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.720
So the first question is
what is the common ratio

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.310
of consecutive values of F?

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.491
So the reason why r right over here

00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.960
is called the common ratio

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.670
is it's the ratio that
if you look at any two,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.720
say if you were to increment t by one

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.040
the ratio of that to F of t,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.520
that ratio should be consistent for any t.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.400
So let me give you an example here.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.400
The ratio of F of two to F of one

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.070
should be equal to the ratio
of F of three to F of two,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.000
which should be the same
as the ratio of F of four

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.060
to F of three.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.040
Or in general terms the
ratio of F of t plus one

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.540
to the ratio of F of t

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.270
should be equal to all of these things.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.000
That would be the common ratio.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.940
So let's see what that is.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.530
If we just look at the form,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.260
if we just look at this right over here.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.110
So what's the ratio of
F of two to F of one?

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.720
450 divided by 300, well that's 1.5.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.143
That's 1.5.

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:11.143
675 divided by 450, that's 1.5.

00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:16.143
1,012.5 divided by 675, that's 1.5.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.907
So the common ratio in all
of these situations is 1.5.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.420
So the common ratio over here is 1.5.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.673
And another way,

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:31.560
and just to to make it clear
why this r right over here

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.490
is called the common ratio,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.150
is let's just do this general form.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.150
So F of t plus one, well that's
just going to be a times r

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.270
to the t plus one power,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.330
and F of t is a times r to the t power.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.820
So what is this going to be?

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.290
This is going to be...

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.290
Let's see, this is going to be
r to the t plus one minus t,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.500
which is just going to be
equal to r to the first power,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.370
which is just equal to r.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.360
So this variable, r,

00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:07.698
is going to be equal to this common ratio.

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:10.095
So whether we figured out
that the common ratio is 1.5,

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:13.530
that tells us that our function
is going to be of the form

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.480
F of t is equal to a times,
instead of writing an r there

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.900
we now know that r is 1.5 to the t power.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.640
1.5 to the t power.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.420
Write a formula for this function.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.930
Well we've almost done that,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.980
but we haven't figured out what a is.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.830
And to figure out what a is
we could just substitute.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.800
We know what F of one is.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.300
When t is equal to one, F is equal to 300,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.990
and so we should be able
to use that information

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.823
to solve for a.

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:42.650
We could have used any of these
data points to solve for a,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.483
but let's do that.

00:03:43.483 --> 00:03:48.410
F of one is equal to a times
1.5 to the first power,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.920
or a times 1.5, and that
is going to be equal to,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.070
they tell us that F of
one is equal to 300.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.740
And so another way of writing this

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.260
is we could say 1.5
times a is equal to 300.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.660
Divide both sides by 1.5

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.620
and we get a is equal to 200.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.390
And so our function, our
formula for our function, is,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.061
let me write it in black so we can see it.

00:04:17.061 --> 00:04:19.490
It's going to be 200, that's our a,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.490
times 1.5 to the t power.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.090
Now another way...

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.160
Well actually let's just
think about the next question.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.040
What is the fine in euros
for Sarah's speeding ticket

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.930
if she pays it on time?

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.050
So paying it on time, that
implies that t is equal to zero.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.670
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.810
we need to figure out her
fine for t equals zero.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.950
So we need to figure out F of zero.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.230
So what's F of zero?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.050
It's 200 times 1.5 to the zero power.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.520
1.5 to the zero power is one,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.330
so that's just going to
be equal to 200 euro.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.120
Now another way of thinking
about it is, well look,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.230
let's look at the common ratio.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.640
To go from 675 to 450

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.060
you're essentially dividing
by the common ratio.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.330
To go from 450 to 300, you're
dividing by the common ratio.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.990
So then to go from t
equals one to t equals zero

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.210
you would divide by the common ratio again

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.610
and you would get to 200.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.820
Or another way of thinking about it

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.480
is to go to successive
values, or successive months,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.390
every time we are multiplying
by the common ratio.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.060
Every time we are multiplying,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.793
we are multiplying by the common ratio.
