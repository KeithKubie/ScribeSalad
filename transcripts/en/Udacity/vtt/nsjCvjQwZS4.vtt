Before we dive into what
an orthographic camera is, and

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.390
how to work with it,
let's see one in action.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.050
This demo creates a simple scene,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.500
which you can view through
two different cameras.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.730
The first camera just displays
an overview of the scene.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.700
But the second camera, the close
up camera, you can move and zoom.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.390
Give it a try.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.079
So, once the demo's running,

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.694
you can use the arrow keys to move
the close up camera around the scene.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:27.759
Now here's the interesting bit,
if you hit space,

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.546
you can see the scene
from the overview camera,

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:34.930
along with a blue rectangle showing
what the close up camera sees.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.760
You can zoom the close up camera
using z to zoom in and x to zoom out.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.590
What's really happening, is we're
reducing the portion of the scene

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.020
that's visible to the close up camera.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.550
You can also change the viewport
height using w and s.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.042
And the viewport width, using a and d.

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:58.240
When the viewport is wide and short, the
world looks super vertically stretched.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.620
When the viewport is tall and skinny,
the world looks horizontally stretched.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.390
You can hit f to set
the aspect ratio of the camera

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.790
back to the aspect ratio of the screen.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.670
You can also rotate
the camera using q and e.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.636
Be aware that very strange things happen
when you rotate a camera that's super

00:01:15.636 --> 00:01:16.262
stretched.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.783
Finally, note that you can easily zoom
the close-up camera out to the point

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.360
where it can see more than
the scene overview camera.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.840
So, no matter how deep we get
into matrices and viewports and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.760
what not,
remember that this is what cameras do,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.450
determine what portion of
the world you can see.
