00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.980
My sister Arden sacrificed her whole
life for this tournament.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.510
"... and through her bravery humankind
pushes on with dreams of tomorrow."

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.170
There's just one problem:

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.380
- "Eight billion people watching and
her nose looks crazy shiny."

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.300
"What? Like you weren't thinking it."

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.660
"Matter transference will commence
in three... two... one..."

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.660
- "Wha...?"

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.320
- "Oh, thank God, we can finally switch plac-"
- "We can't switch."

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.100
"You've got to win this tournament, Victoria."

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.620
"You've gotta win the whole thing."

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.590
- "What?"

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.780
- "Remind me again what happens
if I just quit and come home."

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.840
- "Aliens invade the earth and kill everyone
you've ever cared about."

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.980
(crowd screaming)

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.780
- "That's like a hundred percent for sure?"

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.260
-"This is not a pageant."

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.600
- "Really? Because I just spent the last week starving to death next to a woman who wanted to kill me."

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.860
"Seems pretty similar."

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.060
- "Too slow."

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.840
- "You know some people respond better to positive encouragement."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.320
- "The other competitors are
going to do a lot more than hurt your feelings."

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.940
- "Oh, come on."

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.000
"Still not hearing positive vibes."

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.720
- "You're the hero, Vic. Better get used to it."

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.000
What makes you think you can take on the most powerful force in the universe?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.620
- "Don't you get it? They chose the right sister after all."

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.320
Let's go finish this tournament.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.130
Who am I?
