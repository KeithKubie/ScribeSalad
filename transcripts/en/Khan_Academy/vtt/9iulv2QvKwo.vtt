00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:01.970
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.240
convert this amount
of kilometers

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.830
into meters and centimeters.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.790
So we'll first start
with the 2 kilometers.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.780
And I encourage you to
now pause this video

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.890
and try to do this on your own.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.650
Well, the one thing that we know
is that a kilometer literally

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.110
means 1,000 meters.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.200
So you could literally view
this is as 2 times 1,000 meters.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.260
Let me write that down.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.420
So this is going to be equal
to 2 times 1,000 meters, which

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.780
is equal to 2,000 meters.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.910
If we wanted to convert the
11 kilometers into meters,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.880
it's the same thing.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.450
11 kilometers-- this right
over here-- means 1,000 meters.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.110
So you could think of it
as 11 times 1,000 meters.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.430
So 11 times 1,000 is
going to be 11,000 meters.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.740
Now let's convert these
distances into centimeters.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.120
And here we just
have to remember

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.360
that 1 meter is equal
to 100 centimeters.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.840
Let me write that down.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.880
1 meter is equal
to 100 centimeters.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.140
And that's because the prefix
centi means one hundredth.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.850
Another way you can write
it is that one centimeter

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.640
is equal to one
hundredth of a meter.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.530
But here we have a
certain number of meters,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.270
and each of those
meters are going

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.030
to be equivalent
to 100 centimeters.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.110
So if we wanted to write
2,000 meters as centimeters,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.830
we could say, well,
we have 2,000 meters.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.260
Each of those are going to be
equivalent to 100 centimeters.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.400
And so this is going to be
equal to 2,000 times 100.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.310
Well, that's going to
be 2, and since where

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.900
we have the three
zeroes from the 2,000.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.070
And then every time
you multiply by 10,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.460
you're going to
add another zero.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.141
Or you're going to have
another zero at the end of it.

00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:52.640
And we're going to
be at multiplying

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.590
by 100 is equivalent to
multiplying by 10 twice.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.640
So we're going to
have two more zeroes.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.695
So this is going to be
200,000 centimeters.

00:02:04.695 --> 00:02:07.200
Now let's do the same
thing right over here

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.740
with the kilometers,
the 11 kilometers,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.039
which are 11,000 meters.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.122
And once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:14.790
and try to convert
it into centimeters.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.180
Well, same idea.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.550
You have 11,000 meters,
and each of them

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.530
are equivalent to
100 centimeters.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.550
So this is going to
be 11, and let's see,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.190
we have one, two, three,
four, five zeroes.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.140
So this gets us to
1,100,000 centimeters.
