00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.810 position:67%
From the Library of Congress in Washington,
DC.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:13.440 position:73%
This is the second in a series of three talking
about the Mesoamerican codices

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.230 position:66%
that are in the collections of the Library
of Congress

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.400 position:70%
The one we're going to be talking about today
is

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.590 position:67%
one of the earliest ones to come into the
Library's collections, the Oztoticpac Lands

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.590
Map,


00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.650 position:78%
No one is really sure exactly when this particular
map came into the Library's collection

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.300 position:67%
It has been theorized that it came into the
collection as early as 1905.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.300 position:64%
But it remained unknown pretty much until
April of 1965

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.920 position:66%
when it was pointed out by some of the map
mounters, people mounting maps on backing,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.960
here at the Library.


00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.060 position:70%
It was pointed out to one of the map curators
and that's where it it kind of came into the

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.440
scholarly orbit of


00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.560 position:67%
Map historians and Mesoamerican historians,


00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.070 position:67%
so we don't really know very much about the
actual history

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.880 position:66%
When there was a big census being done for
the Handbook of Middle American Indians

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.800 position:69%
which was published by Tulane throughout the
sixties and seventies

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.530 position:70%
and a lot of the Mesoamerican codices were
researched for that project those researchers

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.560 position:72%
also turned up absolutely no information about
the document's history

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.710 position:69%
and its provenance, so we really are working
with something that we don't know very much

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.710
about


00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.090 position:69%
As far as where it came from It is, however,
an extraordinary document

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.360 position:66%
And we're going to get very deeply into it
today.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.370 position:67%
It is one of the most interesting maps from
this period certainly one of the most

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.480 position:64%
interesting indigenous maps that we could
possibly sit here and talk about.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.280
Now the map of course is Nahua.


00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.300
It is written in Nahuatl


00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.890 position:72%
hieroglyphic writing with, of course, some
Roman script, and we'll be talking a bit about

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.460
that in just a bit


00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.250 position:67%
But a little bit of word, a little bit of
thought on the language that we're going to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.250
be talking about here


00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.640 position:67%
Nahuatl's a part, of course, a larger group
of languages

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.390 position:75%
and it came into the Mesoamerican orbit and
into Mexico migrating down from the southwestern

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.390
United States


00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.470 position:80%
part of a group of languages called the Uto-Aztecan
languages related to things like the North

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.510
American Hopi


00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.860 position:66%
language some of the other Native American
languages which are in the Southwest

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.110 position:64%
and it appears to have migrated down into
the valley of Mexico around 500 AD

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.490 position:67%
Before that time the the Maya languages and
a few of the other

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.090 position:70%
Mesoamerican languages had a much longer time
period in the area

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.810 position:72%
So there's a certain borrowing that took place
and many of the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.850 position:77%
things that we see on this map and in the
Nahua codices are regionalisms that are different

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.050 position:72%
across different areas of the Nahuatl speaking
region

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.860 position:67%
Today there are about 28 different dialects
of Nahuatl spoken throughout Mexico

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.990 position:77%
by about a million speakers and it's an extremely
interesting language group

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.040 position:69%
I'm going to be spending a lot of time today
looking at some of the first Written forms,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.040
Lands Map was made


00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.820 position:69%
the first Romanized forms of Nahua that that
actually survive execution

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.060 position:69%
So, the Oztoticpac lands map was made really
after the aftermath of a trial and execution

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.060
of


00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.230 position:69%
a local chieftan called Chichimecatecatl and
his name is Don Carlos.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.910 position:64%
He was given the Spanish noble Don and he
was executed

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.660
in November of 1539.


00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.690
The reasons for that execution


00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.520 position:64%
are talked about a little bit on the map,
and we'll talk a little bit about that

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
in just a bit.


00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.350 position:69%
But you can see the map is a large pictorial
map it is

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:09.650 position:66%
written and drawn on amate or amatl, which
the mulberry or fig bark paper typical of

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.840 position:69%
indigenous Nahua, and Aztecs there's many
many codices that are on this kind of paper.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.850 position:75%
The document itself has various areas associated
with it.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.850
We can see there's


00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.750 position:64%
there are these sections of the map which
show different things.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.900 position:72%
we're going to go through this in some detail.


00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.310 position:75%
I'm going to talk a lot about these big sections
of script that you see on map below some of

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.680 position:59%
the Maps here because they'll probably


00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.520 position:75%
really give us a lot of insight into the history
of the document and really into the history

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.260 position:64%
of what we're actually looking at when we
look at those Oztoticpac Lands Map

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.000 position:69%
So we're going to start up in that left-hand
corner and this area here, Tollancinco

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.670 position:67%
which is written right in the in the little
box here, which is basically showing

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.310
a parcel of land.


00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.010 position:67%
The little clicks that you see on the sides
are

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.860 position:72%
measurements of land of the land if you sort
of break this out it measures 102 by 160 feet.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.280 position:64%
One of the things that's very interesting


00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.340 position:66%
on the Oztoticpac Lands Map is the parcels
of land

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:23.540 position:88%
we're talking about are not very big even
when we get to the Palace of Don Carlos Chichimecatacatl

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.180 position:67%
we are going to see that it's not that huge
parcels of land that we've seen some other

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.130 position:67%
Mesoamerican codices like, for instance the
Mapa Quetzalecatzin, which we talked about

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.130
last time


00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.110 position:69%
shows a much larger area than the Oztoticpac
Lands Map

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.100 position:72%
Now, we see here that there's a lot of script
and on the Oztoticpac there is really a couple

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.360 position:64%
of Spanish annotations, which are kind of
brief

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.720 position:64%
and short and then there's the long, long
clauses in Nahuatl

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.370 position:73%
and this is one of the first times that Nahuatl
was actually going to be written down on in

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.980
Roman script.


00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.930 position:66%
What we're going to see as we get into the
map

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.900 position:67%
is a little bit of the Nahuatl hieroglyphic
writing.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.650 position:66%
But what's important on the map beyond the
hieroglyphics

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.530 position:69%
is this these written pieces of script here,


00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.620
these Roman scripts.


00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.020
And really what we're looking at


00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:28.030 position:80%
here is we're looking at throughout the map
testimony given by the indigenous people themselves

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.170 position:64%
This one is given by one of the Texcocans
on the map

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.320 position:72%
Benito Ciuaiunti and basically what this piece
of testimony talks about it talks about

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.180 position:72%
Really what the parcel of land and the history
of it is

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.420 position:64%
It talks about eyewitness encounters that
the

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.720 position:66%
The person who is speaking, not the person
who's writing -- the person who is writing

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.600
was most likely a cleric


00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.890 position:63%
Who wrote down this testimony on the map


00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.210 position:63%
In Roman script so this was phonetically


00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.370
sounded out


00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.330
testimony from this Texcocan


00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.500
Benito Ciuaiunti


00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.420 position:73%
It talks about the history of the parcel of
land and it talks about an eyewitness encounter

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.420
that had


00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.130 position:67%
seen Don Carlos when there was a discussion
about who owned this piece land and really

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.630
what we're attempting


00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.630
to establish with this map it made


00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.710 position:63%
For the use in a Spanish court or courts


00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:33.170 position:70%
There's a land dispute that will take place
after the execution of Don Carlos in November

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.170
of 1539


00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.990
We get on that on


00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.990
the


00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.340 position:70%
figure, this is going to be a central feature
of the map

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.800 position:70%
There are lots of little glyphs in the center
here we see these

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.900 position:63%
Cacao beans and basically the cacao here


00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.790
basically the amount of cacao and


00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.730 position:70%
what we're seeing here is Don Carlos actually
owns this piece of property that this parcel

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.550 position:58%
according to the testimony is in fact


00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:07.620 position:72%
private property and it's really talking about
the amount of tribute needed in order to

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.960 position:67%
to rent and lease some of the properties so
the map is really going to get in a lot of

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.130
detail about


00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.680
property law


00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.390 position:66%
how property is handled in Nahua and Aztec
society

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.680 position:66%
and it is a great insight into the sort of


00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.860
bureaucratic superstructure


00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.820 position:69%
Of Nahua culture and how land was was really
treated

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.490
Now one of the features on the map


00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.510 position:70%
Is going to be this palace up on the one hill
up on the

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.480 position:64%
top corner, the left-hand corner there is
this large piece of land here

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.890 position:70%
Which really is the largest piece of property
on the map itself and it is a sort of palace

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.890
complex with


00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.730
outbuildings and


00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:00.850 position:67%
We'll get into exactly how big this is, but
there's a couple of glosses

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.450 position:64%
On the the map which are in Nahua also so
the one on the top in the red box

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.800 position:70%
Basically is telling us that this particular
piece of property is not owned by Don Carlos,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.030
but in fact is owned in common


00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.620
And down below there's another one


00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.720 position:64%
That says it was owned by a man named Don
Antonio, and we're not really sure

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.240 position:64%
Exactly who some of the people on the map
are but we can identify some of them

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.830 position:72%
The gloss itself says "The Palace at Oztotipac
belongs to the ruling line and not to Don

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.070
Carlos"


00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:39.310 position:69%
So we have now two pieces of property, these
are both on that left-hand section, one that

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.310
does belong to


00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:45.080 position:73%
Don Carlos and another one that in fact doesn't


00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.730 position:69%
The interesting things about that particular
map

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.530
Is really in two places


00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.940
on the right hand side is a section


00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:58.560 position:66%
Taken from the Oztoticpac Lands Map itself
and the left-hand side is a fragment

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.290 position:64%
of a map found in the papers of Alexander
Humboldt

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.260 position:63%
it is called Alexander Humboldt fragment


00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:12.540 position:69%
And that fragment as you can see is an exact
mapping of the Oztotipac

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.530
palace on the right hand side


00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.460 position:69%
the people pictured on the Humboldt fragment


00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.420 position:67%
Are a lot of the people who are going to be
involved in this land dispute

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.270 position:66%
And they're actually shown on the Humboldt
fragment, but they don't appear at all on

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.560
the Oztoticpac Lands Map


00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.860
Below the plus there is a large


00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.100 position:61%
Gloss and that gloss is made by another


00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.880
indigenous testimonial


00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.890 position:66%
Which basically talks about the properties
being the estates of Don Carlos belonging

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.980
to the entire family


00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.550
and that this


00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:58.160 position:69%
This itself is not fully owned by Don Carlos


00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.220 position:67%
Now, Really what we have here when we start
looking at this in detail and

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.850 position:61%
putting all of the testimonial together


00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.030
We're really looking at an attempt


00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.980 position:64%
whether by Don Carlos's family or by some
of his

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:19.550 position:73%
commoners and freeholders who are in his employ
and renters to attempt to

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:24.160 position:70%
kind of, grasp onto the land rights that they
believe are theirs

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.420 position:63%
both traditionally and under Spanish law


00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.200
So really what we're looking at is


00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:37.480 position:70%
We're looking at a pseudo legal document that
is really attempting to, kind of, the history

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480
of a particular


00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.590 position:80%
group of parcels of land that Don Carlos associated
with

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.340 position:64%
and so as we go through, there'll be this
continual build up

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.490 position:69%
of the various different kinds of properties
that Don Carlos is associated with

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.010
And the mapping of Oztoticpac is an


00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.080
amazing, amazing primary source for


00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.480
getting a handle on


00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480
ownership law


00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.190 position:69%
agricultural law, how and tributes were paid


00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.580 position:64%
vthe idea of rental property, the idea of
ownership

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:18.030 position:67%
And the idea of hereditary ownership within
Nahua and Aztec society

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:24.130 position:70%
And it really does paint an extremely complex
picture, as all sort of mysterious primary

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.220
source documents do.


00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.660
This particular document


00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.420 position:64%
asks a lot more questions than it answers
a lot of the time

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:38.370 position:64%
Now, this property that we see on the map
is in fact this,this palace and

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:43.630 position:69%
none of the properties are that big this one
is, as I said, six hundred and seventy-eight

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.360 position:66%
by six hundred and thirty-three feet which
is not extremely large.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:53.840 position:70%
And we can really tell how big the properties
are because while surveyed, every one of the

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.060 position:64%
the properties shown on the map has these
dots

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.920 position:59%
Around the perimeter and each of those


00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.590 position:64%
Basically are giving us the length of the
particular pieces of property.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.510 position:59%
It's not very difficult to reconstruct


00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.980 position:67%
the actual sizes of the properties from the
actual measurements themselves

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.150
The surveys


00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:22.260 position:80%
are in the Nahua units which are easily convertible
to

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:29.640 position:69%
feet and standard units now, but this entire
property is about 678 by 633

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.360
so not a gigantic


00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.390 position:63%
pallet by any stretch of the imagination


00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.860 position:64%
So, this is just to look at the inside of
the

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:47.200 position:66%
pass itself, with its little outbuildings,
and some of the the actual way it's broken

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200
up.


00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.570 position:69%
We're not really sure what any of the things
you night here mean, but in both this and

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.660
the Humboldt


00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.120
representation of the palace the


00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.990
figures are exactly the same


00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.710 position:67%
So, this gives us a little bit of insight
into what the actual property, and what the

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.180
palace looked like.


00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.300 position:66%
Now, the most interesting parts of the map


00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.590 position:64%
is the right hand, left -- right hand top
side

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:19.230 position:66%
And this is an extremely complex layout of


00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.230
properties again


00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.280
And, it's a


00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.270 position:77%
complex mashup of all different kinds of property
plans kind of thrown together

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.020 position:67%
And it tells us, in one of the glosses that
this is Octicpac

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.120 position:61%
which means, in Nahua, "above the road"


00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.950 position:70%
And, we can see on the bottom here the little
feet in this road so this is the road

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.460 position:67%
And all these properties are above the road


00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.230 position:72%
We're not really sure exactly where this piece
of property and where any of these are

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.530
today


00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.430 position:80%
Nothing on the map can really be located precisely.


00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.110
The Oztoticpac


00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.280 position:70%
that does exists today outside of Mexico City


00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.530 position:72%
But no one can really say for sure where these
particular pieces of property are

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.110
All we know now is if this is


00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.280 position:66%
Complex or property plans and that we have


00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.140
this above the road


00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.700
We have this Spanish gloss here


00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.740 position:66%
which basically tells us that all of these
properties down here, these these smaller

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.040 position:58%
plots are are basically for commoners


00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.140
And so basically these


00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.240 position:67%
Are either rented or or owned by the people
in kind

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.040 position:69%
There are forty-five of the heads that we
see on the right hand side, there's the head

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.740
with a flag which is 20


00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.120 position:70%
plus 20 plus five there are 45, and if you
count the plots here, there are in fact forty

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.670
five plots


00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.260
and we also see


00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.200 position:70%
Here there are these other smaller plots very
linear

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.350 position:72%
plots which a gloss here tells us are actually
rented out and that there are ten of these

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.600
and here are the ten heads


00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.600
Associated with the ten plots


00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.890 position:59%
And then here we have a whole bunch of


00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:02.270 position:64%
??tribute and numerical tribute, and what
the

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:07.920 position:69%
Glyphs? of when tribute is to be paid, in
other words, when rent is to be paid for the

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.890
properties


00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:10.890
Each of the


00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:16.430 position:69%
Plots have a little glyph in them which is,
in fact, the name of either the owner or the

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.390
piece of property itself


00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.540 position:69%
And so every one of these glyphs has its own
little owner

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.130
Just to blow this up a little bit


00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:30.580 position:69%
here are some of the the glyphs that we find
in those plot again with all of the

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:35.290 position:72%
Measurements of each plot, and then the glyphs
that name the actual plot itself

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.320
These are the tribute


00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.890 position:64%
Markers that have been put on the map and
one of the most interesting things that I

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.520
find are the boundary markers


00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:50.210 position:67%
The boundary markers, which are even used
today in some areas, are these agave plants

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.170
And we can see these agave plants,


00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.430 position:67%
they show how many agave plants are marking
the boundaries

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:03.760 position:69%
And even agave plants are used to mark field
boundaries, and so we see that same thing

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.890 position:72%
These are sort of difficult to pick up, you've
really got to magnify the map

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:09.820
A great deal


00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.210 position:64%
See these agave plants, but they're agave


00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.770
boundry markers


00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:21.480 position:67%
Now one of the fascinating parts of the map
and the thing that

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.180 position:66%
people are drawn to immediately when they
look at it are these place named glyphs on

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.240 position:73%
the left hand side and then these very stylized
trees and bushes that

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.160
that exist on the map


00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.790 position:75%
and what we're actually looking at, here because
the date of this map is 1539

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.630 position:67%
It's not exactly sure when the map was made


00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.040 position:73%
But it had to be between late 1539 and sometime
in

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.120 position:64%
1540 so that is the time frame that we're
really looking at for the construction of

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.120
the map


00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:59.080 position:78%
And, so what we hear is really the first botanical
document from from the New World

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.330
that we know of


00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.880 position:73%
And what we actually see is, we see the various
places that are associated

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:10.170 position:66%
this Oztoticpac down here, and then we see
these trees and then numbers of trees

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.580
so we've got these inventories


00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:18.780 position:73%
The same way that we have the markers for
the boundaries or for the lengths and distances

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.360 position:80%
of various plots of land, we have tree inventories.


00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.090 position:72%
And we've got a whole different group of trees


00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:30.790 position:64%
We've got apples, pears, pomegranates and
grapevines and what we actually see is we

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.890
actually see grafting


00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:37.290 position:69%
I think this is kind of fascinating because
these sorts of graftings are done even today

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.410 position:70%
and we've got pears, pomegranates, and apples
being grafted onto native root stock

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.580 position:64%
It's actually the same way a modern graft
is done

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.710 position:66%
You can see down on the left hand side and
on the right hand side these are two apple

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.740
tree grafts


00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.510 position:69%
You can actually see the the graft marks and
the cuts

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:59.290 position:73%
where the grafting is actually done, so they're
a fairly realistic

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:04.630 position:69%
rendition what what these grafts would would
really look like

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:08.390
This is one of of the graphs also


00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.020
Same exact thing


00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:16.830 position:69%
it's grafted here and grafted here, and this
is really the grafting of grapes onto native

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.110
root stock and


00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.070 position:59%
It's a kind of a fascinating botanical


00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.570
look at really what was


00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.620 position:64%
actually happening on the ground during a
very early period

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:33.290 position:66%
We are really talking,you know, about only
20 years after the conquest

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.660 position:59%
by Cortés in 1519, we are just in 1539


00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.600 position:78%
so we've already developed a lot of infrastructure


00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.840
a lot of, sort of


00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840
iterative¿¿


00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.330 position:61%
idea ??? and a lot of farming practices


00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.810 position:69%
With the Old World that's being grafted onto
native root stock

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.860 position:66%
And so it's a kind of a fascinating little


00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:02.220 position:66%
glimpse into the cultural practices in in
this particular area of Mexico at the time

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:09.520 position:70%
Now, trees and exotic fruits are a part of
a contract that Don Carlos seems to have with

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.640
a man named Pedro de Verga


00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.950 position:67%
And Pedro de Verga was in business with Don
Carlos

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.010 position:75%
And really what they're doing is they´re
growing a lot of exotic fruits that were popular

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.190
and expensive in Europe


00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:26.200 position:67%
Whether they're either selling them to the
local Spanish settlers or sending them back

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.870
to Europe, no one really knows.


00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:35.120 position:64%
With the inventories that we have, we can
count up the number of trees

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.700
and so you know pear trees: 67


00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.700
quince trees: 125


00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.020
Apples: 103


00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.500 position:66%
the pomegranates and peaches we can't tell


00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.620
and there are 27 grapevines


00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.970 position:69%
So, it's not a small orchard when one thinks
that one has between just quince and apples

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.010
more than 200 trees


00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.630
Of those two things


00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.060
So, again some real insight into


00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.050
into a


00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.210
Bureaucracy and almost a


00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:13.240 position:70%
The business that have been going on between
the indigenous and the Spanish at this period

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.030 position:70%
One of the most fascinating things about this


00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.950
document is this


00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:25.950 position:70%
constant look into how both of these groups
are interacting with one another and how both

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:26.950
the


00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.000 position:81%
Indigenous and the Spanish are sort of accommodating
each other

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.850
during this period


00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.470 position:56%
one of the things that you can think


00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:41.090 position:69%
When looking at this document is if this was
to be argued in the Spanish Court

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.220 position:66%
and if these land rights are being claimed


00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.780 position:67%
The way we believe they are in the document


00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.600 position:67%
what we're really seeing here is that we´re
seeing that by

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.230
1539 and 1540


00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:59.060 position:66%
at least part of the indigenous peoples in
the Valley of Mexico or around Oztoticpac

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.550
and south of


00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:05.560 position:69%
Mexico City beginning to, at least, exercise
some

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.620 position:70%
attempt at claiming rights in a Spanish court


00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.520
and so if this is an attempt


00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.620 position:70%
if this document is, as many scholars believe
it to be,

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.540 position:64%
a document that's used in a Spanish Court
to attempt to recover

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:22.530 position:67%
lands that were confiscated by by the Crown


00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.060
after the execution of Don Carlos


00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.290 position:69%
We really do see the beginnings of a certain
accommodation

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.840 position:72%
At least on the part of the indigenous peoples
for acceptance

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.740 position:64%
of Spanish law and working in Spanish law


00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.670
Now


00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:44.120 position:72%
We talked to of you who were here and listened
to the Codex Quetzalecatzin piece.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.260
We talked a lot in that piece about


00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.860 position:72%
About ethnobotanical content of the manuscript


00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.980
again here we are


00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.920 position:66%
At the point where we are looking at a bit
of ethnobotany

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.550 position:69%
At least what we're looking at is we´ll look
at some agricultural practices

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.750
And so we're also getting a sense


00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.580 position:64%
not only of sort of land ownership rights


00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.870
But also of land use


00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.740 position:64%
how was land used during this period what
was the

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.740
what was important


00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.680 position:70%
And, we can see in some of the commoner plots


00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.170 position:67%
the size of the plots are fairly small, but
if one looks at other

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.170
indigenous cultures


00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.380
they used


00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.900
agriculture in the same way


00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.380 position:63%
The plots are really about the same size


00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.970 position:67%
They're for the most part these subsistence
plots that

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:42.320 position:67%
That people are renting who either work or
are in the employ of Don Carlos or who live

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.500
in the area as commoners


00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:52.630 position:69%
The majority of the words that we see on the
manuscript here that talk about

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:53.840
That agriculture


00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.580
Appear in Nahua


00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:02.010 position:70%
And furthermore, of course, had to come later


00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:08.250 position:77%
So, in other words they're later Nahua names,
they're not Nahua names that predate the conquest

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:15.580 position:64%
And some of the things that we associated
with the map and some of the botanical

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.340 position:70%
language associated with what was being grown


00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.350 position:70%
and for instance the pears, the pomegranates,
the quince

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.280
the grapes


00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280
The apples


00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.630 position:70%
all of which up here on the on the map itself
in their Nahua names

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.190 position:63%
And so, very much like we see the glyphs


00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.690 position:73%
With which one can really tell what the species
of the plant are

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.770
by looking at the glyph.


00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.650 position:67%
This is very much the same as we saw on the


00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:50.420 position:77%
Quetzalecatzin when we talked about the botanical
structures that we really did need the Nahuatl

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.720
transcription into Roman


00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.360 position:64%
letters and really to understand what the


00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.230
what plants actually are


00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:10.180 position:69%
One of the the most fascinating parts of the
map will conclude this particular piece on

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.630
the right-hand side


00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.560 position:58%
And this little piece of text is both


00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.560 position:66%
It has the Spanish gloss on top and then a
Nahua

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.370
Long, Nahua gloss


00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:26.410 position:73%
And this particular piece of property is called
the Huehuexoxotl

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.230 position:70%
And the lease shows the Lands of Huehuexoxotl


00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.390
The gloss says that Don Carlos


00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.080 position:64%
And it tells us that he died on the Feast
of Mary Magdalene

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.640 position:77%
So he was executed on the Feast of Mary Magdalene


00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.920 position:66%
and it also tells us that he provided well
for his mistresses

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.860 position:70%
It also gives us notes on some of the various
affairs that he had

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.840
and these


00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:52.780 position:69%
affairs and him having these mistresses were
really used by the Inquisition against him

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.270 position:69%
Regarding the question of why Don Carlos was
executed

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:01.360 position:64%
There is some talk about the fact that he
did keep his

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.580 position:67%
He gave this particular plot of land to his
sister

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.070
his sister had inherited it


00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:12.750 position:69%
Xoxul is her name, and she inherited it, and
he then managed it, and then he gave it back

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.750
to her.


00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:19.730 position:67%
She had a daughter whose name is Ines Tonal
and Don Carlos kept her as a mistress and

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.490
had two daughters with her


00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:28.620 position:69%
Several other places on the map we can sense
thatat Don Carlos was a real a

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.720
real


00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.770
A player


00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:36.500 position:77%
And that he, at least according to the indigenous
testimony, attempted to swindle people out

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.920
of pieces of property


00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.250
currently had his


00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:45.960 position:67%
His ear to the ground to try and figure out
which pieces of property were occupied

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:51.350 position:72%
Who owned them, who was dying, who which piece
of property he could buy up

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:53.250
And really this


00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:58.980 position:72%
combined with the fact that that he had kept
his mistresses -- his niece as mistress -- and

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.690
had two daughters out of wedlock


00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.900
have


00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.370 position:64%
Directed the attention of the Inquisition
at him

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.710
He certainly was an important


00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.250
an important


00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:19.680 position:78%
Local person in the area andcame from an important
family who whose noble line goes back quite

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680
a ways


00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.270
even before


00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.700
the


00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.810
The coming of the Spanish


00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.740
before the contact period


00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.870 position:66%
And so really what, what we see in the map
is we see

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.520 position:66%
to a certain extent we see the life of Don
Carlos kind of played out after his death

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.140
we see that he was a


00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.710 position:69%
local chieftain who attempted to aquiredor
participe she's of lands and rented them out

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.900 position:61%
This seems to have been even before the


00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.550 position:67%
Contact or coming of the Spanish he had his


00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.870 position:66%
Niece as mistress and and and had a couple
of daughters by her

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:59.660 position:69%
We this is life of an individual really play
out on this map

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.620
And we'll also see is we see


00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.950
the ascent of his heirs


00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.000
attempting to reassert


00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.410 position:67%
their right to this piece of property and
whether those rights are through hereditary

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.500 position:63%
Or through the fact that they inherited,


00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.060 position:64%
Or whether the fact that the confiscation
of particular parts of these properties

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:25.700 position:70%
which Don Carlos did not own, which were held
in common, were illegal and they needed to

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.030
be returned


00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.380 position:67%
It is a critically important primary source
document

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.070 position:58%
Really one of the most important maps


00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.930 position:70%
in the collections of the Library of Congress


00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:42.730 position:72%
And a critical primary source for anyone who's
interested in

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.730
both


00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.430
post conquests sort of use


00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.950 position:56%
of Spanish law by indigenous peoples


00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:55.220 position:78%
And really by the way later Nahua and pre-conquest
Nahua dealt with land

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.970
and and and


00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.610 position:66%
rented out properties to rural farmers and
things like that

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:14.660 position:94%
A critical piece of primary history. Thank you all very much


00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.660 position:97%
