00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
The economic divide between the rich and the
poor is more visible than ever. Rich kids

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.870
of instagram swipe to kids sitting in crumbling
schools, and American child obesity sits in

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.380
a feed with crazy movie-star child rearing…
but it seems to me we're missing an angle

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:25.410
here…

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.600
America is the land of opportunity, and yet,
there's a larger economic class divide today

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.719
than any time since… well EVER. It's the
widest ever according to a Pew Research report.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.249
How does that affect us? We have very poor
kids and very rich kids and they're living

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:44.039
completely different and separate lives. Lots
of research has been done on how poverty affects

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.649
the brain, how the behaviors of poor parents
can negatively affect offspring and on and

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.309
on. Researchers love to study the poor, but
we are ALL products of our environment and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.519
if poor kids are affected by being poor, what
happens to the rich?

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.050
Stereotypes of the rich and poor abound. Poor
are lazy, rich work hard, poor are dumb, rich

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.720
are smart, poor use drugs rich… well actually
rich use drugs too. A 2001 study in the American

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.530
Journal of Public Health found, quote "drug
use is equally distributed across poor, middle

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.680
class, and wealthy communities" But stereotypes
are just that, in reality, the Economic Policy

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.640
Institute found poor families worked more
hours than rich families in the boom years

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.240
of the 1990s, because they needed two or more
jobs to reach similar income levels.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.180
Studies on rich kids seem to be less common,
but those that are there seem kind of "no

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.710
duh" science. Seven studies out of the University
of Michigan found "upper-class" individuals

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.860
were more likely to break the law while driving,
take valued goods from others, cheat to win

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.770
a prize, endorse unethical behavior at work,
and exhibit unethical decision-making. And

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.590
then in a separate study, they found wealthier
people are more likely to think "greed is

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.250
justified, beneficial, and morally defensible."
Which all fits with our rich-stereotypes when

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.860
stories come out that found Long Island families
paying stand-ins as much as 3500 dollars to

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.160
take SAT tests for their kids.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.350
Of course, the SAT doesn't even really matter
for rich kids according to an an economics

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.430
study from the Russell Sage Foundation. Because
even the best performing poor kids will only

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.489
find themselves neck-in-neck with high school
dropout rich kids. Yep, rich kids can drop

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.810
out of high school and perform as well as
a poor college graduate.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.390
So why do rich kids do better? Time and money.
Parents can spend more time with their children,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.959
and will talk to them, on average, three hours
more per week, and of course, the parents

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.049
have resources to protect and foster these
kids -- for example, 1 percenters can inherit

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:46.999
the family business or wealth -- degree, diploma,
or not. Plus, they can spend money on 'enrichment

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:54.739
activities,' and DO with spending going up
151 percent from 1972 to 2006.

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.810
Though rich kids can graduate from college
debt free, they'll have a lower GPA on average,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.749
according to a 2013 study published in the
American Sociological Review. Though afterwards

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.120
they can use family connections to gain internship
positions and tap family resources for supplemental

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.670
income and down-payments on real estate.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.579
Though, a new study from Cornell, using the
National Center for Education Statistics found

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.749
the rich DO give back in a more indirect way…
because they tend to study Visual and Performing

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:27.540
Arts, English, History, Communications, Economics,
Politics, Mathematics, Biology and Sociology

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.340
because they're not driven by economic incentive.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.310
Even though a lot of research finds rich kids
might be kind of awful, some will contribute

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.919
to society in important ways! For example,
the decades-long National Longitudinal Study

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:45.040
of 12,000 people found artists tend to come
from rich families, making 35 percent less

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.859
than their parents! While doctors usually
best their parents incomes by more than 40

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:59.309
percent -- because they come from poorer families!

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:05.209
Are you a rich kid? We want to hear from you!
What do you think of these studies?

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:25.620
I'd still be slinging salad and breadsticks
in mid-Michigan to get by.
