[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.794 --> 00:00:07.460
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS:
Thank you for coming.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.330
I want to let you know that
this is a coming-of-age memoir.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.090
So it's like, I don't really
know much about my father's

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.020
business life, just in case
anybody wants to get up and go.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.510
Like, oh.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.640
This memoir took me
a long time to write.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.090
Probably memoirs generally
are artistic projects.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.022
My guess is they often
take a long time.

00:00:27.022 --> 00:00:29.230
But it took me a while
because in the very beginning,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.270
I found myself sort of
disappearing on the pages,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.870
and this is a coming-of-age
memoir about a girl-- me--

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.770
growing up in the '80s and '90s
in Northern California, Silicon

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.210
Valley, and against the backdrop
of a complicated family.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.400
And so it was problematic if I
wasn't showing up on the pages.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.432
I think some of the scenes
would be kind of good.

00:01:00.432 --> 00:01:01.390
They'd have my parents.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.890
They'd have a little
bit of action.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.900
I had to figure out you have
to write a scene, it turns out,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.400
if you're going
to write a memoir.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.470
I could write, but
I wrote essays,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.390
and if you write an
essay for this long--

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.070
this is a 400-page book--

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.097
you sort of lose everyone
after page 10, I guess,

00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:16.180
because it's so condensed.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.790
So instead, I had to learn
to write scenes, which

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.450
mean that I'm letting you live
in the moments of my past,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.950
I guess.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.600
But I was disappearing in them.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.850
So the stakes of writing
this memoir felt kind of high

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.900
because I think that the
last thing I wanted to do

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.460
was be a person--

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.350
the child of a
celebrity, essentially--

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.015
and be writing a memoir, because
a celebrity memoir-- like,

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:52.515
cringe.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.380
But I felt, I guess,
that there was

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.830
a kind of quality of
disappearing in my own life,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.960
and that if I would
write this book,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.540
I could write other
books after, but I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.490
couldn't write those
other books until I

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.880
solved this disappearing
issue and this shame issue.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.490
It's almost like in
high school English

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.580
when you have to identify the
themes of different books.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.800
And even though this
is a non-fiction book,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.490
when I condensed it down to
its essence, there was a theme,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.530
and it was a question
of illegitimacy.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.420
Did I have a right to
stand on the ground?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.962
My own story-- why did
I have a right to exist?

00:02:32.962 --> 00:02:34.920
And so in that sense,
even though I'm saying it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.650
rather dramatically, I guess
it's kind of universal,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.250
because I think that's
a more common question.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.070
So what happened-- the fix for
the disappearance, I think,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.700
was that one of the
inspirations that I read--

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.365
Tobias Wolff's,
"This Boy's Life."

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.940
It's a memoir.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.240
And I noticed that the
more naughty and devious

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.730
and bad young Tobias was,
the more I totally loved him.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.890
So I was like, oh, OK.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.820
So I started to
access my character

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.240
through noticing
where I did things

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.560
that were kind of shameful.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.930
And then, as I wrote
them, the scenes

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.170
were pretty good because
they had life to them.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.150
And so then, I
guess, in that way,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.980
I sort of began to
appear on the pages.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.130
So I'll start with--

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.050
I'll read you from a little bit
of the beginning of the book.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.150
This is a sort of terribly
embarrassing story

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.770
which happened,
obviously, of noticing

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.452
that I was taking things.

00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:42.160
So like many of the
stories in this book,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.200
I thought, oh, God,
I can't include it.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.030
But then ultimately,
it's in here.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.640
Three months before he died,
I began to steal things

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.110
from my father's house.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.270
I wandered around barefoot
and slipped objects

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.530
into my pockets.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.040
I took blush, toothpaste,
two chipped finger bowls

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.160
in celadon blue, a
bottle of nail polish,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.920
a pair of worn patent
leather ballet slippers,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.230
and four faded,
white pillowcases

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.000
the color of old teeth.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.520
After stealing each
item, I felt sated.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.250
I promised myself that this
would be the last time.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.260
But soon, the urge to
take something else

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.570
would arrive again like thirst.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.930
I tiptoed into my father's room,
careful to step over the creaky

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.519
floorboard at the entrance.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.200
This room had been
his study when

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.250
he could still climb the
stairs, but he slept here now.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.550
It was cluttered with books and
mail and bottles of medicine,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.240
glass apples, wooden apples,
awards and magazines and stacks

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.050
of paper.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.510
There were framed prints
by [INAUDIBLE] of twilight

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.130
and sunset at temples.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.880
A patch of pink light stretched
out on a wall beside him.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.370
He was propped up in
bed, wearing shorts.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.230
His legs were bare
and thin as arms,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.210
bent up like a grasshopper's.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.280
"Hey, Leese," he said.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.560
[INAUDIBLE] Rinpoche
stood beside him.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.050
He'd been around recently
when I came to visit.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.030
A short Brazilian man
with sparkling brown eyes,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.230
the Rinpoche was a Buddhist monk
with a scratchy voice who wore

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.780
brown robes over a round belly.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.970
We call him by his title.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.850
Tibetan holy men were
sometimes born in the West

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.190
now in places like Brazil.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.050
To me, he didn't seem holy.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.320
He wasn't distant
or inscrutable.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.460
Near us, a black
canvas bag of nutrients

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.640
hummed with a motor and a pump,
the tube disappearing somewhere

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.530
under my father's sheets.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.360
"It's a good idea
to touch his feet,"

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.270
the Rinpoche said, putting his
hands around my father's foot

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.824
in the bed like this.

00:05:28.824 --> 00:05:30.240
I didn't know if
the foot touching

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.280
was supposed to be for my father
or for me or for both of us.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.100
"OK," I said, and took his
other foot in its thick sock,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.370
even though it was strange
watching my father's face

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.500
because when he winced
in pain or anger,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.410
it looked similar to
when he started to smile.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.740
"That feels good," my father
said, closing his eyes.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.040
I glanced at the chest
of drawers beside him

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.540
and at the shelves on the other
side of the room for objects

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.900
I wanted, even though I knew I
wouldn't dare steal something

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.940
out right in front of him.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.830
While he slept, I
wandered through the house

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.810
looking for I didn't know what.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.210
A nurse sat on the couch in
the living room, her hands

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.870
on her lap, listening for my
father to call out for help.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.510
The house was quiet,
the sounds muffled.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.140
The white, painted brick walls
were dimpled like cushions.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.750
In the cabinet of the
half-bath near the kitchen,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.150
where there used to be a
tattered copy of the "Bhagavad

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.710
Gita," I found a bottle of
expensive rose facial mist.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.600
With the door closed,
the light out,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.420
sitting on the toilet seat,
I sprayed it up into the air

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.950
and closed my eyes.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.160
The mist fell around
me, cool and holy,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.900
as in a forest or
an old stone church.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.090
There was also a tube
of silver lip gloss

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.170
with a brush at one end and a
twisting mechanism at the other

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.020
that released liquid into
the center of the brush.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.880
I had to have it.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.980
I stuffed the lip
gloss into my pocket

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.650
to take back to the one-bedroom
apartment in Greenwich Village

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.250
that I shared with my boyfriend,
where I knew, as much as I have

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.190
ever known anything, that
this tube of lip gloss

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.200
would complete my life.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.240
Between avoiding the
housekeeper, my brother

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.640
and sisters, and my
stepmother around the house

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.250
so I wouldn't be
caught stealing things,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.800
or hurt when they didn't
acknowledge me or reply

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.920
to my hellos, and spraying
myself in the darkened bathroom

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.040
to feel less like I was
disappearing because

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.050
inside the falling
mist, I had a sense

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.910
of having an outline again.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.850
Making efforts to see my
sick father in his room

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.460
began to feel like a
burden, a nuisance.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.410
For the past year, I'd
visited every weekend,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.030
every other month or so.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.240
I'd given up on the possibility
of a grand reconciliation,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.900
the kind in movies, but
I kept coming anyway.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.300
Before I said goodbye,
I went to the bathroom

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.950
to mist one more time.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.620
The spray was
natural, which meant

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.210
that over the course
of a few minutes,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.080
it no longer smelled sharp like
roses, but fetid and stinky

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.990
like a swamp, although I
didn't know it at the time.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.090
As I came into his
room, he was getting

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.750
into a standing position.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.470
I watched him gather both
of his legs in one arm,

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.480
twist himself 90
degrees by pushing

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.820
against the headboard
with the other arm,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.760
and then use both arms to hoist
his own legs over the edge

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.650
of the bed and onto the floor.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.980
When we hugged, I could feel
his vertebrae, his ribs.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.650
He smelled musty,
like medicine sweat.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.660
"I'll be back soon," I said.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.090
We detached, and I
started walking away.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.020
"Leese?"

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.770
"Yeah?"

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.650
"You smell like a toilet."

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.800
It was the rose spray.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.050
And this is one scene of many.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.240
I actually returned
all the things.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.590
This is not a story of a theft.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.909
Although I did like the idea
of theft as a kind of metaphor

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.559
for what I was doing,
there's a terror

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.870
when you're writing a
memoir because even if you

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.059
want to write about
yourself, you find

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.991
that you have just yourself.

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:46.490
You find that you necessarily
pull all these other people up

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.890
into your net, and so
you have a responsibility

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.350
to do the best job with
them you can-- to be kind,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.620
and to be honest,
and to try to capture

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.940
some element of their character,
at least as it relates

00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.900
to your own life.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.650
But sometimes, you aren't
able to capture necessarily

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.450
the fullness of
everyone's character.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.450
You're capturing how
they're interesting to you,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.370
and you're using
them in a certain way

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.100
to tell an emotional
story of yourself.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.360
But I did get an email once
from my mother's ex-boyfriend,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.930
and the email was
titled "Correction."

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.160
And I thought, oh, no.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.200
And I went into it, and he said
that there was a person named

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.990
Ron in my book, and perhaps
I had described him,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.120
and that this person
named Ron in my book

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.090
had many similarities to
this boyfriend, who was also

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.700
named Ron, in that they
both worked for NASA

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.940
and that they both had dated
my mother at a certain point,

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.570
but that I described this
person, who clearly wasn't him,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:50.300
as having hair tufted on
the sides like a clown

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:56.000
and having a totally
shiny, bald head

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.760
and walking with
his feet splayed out

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.890
and having lips like a fish.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.510
I thought, oh, God.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.790
And so he said, I've attached
a photograph of myself

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.910
for further reference if
you do want to describe me,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.740
and he had a picture of Fabio.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.440
But then I thought,
oh, no, why have I

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.090
described this man, who is quite
wonderful, in this sort of not

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.699
very flattering way?

00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:20.240
And then I thought
back on that scene

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.970
and I realized, oh, it was
because I was meeting him

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.110
for the very first time.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.000
He'd just started
dating my mother,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.160
and I felt possessive
of my mother,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.260
and I wasn't sure I
liked him so much.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.220
And so that's why I had
described him that way.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.960
Now that I've already
described myself

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.399
in a sort of compromised
way, the only way

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.940
I felt like I had permission to
describe other people the way

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.920
that they were and with all of
their eccentricities is like,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.639
I had to describe my own.

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:47.180
The other thing I
can say right now--

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.580
I'm just worried that
in my scatterbrain-ness,

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.460
I'll forget later-- is something
like, I'm trying to give people

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.370
the chance to have
their own story

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.079
within the pages of my story.

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:59.120
So I think different people
take different things

00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.720
from this book.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.890
They have different
relationships

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.350
with their parents, and they
had different coming-of-age

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.070
stories.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.550
And it's been sort of a
victory to me, this idea

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.340
that I've brought up people's
pasts for themselves,

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.050
because they've come
up to me at readings

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.870
and they've said, oh, that
feels exactly like me.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.370
I'm a single mother.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.290
Or they've said, oh, my
father was like that.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.800
He would make jokes like that,
or he was difficult like that.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.440
And I've noticed that if you
read a book at a certain point

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.840
in your life, maybe a book
that you love, and then

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.760
you wait 10 years and
you read it again,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.120
it's almost like it's a
totally different book.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.420
And I have a feeling it's
not the book that changed.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.650
I think it's that we
continuously change,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.830
and then art, hopefully,
reflects our own changes back

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.524
to us.

00:11:41.524 --> 00:11:43.440
So I think that it's
sort of a difficult thing

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.690
because this book that
I wrote about my family

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.130
is now everyone else's book.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.930
It's not mine
anymore, and I have

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.499
to release it and say
whatever you get out of it,

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:53.790
it's what you're supposed to
get out of it because it's

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.384
your book now.

00:11:54.384 --> 00:11:55.800
Of course, it's a
little difficult

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.424
because it's my
family, and sometimes I

00:11:57.424 --> 00:11:59.520
want to say, no, that's
not what I meant.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.660
But that doesn't
really matter anymore.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.990
But without further
ado, the Ron story.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.610
Since she'd become
interested in Ron,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.120
she no longer paid attention
to me as astutely, I thought.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.430
She no longer
consulted the I Ching.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.500
She was half-absent
with happiness,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.060
the same slight
smile on her lips

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.000
as when she ran up the hill
to get the prickly pear.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.280
It was between boyfriends,
between the loneliness

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.620
and despair that
followed one and the lift

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.480
that began the next, where
I hoped to stay forever,

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.620
she and I the only
team, the real couple.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.345
On the night of the date,
Ron arrived on time.

00:12:31.345 --> 00:12:32.970
She was leaning over
the bathroom sink,

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.980
doing her makeup
when he knocked.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.720
I ran to open the door.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.000
I saw right away that
Ron wasn't a hippie.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.360
He was bald, with hair tufted
on the side like a clown's, and

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.850
had wide, bushy
eyebrows, glasses

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.180
rimmed with gold, and large,
swollen lips like a fish.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.150
He looked clean and smelled
of soap and detergent.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.990
"Hello," I said.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.010
"I'm Lisa.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.660
My mom's getting ready."

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.450
"Nice to meet you," he
said, holding out his hand.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.190
He followed me into
the living room.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.310
I noticed that as he walked, his
feet splayed out dramatically

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.732
to either side.

00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:05.190
My mother called
from the bathroom.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.786
"I'll be out in a minute."

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.910
As we passed the bookshelf,
I reached for the album

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.590
of photographs of my birth.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.060
This was unplanned.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.790
It surprised even me,
one arm jutting out

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.950
as if I didn't have
control of my limbs,

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.260
and pulled it out of
its socket on the shelf.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.837
I was seven years
old at this point.

00:13:20.837 --> 00:13:22.920
I'd asked her to get rid
of this album many times,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.720
and she refused,
bringing it with us

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.430
as we move from house to house.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.290
The cover was made of
brown, woven grasses,

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.748
and because it was
old, the grasses

00:13:29.748 --> 00:13:31.320
had started to
fray at the edges.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.620
To me, too, this hinted at
the shame of the contents.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.090
I suspected other
children didn't

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.330
have shameful books like
this around in their houses.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.220
He and I sat down on
the flowered couch

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.520
beside each other.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.460
"I want to show you
something," I said,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.040
"just some photos of
my mother and me."

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.740
I opened the book across my
lap where he could see it.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.710
My mother, younger, lying
on a bed with long hair

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.560
like dark water pooling
around her face.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.690
These were the pictures
of my birth in black

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.962
and white with rounded corners.

00:13:59.962 --> 00:14:01.920
She had what looked like
a man's shirt buttoned

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.710
around her chest, and she was
naked from the waist down,

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.680
with her legs bent and open in
the foreground of the photo.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.850
I turned the page.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.760
There I was, emerging from
between her glowing white legs

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.460
like a turtle rising
up from a pond.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.920
In the following
pictures, once I was out,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.800
you could see my body
wrinkled, my face wax-white,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.690
asymmetrical, and squished.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.240
I felt revulsion and
disgust, and yet I

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.730
continued to turn the
pages, I would not

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.590
have known how to articulate it.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.800
I wanted to disgust him
the way I was disgusted,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.670
to scare him away, to show him
who we were so that he might

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.950
leave now rather than wait.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.280
"And here's more," I said
in my sweetest voice.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.230
"Yes," he said, "I see."

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.420
He made no motion
to rise and run.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.370
He sat, glancing at
the pages and then

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.566
looking away as if distracted.

00:14:49.566 --> 00:14:51.690
When my mother came out of
the bathroom and saw us,

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.730
she snatched the
album from my hands

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.070
and stuck it back in
its place on the shelf,

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.520
giving me a furious look.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.840
So I think one of
the things also

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.760
that I'm trying to
do with this book is

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.260
to get so particular about
my life that, in some ways,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.124
it gets universal
so that people--

00:15:07.124 --> 00:15:09.540
I think that the Steve Jobs
thing can be quite distracting

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.010
and people think, oh, my
life must be so different.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.630
But then, when they read
it, it's not so different.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.630
Usually people have complicated
people that they love,

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:24.300
and they have bumps in
the road of coming of age.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.210
And I think in some
ways, the contrasts

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.690
are quite high in this
book, in my story.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:35.070
But the more I hear from
other people and the more I--

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.100
and because I know people and
have friends and love people,

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.710
I know that people also
have stories like this,

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.750
even if they don't have the same
degree of notoriety, I guess.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.560
But I had to use people in
my life that I loved to stand

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.800
in for other things, and I
was doing a reading actually

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.070
at my old high school, where
everyone who was in this memoir

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.200
was there-- it was
kind of terrifying--

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:03.060
and including my ex-boyfriend,
my high school boyfriend, who--

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.980
I wrote some things about him.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.577
And I think he's certainly
a more interesting person

00:16:09.577 --> 00:16:10.410
than on these pages.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.870
On these pages, he's
in relation to me.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.190
But what I was thinking about
his character in the book

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:22.500
is that he stands
for California.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.600
Falling in love
with him is a way

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.430
of explaining the Bay
Area where I grew up.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.190
And I'm sure lots of you--

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.240
I imagine lots of you
have been to the Bay Area,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.860
because Google.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.810
And actually, I
guess Google started

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.435
in the garage of my
journalism teacher.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.100
And she ran the paper
in my high school,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.120
and it hadn't started yet.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.230
It was a twinkle in
someone's eye, I guess.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.170
But it was just about
to start in these pages,

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.367
although I didn't know.

00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:56.200
But anyway, this isn't
a story about Google.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.430
This is a story about me.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.930
So this is the story of
high school in the Bay Area,

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:10.359
and I was writing this book
from the cold wilds of Brooklyn

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.540
and imagining
sunshine and imagining

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.950
air that had perfume in it
of eucalyptus and bay laurel

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.859
and the grasses on the hills.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.871
And it was a nice place
to live for a long time.

00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:26.079
Now I'm going to have to
actually go back to Brooklyn

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.840
and live in Brooklyn.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.000
But it was a nice way to
time travel, spend time

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.960
with my young parents,
and travel through space

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.210
and be in the Bay Area
again, which is so beautiful.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.310
On the way home from
another visit to my school,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.680
to "the" school,
my father suggested

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.740
that we stop at Palo Alto High
School, "Pally" for short,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.600
just to see what it was like.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.910
It was late in the afternoon
and school was out.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.580
For a few minutes, we walked
around the empty quad.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.560
Many of the buildings
looked like bunkers.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.380
I felt uncomfortable, as
if we were trespassing.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.712
But then we heard music
coming from somewhere,

00:17:58.712 --> 00:18:00.670
and we followed it over
to where a tall boy was

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.000
standing beside the door, where
the music was coming from.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.730
I was too shy to speak,
but my father asked,

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.440
"What's going on in here?"

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.480
And the boy said,
"It's the paper,"

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.820
and we peered into the room.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.100
There were lots of people
inside working on computers

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.010
and lounging on
beanbags, and I thought

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.094
if I did decide to go here,
I'd work on the paper, too.

00:18:21.094 --> 00:18:22.510
"You know what's
great about going

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.070
to school nearby your house?"

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.780
my father asked as we left.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.980
"You can walk to it, like I did.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.670
And if you walk a lot
over the course of time,

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.830
you get to see the
seasons change."

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.610
He said it in the same, slow
way he spoke of beautiful women,

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.300
but walking to school didn't
sound very romantic to me.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:45.850
Nonetheless, I go to the school,
and now I'm in my senior year.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.530
In my senior year
at Pally, I was

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.580
elected to the position of
editor in chief of the paper.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.380
One day, in the
middle of the week,

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.120
there were technical problems.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.070
The computer systems crashed.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.510
The screens went dark.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.730
The printer became inaccessible.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.370
If the computers no longer
operated and would not reboot,

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.620
days of work would be lost--

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.200
all our carefully
designed pages.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.560
Josh, his dirty blond hair
the color of a sand dune

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.410
worn in a thick ponytail,
laid down on the floor

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.990
to inspect and
arrange the wires.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.770
The rest of us mulled in a
daze of terror and tragedy.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.700
"Do you want to come?"

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.390
he asked me about a trip to his
house to get a missing cord.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.730
I noticed Josh
more closely now--

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.520
dimples when he
smiled, wide shoulders

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.290
beneath flannel shirts.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.880
He was shy and friendly and had
loose, complicated handwriting,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.520
like the bouncing
string of a kite.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.630
"Sure," I said, not knowing then
that he lived in Portola Valley

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.490
20 minutes away.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.030
He seemed to me sloppy,
too relaxed, shambolic.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.217
He could fix computers,
but he was disorganized,

00:19:51.217 --> 00:19:53.800
forgetting to do his assignments
for Mrs. [? Paul's ?] English

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.640
class, whereas I was
meticulous, a grade grubber.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.690
He never arrived
anywhere on time,

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.299
and he was hopeless
with a calendar,

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:03.340
wouldn't have his homework
and scrambled to do it

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.840
in the minutes before class.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.320
Later, I would find out that he
was taking applied mathematics

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.480
and differential
equations at Stanford,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.210
and he would be admitted to
college at Stanford and MIT,

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:15.400
so he was clearly fine.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.610
He drove a used '83 Toyota
Supra in incandescent

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.970
teal with a pink sine wave
painted along both sides.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.000
"Sorry about the paint
job," he said as we got in.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.180
He bought it used from a
female physicist in Livermore.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.670
He had nice hands on
the steering wheel.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.640
His room had a mattress on the
floor and a window looking out

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.620
to a yard and the forest.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.050
There were papers and
books strewn around,

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.930
a stack of stereo
equipment and headphones.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.150
It was large enough to
seem empty and cluttered

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.470
at the same time.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.780
He found the cord, and we left.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.320
On the way back, we turned onto
[INAUDIBLE],, a two-lane road,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.070
rough and patched, that wound
beside a nature preserve.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.900
"I'm going to show you
a secret," he said.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.370
"Hold on."

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.390
The speed limit was 25.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.056
He began to accelerate.

00:21:01.056 --> 00:21:02.680
We advanced toward
a blind corner where

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.600
the road rose up and
then disappeared,

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.180
a hill on one side,
a drop on the other.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.720
The road curled back on itself
around the hill, out of sight.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.030
Another car might be
advancing toward us

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.370
and smash into us at the bend.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.980
A family of deer might
be walking across.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.470
He continued to build
speed, shifting up--

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.540
third, fourth, fifth.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.610
The car rumbled and whined.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.290
"Are you sure you should be--"

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:27.730
"Don't worry," he yelled.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.290
"I've done it before."

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.920
My mother sometimes said
there are guardian angels just

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.540
for teenagers.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.940
"Oh, help me, God
of teenagers," I

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.460
thought, "oh God of teenagers."

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.270
"Hold on!" he yelled.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.680
The car scraped.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.600
The gears sang.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.782
I gripped the top of the
seat belt in one hand,

00:21:46.782 --> 00:21:47.990
the door handle in the other.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.800
He shifted again, peeled
around the blind curve,

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.540
and then we flew.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.110
It was because of the uneven
road, a raised portion followed

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.360
by a long dip downhill.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.420
If you got up enough speed, you
could catch the lip of the up

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.690
and fly over the concavity,
through the dots of light cast

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.090
by the row of emerald
trees and bushes

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.830
growing alongside the road.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.860
For me, the flight
unlidded the town.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.784
There were hidden places of
freedom, and he knew them.

00:22:15.784 --> 00:22:16.700
And then we're dating.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.860
[CHUCKLING]

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.110
Sometimes in the late
afternoon after school,

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.870
during the weeks when we were
not producing the newspaper,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.000
Josh and I went to
Windy Hill Preserve

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.300
up above skyline, hills wide and
yellow and soft like the humps

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.754
of camels, on one
side more hills,

00:22:31.754 --> 00:22:33.920
like a blanket thrown out
into the wind, all the way

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.020
to the Pacific Ocean.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.590
The town was a miniature
below us, silent and still

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.960
except for the singing,
rasping wind that

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.120
flattened the tall grasses.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.630
A clear day, too much to
take in, the glassy air

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.590
and the feeling of great freedom
and grace, the world opening--

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.930
I looked north, and I could
see San Francisco sparkling

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.320
in the distance.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.980
It was both close and
far away, something

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.570
to do with the
angle of this hill

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.210
to those hills, the
refraction of the light.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.790
That's how I felt
about my parents

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.380
now that Josh was around--

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.669
not that I didn't worry
about my mom or my father

00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:11.960
or what would happen when he
realized that I was really

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.490
leaving for college.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.950
I was simply hovering
above it all so

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.900
it didn't pinch or press.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.750
Now Josh was the one who drove
me to doctors appointments

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.520
or between houses.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.610
He did not keep a calendar,
forgot about work assignments

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.070
and missed dentist appointments
and other appointments,

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.380
but never the ones with me.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.725
I was protected
inside his teal Supra.

00:23:33.725 --> 00:23:36.710
After the spring
rains, when the grasses

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.320
came up out of the claws of dirt
under the oak and eucalyptus

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.960
trees around Stanford,
viridian fuzz

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.490
like whiskers, stripes of gold
light in long, bright ribbons,

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.550
I thought, "This is my town."

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.930
I walked home after school and
noticed the seasons change.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.740
Before this, it was my father's
town or my mother's town,

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.930
or the town where I'd
been placed by accident

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.640
and shifted around.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.530
Now I was in love,
and the land was

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.560
dimensional and heavy
and particulate.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.401
It belonged to me.

00:24:08.401 --> 00:24:08.900
Thank you.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.183
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:13.262 --> 00:24:13.970
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:14.780
That was awesome.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.904
Thank you for the readings.

00:24:15.904 --> 00:24:17.130
They were really great.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:21.190
When you think about your dad,
how would you describe him?

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.760
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS: It's hard
to sum it up so quickly.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.350
Very human, I would say.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.910
It was interesting.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.464
I was talking about
time traveling.

00:24:29.464 --> 00:24:31.630
One thing you get to do
when you're writing a memoir

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.610
is you get to go and hang
out-- at least I did.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.830
You get to go and hang
out with your parents

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.420
when they're younger
than you are now.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.350
So you get to notice
that they're human,

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.165
and one thing that
I noticed was that--

00:24:47.165 --> 00:24:49.540
so my father wasn't really
around when I was very little.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:25:00.090
I was unexpected, unwanted, and
my parents were both so young.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:05.190
And his career trajectory was
just beginning then and really

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.860
starting to ramp up,
as far as I understand.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.830
So he wasn't around.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.020
And then, at a
certain point, he must

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.430
have made a pretty
clear decision

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:18.810
to come back and be
a part of my life.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.830
And I think for
me, at the time--

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.930
and you will see in the book--

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.270
it was very awkward.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.770
We wanted to get
to know each other,

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.936
but I think he was very
young and didn't really know

00:25:30.936 --> 00:25:33.720
how to be with kids, and
I had been dreaming of him

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.940
for so long that it was
like I wanted him to arrive

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.130
on the scene with a real bam.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:43.830
And he was, in some
ways, the dream father

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.660
in the sense of being
the father you dream

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.160
about when you don't have one.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.390
He was famous, and
he was rich, and he

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.480
was incredibly charismatic,
and he was handsome,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.100
and he drove a Porsche.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.090
And so it's kind of like
this realer-than-real,

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.820
larger-than-life arrival.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.550
But in another way,
it was disappointing

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.930
because he was so awkward.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.910
There were these long pauses.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.760
And I went back as
a part of this book

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.361
and watched this
next presentation.

00:26:15.361 --> 00:26:16.860
It was the introduction
to the next,

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.780
I think, at Davies Symphony
Hall in San Francisco.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.590
And I had already
written about it,

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.340
but I wanted to watch
the presentation

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.890
because I wanted to make
sure that what I'd remembered

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.300
was correct.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.150
And I'm not really a
Steve Jobs completionist,

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.780
so I don't really watch
his old presentations.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.780
I was there at some of
them, and the other ones,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.010
he was my father,
not this figure.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.030
But I got myself to
watch the presentation,

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.780
and I'd remembered looking
at him from the perspective

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.170
of a daughter and him being
kind of amazing and larger

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:48.670
than life.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.230
And then when I watched the
presentation again on YouTube,

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.164
he was incredible.

00:26:53.164 --> 00:26:55.080
I was like, oh, wow, he
really was incredible.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.890
This wasn't just the
perspective of a daughter.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.000
He seemed so at ease in
front of so many people.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.010
And so I guess--

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.310
this is kind of a terrible word,
but so relatable, so simple

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.930
and human at the
same time as being

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.040
so sparkling and incredible.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.930
And so set against our
personal interactions

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.852
when we were getting to
know each other, we were--

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:27.810
the first time I was
going to stay at his house

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.550
overnight because my
mother was taking a class,

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.300
and I went to his company and
waited for him for a while.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.120
Then we got in his car,
in his amazing Porsche,

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.250
and drove to his mansion.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.660
And the whole drive,
he didn't say a word.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.370
And at the time,
I thought maybe it

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:48.559
was something I
did, or maybe if I

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:50.100
had been more of a
conversationalist,

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.190
or maybe he was mad at me.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.450
And I realized, looking
back as an adult, spending

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.940
time with this
young, awkward man,

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.180
that he actually just was
kind of doing his best,

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.400
and he was quite human.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:08.520
So it was wonderful to have
certain revelations like that,

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.240
to give myself
permission to understand

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.370
who he might have been
as a father and a person

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.828
and where he might
have been coming

00:28:15.828 --> 00:28:20.670
from as a complicated
and incomplete person

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.744
as we all are.

00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:25.160
I hope that answers
your question.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.550
Again, I'm the last person
to talk about his work life,

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.612
right?

00:28:29.612 --> 00:28:32.070
AUDIENCE: I feel like when you
look back at your childhood,

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.870
a lot of people
have patchy memories

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.030
or may have remembered
something incorrectly,

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.850
that then somebody tells you
the story later, an older

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.230
adult that may have been there.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.090
So I'm wondering if you had
more of those revelations

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.520
as you were writing about
them, things that you thought

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.770
happened a certain way,
and then as you started

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.260
to describe them, you
realized, actually, that's not

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.219
at all what happened.

00:28:50.219 --> 00:28:51.510
Did you have moments like that?

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.700
And what was one
that was interesting?

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.620
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS: I'm sure
I did have moments like that.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.097
So what happens is it's really
hard to remember so many things

00:29:01.097 --> 00:29:03.180
from your life, and I
wasn't sure at the beginning

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:10.420
I had enough memory to write a
whole book about my childhood.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.320
It's a coming-of-age book, so it
ends when I leave for college,

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.450
and I was terrified.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:21.060
But it turns out, when you start
to sit down and think and work

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.716
at it and write, something
about writing also helps.

00:29:24.716 --> 00:29:26.340
You get one story,
and then another one

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.500
connects to that story, and
then another one connects.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.080
And after a while, you have a
whole constellation of stories.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.460
And if you kind of pull this
end, this end kind of trembles.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:40.410
So I probably wrote seven
books for this book, stories

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.140
that helped me get to a
place, but that, in the end,

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:46.090
weren't necessary,
didn't merit inclusion.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:50.370
And I'm looking for the
stories in my life that

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:55.480
stand for several things,
maybe stories that

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.070
are kind of metaphors as well.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.400
And there was one time--

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.150
my father used always
used to say, "Leese,

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.140
you're going to remember this."

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.110
And I thought, what am
I, the record keeper?

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.910
But also, I thought, oh,
God, I hope I remember.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.743
Why would I remember
this particular moment?

00:30:07.743 --> 00:30:09.330
Because some of the
moments were very

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.670
poignant, perhaps, for him,
and they weren't for me.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.280
And so I didn't quite
understand what was going on.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.760
And there was one moment when
we were on a vacation in Hawaii.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.060
I think I was maybe nine.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.391
And he'd been-- especially
when I looked at this book

00:30:24.391 --> 00:30:25.890
and researched it,
I understood he'd

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.980
been wavering back and
forth about his paternity.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.240
It had been proven
by a DNA test,

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.440
but he still was saying he
wasn't my father in public

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.160
and to other people in private.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.590
But there was this moment
when we were in Hawaii,

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.375
and I do remember him sort
of pointing out body parts

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:45.000
and saying, look, we
have the same this

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.083
and we have the same this.

00:30:46.083 --> 00:30:49.590
And I remember he wanted to
sort of sit there for a while,

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.530
and his arm around my waist
kind of felt like a seat belt

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:56.220
because I wanted to run and leap
and jump to the desserts table.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.150
And I thought, why is he
keeping me-- this heaviness?

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.880
And I talked with his
ex-girlfriend, Tina,

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.080
and she remembered that time
too with a little more clarity.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.570
And she also was telling
me that he was even

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.300
saying to her that he wasn't
necessarily my father,

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.190
and it was at that
moment, because she

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:20.530
was there too, that she saw
that he was kind of claiming me.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:25.110
And so I had remembered
some part of that moment

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:29.970
from my child's perspective, but
the full import of that scene

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.890
was not apparent until I went
back and did some research

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.470
and understood what
was really going on.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:42.600
And it was wonderful to be able
to layer my childhood memories

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.560
and feelings and desires
and longings with the woman

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.390
that I am now who knows
so much more about people

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:54.480
and who can understand
more of what's going on.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.910
It was like I could keep
my child self company.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.440
I don't know if it
happens for you guys,

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.104
but sometimes things
happen when you're a kid

00:32:04.104 --> 00:32:05.520
and you don't know
what they mean.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.210
And so it's those things that
you keep and preserve and bring

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:12.540
forward into your
adulthood, maybe

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.192
because you hope at
some point you'll

00:32:15.192 --> 00:32:16.650
have the information
and the wisdom

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:21.270
and the knowledge to be able to
sort of open up those mysteries

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.951
and make sense of them later.

00:32:22.951 --> 00:32:24.450
And so the process
of writing really

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.710
was a process of opening up
all these long closed boxes

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.520
and seeing what was inside.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.260
And sometimes what was inside
was a run-of-the-mill story,

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:40.830
and sometimes what was inside
was more than I had anticipated

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.110
and changed my own
perspective of my past.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.770
And I guess I do hope to do
that for other people reading

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.290
the book also.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:56.400
I hope to maybe change
other people's perspective

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.790
or deepen their own
awareness or their memories

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:00.619
of their own past.

00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:02.910
I think it's definitely
happened for people who grew up

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.400
in California
because they're like,

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.280
the smells, because I have
so many smells in this book,

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.810
maybe too many smells.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:16.030
But I think childhood also has
a lot of these mysteries in it.

00:33:18.492 --> 00:33:20.200
There's a thing you
do as a kid, I guess.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.630
You use anything you've got
because you don't really

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.620
have much.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.460
So remembering all the times
I kind of subtly and not

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.450
so subtly tried to use my
father's fame to prop myself

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.630
up-- how embarrassing is that?

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:38.560
And then, trying to forgive
that young person for--

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.320
or be able to chuckle
at the young person

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.560
for doing whatever she
could do and being scrappy.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.480
Yes?

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.190
AUDIENCE: So another
funny connection--

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:50.320
your journalism
teacher, I believe,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.820
is [INAUDIBLE],, one of whose
daughters is YouTube CEO.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.670
Another daughter was
married to Sergey Brin,

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.770
I think, for a little while.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.630
To what extent were
these connections

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.925
to the rest of Silicon Valley
connected as part of your life?

00:34:04.925 --> 00:34:06.550
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS:
Google was beginning

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.429
in her garage I think around
the time I was graduating,

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.980
or maybe just about
when I went to college,

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.060
and I had just about no idea.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.139
So amazing things can
be happening around you,

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:20.830
and you can not know
about them, even if you're

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.830
right in the epicenter of them.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.092
I don't think anyone
particularly knew.

00:34:27.092 --> 00:34:28.300
So yes, that was [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.880
And I was saying I had an
event at my high school

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.840
with [INAUDIBLE] the other
day, and almost everyone

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.389
in the memoir was
there, which I can

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.330
tell you is kind of terrifying.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:45.460
But I'm relating to
my story as the story

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.920
of a girl with a father
and a mother growing up

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:54.719
in California at that time,
not as the story of a titan,

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.820
nor of a Silicon Valley guru.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:03.130
I get to talk about how Silicon
Valley was because I lived it.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:08.880
But I certainly was not a
part of the business aspect.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.850
I guess that's interesting
in its own way.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.610
I remember coming
back in college--

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:18.980
and it was during the first
dot.com boom, I think--

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.440
and noticing that every
other car was a Ferrari,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.291
and there were
lots of high heels.

00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:25.040
And I'd never seen
high heels in Palo Alto

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.560
before that, so I was like, wow,
what's happened to my place?

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.973
And now, going back, of
course, it's vastly different.

00:35:35.594 --> 00:35:37.260
I think this is more
of a story everyone

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:43.260
can relate with, even though
it has dramatic ups and downs.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.500
Yes?

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.940
AUDIENCE: You've talked about
how you looked at your father

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.410
and you were trying
to from the outside

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.630
learn how he was feeling
about being your father,

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.966
like the thing with the arm.

00:35:56.966 --> 00:35:58.590
I was wondering if
you've ever actually

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.870
had an open conversation
with him about this,

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:04.230
if you ever asked him why it was
so difficult for him to accept

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.705
that he is your father.

00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:07.455
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS:
That's a good question.

00:36:10.884 --> 00:36:13.050
It was hard to talk with
him about things like that.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.380
He said that he wasn't
so good at communicating.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.640
And there was a kind
of wonderful moment--

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.600
the end of the book.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.391
I'd been waiting for
this Hollywood moment.

00:36:23.391 --> 00:36:26.160
He was so sick, and I'd been
waiting for some sort of moment

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.310
of reconciliation.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.810
And of course, I
knew I was an idiot

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.581
because when do you get those
moments that are in the movies,

00:36:33.581 --> 00:36:34.080
right?

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.680
When the person says, I'm sorry,
or I understand how you felt.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.770
But still, I was waiting for
it, so I kept on returning home.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.510
And I think that's
why I was pilfering

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.040
these objects, because I
felt things weren't complete.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.520
But I couldn't really get
that conversation out of him,

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.430
and I was terrified.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.030
When we had talked about it
earlier, he'd said things like,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.030
just move on.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.870
He said at some point he was
sorry, and he said he loved me,

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.840
but it somehow wasn't
enough for what

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.640
felt like a kind of
tidal wave of grief,

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.170
actually, that we'd missed
each other for so long.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:20.470
So when he was dying, I
went back a month before.

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.530
And finally, we had a kind of
amazing moment where he said,

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.500
"I really owe you one,"
over and over again.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.470
And it's such an odd
phrase, "I owe you one."

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.590
He hadn't really said it
before, and I kept on wondering,

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.770
what is the one?

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:39.360
And he was also sad because he
hadn't really spent the time,

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.880
he said, and the
problem with dying

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.260
is I guess it's kind
of like a final end.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.960
So if you haven't spent the
time before that happens,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.280
then it's too late, you know?

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.290
So that felt very
meaningful, like OK, we're

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.040
on the same page.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.620
We missed something here.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.220
And I wish it had happened
earlier because it would

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.915
have been nice to be friends.

00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:06.990
It would've been nice to
have a feeling that he

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.820
had been unburdened
of this feeling

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.980
earlier so that we
were on the same page,

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.020
because we actually
really liked each other

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.010
and had some great
times together.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:21.400
He was also really funny, and he
was enjoyable to be with a lot.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.920
We had a lot of
fun on our skates,

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.730
and it felt like it was very
lucky, in some ways, that I

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.160
lived with him
during high school

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.470
because even though, as
you'll see in the book,

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:36.270
I am full-on in the midst
of adolescent angst,

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.370
I realized if we hadn't
lived together then,

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:41.910
we wouldn't have gotten to know
each other as well as we did.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:45.120
And that contains its
own kind of resolution,

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.260
because I guess if you know
someone more as a person,

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.960
their flaws become
more understandable,

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.560
and they perhaps become
less personal, I guess.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.150
I did feel-- and I write
about this in the book.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:04.680
But I did feel that I'd
been hearing about--

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.180
sometimes people
imitate my father

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.690
by imitating his wardrobe,
or they imitate maybe

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.870
some of the ways he could be
caustic and sharp and difficult

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.760
and sometimes cruel.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:22.260
And from my
experience, the sense

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.160
that he had an extremely
sensitive part--

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.400
very dear, very kind,
very simple, very caring.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.140
And it was from
that part, as far

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.320
as I could tell by knowing
some of his work colleagues

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.150
and by knowing him
to the degree that I

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:40.570
did-- it was from that
part from which he created.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:45.540
And so I wondered if perhaps
some of the imitations

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.540
of the caustic part--

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.870
if that part was the
part that was protecting

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:54.360
this ultra-sensitive core.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.040
And so if the imitations,
in that sense,

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.600
are a bit misguided.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.390
AUDIENCE: Given that you
and your dad didn't--

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:04.110
he didn't fully
accept you as his kid

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.830
until you were a
little bit older, how

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.540
did you deal with
that reconciliation

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.000
from your perspective,
both when you were a kid

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.656
and then as an adult when
you had more perspective?

00:40:14.656 --> 00:40:17.280
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS: I think this
book is going to answer so many

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.190
of your questions,
but in a subtle way.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:27.011
So I think I thought I had
gotten over it, sort of,

00:40:27.011 --> 00:40:29.010
because we had had a lot
of good times together,

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:32.250
and he'd apologized,
and we liked each other,

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.619
and we used to tease each other.

00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:36.660
But then, certain funny
things kept on happening.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.470
Like I was enraged that
he wouldn't get a couch.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.160
We had chairs.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.660
We had places to sit,
but my mother and I

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.217
had been sort of nomadic.

00:40:47.217 --> 00:40:48.550
We'd been a little bit rootless.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.370
We'd been searching for a
home, and so we didn't really

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.060
have a couch.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.850
We'd sort of taken one
from him at some point

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:58.710
and then carted this sort
of horrible couch around,

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:02.872
but this feeling that he owed
me a couch was so profound.

00:41:02.872 --> 00:41:04.830
So I would complain
bitterly about the couches,

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.880
and I felt so sad about it and
so deeply owed and so enraged,

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.970
disproportionate to what
a couch actually is.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.410
And I think that my sense of
grief about having lost him

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:19.470
became blame, became anger,
and would sort of attach itself

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.690
to these odd objects.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:28.290
So in that sense, I think, it
took a while to understand,

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:36.000
to get under the skin of
my own strange frustrations

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.390
and understand that
loss might have

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.980
been at the root
of them, which was

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.938
kind of another revelation
of writing the book.

00:41:42.938 --> 00:41:44.970
Oh, right, why was I so
fixated on the couch?

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:50.080
Oh, right, because I hadn't had
a father during all that time.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.870
I don't really tell
you this in the book,

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.170
but I think it
becomes kind of clear.

00:41:56.522 --> 00:41:57.980
Did you want to
ask a question too?

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:58.604
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:41:58.604 --> 00:42:03.110
My interest, I guess, is do
you have technology and use

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.190
technology in your life?

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.890
Do you have an iPhone, or do
you have an Android device?

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:10.080
There's lots of folks here that
work on a competitive product.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.590
And as a new mom,
do you have a plan

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.700
for how you're going to deal
with technology with your kids?

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.490
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS: First
of all, I have an iPhone

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.190
and I'm slightly bitter
because the new ones seem

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:20.150
to be so large, and I
have the smallest hands.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:25.367
And so it kind of
slips a bit, so maybe I

00:42:25.367 --> 00:42:26.950
need to get an Android
and solve that.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:27.450
No.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.790
[CHUCKLING]

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:30.200
I can say that--

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.970
and I love the
camera on the iPhone,

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.342
and I wrote my book on
an Apple, and I love it.

00:42:35.342 --> 00:42:36.800
But when I was
writing, it was very

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.450
difficult to interact with
the insta-texting world

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.120
while I was doing deeper work.

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.440
It would sort of pull me
out of profound thinking.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.197
So I would leave my phone
at a cafe down the street.

00:42:53.197 --> 00:42:54.780
And I was actually
dating at the time,

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.290
which made really
difficult to date

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.630
when you don't have a phone.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:03.020
But I would leave it at a
cafe, and they would hold it

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.240
for me, which is so odd, right?

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.470
Sometimes for days at a time.

00:43:08.704 --> 00:43:11.120
Because sometimes you get to
a hard place in your writing,

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.470
and you realize you're
writing really badly.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.330
And it feels like if you look
at your phone and you can text

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:20.082
with your friends or you can
look at some article that

00:43:20.082 --> 00:43:22.040
you've sort of solved
the problem, but in fact,

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:22.539
you haven't.

00:43:22.539 --> 00:43:26.000
You kind of have to
sit with the misery

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.440
of your own bad
sentences for a while.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.714
They become good,
but they started bad

00:43:30.714 --> 00:43:32.630
because I didn't know
where I was coming from.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:38.041
So hiding away my
phone was very useful,

00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:40.040
and sort of turning off
the internet for a while

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.430
was useful.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.630
So the relationship I
have with my devices

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.675
is close, but intermittent.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.880
And I've tried when I'm nursing
and when I'm with my son

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.360
not to be on the phone,
and me and our babysitter

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.570
have talked about trying
not to do that so much when

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.890
we're with him, because it feels
as if you're giving someone

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.580
concentrated attention,
but of course, you're not.

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.040
And I find the easiest
solution is to get rid of it

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.240
for-- he's crying.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.160
He's like-- sorry.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.060
That's my son.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.161
[CHUCKLING]

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:25.280
So I'm hoping for future books
it's not so fraught, that I'm

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.277
able to put my phone
in the other room

00:44:28.277 --> 00:44:29.360
and ignore it for a while.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.735
But I found with
this book, I had

00:44:30.735 --> 00:44:33.410
to either leave it
at a cafe, or later,

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:39.170
lock it in a food addictions
box for a time, which you

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.720
can get on Amazon, actually--

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.250
probably other places, too.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:46.310
[CHUCKLING]

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:52.760
So I wouldn't say love/hate, but
intermittent and close, maybe.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.576
Yes?

00:44:53.576 --> 00:44:55.200
AUDIENCE: So I was
thinking about this.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.380
You and your family, and
especially your father,

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.770
have been portrayed numerous
times in film and television.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:05.780
And have you paid
attention to any of this?

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:06.770
It must be weird.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.710
How do you feel about it,
just in general thoughts?

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:13.320
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS: I
assiduously avoid it.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.600
I didn't see the Sorkin movie,
and I didn't read the Isaacson

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:23.240
biography, and I don't read
the books about my father.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.880
I figure there's a scene in
"Pee-wee's Big Adventure."

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.530
My dad and I used to watch that.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.260
And they make a movie about
Pee-wee at the end of his big

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.847
adventure, and Dotty, his
friend, says, "Pee-wee,

00:45:32.847 --> 00:45:34.430
aren't you going to
watch your movie?"

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.200
And he says, "I
don't have to, Dotty.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.352
I lived it."

00:45:37.352 --> 00:45:38.310
So something like that.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.726
But also, I was
working on a book,

00:45:39.726 --> 00:45:42.020
and I thought, sometimes
you can look at a picture

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.210
and it informs your own memory.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.860
You stop remembering
what you remember

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.630
and you start
remembering the picture.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:51.110
And I felt it was very
important to not interact

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:55.970
with other people's
interpretations of my father's

00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:01.090
life with me as a bit character,
because it was already

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:04.127
a courageous act to decide I
got to be a main character.

00:46:04.127 --> 00:46:06.460
I think people will sometimes
pick up this book thinking

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.335
that they're getting a
book about Steve Jobs,

00:46:08.335 --> 00:46:11.950
and they will be plunged
into the coming-of-age sagas

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:15.220
of a girl, which I
think is wonderful.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:18.760
Maybe it's a book some
people wouldn't normally buy.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.430
But I'm actually finding men
are liking it a lot, too, which

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:24.355
I was hoping for, and
which surprises me

00:46:24.355 --> 00:46:29.840
because it is so specifically
about a woman or a girl.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.310
But yeah, I don't
interact with them,

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.750
and I don't have
difficulty avoiding press.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.647
Even during this book tour,
I've had to keep my equanimity,

00:46:38.647 --> 00:46:40.480
and the way I've done
that is by not reading

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.670
any reviews or press,
because when I think of it,

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.160
I sort of get a
pit in my stomach.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.510
It's hard to be part of another
person's narrative, which

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.660
is part of the reason I felt
heavy hearted about writing

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.570
my own narrative, because other
people would be a part of it.

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:01.730
And I've done the
best I could with it.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.680
And I think we do have the
right to write our own stories

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.510
or to come to terms
with our own stories,

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.370
but we don't necessarily
have the obligation

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:12.766
to participate in the
stories of others.

00:47:12.766 --> 00:47:14.140
AUDIENCE: I have
three daughters,

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:19.330
and I'm pretty comfortable with
my own passion for technology.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:22.670
I don't really share
much of that with them.

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:26.170
So I'm just kind
of wondering, you

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:31.030
having a father as very
passionate about technology,

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.330
what were your common grounds?

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:38.116
How did you connect
with each other?

00:47:38.116 --> 00:47:39.490
Because we have
our things we do,

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.950
because I know they're not
interested in all my technology

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.000
enthusiasm.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.710
LISA BRENNAN-JOBS:
You're like, gadgets?

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:45.490
No.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.230
More gadgets?

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.750
No.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:51.370
Yeah, I think people are
looking for connection and love

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:57.700
and humor from their
parents and their fathers.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.820
And the gadgets are such a
means to something, right?

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.480
They're not an end,
and they certainly

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.950
don't replace human contact,
would be my thought.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:17.740
So my father was, when
he was on his game,

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.660
totally delightful to
hang out with because he

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:24.110
was interested and curious
about a ton of things.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.950
And I guess the
way technology is

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:28.600
the best, from my
perspective, is

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.450
that it can help with
that kind of curiosity

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.550
and that kind of
investigation, but it doesn't

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.571
replace curiosity or hanging
out together or spending time

00:48:36.571 --> 00:48:37.070
together.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:41.980
And I think in my
experience of my father,

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.610
he was not an exception to that.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.810
He did not seem gadget obsessed.

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:53.260
He knew that I wasn't going
to talk with him for hours

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.500
about the iPhone.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.920
So we would take skates
and talk about roses

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.370
and talk about architecture
and talk about fonts

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:08.054
and talk about Palo Alto,
and he seemed very interested

00:49:08.054 --> 00:49:08.720
in those things.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.610
And I guess interest and
curiosity are infectious.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:16.770
So I think you're doing great.

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:18.000
Thank you so much for coming.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.500
Thank you.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.950
[APPLAUSE]
