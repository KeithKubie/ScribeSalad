&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.620
&gt;&gt; John Kelly: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.240
Welcome. My name is John Kelly.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.620
I'm a columnist at
the Washington Post.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.970
And the Washington Post is a
charter sponsor of the Library

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.340
of Congress National Book Festival.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.840
We want to thank the cochairman
of the festival, David Rubenstein,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.210
and the many National
Book Festival sponsors

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.200
who made this event possible.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.640 position:56%
And you can be like David Rubenstein

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.010
and support the festival
with a donation.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.590
Information is in the program.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.510
After our guests speak, there will
be a Q&amp;A and it will be filmed

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.070
for the archives and could
appear on a later broadcast.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.840
So if you've always wanted to be
in the collection of the Library

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.890
of Congress without having to
write a book, here's your chance.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.780
It may be rude to talk about
people when they're not around,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.210
but this morning we have no choice.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.590
Unfortunately, Kwame Alexander
has had a family emergency

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.190
so he can't be here.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.900
But let's talk about him anyway.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.630
Kwame was born in Brooklyn and
raised there and in Chesapeake,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.690
Virginia, in a house where he
said, books were on shelves

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.370
on every wall in every room.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.790
My parents forced us
to read every day.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.280
Then we could do other things.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.360
It sounds like the other thing that
Kwame did mainly was write books.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.120
He has written about 24
books, which is more books

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.520
than a lot of people read.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.160
They include the picture
books: Animal Ark,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.200
Out of Wonder, and Surfs up.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.280
The novels: Booked
and He Said She Said.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.790
And the playbook: 52 Rules
to Help you aim Shoot

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.480
and Score in This Game of Life.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.640
His novel in verse, The Crossover,
won the 2015 Newberry medal

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300
and the Caretta Scott King Award.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.910
Kwame serves as the president of
Book in a Day, a literacy nonprofit

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.160
that inspires youth in the
writing and publishing process.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.660
And he recently led a delegation of
20 writers and activists to Ghana,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.620
where they delivered books and
worked on literacy projects,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.260
and I think that may have
inspired part of the book

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.010
that we're going to
feature this morning.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.840
And that book is Solo.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.970
It's about Blade Morrison,
the 17-year-old son

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.230
of a washed-up rock musician.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.190
I imagine a cross between
Ozzy Osbourne

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.070
and Steven Tyler and Lenny Kravitz.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.290
Trying to find his
place in the world.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.040
A solo, of course, is
that part of a song

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.780 position:56%
where the lead guitarist wails away.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.800 position:56%
And it's also what a pilot has to do
to prove that she knows how to fly.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.190
I think Kwame and Mary mean
both senses of the word.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.840
It's a moving book and
it's a funny book too.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.620
Solo is actually a duet.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.650
Kwame wrote it with Mary Rand
Hess, an author, poet, and editor,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.260
who like Kwame, lives
in Northern Virginia.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.310
She is the author of the picture
books: The Cowpoke Adventures

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.890
of Slim and Haskell, and
The Day I Met the Nuts.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.000 position:56%
She's a cowriter of Animal Ark,
Celebrating our Wild World in Poetry

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.830
and Pictures, a book of
animal photography and poetry.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.260
She grew up thinking that
she would be a rock star

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.660
in sort of a Pat Benatar mold.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.940
But we already have a Pat Benatar,
so we don't need another one.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.430
Instead we have Mary Rand Hess,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.440 position:56%
a graduate from George Mason
University with a degree in English,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.900
who wrote this book with Kwame.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.120
Finally, seeing a guitar on
stage is like seeing a gun

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.470
on the wall in a checkoff play.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.090
And we are fortunate,
it's going to get played.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.810
We are fortunate to have guitarist
Randy Preston with us this morning.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.230
He has known Kwame Alexander for 25
years, when Kwame produced a play

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.950
that Randy was in, The Weight
of Being Black by Glen Allen.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.410
And Randy said, I remember Kwame
selling his books out of his car.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.030 position:56%
And they lost touch, and then he
heard Kwame being interviewed on NPR

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.080
and knew that he had made it.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.460
Randy is a former English
teacher in Washington, DC.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.330
And if you listen to the audiobook
of Solo, you will hear the songs

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.800
that Randy wrote for
the characters in there.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.510
So please join me in welcoming
Mary Rand Hess and Randy Preston.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.260
[ Applause ]

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.300
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: Thank you
so much for being here today.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.740
Obviously we're missing Kwame.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.790 position:56%
And we wish him and his family well.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.030
And we're praying for them.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.050
And we're going to
carry on in a spirit

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.110
of Solo in Kwame's honor today.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.870
And let's begin.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.290
So when I decided to write
this book and Kwame decided

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.100
to write this book, we
brainstormed together.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.650
And the music that inspired
us throughout our childhood

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.660
and adulthood played a big part.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.660
We're big rock fans, as is Randy.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.630
And Randy wrote the awesome music
that Blade writes in this book

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.180
and composed the songs that
you're going to hear today.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.530
And so we're very excited
to share that.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.080
But I wanted to start with Blade.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.290
Blade's journey is a
journey of self-discovery.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.520
But it starts in a rough spot.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.350
You know, he doesn't know where he
quite fits in and where he belongs.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.160
Because his father is a
washed-up rock star and an addict.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.000
And his mother is dead.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.770
There's this dream I've
been having about my mother

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.770
that scares the holy
night out of me.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.610
And each time I wake from it,
I'm afraid to open my eyes

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.240
and face the world that awaits.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.170 position:56%
The fractured world that used to
make sense but now seems disjointed,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.940
islands of possibility that
float by like 1000 puzzle pieces

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.330
that just don't fit
together anymore.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.680 position:56%
So I think of Chapel and I grab hold

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:48.370
of the only other thing
that matters: my guitar.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.320 position:56%
So he's grown up under the spotlight
and the press has hounded him,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.410
and he's had to, you know, endure a
lot of his father's antics and show

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.750
up to a lot of his shows.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.860
The show. My father,
Rutherford Morrison,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.400
can't stand to be away
from the stage.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.030
He is always craved the spotlight.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.310
Needs it like a drug.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.830
Posing, posturing,
profiling before millions.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.430
An electric prophet,
or so he thinks.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.870
Capturing concert whisperers
and the vapors of his breath

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.600
as if his voice is
preparing them for rapture.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.280
My sister and I have always looked

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.230
under the stage, beside
it, behind it.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.310
I think he feels -- right
now he puts his hope

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.230
in his one saving grace: his
guitar and his girlfriend.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.410
He thinks that Chapel
will kind of save him.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.880
Those eyes will be the death of me.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.120
My gravestone will read:
Here lies a young man

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.680 position:56%
who died inside the gaze of a woman.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.510
I watch the river in
her eyes gallop forth,

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.700
fall into them, dive into them.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.250
She smiles.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.080
Those eyes, I can't
escape the depth of them.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.580
The song has ended but
the melody still sings.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.760
From her mouth I can hear a
word -- I can't hear a word.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.030
I'm lost in those two comets
that move across my universe.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:31.510
I remember the first time
she looked at me, like this.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:09:50.490
[ Guitar and Singing ]

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:56.520
So Blade has this guitar and he
has his memories of his mother,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.340
and of course, Chapel, the bridge.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.790
Rutherford gave it to
me in a grand fashion

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.120
on a black velvet bench
for my 13th birthday.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.940
A custom-built Eddie Van Halen
Frankenstrat, made of body, ash,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:20.080
neck, maple, with pickups
tweaked by EVH himself.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.810
Legend has it that Eddie was going
to give it to some king in Africa

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.060
or something, but my dad
convinced him to gift it to me.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.050
And that's real cool, I get it.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.240
But what mattered to me
was that when I strummed,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.180
it sounded like mom laughing.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.740
So I named her Sunny
after my mother.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:45.360
There hasn't been a day, no matter
how crazy or wicked or cruel,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.100
that I haven't held her, knowing
it's the bridge that connects

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.450
between heaven and earth.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.500
So that guitar, as you can see,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.050
really kind of helps
him gather his emotions.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.710
But there's problems
that are brewing.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:13.010
It seems that Blade -- or Chapel's
father really doesn't like him.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:18.770
And he's going to have
to find a way.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.460
The sky beams as I
search for comfort.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.440
She wraps her arms around my waist.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.580
We hug so tight, the Milky
Way spins on our axis.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.420
Our kiss could save a planet.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.060
This is where I want to be.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:46.300
This is where I need to be, swaying
softly together toward the stars,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:52.610
until an earthquake thunders
towards us with an angry --

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:58.430
anger so fierce it'd make 10,000
horses fall and never get up.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:03.080
Chapel's father is a
6.5 on the Richter.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.030
He stomps up to me in
an ominous black robe

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.220
and practically moves
the ground beneath us.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.810
This is it, he roars.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:18.680
And he tears us completely apart.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:28.830
Day one. I will never
leave this bedroom again.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.470
I stare at the walls, the
ugly, empty space imprisons me.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.490
There is nothing left
for me if she is gone.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:43.480
A bare unspoken language that
has no words, no gestures.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:49.970
A song of sinking silence.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:55.510
I've texted her 13 times.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.050
I imagine she jumps into my arms.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:10.440
We kiss. Our lips like two
special edition book covers.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.630 position:56%
Keeping our secret story safe inside
the history book of greatest loves.

I tell her I'm leaving.

She insists she's going with me
and that we're never coming back.

We'll compose some deep cuts.

Flip the script, our B side
in a place that's just ours.

I see the light still on
in Chapel's bedroom window.

secret, and that's kind

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.060

to read the book.

to cut some poems.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.070
In fact, we cut about 200
pages out of the book.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.400
So you see how thick this book is?

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.370
It was going to be like that.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.140
We had an editor who
was like, cut this down.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:46.960
So any other questions?

00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:00.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, I was wondering
about the audible version.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.310
And if Randy's songs, are
you performing, Randy?

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.610
&gt;&gt; Randy Preston: Yes, ma'am.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:08.520
So the audiobook -- I
think, yeah, it's just me

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.880
and the guitar and
that's what we did.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.170
Kwame's narrating it,
which is awesome.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.890
He did a really good job of it.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.160
And yeah, check it out.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that seems like
that would be wonderful.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.350
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: In fact,
since he couldn't be here today,

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:28.400
I recommend if you have a
moment to grab the audiobook,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.090
you can hear him read,
since he wasn't here today.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:34.020
And he is just phenomenal
at reading this book,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.930
and Randy's music to go with it.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.230
&gt;&gt; Randy Preston: Yeah,
he's an actor.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.530
He's a performer.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.830
He knows how to present things.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.010
And so when he's presenting
them, he tells such a good story.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.310
It's really compelling.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.900
Go out and get it, it's good.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.800
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: And
we might be biased, but.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.330
&gt;&gt; Randy Preston: We're
a little biased.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: Anyone else?

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.770
&gt;&gt; Hi. We were here a couple of
years ago and saw Mr. Alexander.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.960
And he was talking
about the possibility

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.570
of a movie for the crossover.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.820
Where do you see this book going?

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.420
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: That's
a really great question.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:19.770
It would be my dream to see it
on the screen and as a musical.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.820
I think it would make
a great musical.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.010
With all the music
and the storyline.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.310
So that's a great question.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.150
We have some things
floating out there.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.640
&gt;&gt; Randy Preston: There's
some things in the works.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Randy Hess: Some things
in the works, some interests.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.000
So we'll see what happens.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.120
Very excited.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for
sharing your talents today.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.010
I was wondering about how we
could hear more of your music,

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.310
besides the audio version.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.960
Is there other outlets?

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.260
&gt;&gt; Randy Preston: Yeah,
yes, there is.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.370
Yeah, I'm traveling to balance it.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:57.230
Up to about a year and a half
ago, I was teaching full time

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.810
in a Washington, DC charter school.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:02.170
So recently I'm like, oh, no,
I have to write more music.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.790
So I'm doing that.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:07.640
Hopefully by the end of
September, we will have three

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.870
of the songs from this on iTunes.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.320
That's what we're working on now.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.020
So keep your ears open for that.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.320
And that'll be cool.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.100
And I'll be doing my own
little stuff in between there.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.450
We'll talk about that as well.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.960
But thank you for the question.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.480
&gt;&gt; Hi. Excuse my ignorance but
who wrote the poetry in this book?

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: I'm sorry?

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.080
&gt;&gt; The poetry?

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.380
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: The
poetry in the book?

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.860
Kwame and I wrote the
poetry in the book.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.830
So all the poems that you read

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:39.710
in the book are written
by Kwame and myself.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:45.520
&gt;&gt; The verbal version of the
book will have the songs?

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: Yes.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.800
The songs that you hear in
the book that are written

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.750
by the character Blade,
Randy here wrote those songs.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:33:00.150
And there's four songs in this
book that are original, you know,

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.960
it's original music
that he, Randy, wrote.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.820
And it's on the audiobooks.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.890 position:56%
It's in here, the words are in here.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.930
But if you want to hear it live,
performed live in a studio.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.780
&gt;&gt; I thoroughly enjoyed
the songs and I would

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:20.030
like to get the other version of
the book that has the songs in it.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.330
&gt;&gt; Randy Preston: Thank
you very much.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: I
highly recommended it.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.930
Thank you.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:30.050
&gt;&gt; Randy xxx: I recommend
it as well.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:35.430
&gt;&gt; Mary Rand Hess: Anyone
else have a question?

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.510
Well, thank you so
much for being here.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:45.510
[ Applause ]

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:48.260
And I know Kwame missed
being here today,

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.680
and thank you for coming to see us.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.080
I know that he was here in spirit
and he appreciates all of you.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:03.590 position:56%
So have a wonderful time here at the
festival and go out and find Solo.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:04.890
Thank you.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:07.640
&gt;&gt; Randy Preston: It's
good, it's good stuff.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.940
Thank you.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.410
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
