So, Lauren's right. You know, sometimes different psychologists do have

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:07.150
different perspectives on things. But you may we wondering, what's so important

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.555
about theory? Who really cares?

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.710
&gt;&gt; Well, actually, it's quite interesting. Psychologists who have different

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.725
perspectives on language acquisition have actually had some heated debates in

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:20.321
the past. For example, I was trained as a behaviorist. So I subscribe more to

00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.935
B.F. Skinner's theory of verbal behavior.

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:27.000
&gt;&gt; And I side more with Noam Chomsky. The point is that Chomsky and Skinner did

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.060
disagree, have different perspectives on how language was acquired, but that's

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.240
okay.
