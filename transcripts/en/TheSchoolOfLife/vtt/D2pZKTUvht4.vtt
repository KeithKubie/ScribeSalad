00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.560
In so many areas,
we're used, nowadays,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.760
to questioning the status quo

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.720
and exploring alternatives.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.240
It would be odd, therefore,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.540
not to try to perform
the same exercise

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.180
around marriage.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.140
Here seem to be
our main options

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.320
for how to arrange
our personal lives.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.740
Firstly, the standard marriage.
[ applause ]

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.220
The upsides are firm possession
of one prized person,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.960
continuity, resolution,
children are reassured,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.440
economic stability, and social prestige.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.320
But there are some downsides, too.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.960
Sexual boredom, exasperation,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.660
a lack of appreciation,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.000
a suspicion of better alternatives out there.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.720
Second option, divorce.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.600
Now, the upsides here are,
[ laughter ]

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.080
New possibilities
for sexual excitement,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.780
an end to cycles of exasperation,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.440
and past problems
can be seen to be

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.300
all their fault.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.220
The downsides of it are

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.800
perturbed children,
economic chaos,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.020
probably no one better out there,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.220
and in fact, our fault, too.
[ applause ]

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.640
The third option.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820
The sunset clause marriage
[ laughter ]

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.360
may be renegotiated
every 10 years.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.100
Now, the upsides of this are
prospect of sexual excitement,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.240
much more appreciation and effort,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.320
and children who are
somewhat reassured.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.720
But there are downsides, too.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.520
insecurity, jealously,
terror of abandonment,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.840
and no one actually might be better.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.860
And it's difficult to pioneer.
[ applause ]

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.880
There's a fourth option.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.020
Marriage with secret affairs.
[ laughter ]

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.040
The upsides of this
are fragile stability

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.580
mixed with partial excitement.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.200
But the downsides are
deceit, jealousy, cowardice,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.820
and a lot of shame.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.100
Now, what about polyamory?
Our fifth option.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.540
The upsides here are
constant sexual possibilities

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.920
and not much
day-to-day exasperation.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.160
But there are downsides.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.100
Socially not very prestigious,
a lot of jealously around,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.020
children might be in turmoil,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.980
discontinuity, exhaustion,
and career chaos.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.040
What about the sixth option.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.160
Serial nonbinding monogamy.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.820
The upsides are lots of
sexual possibility.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.140
The downsides...moth-eaten loneliness
and possibly a lot of insecurity.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.140
What about number seven?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.140
Communal living.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.640
Here the upsides are:

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.140
shared childcare

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140
and sexual variation.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.140
The downsides, though,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140
bit utopian, quite a lot of jealosy, factions

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.140
and bickering.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.960
An eighth choice: celibacy

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.140
Well, the upsides here are:

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.140
time to work and think,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.140
there are downsides, too:

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140
loneliness, and sexual humiliation.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.140
We see a recurring theme:

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.920
a struggle between loyalty and freedom.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.040
We can invest in more loyalty,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.600
but must then risk suffering from boredom,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.560
lack of appreciation, and sexual frustration

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.220
Or we can invest in more freedom and risk chaos,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.960
irresolution, exhaustion, jealousy, and humiliation.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.840
It seems that whatever we choose is going to be very painful.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.560
The option is not between error and happiness,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.280
but between what varieties of suffering we would ultimately prefer.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.600
This is why our very favorite quote

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.080
is Kierkegaard's playful, bleakly exasperated outburst

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.240
from his book "Either/Or":

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.320
"Marry and you will regret it;"

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.640
"don't marry, you will also regret it;"

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.720
"marry or don't marry, you will regret it either way"

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.640
"Laugh at the world's foolishness, you will regret it;"

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.280
"weep over it, you will regret that too;"

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.600
"laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both."

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.200
"Believe a woman, you will regret it"

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.500
"Believe her not, you will also regret it..."

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.000
"Hang yourself, you will regret it;"

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.320
"don't hang yourself and you will regret that too"

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.640
"hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you'll regret it either way"

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.940
"whether you hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you will regret both."

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.040
"This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.740
We do, however, have one suggestion:

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.040
That humanity's efforts should be spent not so much on retooling the external structure of relationships

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.000
as on rethinking the humbling central problem we're grappling with all the while beneath the surface.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.560
Why other human beings are so hard to love,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.280
and why we are, by extension, so difficult to live around.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.200
In other words, perhaps the answer lies

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.800
not so much in a new kind of relationship, as in improved capacities around emotional skills.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.960
The solution to the dilemmas of relationships should be to increase our understanding of how to love,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.960
rather than merely making it easier to find and fire new lovers.
