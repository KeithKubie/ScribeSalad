00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.029
We know Olivia can travel 30 miles, so we'll have her distance as 30. And

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.242
Terrance can go 15 miles, so his distance would be 15. And here's where we

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:15.514
want to be careful. We can either let x be Olivia's rate or Terrance's rate. We

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:19.920
know Olivia can go 4 miles per hour faster than Terrance. So we'll just add

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.974
four to whatever Terrance's rate is. We don't know Terrance's rate, so I think

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:29.304
it's best to use x here. If we do this, Terrance will be x and Olivia will be

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:35.040
four more than that, four x plus four. And finally, to find the time, we'll

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.188
take the distance of Olivia and divide it by her rate. So the time is 30

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:46.478
divided by x plus 4. We do the same thing for Terrance, since his time would be

00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:51.360
distance divided by rate, or 15 divided by x.
