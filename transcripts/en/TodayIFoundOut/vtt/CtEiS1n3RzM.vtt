00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:10.240
Did English Speakers Really Not Use Contractions
in the 19th Century as Depicted in True Grit?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.300
Won’t, don’t, wouldn’t, isn’t and
even ain’t- where would we be without our

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.300
contractions?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.599
Prevalent in spoken English and increasingly
accepted in written pieces, contractions enable

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.789
brevity and make written works more accessible
and friendly.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.420
Contractions in some form of English date
back to Old English (450 AD – 1150 AD),

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.610
a language that bears little resemblance to
our English today.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.320
Before this period, although the Romans had
already invaded, the dominant language on

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.380
the island was Celtic.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.649
In the 5th century, several groups, notably
the Angles and the Saxons, began to invade,

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.270
and they brought their Germanic languages
and rune alphabets with them, along with several

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.109
well-established contractions.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.969
These included shortened forms for “is not”
(nis, today, “isn’t”), “did not have”

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.930
(ne haefde), “was not” (ne waes, today
“wasn’t”) and “would not” (wolde,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.420
today “wouldn’t).

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.880
During the Old English period, Christian missionaries
introduced Latin as well as the Roman alphabet,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.110
so by the time the Normans appeared in the
mid-11th century, the language was ready to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.060
incorporate a fair bit of French, the language
of post-Conquest English nobility.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.810
(In fact, King Richard “The Lionheart”
barely spoke English, and only spent about

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.500
six months in the country he was king of for
the decade he was king.)

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.040
Nonetheless, the common people continued to
speak English, although now peppered with

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.830
thousands of French words and conventions,
and eventually, this pidgin developed into

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.420
Middle English (1150 AD to 1450 AD).

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.479
Far easier for a modern English speaker to
understand, it was during this period that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.610
negative contractions (i.e. using “not”)
arrived on the scene in the form of ne were

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.250
(“were not”) and noot (“knows not”).

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.680
Other contractions from this period include
thilke (for “the ilke” meaning “the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.110
same”) and sit (a shortened form of sitteth).

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.299
By the turn of the 16th century, the Renaissance
arrived in England and with it came further

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.399
changes to the language, which by this time
is recognizable as Early Modern English (1450

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.530
AD to 1750 AD).

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.000
Latin and Greek words were adopted and altered
(e.g., militia, squalor, illicit and explain),

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.160
and men like Shakespeare were introducing
new words to the masses at a rapid pace (e.g.,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.550
assassination, cold-blooded, eyeball and fashionable).

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.230
Some contractions that appear during the Early
Middle English period include I’ll (I will),

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.090
‘twould (it would) and ’twill (it will),
as well as negative contractions of every

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.810
form including can’t (cannot), don’t (do
not), shan’t (shall not), mayn’t (may

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.420
not)and won’t (will not).

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.440
According to the Online Etymology Dictionary,
won’t first appeared at the dawn of the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.811
period in the mid-15th century as wynnot and
then wonnot, and its modern form in the mid-17th

00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:48.811
century.

00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.170
Don’t was first recorded in the 1630s, and
can’t first appeared in print in 1706.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.040
Ain’t also first appeared in 1706 as a contraction
only for “am not,” although by the early

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.300
1800s, it was also used to mean a variety
of negatives including “are not,” “is

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.540
not,” “have not,” and “has not.”

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.530
As you might have guessed from all this, contrary
to what the latest True Grit film would seem

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.460
to indicate, contractions were around long
before Mattie and Rooster were attempting

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.170
to avenge her father.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.060
However, during the period in which the character
of Mattie was off on her adventure (1880s),

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.180
in formal writing contractions were absolutely
disfavored.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.420
This is a trend that started in earnest around
the late 18th century.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.380
However, as we can see by the works of Mark
Twain (1835-1910), among many others who wrote

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.520
certain characters speaking the way real people
actually talked in this era, in everyday speech,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.230
contractions seemed to have been the norm.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.130
So why did the Coen brothers choose not to
use them in their adaptation of the True Grit

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.130
serials?

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.940
Ethan Coen explained in an interview, “We’ve
been told that the language and all that formality

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.860
is faithful to how people talked in the period.”

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.340
While this is mostly true in formal writing,
it was most definitely not in common speech,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.290
particularly for characters like Rooster Cogburn
and Tom Chaney.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.240
And, in truth, the original True Grit serials,
written in 1968 from the perspective of a

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.011
woman writing in the 1920s, used “won’t”
instead of “will not” about 36% of the

00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:15.950
time and “don’t” instead of “do not”
about 60% of the time, among other uses of

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:16.950
contractions.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.371
As for today, despite the many years contractions
have been taboo in formal writing, as with

00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:25.490
many grammatical sacred cows, time (starting
around the 1920s) and more recently the Internet

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.840
seems to have changed at least some people’s
views of their acceptability in writing.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.190
Nonetheless, apparently the APA still disapproves
of them, according to many commentators, and

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.560
the United Kingdom’s The Guardian newspaper
cautions against overusing many contractions

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.930
including can’t, aren’t, don’t, I’m
and it’s even though “they might make

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.910
a piece . . . easier to read, they can be
an irritant and a distraction, and make a

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.140
serious article sound frivolous.”

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.940
On the other hand, reference guides for AP
style note that contractions found in reputable

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.990
dictionaries are acceptable in informal writing,
but should not be used excessively, and the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.480
Chicago Manual of Style goes further to say
that “most types of writing benefit from

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.090
the use of contractions,” although they
should be used “thoughtfully.”

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.660
Experts in business writing generally approve
of the use of contractions for creating a

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.870
flowing style that engages the reader, but
warn that when writing for an international

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.430
audience where there will be non-native English
speakers, contractions can be confusing and

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.610
should be avoided.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.930
Uncle Sam has even weighed in on the debate.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.590
Beginning in 1998 when President Bill Clinton
issued an executive memo instructing federal

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.250
agencies to write more plainly, the federal
government has been trying to turn government

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.090
jargon into readable English.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.610
Along with the 2010 Plain Writing Act signed
into law by President Obama, these two directives

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.040
have resulted in PlainLanguage.gov, a set
of instructions for government employees to

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.650
help them write documents Americans will understand.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.430
Under these guidelines, writers are instructed
to “use contractions when appropriate,”

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.750
even with legal writing as they will render
it “less stuffy and more natural.”

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:06.360
To sum it up, the directive is “write as
you talk,” but use discretion when including

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:14.229
contractions.
