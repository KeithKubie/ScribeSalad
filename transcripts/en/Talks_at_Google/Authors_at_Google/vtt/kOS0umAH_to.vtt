00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:06.400
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I'm Claire Hughes Johnson.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.439
It is very exciting to be here
to host Adelle Waldman, who

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:12.730
happens to be my sister-in-law.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.005
ADELLE WALDMAN: [LAUGH]

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:14.330
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
My brother and my husband

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.970
are also here.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.660
It's a family event, today.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.560
But we couldn't be more proud
of Adelle and pursuing her dream

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.670
and realizing it-- woo!

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.560
--with this novel.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.480
But hopefully many more.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.970
I'll give a little
bit of an intro,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.120
so folks have a
background on Adelle,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.601
and then she's going to read
a bit from "The Love Affairs."

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.350
And then we'll just
do a little bit of Q&amp;A

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.030
and invite folks in the
room to ask questions.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.624
So Adele went to Brown
University-- grew up

00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:44.165
in Baltimore.

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.600
She went to Brown
University-- go, Bruno.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.240
I happened to, also,
go to Brown University.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.215
And she worked as a reporter
for the "New Haven Register"

00:00:52.215 --> 00:00:54.510
and also the Cleveland
"Plain Dealer"

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.909
and then moved to New York
and started writing and doing

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:58.450
other things.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.950
Yes?

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.200
Is that accurate, or not?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.540
ADELLE WALDMAN: Yeah.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.540
That sounds pretty good.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.490
There was some SAT
tutoring, in there.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.989
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: SAT tutoring,

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.420
to make some bucks
on the side, there.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.910
As a writer, you need to make
some bucks in other ways,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.460
often.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.770
ADELLE WALDMAN: Exactly.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.840
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And has
written for a few publications,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.280
like "Village Voice," and
some bigger ones, coming up,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.790
I think.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.860
But-- other ones?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.276
ADELLE WALDMAN:
Many publications,

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:23.820
as many a freelance
writer has experienced.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.420
But I've written book reviews
for the "New York Times"

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.650
and the "Wall Street Journal"
and "The New Republic."

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.110
And I'm working for something
for "The New Yorker," now,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.240
but-- this and that, mixed
with-- well, this and that.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.740
[LAUGH]

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.560
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Yeah, mixed with-- right.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.840
We'll have Adelle tell
us a little bit more

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.520
about the writing process,
once she reads from the book.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.980
This book-- which we've highly
publicized in our notes--

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.443
has been named a Book
of the Year, last year,

00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:52.344
by anybody you can name.
"The Economist," NPR, "Elle,"

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.260
"Vogue," "The Washington
Post"-- I don't know.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.230
It was, like, a huge list
that is incredibly impressive.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.737
It is-- on the
paperback version,

00:01:58.737 --> 00:02:00.195
here, which is the
first I've seen.

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:01.600
I ordered some from Amazon.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.920
ADELLE WALDMAN: Oh!

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.086
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
--says "National Bestseller."

00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:06.490
So that is pretty rock-star.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.810
And is, I think, viewed
as a great success

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.977
and has gotten a lot of
attention in articles as well,

00:02:12.977 --> 00:02:15.060
for various reasons, which,
maybe, we'll get into.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.040
But one of them,
of course, is, it's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.720
written from the
male perspective,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.680
and people find
interesting when they

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.950
meet Adelle, who is one
of the nicest, greatest,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.120
non-male people [LAUGHTER]
(LAUGHING) that I know.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.320
So we'll get into that.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.260
But why don't we
do a quick reading,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.825
and then I'll ask
some questions.

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:32.690
Sound good?

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.190
All right.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.585
Great.

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:35.543
ADELLE WALDMAN: Well,
thank you for that intro.

00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:38.350
That was the loveliest intro--
and the most personal one.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.180
I've never been introduced
by a family member.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.980
That was nice!

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.650
So I'm going to say a few
words, before I start reading,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.930
if that's OK.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.560
So the book-- as
the title suggests--

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.060
"The Love Affairs
of Nathaniel P."--

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.560
it's kind of obvious that the
book is going to be about this

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.390
guy's love life.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.870
Nathaniel P. is a
writer in New York.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.440
He's in his early 30s,
and he is achieving

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.160
some professional success,
when the book begins.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.820
And when he was in his 20s,
he was a struggling freelance

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.896
writer; I can
relate to that part.

00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:11.120
But he wasn't that
popular with women.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.920
He's, like, a fine-looking
guy, but he's not

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.810
the best-looking guy.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.760
But as he's hit 30 and
he started to do better,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.850
professionally, he's
becoming more popular

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.875
with women, and that is
having mixed consequences.

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:28.250
In the past few
years, he sort of

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.790
had a habit of
pissing women off.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.470
And he's got a
number of exes who

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.117
aren't super-pleased with him.

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:39.567
So he's not a terrible guy.

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:41.400
He doesn't wake up in
the morning and think,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.470
I am going to hurt women today.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.620
But he has a number
of ex-girlfriends

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.950
who aren't too pleased with him.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.720
So the section I'm
reading, though,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.010
is not about Nathaniel--
or, as he's often called,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.380
Nate-- in New York; it's
backstory about the days

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.050
before he got to
be this guy, when

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.150
he was in high
school and college.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.114
And, well, he was
different, back then.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.030
And all you need to
know-- all that's happened

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.010
is that, in the
first chapter, Nate

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.670
has run into an ex-girlfriend
on the streets of Brooklyn,

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.750
and the encounter did
not go super-well.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.560
It ended with her calling him
an asshole and storming off.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.210
So this is chapter two.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.370
"Nate had not always been
the kind of guy women

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.610
call an asshole.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.710
Only recently had he
been popular enough

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.214
to inspire such ill will.

00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:35.880
Growing up, he had
been considered nice.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.800
He was also a wunderkind of
advanced placement classes,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.690
a star debater, and a fledgling
songwriter whose extra-credit

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.680
homage to Madonna, for
Math Appreciation Week--

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.550
"Like a Cosine, Solved for
the Very First Time"-- had,

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.970
unfortunately, been broadcast
to the entire upper school.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.670
Despite playing on the varsity
soccer and baseball teams

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.240
since 10th grade-- granted,
his was a Jewish day school--

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.810
Nate never quite achieved
the reputation of an athlete.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.810
He didn't repel girls, exactly.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.020
They sought him out for
help with Bio or Calculus--

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.464
even for advice about
their personal problems.

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:09.630
They flirted with him when
they wanted an ego boost,

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.380
and then they told him
about their crushes

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.520
on Todd, or Mike, or Scott.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.420
Nate wasn't much to
look at, back then.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.777
Dark-haired and skinny, he
had a pale, sunken chest

00:05:17.777 --> 00:05:19.360
that, he felt, made
him look cowardly,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.055
as if he were perpetually
shrinking back.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.430
Though he wasn't painfully
short, he wasn't tall, either.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.880
His, hands, eyebrows,
nose, and Adam's apple

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.787
appeared to have been intended
for a much larger person.

00:05:29.787 --> 00:05:31.370
This caused him to
hold out hope, even

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.453
as high school progressed,
that he might spring up

00:05:33.453 --> 00:05:36.632
another couple inches into
the five-foot double digits.

00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:38.340
In the meantime,
though, these attributes

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.179
didn't add much to his existing
stock of personal charms.

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.470
Todd and Mike and Scott were
Nate's soccer and baseball

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.300
teammates.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.275
Scott was the most popular
guy in their class.

00:05:47.275 --> 00:05:49.650
He was tall and broad-shouldered
and had that combination

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.750
of crudeness and confidence that
rendered intelligence not only

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.790
irrelevant but
slightly ridiculous--

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.650
a peculiar, if not
entirely unamusing, talent,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.614
like the ability
to ride a unicycle.

00:06:00.614 --> 00:06:02.280
Todd and Mike and
Scott were not exactly

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.760
Nate's friends, at least
not on terms of equality.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.010
But they thought he was funny.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.090
They also relied on him
for help with calculus.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.700
Todd and Mike did,
anyway; Scott never

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.812
made it past trigonometry.

00:06:12.812 --> 00:06:14.090
Nate went to their parties.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.950
Nate got drunk.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.830
Jokes were made about how funny
it was Nate-- bard of the math

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.710
department, with a
4.0 GPA-- was drunk.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.470
Meanwhile, Nate pined for
girls like Amy Perlman--

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.940
the stacked blonde
siren of their class,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.180
whose bashfully averted
eyes and modest smile

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.370
were nicely offset by her clingy
sweaters and ass-hugging jeans.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.860
Naturally, Amy went out with
Scott, although, one day,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.860
she confided to Nate that she
was worried about their future.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.630
'I mean, what will
become of him?

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.840
Like, if his dad's stores'--
liquidated designer goods--

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.970
'don't keep doing well,
my dad says they're, like,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.220
overleveraged.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.480
But Scott can barely read.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.185
And I mean, he can read;
just not, like, whole books.

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:54.107
But I can't see him
doing well in college

00:06:54.107 --> 00:06:55.190
and getting a regular job.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.486
It just wouldn't
be him, you know?'

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:59.420
In retrospect, it
wasn't surprising

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.960
that Amy Perlman-- who was
not actually stupid, but only

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.700
affected stupidity
in her speech,

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.540
because that was the fashion--
eventually ditched Scott

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.840
and got an MBA from Wharton.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.270
At the time, however, Nate
had, somewhat to his surprise,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.620
come to Scott's defense.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.670
'He's a good guy, though, and
he really likes you.' Amy looked

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.720
thoughtful but not
quite convinced.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.260
"I guess."

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.810
Meanwhile, Nate did have one
admirer during high school--

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.607
frizzy-haired
Michelle Goldstein.

00:07:24.607 --> 00:07:26.190
It wasn't that
Michelle wasn't pretty.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.750
He'd been interested in girls
who looked worse, anyway.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.750
But there was something
painfully self-conscious

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.180
about her.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.300
While it should have been
refreshing to see someone

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.600
at their school
engrossed in Mary

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.474
Woolstonecraft's 'A
Vindication of the Rights

00:07:36.474 --> 00:07:39.650
of Women,' Michelle's embrace of
culture seemed a bit affected.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.190
She had an inexplicable
fondness for the phrase 'pas de

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.220
deux,' which Nate had once--
frighteningly enough--

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.980
overheard her use in reference
to her relationship with him.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.670
Still, at moments, he felt
real affection for Michelle.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.170
One spring night--
it must have been

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.102
after a school play
or concert-- they

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.560
sat together for hours on a
bench outside the upper school,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.890
gazing down a grassy hill
toward the dark expanse

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.729
of the athletic fields.

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:05.520
Michelle spoke
intelligently-- touchingly--

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.700
about the music she liked--
moody female singer-songwriters

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.416
with socially
progressively lyrics--

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:13.040
and of her intention to live in
New York one day, to go, often,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.340
to The Strand-- 'a
huge used bookstore,

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.936
downtown,' she explained.

00:08:16.936 --> 00:08:19.920
Nate wasn't sure if he'd even
been to a used bookstore.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.640
There weren't any, in their
suburb, he didn't think.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.030
'You should go to New York
some time,' Michelle said.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.670
'I've been; we didn't go
anyplace like that.' From his

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.640
family's weekend in New
York, Nate had photos,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.320
taken by his Dad, of
him and his mother,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.570
huddled together on the
observation deck of the Empire

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.900
State Building.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.350
They wore newly
purchased ponchos

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.890
and smiled warmly while a cold
drizzle fell on their heads.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.230
Michelle smiled sympathetically.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.519
In the light that spilled
over from the parking lot,

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:46.810
Nate thought Michelle's
freckles and straw-colored hair

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:47.587
were cute.

00:08:47.587 --> 00:08:49.170
He nearly reached
out across the bench

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.200
and touched her-- her
hand, or her thigh.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.980
It wasn't even about sex.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.146
Nate's life had been somewhat
short on friendship--

00:08:55.146 --> 00:08:56.770
real friendship,
distinct from the sort

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.020
of conditional alliance he
had with Scott and company.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.870
Sitting on the bench
with Michelle, Nate

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.744
felt as if the two of
them shared something--

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:05.810
some nebulous, slightly
melancholic sensitivity

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.320
that made them different
from their classmates.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.850
But at school, on
Monday, Michelle

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.870
seemed to have reverted
back to her other self.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.400
'I can't believe you got an A
on that test,' she said after

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.310
calculus.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.230
'What a coup d'etat.' She gave a
little wave as she walked away.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.890
'Ciao, cheri.' '"Coup,"'
Nate wanted to shout;

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.620
'you mean just plain "coup."'
Yet he and Michelle were

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.120
constantly lumped together
and treated as a couple.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.824
Scott repeatedly asked
him if her cooter

00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:32.240
smelled like mothballs, because
of all the vintage clothes

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.330
she wore.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.830
Michelle's ambiguous
social status--

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.970
neither cool nor uncool--
apparently made her

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.435
his female equivalent.

00:09:39.435 --> 00:09:41.284
They even went to
senior prom together.

00:09:41.284 --> 00:09:42.700
Nate had been
working up the nerve

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.170
to ask a pretty
sophomore, and he

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.128
felt both resentment and
relief when Michelle's

00:09:46.128 --> 00:09:48.190
asking him foreclosed
that possibility.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.581
On prom night, he thought
Michelle might even

00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:51.830
have been willing to have sex.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.070
But he didn't really try--
although they made out.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.090
Well, more than
made out, actually.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.620
He had a brief opportunity
to assess Scott's hypothesis

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.230
vis-a-vis the bouquet
of her female parts.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.887
But Nate didn't push, because,
at that particular moment

00:10:04.887 --> 00:10:06.720
in his life, he didn't
want to get entangled

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.890
with a girl who was
slightly repulsive to him.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.716
Nor could he imagine
sleeping with Michelle

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:14.090
and then blowing her off, the
way that Todd or Mike might

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.790
have-- although not Scott,
who, for all his crudity,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.052
was sensitive and unwavering
in his devotion to Amy.

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:22.260
There was something that
rubbed Nate wrong about Todd

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.930
and Mike's attitude toward
girls-- their implicit belief

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.180
that whatever befell a foolish
or unattractive one was

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.610
her just desserts.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.030
Empathy they reserved for
the best-looking girls.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.330
Amy Perlman's most minor
setbacks-- a B+ or mild cold--

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.920
elicited coos of grave concern.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.640
Besides, by prom, Nate had
largely begun to pin his erotic

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.010
hopes on college,
where, he imagined,

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.840
even girls who looked like
Amy Perlman would be smart

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.980
and, more important, mature--
a word he had lately begun

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.579
to interpret as 'willing
to have sex with him.'

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:54.870
If he were to list the biggest
disappointments of life,

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.245
freshman year of
college would be

00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:58.180
near the top, right
behind the realization--

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.300
much later-- that even something
as seemingly sublime as a blow

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.770
job-- his penis, in
a woman's mouth--

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.910
could be boring-- even
slightly unpleasant--

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.977
under the wrong circumstances,
or performed inexpertly."

00:11:10.977 --> 00:11:12.435
And I think I'm
going to leave off,

00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:14.411
at that slightly
embarrassing note.

00:11:14.411 --> 00:11:14.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.970
I didn't quite
realize what it would

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.090
be like to be reading that
in such a brightly lit room--

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:21.720
--at 1:00 PM.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.690
I do a lot of readings at
night; the lights are dim--

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.005
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
At night, at bookstores--

00:11:25.005 --> 00:11:27.710
this doesn't feel like a cozy
bookstore; sorry! [LAUGH]

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.480
So let's talk a little
bit, and then, definitely,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.340
think of questions,
for those who are here.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.923
First about the book,
and then, maybe,

00:11:35.923 --> 00:11:38.232
a little bit about
getting to the book.

00:11:38.232 --> 00:11:39.690
You are always
asked this question,

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.260
but, I think, it
is one to-- why did

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.364
you choose to write
from Nate's perspective?

00:11:44.364 --> 00:11:45.280
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.154
I love this question.

00:11:46.154 --> 00:11:49.210
So Nate is-- he's
a guy, and I'm not.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.090
And that's, like, the
most-- in some ways,

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.620
the most salient
fact about the book.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:59.310
And I did that, in part, because
I had this sense, one day.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.880
I was reading a book
by a male author that

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.420
was, among other things,
about his relations--

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.710
or about the male
character's relationships.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.540
And I was lying at a park,
near my apartment, reading,

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.480
and I had this feeling this--
sort of like a light bulb going

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.190
off in my mind-- that
I felt like I knew more

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.290
about this guy's emotional
life than he did.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.850
And I felt that I
did, because I spent

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.690
my 20s dating various
people, some of whom

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.080
were better to date
than others, and trying

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.690
to analyze these bad boyfriends.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.700
And talking to my friends
about their bad boyfriends,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.280
and to my male friends,
about their relationships.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.220
And I felt like
sometimes the problem

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.210
was that these guys were
not actually taking the time

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.160
to think about why they were
doing what they were doing.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.706
So I had this
thought; it was, like,

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:50.580
I think I could use all
this insight I have--

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.272
all these years I've spent
thinking about these guys,

00:12:54.272 --> 00:12:55.230
and put it into a book.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.760
But that seemed kind of crazy.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.240
So it was this idea,
in the back of my mind.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.955
And I just thought I
would-- it was, almost,

00:13:02.955 --> 00:13:04.070
like a joke, or a dare.

00:13:07.196 --> 00:13:08.650
But I kept coming back to it.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.420
And then I started to
combine that with this idea

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.050
that I felt that I'd read
a lot of books-- books

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.320
that I love-- by male authors,
like Philip Roth, and Saul

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.920
Bellow, and more modern
male authors, as well.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.440
But about a young man who
is smart and ambitious,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:31.320
and comes to the city to
conquer it with his intellect,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.420
and cuts a wide swath through
the female population.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.850
And, usually, he's really--
he's charming, as a protagonist.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.300
And as readers, we identify with
him and sympathize with him.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.450
But I think that, oftentimes,
the way these guys

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.440
treat women isn't
really scrutinized.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.680
And I thought, wouldn't it
be neat to write a book that

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.400
follows that same archetype
but really pays attention

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.380
to how this man treats women?

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.157
And so I decided
to give it a try.

00:14:01.157 --> 00:14:02.990
I thought I would just
try a chapter or two,

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.030
to see how it went.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.894
And then, four years later,
there was a book. [LAUGH]

00:14:08.894 --> 00:14:10.990
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's great.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.721
So Nate is not the most
appealing protagonist.

00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:16.970
And I also think it's funny,
because a lot of the male

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.400
reviewers-- particularly
those who live in New York,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.040
or who are in this,
sort of, writing scene,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.846
if you will-- kind of said,
oh, I recognize myself. [LAUGH]

00:14:24.846 --> 00:14:25.280
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.520
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
I thought, how are they

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.978
dealing with that fact, that
they're recognizing themselves

00:14:28.978 --> 00:14:31.640
in-- because he is very
real, but he's also

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.630
hard to deal with.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.246
If any of you have
read the book,

00:14:34.246 --> 00:14:36.620
it's a fascinating exercise,
'cause it's so well-written,

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.020
and you're interested
in what's happening,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.360
but you also want to punch him.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.320
I-- at least for me.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.680
I'll speak for myself.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.300
Occasionally, I
wanted to punch him.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.210
ADELLE WALDMAN: And
you're not the only one,

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.260
Claire; it's not some especially
violent tendency on your part.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.070
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: [LAUGH]

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.319
ADELLE WALDMAN: I've heard
that from many, many women.

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:54.000
And definitely from
certain men, too.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.720
So there is an interesting
gender divide, I think,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.830
in response to the book.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.840
Because, I think,
men tend to say

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.384
that they relate a
little bit to Nate.

00:15:04.384 --> 00:15:05.550
But they're not proud of it.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.883
They don't read this book and
they're not like, oh, yes!

00:15:07.883 --> 00:15:08.990
That's me!

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.850
They see some of
their-- some habits

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.250
that they're not so proud of.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.750
And I think, by
virtue of the guy

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.814
saying that he-- he, kind
of, winces with recognition,

00:15:22.814 --> 00:15:24.730
in reading the book-- I
think that, by virtue,

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.120
make these guys
better than Nate,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.180
because they're more self-aware.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.850
But women, also,
sometimes-- I think--

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.380
respond in a way that is,
maybe, wincing or cringing,

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.800
but it's not because they
recognize themselves, in Nate,

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.080
but they recognize men
they've dated, in Nate.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.306
And so there's that divide.

00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:45.152
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:46.000
ADELLE WALDMAN: But, yeah.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.580
I tried, in writing the book,
not to think very much about

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.010
whether I liked Nate or not.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.660
I just, really, wanted
him to feel real.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.000
And I wanted him to be a
slippery as any ex-boyfriend

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.490
that I or my friends
had ever had,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.140
and to not be completely
bad or completely good.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.590
And I have to say
it's whether I--

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.970
There are aspects
of Nate that I like.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.820
I have this moral
critique of him,

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.340
but I don't hate him,
across the board.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.680
And I wanted to be fair to him.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.850
I didn't want to make him
just a standard villain.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.154
I wanted to make him
someone that-- men wouldn't

00:16:18.154 --> 00:16:19.820
read the book and
think, oh, this sounds

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.690
like a bitter ex-girlfriend's
revenge fantasy.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.795
That would undercut the purpose.

00:16:25.795 --> 00:16:27.712
So I think Nate-- or, I
hope he's complicated.

00:16:27.712 --> 00:16:30.170
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: He's
definitely complicated, though.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.463
It struck me as a very
intelligent, bitter (LAUGHING)

00:16:32.463 --> 00:16:34.615
ex-girfriend's revenge
fantasy, possibly.

00:16:34.615 --> 00:16:36.125
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:38.620
But frankly, Hannah-- the
female protagonist-- though,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.770
obviously, not as central
as Nate, in the book,

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.654
but very important--
is not faultless.

00:16:43.654 --> 00:16:44.570
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.070
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I mean, I think

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.230
that's the other thing, is,
you're kind of-- if you're

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.688
a woman-- for me,
reading the book,

00:16:48.688 --> 00:16:51.130
I'm kind of wanting
to have my older self,

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.865
say, knock some sense
into her, as well.

00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:53.990
ADELLE WALDMAN: Absolutely.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.700
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And did you--?

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.575
ADELLE WALDMAN: Yeah.

00:16:56.575 --> 00:16:59.130
So, in the book, there's
one main relationship

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.630
that takes up the
arc of the plot.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.450
And it's-- Nate starts dating
this woman named Hannah.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.220
And their relationship
starts off

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.250
with a fair amount of promise.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.300
Hannah's a little bit
skeptical of him, at first.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.560
He's, kind of, got a rap
as a womanizer, these days.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.150
So she's skeptical.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.015
But he seems very into
it and wins her trust,

00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:22.470
and she lets her guard down.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.109
And things are good,
for a little while.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.380
And then Nate just
starts losing interest.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.850
It starts really subtly.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.590
He doesn't even know why
it's happening, at first.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.240
And so he can't explain why.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.090
And Hannah starts to
sense that, and that

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.220
makes her feel insecure.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.960
And as she feels a
little bit insecure,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.245
he becomes a little
irritated by her insecurity.

00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:47.130
It's the cycle.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.804
And it was really important, to
me, to write about that cycle,

00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:51.720
because I felt like it
was something familiar.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.090
And I don't think it's only
men who behave like Nate.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.030
I think we've all been
a Nate, and we've all

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.470
been a Hannah,
regardless of our gender.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.272
But I felt like
it can be hurtful,

00:18:03.272 --> 00:18:04.980
if you're in Hannah's
position, if you've

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.290
come to care about
someone, and then

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.860
you sense them pulling away,
and you don't know why.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.405
And I've definitely heard from
a lot of readers who have--

00:18:16.405 --> 00:18:18.530
and women readers-- who
are disappointed in Hannah,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.130
because she does-- she
gets more insecure,

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.499
and she becomes
weaker and needier.

00:18:25.499 --> 00:18:27.290
And I think, as a woman,
you read the book,

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.130
and you just want
to tell-- you want

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.900
her to kick him to the curb.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.190
And I wish she would.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.396
I, too, feel the same
way that Claire did.

00:18:34.396 --> 00:18:36.020
But it was important
to me that she not

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.670
do that, because I felt
that, ironically, it

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.230
would be letting
Nate off the hook,

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.080
if Hannah got away too unhurt.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.802
That I felt, like, to show
how hurtful his behavior is,

00:18:45.802 --> 00:18:47.260
I had to show its
effect on Hannah.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.590
It gets under her skin.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:55.291
He's not so bad that she-- that
she can just break up with him,

00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:55.790
instantly.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.465
She's trying to--
she likes him; she's

00:18:57.465 --> 00:18:58.590
trying to make the best of.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.249
And he does things
like-- like, she asks him

00:19:01.249 --> 00:19:03.790
if something is wrong, because
she senses something is wrong,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.360
and he says no-- but
in a tone of voice that

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.450
clearly suggests there is.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.214
And I think that
can be maddening.

00:19:10.214 --> 00:19:11.130
And it's hard to know.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.000
It's, like, do you
break up with a person

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.600
because they're being a
little cool or distant?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.570
But maybe they've just had a bad
day, or maybe they're stressed.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.680
So I felt like it was really
important to, kind of,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:30.530
allow Hannah to really
run the gamut and be her.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.280
And she, ultimately, does-- ooh,
I shouldn't give away too much.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.770
But I understand
that frustration.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.470
I, too, wish I could shake
Hannah and get her to break up

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.530
with Nate, and Nate
could, sort of, earlier

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.360
get the comeuppance he
definitely deserves.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.940
But I didn't think that would
serve my purpose in being

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:55.590
realistic, and, also, in showing
just how harmful Nate's-- that

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.700
kind of behavior can be,
for the other person.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.334
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So-- well, I

00:20:00.334 --> 00:20:02.000
will say-- if you
haven't read the book,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.170
there are these, like, moments
in Nate's inner monologue.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.590
First of all, he assesses
every woman, physically, [SNAP]

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.840
immediately, which, you have
to believe, is happening.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.770
But also, things
like-- the pillows

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.970
on her bed bug the
crap out of him.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.940
And, like, how she's
decorated-- you know,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.960
these moments are very
specific and exactly right.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.350
There's also been a
question, that I get,

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.010
which is, is there any
of your brother in Nate?

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.219
And the answer I give is, I
think his hideous apartment--

00:20:30.219 --> 00:20:31.177
ADELLE WALDMAN: [LAUGH]

00:20:31.177 --> 00:20:31.677
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:31.677 --> 00:20:33.843
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
(LAUGHING) --is, potentially,

00:20:33.843 --> 00:20:36.800
drawn from my brother's
excellent housekeeping skills.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.110
But I won't put you on
the spot too much on that.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.380
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.755
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: But you've

00:20:40.755 --> 00:20:44.507
probably had to deal with,
how did you create Nate, and--

00:20:44.507 --> 00:20:45.840
ADELLE WALDMAN: Well, definite--

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.590
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: --is
there a specific individual,

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.970
or--?

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.053
ADELLE WALDMAN: There is
no particular individual,

00:20:50.053 --> 00:20:52.530
and certainly not
my kind husband,

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.406
Claire's brother, who--

00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:54.906
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:54.906 --> 00:20:55.170
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
She's, like, I

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.628
don't want to get
in trouble, here.

00:20:56.628 --> 00:20:57.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.179
ADELLE WALDMAN: Perhaps
some very minor details,

00:20:59.179 --> 00:21:01.500
such as the top of Nate's
dresser, I did, maybe,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.355
peer at the top of
my husband's dresser,

00:21:03.355 --> 00:21:06.270
to see what kind of
junk he kept on it.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.836
But that's about it.

00:21:07.836 --> 00:21:09.877
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And the hideous apartment.

00:21:09.877 --> 00:21:12.920
ADELLE WALDMAN: [LAUGH]
But in a deeper way.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.070
Nate-- the way he
sizes up women--

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.920
writing that was so
weird and painful.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.905
And I had a good friend of
mine, who I'd give the novel to,

00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:24.280
in chunks, when
I was writing it.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.870
And I gave her the first
five chapters to read.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.490
And then we met for a
drink, to discuss it.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.342
And she was, like,
I have to tell you,

00:21:32.342 --> 00:21:33.800
I'm feeling a little
uncomfortable.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.845
When-- when I-- now
that I've read the book,

00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:39.997
I feel like, when
we see each other,

00:21:39.997 --> 00:21:41.330
are you checking out my breasts?

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.260
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: [LAUGH]

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.440
ADELLE WALDMAN: And
I was, like, no!

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.320
And when I am writing,
and being Nate,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.700
it's a totally different world.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.570
When I'm back to
being Adelle, like,

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.120
the world looks normal again.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.580
But I get that.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.690
And some of what I wrote in
the book really disturbed me.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.980
I felt, to do what
I wanted to do,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.180
well enough, I had to put
my own feelings aside,

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.500
because a lot of
what Nate thinks

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.680
are, actually, the
things that I most feared

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.450
an ex-boyfriend would've thought
about me, when we were dating.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.080
They weren't comforting
for me to imagine.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.370
But I felt that there
was a reason to do that,

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.740
in part because I
didn't want it to read

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.280
like any kind of fantasy.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.150
I wanted it to be a
serious book about dating.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.710
And I don't think
that's an oxymoron.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:31.500
I think many of us who spend
a good portion of our adult

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.700
lives single, in
this day and age,

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.500
and that the struggles of
finding the right person

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.760
and dating deserve to
be taken seriously.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.340
They're not inherently
just frothy,

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.050
and the stuff of
romantic comedies.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.200
I wanted to write, I felt,
a serious, if not always

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.410
comforting, book,
about these subjects.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.730
And I got freaked out.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.030
And the one story I love to
tell, about Evan-- Claire's

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.270
brother, my husband-- is,
there were times when I'd just

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.740
write something I felt
was so disturbing,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.640
just, like, one of
Nate's fantasies,

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.829
or just he'd be sizing
up women's bodies.

00:23:06.829 --> 00:23:08.495
And I would just be
in my little office,

00:23:08.495 --> 00:23:10.080
and I'd get all disgusted.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.410
And I'd come out,
and I'd see Evan,

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.190
and I'd just be mad at him for--

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.730
--being a guy.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.950
And then Evan would
feel like it was unfair,

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:22.040
that I was mad at him for what I
made my imaginary character say

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.810
and do, in my imaginary world.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.120
And I think he had a point.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.190
But I had a point, too,
(LAUGHING) I think.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.951
But yeah.

00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:30.450
Wow.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:30.950
Men.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.900
But actually, I'll just
say-- men in the room--

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.650
they're-- I don't think
all men are as bad as Nate.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.362
I do think Nate behaves in
some stereotypically male ways,

00:23:40.362 --> 00:23:41.570
and that was important to me.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.870
I didn't want to
write a male character

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.910
that, maybe, was
believable as a male,

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:50.485
but that sort of-- on the
far end of being feminine.

00:23:50.485 --> 00:23:54.830
And I wanted to write, like, a
kind of uber-masculine guy who

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.770
does the things-- like, he
doesn't-- he's ambivalent about

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.150
wanting a relationship; he goes
out on a couple of really good

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.670
dates and then takes,
like, a week to call.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:09.530
He, when asked if something
is wrong, he's apt to say no,

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.150
just 'cause he wants to
avoid a conversation.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:17.880
And just behaviors that,
I felt, seemed-- not

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.290
typical of every
man-- and again, women

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.900
have-- we have our own.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.960
Women do these things, as well.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.730
But it was very interesting
to try to explore,

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.809
in a fair way, the thinking that
might underlie these behaviors.

00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:32.100
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So I
don't want to give it away,

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.990
but I love the
ending of the novel.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.810
I found it fascinating
when I learned

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.130
that some readers, including
more professional readers,

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.620
thought the ending
was a happy ending.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.505
I'm not saying it's
an unhappy ending.

00:24:43.505 --> 00:24:45.630
I think it's an ending that
really makes you think.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.630
But how did you handle it, when
various reviewers or readers,

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.990
or even editors,
sort of made comments

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.480
about the novel that were
not, maybe, your intended--

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.090
or is that-- was
that exciting, to see

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:57.426
a different interpretation?

00:24:57.426 --> 00:24:58.967
ADELLE WALDMAN: A
little bit of both.

00:24:58.967 --> 00:25:01.790
So one of the challenges, for
me, in writing this novel,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.037
is that it's all told
from Nate's perspective.

00:25:05.037 --> 00:25:07.370
It's written in something
called the close third person.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.411
So it's not first person;
I'm not writing, like,

00:25:09.411 --> 00:25:11.910
"I this, I that"-- which would
be a little bit weird for me,

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.010
as a woman, to be
writing first person,

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.400
from Nate's perspective.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.720
So it's close third.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.816
It's always in his head.

00:25:19.816 --> 00:25:21.315
You don't get the
perspectives-- you

00:25:21.315 --> 00:25:22.740
don't get the inner thoughts
of any other character,

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.769
and there's no narrator
making judgments.

00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:27.060
And that was really hard for
me, because I'm, actually,

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.410
a pretty moralistic, judgmental
person, in a lot of ways.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.600
And I wanted to step
in and be, like, OK,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.090
we know that when
Nate does this,

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.050
it's bad, for these reasons,
and he's been a jerk, here.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.520
But I couldn't, because
it's in his head.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.120
So I, also, felt like that left
open room for interpretation.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.210
And there's a lot
of things that I

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.040
think about what
are wrong with Nate

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.330
that they're just--
they're not in the book.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.954
And it's been very
interesting, for me,

00:25:52.954 --> 00:25:55.600
to hear different
people's responses.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.640
And I have a mixed reaction.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.140
In some ways, it's exciting
when people read the book really

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.470
differently, because it makes
me feel that I have been fair,

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:09.070
that the ending was fair,
if some people can read it

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.070
as a happier ending and
some as a sadder ending.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.070
It sort of depends how
you feel about the person

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.780
and the relationship Nate is in.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.900
And I wanted it to be as
realistic as any relationship

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.020
that anyone we know might be in.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.210
It's not 100% perfect, but
I don't think any of us

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.970
are in relationships that are.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.886
And just-- you know,
just, like, relationships

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:30.850
with your friends, or
that a friend might have,

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.790
you might think, ah, she could
have done a little bit better.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.206
But then, someone else might
be, like, no, no, no, they're

00:26:36.206 --> 00:26:37.400
pretty happy.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.690
So I wanted it to
feel like that.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.580
So in the one sense,
it's gratifying,

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.390
if there's a variety
of responses;

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.110
I feel like I wasn't
too heavy-handed

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.869
and didn't force my perspective.

00:26:46.869 --> 00:26:49.160
On the other hand, there are
moments, it's frustrating.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.250
I'm like, what?

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.390
I totally wanted everyone
to think this other thing.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.140
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's very honest.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.710
So let's talk a minute about--
you got a novel published.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:00.920
That's a big deal.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.420
So can you tell me a little bit
about your journey to that--

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:03.820
ADELLE WALDMAN: Sure.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.880
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: --and
career choices you made?

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.595
We always like to have talks
about career development,

00:27:07.595 --> 00:27:08.380
at Google.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.950
(LAUGHING) And so-- this is
a very non-Googly career,

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.590
(LAUGHING) that
Adelle has developed.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.324
And I think it's
pretty fascinating.

00:27:14.324 --> 00:27:15.240
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.690
Well, I graduated from
college with the desire

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.770
to write a novel.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.100
The problem was,
I had zero ability

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.600
to actually write a
novel, at that point.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.955
I somehow thought that it
wouldn't be as hard as it was.

00:27:30.955 --> 00:27:34.614
But soon after I graduated
from college, I realized,

00:27:34.614 --> 00:27:36.780
I don't know why I had
thought I could just do this,

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.060
and it would just work.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.530
So I went into journalism
as a good day job--

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.190
as something that
seemed kind of fun.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.360
I knew people who
worked as journalists.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.460
I thought it could
only help my writing,

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.391
and I'd learn more
about the world.

00:27:50.391 --> 00:27:51.640
And it turned out to be great.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.210
And I spent my 20s working
in-- I first started

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.430
a financial trade
publication, and then moved

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.070
from there to the "New
Haven Register" newspaper,

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.740
in Connecticut.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.920
And it was great.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.754
It was a lot of fun.

00:28:02.754 --> 00:28:04.253
But in the back of
my mind, I always

00:28:04.253 --> 00:28:06.516
wanted to be a novelist,
which wasn't great, you know,

00:28:06.516 --> 00:28:08.140
when you do those
job interviews.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.672
And they're like, where do you
see yourself in five years?

00:28:10.672 --> 00:28:12.690
I'd be, like,
novel-- no-- I would

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.750
like to be covering
international affairs

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.140
for the "New York
Times." [LAUGH]

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.960
So it was always on my mind.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.007
And then, when I was about 29,
maybe, it was freaking me out.

00:28:24.007 --> 00:28:26.090
Like, oh my god, am I going
to spend my whole life

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:30.780
as a person-- when the back of
my mind wants to write novels,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.390
but never does?

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.000
I decided to take a bold step.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.880
I was writing a column, for
the wallstreetjournal.com,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.920
about twentysomethings'
personal finances.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.950
And I quit that gig, and
I wrote my last column

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.589
about how I was going
to sublet my apartment

00:28:46.589 --> 00:28:48.130
and move in with my
parents and spend

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.650
six months writing a novel.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.000
And I did.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.614
And the amazing thing is,
I actually wrote a novel.

00:28:54.614 --> 00:28:56.780
And I had never written
anything that had more than,

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.630
like, 30 pages before I gave
up, because it was horrible.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.950
And it really was-- what
I'd written-- was horrible.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.200
So just the fact that I'd
actually finished one,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.744
in six months, blew me away.

00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.160
And I was a little
bit unrealistic

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.609
about what would happen next.

00:29:08.609 --> 00:29:10.650
I came back to New York
at the end of six months.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.650
My subletters moved out.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.950
I thought-- I thought it would
be just a matter of months

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.476
before I got an agent,
that novel was sold,

00:29:18.476 --> 00:29:21.393
I was on-- being interviewed
by Terry Gross, on "Fresh Air,"

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:22.518
I never had to work again--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

CLAIRE HUGHES

00:29:23.892 --> 00:29:24.871
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

CLAIRE HUGHES

realize, in your life.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:27.850
ADELLE WALDMAN:
(LAUGHING) Right.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.820
I mean, I just
thought-- this is great.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.070
I'm done.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.289
So it didn't actually
proceed that smoothly.

00:29:34.289 --> 00:29:36.330
And I moved back to New
York, and I had decided--

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.590
since I was only going to
be nonfamous for six weeks,

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.820
or something-- that I--

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.920
--should, um-- I'd just get a
job tutoring as an SAT tutor,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.427
because it just seemed
like, why bother

00:29:48.427 --> 00:29:50.010
to try to land another
journalism job,

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.960
for such a short time?

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.471
I wound up being an SAT
tutor for six years.

00:29:55.471 --> 00:29:56.470
It didn't go as planned.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.550
So that novel didn't
find a publisher,

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.490
and it took me
awhile to realize,

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.240
that's actually for the best.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.880
At the time, I was devastated;
definitely devastated.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.520
But, over time, I saw
that I had learned a lot

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.850
from writing that novel,
but it really-- it

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.250
wasn't ready to be published.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.710
And, eventually I
met Evan, my husband.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.300
And I'd like to give
them credit for this,

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.330
that he, sort of, pushed
me to start another novel.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.315
He said, well, you
can't just always dwell

00:30:28.315 --> 00:30:29.940
on the novel that
didn't get published,

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.730
if you want to be a novelist.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.440
Now you know you
can write a novel,

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.250
and why not start another?

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.210
And that led to my
starting this one.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.120
And it took a lot longer
than six months, which I hope

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.710
is good for the
quality of the novel.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:46.050
[LAUGH] I wound up taking
about four years to write it.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.900
And in that time, I
found a literary agent,

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.880
who's a person who, then, takes
it to publishers and sells it.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:00.110
And she sold it very nicely and
quickly-- which was gratifying,

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.860
after my last experience.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:07.440
So, all told, it was
four years of writing,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.240
and then there was
about another year

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.310
before it actually
appeared, because publishing

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.290
takes a long time.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.812
So it was about
five years from when

00:31:13.812 --> 00:31:16.640
I started writing to when
it actually was a book.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.130
In which time, I
think that many people

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.420
in my life, understandably,
were sick of hearing

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.895
me talk about this novel that
never seemed to go anywhere.

00:31:23.895 --> 00:31:25.478
It was just a Microsoft
Word document.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.150
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And then you, kind of,

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.233
achieved that dream you
had with your first novel,

00:31:33.233 --> 00:31:35.050
which is this recognition.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:39.205
And it is unusual for a first
novel to get the attention

00:31:39.205 --> 00:31:41.670
and acclaim that "The Love
Affairs" has received.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:42.015
ADELLE WALDMAN: That's true.

00:31:42.015 --> 00:31:42.514
Although--

00:31:42.514 --> 00:31:45.460
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Did
that strike you as gratifying,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.560
or do you know that that
(LAUGHING) was unusual?

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.330
ADELLE WALDMAN: Well, now--

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:48.590
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: I know you

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.720
know that, intellectually, but--

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.120
ADELLE WALDMAN: Now,
I absolutely do,

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.450
but at the time-- I mean,
during the first novel-- I mean,

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.750
the thing is, I don't think
I've ever achieved the glory I

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.860
thought I would with
the first novel,

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.320
because I was so unrealistic--

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:58.810
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Oh, because there's

00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:59.880
Terry Gross involved.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.125
Right.

00:32:00.125 --> 00:32:00.370
OK.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:00.550
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.450
And I just thought-- this "never
having to work again" thing--

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:07.218
I didn't, really, quite
understand the economics of it.

00:32:07.218 --> 00:32:11.770
[LAUGH] So maybe I'll
always be striving

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.240
for that dream of glory.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.900
But no, no; it's been great.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.096
And I think it's been
good that, over the years,

00:32:19.096 --> 00:32:20.970
I learned more about
the publishing industry,

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.140
and my expectations
have been moderated.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.170
And then, certainly, the
response to this novel

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:31.290
has exceeded my expectations
in so many ways that

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.840
have been extremely gratifying.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.200
But I also think it was
healthier to think smaller--

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.790
and to realize, too, that the
main part of writing a novel

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.690
is, actually, the writing of
it; the time it's just you,

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.910
sitting there, at the computer.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.900
And that part is, actually,
really fun and gratifying.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.880
And I think that has to be the
main thing, because you never

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.310
know what will happen
with the response.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.825
Or sales; very mysterious.

00:32:56.825 --> 00:32:57.950
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Yes.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.002
Mysterious sales.

00:32:59.002 --> 00:33:01.210
And you're now on-- so you
did, sort of, a little bit

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.710
of a tour, when it
was out in hardcover.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.900
And now, the way it
works is, they send you

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.340
on another tour-- yes?

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:07.720
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.425
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
For paperback?

00:33:08.425 --> 00:33:08.860
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.485
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: The whole
publishing thing is, actually,

00:33:11.485 --> 00:33:14.060
fascinating, if you don't work
(LAUGHING) in that industry.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.260
ADELLE WALDMAN: Interesting.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:14.760
Yeah.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.765
So I was in Portland on Monday
night, and Seattle last night.

00:33:18.765 --> 00:33:20.390
And then a place
called Corte Madera--?

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:21.295
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Corte Madera.

00:33:21.295 --> 00:33:21.660
ADELLE WALDMAN: --tonight.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.350
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Tonight.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.040
ADELLE WALDMAN: And
Oakland, tomorrow.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.200
So it's exciting.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.362
And fun.

00:33:26.362 --> 00:33:28.570
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So
you go to these bookstores,

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:29.180
and you read.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.250
And do you sign them, and
you, kinda, chat with people?

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.410
Do weird people show up?

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.143
What kind of people show up?

00:33:34.143 --> 00:33:35.010
ADELLE WALDMAN: All right.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.120
I'm going to give you the
really candid answer, if you

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.060
don't mind.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.060
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
This is getting recorded.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.732
ADELLE WALDMAN: So Monday night,
I did the reading in Portland,

00:33:42.732 --> 00:33:44.440
at Powell's Bookstore--
famous bookstore.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.720
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Very iconic.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.928
ADELLE WALDMAN: It was great.

00:33:46.928 --> 00:33:48.360
It was so much fun.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.262
A good crowd came; the
questions were great.

00:33:52.262 --> 00:33:53.640
This was really good.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.000
And I've done a lot of
readings, at this point.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.170
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Was
it, like, young hipsters,

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:56.730
basically?

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:57.185
Or what was the--

00:33:57.185 --> 00:33:59.060
ADELLE WALDMAN: Actually,
an interesting mix.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.676
I remember two people in
line-- you do a signing, after.

00:34:01.676 --> 00:34:03.300
So you talk to people
who buy the books

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.100
and want me to sign them
and chat for a minute.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.516
There were two
women who said they

00:34:06.516 --> 00:34:09.350
were buying the books to help
them understand their sons,

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.120
and that they thought
that they might

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.820
give the book to their sons.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.460
And I think they had read
about it in an alt weekly,

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.190
in Portland, which had
just run an interview.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:21.340
So there were-- and
there were some, sort of,

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.980
older people-- um-- a mix.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.760
And then younger-- the younger
hipster crowd, definitely.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.804
And there's always an
interesting gender mix,

00:34:31.804 --> 00:34:32.929
I have to say, at readings.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:37.020
And one thing that has also
been gratifying, to me,

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.900
is that, when you write a
book about relationships,

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.360
there's the perception
that it's for women.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.610
That only women care about it.

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:48.239
And I have to say, my book
is-- I think, actually, men

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:52.440
might like it better, maybe
because Nate is hard to like,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.080
as a woman.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.050
I get-- a lot of the reviews
have been written by men,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:59.810
and I get-- about
2/3 of the letters

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.460
I get are, actually, from guys,
saying they relate to Nate,

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.480
and they see their thoughts
reflected on the page.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.300
But again, what I
also think, that

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.690
does make them better than Nate,
because they're self-aware.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.300
But I also feel like it's
just gratifying, in its way,

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.650
to think, men do care
about relationships.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.902
This is a book--
there is no B-plot.

00:35:18.902 --> 00:35:20.110
It's all about relationships.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:24.170
There's no terrorism,
there are no police chases,

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.600
there's no cigars
or whisky-- well,

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.222
there's a little whisky--
but, you know-- I don't know.

00:35:30.222 --> 00:35:31.164
So that's been neat.

00:35:31.164 --> 00:35:32.580
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So you were

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.500
telling-- Portland was great.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.075
So maybe not
everywhere is great.

00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:37.158
ADELLE WALDMAN: Oh my god.

00:35:37.158 --> 00:35:39.170
So, then I went to
Seattle, last night.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.470
And Seattle has a great
bookstore-- Elliott Bay

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.260
Bookstore.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.010
And wow, I-- it was just a
very, very different crowd.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:52.190
And nobody laughed, and the
questions felt kind of hostile.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.760
It was just so different.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.090
And I don't know if
it just-- who comes.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.350
Maybe it was a beautiful
day in Seattle,

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.609
and the reading was in
a downstairs basement.

00:36:00.609 --> 00:36:02.650
Maybe people were in a
bad mood from being there.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.859
Maybe I read horribly.

00:36:03.859 --> 00:36:04.400
I don't know.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.519
But it can vary.

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:08.185
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: What is a
hostile question, to an author?

00:36:08.185 --> 00:36:09.418
I mean--

00:36:09.418 --> 00:36:12.450
ADELLE WALDMAN: I don't-- I
guess it-- it will just be,

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:17.825
like, why-- why are your
characters (LAUGHING)

00:36:17.825 --> 00:36:18.776
so pretentious?

00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:21.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.000
It's pretty--

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.470
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
did, almost, ask you a very--

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.852
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:23.852 --> 00:36:24.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:24.352 --> 00:36:25.000
--actually.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.560
Because there is
some intellectual

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.425
snobbery-- right? --in Nate
and his circle of friends.

00:36:29.425 --> 00:36:30.800
And it's fascinating
to watch him

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.010
be so obsessed with
women's breasts, and then,

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:36.569
the next moment, be
thinking about how

00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:38.610
to write about the income
(LAUGHING) inequality--

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.140
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.056
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
--in radical, new ways.

00:36:41.056 --> 00:36:44.494
And I wondered if people
found that off-putting.

00:36:44.494 --> 00:36:45.410
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.118
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Because that group

00:36:47.118 --> 00:36:49.676
is-- that's not most people's
circle of friends, right?

00:36:49.676 --> 00:36:50.592
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:36:50.592 --> 00:36:53.530
Yeah, I really think that's
been a factor, with this book.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.986
And I don't know
what to say about it.

00:36:55.986 --> 00:36:57.360
When I set out to
write the book,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.369
I felt like I wanted to write
the book-- the book that I

00:37:02.369 --> 00:37:03.660
was most interested in writing.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.380
And I didn't think it
would be good, as a writer,

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.400
to start thinking about,
what would appeal to the most

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.420
amount of people,
and how could I

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.000
create the most
relatable character.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.020
I thought if I could make the
character be very particular,

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.480
I would hope that it
would speak to people.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.950
And I guess I was
also interested,

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:21.480
as a writer, living in New York,
in a particular subculture--

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.900
there's this, sort of,
intellectual sexism, among men,

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:26.870
that interested me.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.780
And I was around
guys who, I felt,

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:36.040
presume themselves to be, sort
of, intellectual inheritors

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.250
of greatness, in this
way that, I felt,

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.190
that the women in
our circle, who

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.140
are equally motivated
and intelligent

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.410
and well-read-- I just don't
know if we see ourselves

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.460
in quite the same terms.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.060
And I really wanted
to explore that

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.730
without completely demonizing
Nate, but trying to flesh out

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.120
some of his more
sexist thoughts.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.836
That he's not a monster, doesn't
state these things aloud.

00:37:58.836 --> 00:38:01.086
He doesn't think women should
be barefoot and pregnant

00:38:01.086 --> 00:38:01.930
in the kitchen.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.542
But he has some
intellectual sexism.

00:38:04.542 --> 00:38:06.250
So that was important,
to me, to explore,

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.670
but there is a flip
side-- is that, it's just

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.550
a book set among a
self-consciously intellectual

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.826
crowd.

00:38:12.826 --> 00:38:14.575
And I understand why
that puts people off.

00:38:14.575 --> 00:38:17.450
I mean, it puts off people,
including my parents, I think,

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:18.192
a little.

00:38:18.192 --> 00:38:19.900
They think-- they
think it's pretentious.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.024
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
what about your friends?

00:38:22.024 --> 00:38:24.130
ADELLE WALDMAN: Oh,
well, I think-- oh-- huh.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.440
How do I answer this without
seeming to undercut my friends?

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.856
Are we all pretentious,
that (LAUGHING) we--?

00:38:29.856 --> 00:38:30.820
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I'm
not calling your friends

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.150
pretentious--

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.570
ADELLE WALDMAN: No, no!

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.390
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: --but
I wonder if they think, oh,

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.764
that's me, and that's her, and--

00:38:34.764 --> 00:38:35.680
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.407
Um, I think I've been
very, very lucky.

00:38:38.407 --> 00:38:40.240
And I was also careful,
in writing the book,

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.290
to try to make sure
that the book was true

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.707
to a general
subculture, but not--

00:38:44.707 --> 00:38:46.581
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
--yours, specifically.

00:38:46.581 --> 00:38:48.430
ADELLE WALDMAN:
--implicate individuals,

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.740
because that seemed-- it's just
not the-- the book has kind

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.760
of-- Nate's tone is
not always very nice,

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.801
and the thing-- I mean,
it's often not very nice.

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:59.380
The way he thinks about
people-- I would never

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:03.240
want any particular person to
read the book and think Nate

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.680
was thinking that
way about them.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.930
So I feel like all the
characters are very carefully

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:10.270
designed to not be real people.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.730
But one thing-- I have to say
this-- a good friend mine,

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:16.800
from high school-- who's not
in this subculture, at all--

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.600
he read an early
copy of the book.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.714
And he said he liked
it, but he told me,

00:39:21.714 --> 00:39:23.880
after the book was published,
that he was very, very

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.380
relieved at the way
it was received.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.640
Because, he said,
that, when he read it,

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.250
he thought people in my
world-- writers in Brooklyn--

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.470
would be horrified, because it
portrays them so negatively,

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.540
and that I'd be,
kind of, cast out.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.592
And he was just worried for my
sake, but-- what would I do?

00:39:39.592 --> 00:39:42.260
Actually, it hasn't
been like that at all.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.039
And that has been-- luckily, I
didn't-- if I had expected what

00:39:46.039 --> 00:39:48.580
Matt expected for me, I would
have been so much more nervous.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.470
But that I think
that even people

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.450
in this literary
Brooklyn world get

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:57.410
a kick out of seeing
recognizable types.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:01.190
Or, in any case, people
have been very nice to me,

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.210
about the book, in Brooklyn.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.710
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's great.

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.252
Any questions?

00:40:07.252 --> 00:40:08.710
I'll let you guys
think about that.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.944
All right.

00:40:08.944 --> 00:40:09.750
We've got a lot of questions.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:10.250
Right.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.526
We'll start over here.

00:40:11.526 --> 00:40:12.145
Yes.

00:40:12.145 --> 00:40:13.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:26.466
ADELLE WALDMAN: Mhm.

00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:27.341
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:34.954 --> 00:40:36.620
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I'm going to just

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.970
restate the question, quickly.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.150
So the comment was--
without giving a lot away--

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.120
the book has a long relationship
and a shorter relationship,

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.700
and the longer relationship
is a richer one

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.340
and also gets more
time in the book.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.470
And was that intentional,
in terms of time,

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.090
as well as how you
perceived the relationship?

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.749
Is that a fair restatement?

00:40:53.749 --> 00:40:54.540
ADELLE WALDMAN: OK.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.921
I think this is
a great question.

00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:57.420
It's only tricky
for me to answer it

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.552
in a way that is
meaningful to those

00:40:59.552 --> 00:41:01.760
who have read the book,
without giving too much away.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.510
I'm going to try to do my best.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.320
So when I conceived the book,
I knew from the very beginning

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.540
who Nate was going
to end up with.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:17.720
And I wanted it to be not
obvious to readers, any more

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.520
than it was obvious to Nate.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.700
And there's a basic
little plot I had in mind,

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.550
that I felt that, if I
could take-- I thought,

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.880
there's this thing that
happens, sometimes,

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.310
where-- this is from a
woman's perspective--

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.820
a woman in a heterosexual
relationship.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.950
She's dating a guy, things
are good, for a while.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.180
Then things are less good.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.350
He seems to be pulling away.

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:47.460
She doesn't know why.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.160
Things get worse and worse.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.720
And then, they finally break up.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.230
She is unhappy,
because she liked him.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.480
But she tells herself that,
well, this guy, really,

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.550
has commitment issues.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.286
So that's clearly the problem.

00:42:01.286 --> 00:42:03.160
But then what happens--
like, a month later--

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:08.310
he's suddenly moving in with
someone else who seems, maybe,

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.440
less good for him, on paper.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.250
And I thought-- I
felt like this was

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.660
a scenario that
seemed just common.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:16.834
And I had heard of
it from friends.

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:18.750
So I thought, wouldn't
it be neat to dramatize

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.570
it-- to dramatize all
the players in it,

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.160
and to be fair to each of them?

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.102
So that played a role in
how I conceived the book.

00:42:29.102 --> 00:42:29.810
So in some ways--

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:30.490
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Because those things

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.160
happen quickly, those--

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.150
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.530
Like, the final relationship
happens quickly.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:39.160
It takes a long time for, maybe,
a bad relationship to play out,

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:44.600
and a new relationship,
in this case,

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.080
seemed to happen more quickly.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.055
So that's part of how I
saw the book's structure.

00:42:51.055 --> 00:42:54.054
I also thought, after
spending so much time

00:42:54.054 --> 00:42:55.470
on one relationship,
that I really

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.310
wanted to trace
this whole arc, it

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.780
would be tiresome
to do it again.

00:43:02.462 --> 00:43:05.440
I think those are the-- that
might be the best I can do,

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.660
without giving too much away.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.035
But I think it's
a good question,

00:43:08.035 --> 00:43:13.820
because it's an odd
choi-- and it's-- people--

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.140
I do think the final chapter
does seem to come rather

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.855
quickly.

00:43:17.855 --> 00:43:19.730
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You've got a question?

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.271
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about your
overall process [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:34.777 --> 00:43:36.360
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
So the question

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.270
was the process-- was there an
outline or a structure in mind?

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:40.570
Was it iterative?

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:41.630
What did you start with?

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:42.680
ADELLE WALDMAN: Right.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.080
Well, I had this basic
arc, that I just described,

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.210
of the relationship--
from beginning

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.470
to end-- that I wanted to show.

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:52.980
So I went with that.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.690
And I did know, from
the very beginning,

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.480
who Nate was going
to end up with.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.180
And so I put that chara--
well, sort of put her in,

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.660
early in the book, in
the way that I-- there's

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.570
this saying among
writers of-- it's

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.590
from Chekov, that
Chekov said, if there's

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:12.480
a gun in the first act, it has
to go off in the third act.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.960
So I really wanted the
one Nate winds up with

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.650
to be there from the
beginning, but not

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:20.430
necessarily in a way you pay
attention to, at the time.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:23.140
So in that sense, I was very
much aware of the structure,

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.120
from the beginning.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.536
But that said,
that makes it sound

00:44:25.536 --> 00:44:28.024
like I had so much more control
or knew what I was doing.

00:44:28.024 --> 00:44:30.190
It took me so many years
to write this book, in part

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.830
because I had to go back
and play with the structure.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.900
To try to get a relationship
in a slow decline,

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.660
the way Nate and
Hannah's eventually is,

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:39.626
was so hard for me.

00:44:39.626 --> 00:44:42.000
I feel like it's something
we've all experienced-- again,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.560
men or women, in real life.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.620
But it's hard to
dramatize relationships

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.804
just getting slightly
worse, because, you know,

00:44:50.804 --> 00:44:51.470
nothing happens.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.770
There's no-- no
one cheats, there's

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:57.590
no violent fights,
where dishes are thrown.

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:59.940
It's sort of a series of
dinners that are a little bit--

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.815
something is off, and
they're kind of boring.

00:45:01.815 --> 00:45:04.064
It was, like, how do I write
about this without making

00:45:04.064 --> 00:45:07.060
the reader feel as bored as Nate
and Hannah do in the moment?

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.780
And to sort of get
that right, and try

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:13.310
to come up with scenes that
convey what's going on,

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:17.170
without being terribly
boring, was really tricky.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.420
So it's like, I had
this overall structure,

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.532
but the microscenes
took me a long time.

00:45:22.532 --> 00:45:23.740
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Great.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:24.730
Any other questions?

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.330
Back here?

00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:31.046
ADELLE WALDMAN: Oh!

00:45:31.046 --> 00:45:32.692
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:32.692 --> 00:45:33.775
ADELLE WALDMAN: Thank you.

00:45:33.775 --> 00:45:34.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:38.433 --> 00:45:39.880
ADELLE WALDMAN: Oh, thank you!

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.755
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:54.770
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So the
first was a lovely compliment,

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:58.140
that this book is
recommended by our questioner

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.280
to his male friends.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.670
And the other is-- so,
if you're not aware,

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.672
Adelle recently wrote-- is
"novella" the right word--?

00:46:05.672 --> 00:46:06.505
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:06.505 --> 00:46:06.850
ADELLE WALDMAN: I don't know.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:06.920
It's--

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.320
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
A short story?

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.600
ADELLE WALDMAN: --a long short
story, or a short novella.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.230
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
--called "New Year,"

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.855
from the perspective one of the
female characters of the book--

00:46:13.855 --> 00:46:15.965
one of the friends
of Nate, who's

00:46:15.965 --> 00:46:18.020
a woman who is a
fascinating character,

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.450
actually, in the book.

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.240
And why did that
happen, or how did

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.630
that come about--
kind of question.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:27.320
ADELLE WALDMAN: Yeah,
so-- it's so interesting.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.070
I didn't intend to write
this other short story, "New

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.370
Year's," exactly.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:37.430
I had mentioned,
casually, to my publisher,

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.570
that I had a lot
more material on each

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.807
of the characters
in my book than,

00:46:41.807 --> 00:46:43.140
actually, make it into the book.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.181
Which is normal, I think.

00:46:44.181 --> 00:46:45.700
As a writer, you
spend so many years

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.400
thinking about these characters.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.200
So I knew-- you know, it
was fun for me to flesh out

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.770
the backstory of
all the characters,

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.350
even though it's not,
actually, in the book.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:58.230
And the publisher-- the guy
whose title is, literally,

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:02.019
the publisher-- said, you know,
that might be fascinating.

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:04.310
Would you be interested in
taking some of this material

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:07.130
and putting it into a story?

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:08.755
And I said, no.

00:47:08.755 --> 00:47:10.120
(LAUGHING) Absolutely not.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.030
Because I thought the book
was an aesthetic whole.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.040
It was very important to me
to keep it in its perspective.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.415
I worried that another
perspective-- there

00:47:19.415 --> 00:47:23.820
would be a temptation for
me to moralize too much.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.320
I worried about all
sorts of things.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.740
At the same time, as soon as
he had raised this possibility,

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.680
some part of my mind was a
little excited and intrigued

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.430
by it, because I really
loved writing this book,

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.490
and I loved thinking
about all the characters.

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:40.370
So it was a little
bit like an invitation

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:43.750
to go back to a world that
I'd had a lot of fun in.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.660
And in the end, I was persuaded
to just give it a try.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.200
And I said, OK, OK, I'll try it.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.908
But I'm not going to
guarantee that we're

00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:52.890
going to publish anything,
because I did have concerns.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.990
And I wound up writing
from the perspective

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.315
of a character named
Aurit, who is sort

00:47:58.315 --> 00:48:01.440
of a truth-telling
female friend of Nate.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.280
She gives him a hard time about
the way he behaves with women.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.630
And she was a very fun
character to write.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:14.020
And it seemed fun to
inhabit her mindset.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.150
And it was fun.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:16.760
And I have to say, when I
sat down to write this story,

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.968
it took on a life of its own.

00:48:17.968 --> 00:48:20.180
It wasn't something I
had thought I would do

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.990
or intended to do, but
once I started doing it,

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:24.690
I became invested in it.

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:28.410
But I still feel a little--
it's hard for me to explain it,

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:31.310
because it wasn't something
I ever thought I would do,

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:33.110
and yet, I really enjoyed it.

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.952
And I came to care
about the story.

00:48:34.952 --> 00:48:36.160
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Right.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.470
Any final last question?

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:38.747
We're almost out of time.

00:48:38.747 --> 00:48:39.580
You have a question?

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:39.940
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.620
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
All right; great.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:42.579
AUDIENCE: How did you
meet your literary agent?

00:48:42.579 --> 00:48:43.661
ADELLE WALDMAN: Oh, great!

00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:44.610
A practical question.

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:47.926
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: How
did you meet the agent?

00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:50.550
ADELLE WALDMAN: Well, when I had
written that first novel, that

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:52.383
didn't get published,
I didn't know anything

00:48:52.383 --> 00:48:53.300
about book publishing.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.716
It's funny; you
would have thought

00:48:54.716 --> 00:48:57.100
that-- I lived in New York,
and I worked in newspapers--

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.099
that I would know a lot.

00:48:58.099 --> 00:49:00.910
But there's, actually,
a pretty strict divide

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.440
between people in
the newspaper world

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.185
and in the publishing world.

00:49:06.185 --> 00:49:08.810
And that's probably, too, why I
had these delusions of grandeur

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:10.740
about what was going to happen.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:17.340
But at that point, I wrote
letters to literary agents

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.872
that I saw in directories
of literary agents.

00:49:20.872 --> 00:49:21.580
You can buy them.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.910
Now they're mostly online.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:26.990
And you can also read the
acknowledgement pages of books,

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.760
to see who the author's
literary agent is.

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.130
I basically wrote--
I actually wrote

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.480
letters, when I think about it.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.960
Some were paper letters.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.500
There were some that were
email, but-- it was so long ago.

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:41.930
And that worked.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:42.940
I got some responses.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.470
People asked to see it.

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:49.676
But then many of them said
no to that particular book.

00:49:49.676 --> 00:49:53.339
But by the time I wrote
this novel, one of my goals,

00:49:53.339 --> 00:49:55.880
while writing it, was also to
learn more about the publishing

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.220
world, to be in
a better position

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.610
by the time I
finished the novel.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:02.880
So I had tried to make an
effort to write book reviews

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.650
and get to know
people who were more

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.890
connected to the literary
world and publishing,

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:09.760
and to meet more
authors of books.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.700
And that helped a lot.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:14.520
Because this time,
when I wrote to agents,

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.530
I did do the same thing.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:20.690
I sort of asked around, to find
out who some good agents were.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:21.760
And I wrote emails.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.360
But this time, I tended
to write emails that said,

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.510
my friend so-and-so,
who's one of your clients,

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:29.310
suggested I contact you .

00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:32.930
And that, I have to
admit, helped a lot.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.780
On the other hand, I did get
responses, even the first time.

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.940
I mean, I do think my first
novel was rejected because

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.090
of the contents, not because
I didn't know people.

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.950
But I do think-- if
anyone here is thinking

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:48.490
about these things-- I think
that it is, probably, true

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:52.660
that it can be helpful to
get a quicker response,

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.040
if you have some connection.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.664
And that's unfortunate.

00:50:55.664 --> 00:50:57.580
I mean, one shouldn't
have to live in New York

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.270
and hang out with writers
to get a quick response

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:04.302
from a literary
agent, but so it is.

00:51:04.302 --> 00:51:06.760
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: That's
true in many businesses, yes?

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.780
I see some nods in the room.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:09.500
Well, thank you so
much, Adelle, and thanks

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.000
to all of you for
coming, and anyone

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.599
who joined us on
the live stream.

00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:15.140
If you have not read
the book, I hope

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.060
you want to to, after this talk.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.020
And, uh, have a great day.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:19.520
Thanks.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.120
ADELLE WALDMAN: Thanks, again.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:20.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.820
Thanks so much for being here.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.370
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Great.
