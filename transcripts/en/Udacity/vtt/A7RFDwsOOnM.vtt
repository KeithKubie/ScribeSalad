00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer of the quiz is D.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first enqueue operation returns true because in a 2-element queue 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
where we haven't inserted many elements there's space to insert an element.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The second enqueue call succeeds for the same reason.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The third enqueue call fails and returns false, because there was no room left 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in a 2-element queue after 2 enqueue operations had already succeeded.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Because we have a FIFO queue, the first dequeue operation returns the first element 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that we'd added to the queue--that is to say 6,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 the second dequeue operation returns 7, 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and the third dequeue operation, which is now called on an empty queue, returns none.
