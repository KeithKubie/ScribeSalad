Google Sign In is a secure
authentication system

that reduces the burden
of login for your users,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.980
by enabling them to sign in
with their Google account,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.330
the same account they already
use with Gmail, Play, Google,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.430

using subscriptions

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.197
to offer premium
features or content,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:42.780

Differentiate entry
pricing significantly

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.570
from the normal subscription
to keep the entry barrier low,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.930
for example, by
progressively discounting

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.980
longer running subscriptions.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.820

and customize the
time period so that it

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.020
works for your business, for
example, 5, 7, 30, or 60 days.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.260
When readers sign up
to the free trial,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.160
they enter their
payment details,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.360
so if they don't cancel
the subscription,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.730
they'll turn into regular
paying subscribers

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.130

conversion reporting.
