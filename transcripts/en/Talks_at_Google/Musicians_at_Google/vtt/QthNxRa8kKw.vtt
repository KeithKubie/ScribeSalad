[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:03.005
AVERY SUNSHINE: So I wanted
to do a couple of songs

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:03.760
from the new record.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.855
I was going to let
you all hear them,

00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:05.985
so I'm going to
do one real quick.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:06.280
AUDIENCE: I thought you
were going to do two.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.654
AVERY SUNSHINE:
What did you say?

00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:08.639
Huh?

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.055
But no, if I do
two of those, then

00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:11.080
I can't do the other
songs that they--

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.600
you know what I'm saying?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.197
Very well?

00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:14.030
You hear Ike Turner?

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.836
Did you hear him?

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:23.084
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:23.084 --> 00:00:25.500
AVERY SUNSHINE: So I've got
to set this up really quickly.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.640
So I have to say, something
that we never really talk about,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.340
we never talk about
equal love and all that.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.170
I was blessed to be born
into a family where my eldest

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.702
brother is a same
gender loving person.

00:00:38.702 --> 00:00:40.680
Y'all know what I'm
talking about, right?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.280
Absolutely.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.120
And I felt like I wanted
to address that because he

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.440
is the godfather of my
children, and I wanted people

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.120
to know that one of the best
examples that I had seen

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.460
for love had been with my
brother and his partner

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.920
of some 20 years.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.040
So I figured out
the way I could say

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.334
this was something like this.

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.500
[MUSIC - AVERY SUNSHINE,

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:13.970
AVERY SUNSHINE:
Those folk that talk.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.136
[MUSIC - AVERY SUNSHINE,

00:03:17.722 --> 00:03:21.674
AVERY SUNSHINE: Y'all know
what I'm talking about?

00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:25.150
You love who you
want to love, believe

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.585
what you want to believe,
have the career that you

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:30.980
want to have.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.801
Anybody really, really know
what I'm talking about?

00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:35.218
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:36.843
AVERY SUNSHINE: I
still feel like we're

00:03:36.843 --> 00:03:39.040
going to make it
to the other side.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.420
All right.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.046
So I see you when I get there.

00:03:44.046 --> 00:03:45.800
I might choose not to
wear shoes on stage,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.315
but I'm going to be on the
other side with no shoes on.

00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:56.770
I hope you really, really
get it, and I have to say--

[INAUDIBLE], here we go.

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:27.032
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:29.992
AVERY SUNSHINE:
Thank y'all so much.

00:05:29.992 --> 00:05:31.200
And that means so much to me.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.059
I hope y'all like that song.

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:34.350
My brother hasn't heard it yet.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.800
I can't wait for him to hear it.
