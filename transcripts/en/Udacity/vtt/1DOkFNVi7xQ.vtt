00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.400
Okay, so now that we have seen how ILP and IPC differ, let's do a little IPC and

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.440
ILP quiz. Let's say that we have a 3 issue in-order processor, that has 3 ALUs.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.750
Meaning that for everything that we can issue, it can always executed, and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.890
these are general purpose ALUs that can just execute any type of instruction.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.460
So, we probably won't have any issues with the limited number of units.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.300
The program we are going to execute is- So for

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.640
this program what we want to know is what is the ILP and what is the IPC.
