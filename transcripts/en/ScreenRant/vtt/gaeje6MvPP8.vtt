00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.820
Whether it's pulse-pounding action or gut-wrenching
drama, movies only succeed if they keep audiences

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.170
glued to what they're putting in the spotlight.
At least, that's the plan. But what happens

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.210
when a movie's best jokes, weirdest scenes,
or wittiest references are being made where

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.820
nobody should be looking? Here are Screen
Rant's 10 Hilarious Details Hidden In The

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.839
Background Of Movies.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:32.839
Mr. Nanny (New Line Cinema)&nbsp;

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:36.350
Our list proves that a background actor or
extra can give a movie something special,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.640
but when Hulk Hogan's adventure in babysitting
ends, there's only one thing viewers will

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.989
ask: was that guy throwing his dog into a
lake? The inexplicable background detail has

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.320
become a cult favorite, when Hulk's motorcycle
montage features, with no explanation, a man

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.039
tossing his pet into the water. The dog seems
more surprised and confused than actually

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.250
bothered - it's a dog, after all - but was
it planned? Was the man an actor, or was it

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.780
a total coincidence? The questions have lasted
longer than the Hulkster's career, meaning

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.780
that dog at least deserves a supporting credit…
and don’t worry no dogs were harmed during

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.840
the filming of Mr. Nanny!

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.840
Despicable Me (Universal)

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.810
The yellow minions of this movie series were
runaway hits, scoring their own film and too

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.140
many products to count. But did you know that
minions can get a little romantic when no

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.229
one's watching? When Gru and his gang are
celebrating a year of supervillainy, one minion

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.820
gets so excited, he can't help but plant a
passionate kiss on his coworker. It went over

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.479
pretty well. When their rocket makes it to
the moon later in the movie, the kisser becomes

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.569
the kissee - with the romanced minion returning
the favor.

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:36.569
Star Wars (Lucasfilm)

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.569
You have to hand it to Boba Fett: he's only
on screen for a minute or two of the original

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.370
Star Wars trilogy, but still just as famous
as Darth Vader or his stormtroopers. But most

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.181
fans don't realize the bounty hunter's death
is meant to make Boba Fett the butt of one

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:52.930
of the trilogy's best slapstick gags. They'll
remember Han Solo activating Fett's jet pack

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.709
by accident, sending him into the Sarlacc,
but Luke's lightsaber fight usually distracts

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.030
fans from the ice cold killer hilariously
flailing through the air across the frame.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:12.650
Making his reputation as a no-nonsense assassin
even funnier.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.650
Jurassic Park (Universal)

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.739
It's impossible to forget the moment that
Spielberg's massive T-Rex was revealed, changing

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.359
movie history along with it. But aside from
CG, the practical puppet of the dinosaur helped

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.450
bring the creature to life - especially as
it chowed down on a goat. We all know that

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.230
the T-Rex was just movie magic, but the scene
itself breaks the illusion a few times. The

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.730
best example? When the T-Rex throws its head
back to swallow the goat whole, and the camera

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.019
follows: revealing the sprinkler head spraying
directly onto the puppet (1:03:14). No wonder

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.709
he was so angry.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:40.709
Year One (Columbia Pictures)&nbsp;

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.030
The final film from Ghostbusters creator Harold
Ramis wasn't a big hit with critics or audiences,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.319
but the caveman comedy managed to sneak one
of its best jokes into the background. While

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.040
the heroes carry out a scene in front of the
camera, a background character seems to be

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.221
getting.... familiar with a goat (but not
exactly the way you'd expect). It's the actor's

00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:00.590
excitement and silent cheer as the other extras
look on that seals the joke, even if most

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.790
viewers will miss it completely.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.370
The LEGO Movie (Warner Bros.)

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.340
The world of LEGO can take you anywhere, but
when it comes to food, the toys have been

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.420
limited. Croissants and sausages are two of&nbsp;the
most popular solutions, since they actually

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.379
fit the LEGO figures hands. In the LEGO Movie,
the filmmakers couldn't help themselves from

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.860
making a joke with that in mind. When the
movie's heroes smash into a train in the Old

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.670
West, keep an eye on the last pig on board.
The heroes land on the train, but the pig

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.520
smashes into the ground. Bursting into a cloud
of sausages. More proof that no one ever really

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.709
dies in a world where everything is awesome.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.200
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Paramount)

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.319
Who can make the world taste good? The Candy
Man can! That's according to an early song

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.739
in this kids' classic, delivered with handfuls
of candy by a candy store owner. You can tell

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.220
it's only a movie when he lets the kids help
themselves to the treats behind the counter,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.890
but for one girl, things get VERY real. In
hindsight, she probably shouldn't have been

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.430
resting her head on the counter knowing it
was going to be opened, but seeing her drilled

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.569
in the chin - and it somehow being the best
take - is just one more reason to watch it

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.689
all over again.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.049
The Last Samurai (Warner Bros)&nbsp;

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.840
It's a proven fact that animals in Hollywood
are unpredictable, and the more serious a

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.489
scene, the more trouble they'll cause. You
might have caught this one in our other video

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.319
entitled Biggest Movie Mistakes You Missed
but we just couldn’t leave it out! Fans

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.410
of Tom Cruise's Last Samurai will forever
wonder how they could have missed this unscripted

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.410
moment from the hero's horse, proving that
bullets and bombs weren't the only things

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.660
Samurai had to worry about. Apparently Tom
Cruise wasn't as gifted a rider as his horse

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.280
seemed to think, with a poor extra taking
the punishment.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.560
Everything Must Go (Lionsgate)&nbsp;

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.250
It's a shame this Will Ferrell dramedy wasn't
a blockbuster hit, since even more people

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.480
could have witnessed one of the weirdest background
movie moments ever. When Ferrell's character

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.120
visits a high school friend, they carry on
their scene as her children play in the front

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.140
yard. But when the kids appear in the background
completely motionless, it's impossible to

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.060
look away. The young actors were probably
told not to be distracting and keep still,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.640
but the result has viewers wondering if they've
suddenly stumbled into an unsettling horror

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.480
movie.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.930
Raiders of the Lost Ark (Paramount)&nbsp;

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.060
Everyone knows that the infamous gun vs sword
showdown in the first Indiana Jones adventure

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.240
wasn't entirely planned, with Harrison Ford's
illness seeing the extended fight cut for

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.230
a quick gag. But the inside joke means viewers
might miss the other gem of the scene: the

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.420
world's laziest butcher over Indy's shoulder.
Sure, hammering a butchers knife in the background

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.170
of a scene would be distracting, or even dangerous.
But the weak chops the extra settled on are

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.450
distracting in an even better way.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.260
Those are the best jokes and details we could
find hidden in the background of our favorite

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.960
movies, but which ones have we missed? Be
