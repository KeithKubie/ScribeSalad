00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.440
Being kind will get you far in life.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.120
When you can go beyond the ego, you are able to break free from self-absorbed habits that can damage your health.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.520
But swing on the other side to extremes, and too much kindness can just be destructive

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.740
Family and marriage therapist Darlene Lancer says that people-pleasing habits start from your childhood.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:32.300
If you feel like you always had to accommodate to others, it may have stemmed from your parents who withheld love from you, forced impossible expectations on you, and practice unfair ways of disciplining you.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.220
Does this sound like you? Here are five signs you are a people pleaser.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.159
1.) You agree with others because you're afraid of conflict.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.090
Do you have different political beliefs from your friends that you keep to yourself?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.489
Or go along with the family tradition

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.459
Even though you hate it? If you agree with others just for the sake of making others feel happy, consequently,

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.459
You run the risk of making yourself feel uncomfortable.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.039
You might end up losing friends when you state your honest opinions, or get into domestic quarrels.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.739
But this can be beneficial in the long run.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.119
You can find out who your true friends are by showing your real self, and take an active part in decision-making with your family.

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.389
Remember, being passive easily results in

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:23.429
Dissatisfaction when your thoughts aren't being heard. But practicing self-expression helps you feel more self-assured about your values and ideals.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.180
2.) Saying no is a challenge for you.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.990
Are you constantly busy because you're always taking on more than enough projects? Pause for a second, and ask yourself,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.990
When was the last time you allowed yourself a good break?

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.229
It's great helping someone reach their goals, and show people you are a reliable worker, friend, and colleague.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.769
But your dreams, goals, and health matter, too.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.610
It doesn't make you a bad person if you want to cancel plans over the weekend, or make time to get your own work done first.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.799
3.) When you help others out, you feel more resentful than fulfilled.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.639
Research shows that practicing compassion can give you a sense of purpose, and make you feel more connected to your community.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.480
But when you do it to a point where it burns you out,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:14.380
You might want to retreat for a bit, and reflect on what's not working. Psychotherapist Sharon Martin

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.260
Advises you to pay attention to whether you are doing things out of true desire or because you feel obligated.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.429
4.) You're incredibly hard on yourself. When parents are overbearing and have high demands for you,

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.380
It puts you at a higher risk of being a people pleaser.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.560
Does this sound like you? When you make mistakes, you don't cut yourself slack, and strive for perfection instead of progress.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.300
Psychologists Thomas Curran and Andrew Hill define perfectionism as an irrational desire to achieve,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.900
Along with being overly critical of oneself and others. When you don't embrace your failures,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.640
You will never learn resilience and the central life skill to have.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.280
Focus on your strengths instead, and practice mindfulness.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.460
5.) You pretend like you're doing all right when you're actually hurting on the inside. When you experience all the previous points mentioned,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.619
Overextending yourself to others, being hard on yourself, and agreeing with others just to avoid conflict,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.109
It makes it difficult for people to reach you when you aren't vulnerable enough to state your true feelings.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.499
Bottling your emotions up instead of openly talking about them can prevent you from forming authentic connections.

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.989
Is it really worth keeping everyone happy when this only sustains artificial relationships?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.019
Remember this the next time you want to hide your disappointment.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.879
When was the last time you did something without feeling the pressure to please?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.220
