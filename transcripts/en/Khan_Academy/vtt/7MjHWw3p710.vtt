00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:01.558
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.558 --> 00:00:02.619
is to see if we can understand

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:04.276
all of the different parts of kind of

00:00:04.276 --> 00:00:07.203
a traditional income statement.

00:00:07.203 --> 00:00:09.550
As we get into more and
more complicated examples,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.578
you'll see more and more

00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:11.879
complicated income statements,

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.123
but this is a good start.

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:13.941
What I've done here is

00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:15.109
I've drawn the income statements

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.706
for actually two businesses.

00:00:16.706 --> 00:00:20.804
One is Ben's Shoes, and
one is Jason's Shoes.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:21.469
I did that because

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.376
these are fundamentally the same business,

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:25.734
but they have a slightly
different capital structure,

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:26.956
and we'll talk about what that means

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:28.214
in a second,

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:29.903
but they're both shoe stores.

00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:32.307
They literally, they buy shoes

00:00:32.307 --> 00:00:33.555
from shoe manufacturers.

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:34.711
They put them on their shelves,

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:36.802
and then customers come
in and buy those shoes.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:37.740
The first line,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.964
we're pretty familiar with it already.

00:00:38.964 --> 00:00:40.209
This is the revenue,

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:43.473
this is the sales for
each of these shoe stores.

00:00:43.473 --> 00:00:44.408
In the case of a shoe store,

00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:46.799
it's literally just
going to be a measure of

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.209
the cash that the customers are paying

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:51.000
for the shoes.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.151
You wouldn't have something like

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.073
accounts receivables,

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:54.733
where people can pay months later.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.875
Most of it will just be cash.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:58.268
Cost of goods sold,

00:00:58.268 --> 00:00:59.933
in this example,

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.002
we're just going to assume it to be

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.550
the actual cost of a shoe.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.677
If I sold a pair of $100 shoes,

00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:08.966
but I had to pay $50 to
the shoe manufacturer

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:09.783
for those shoes,

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:12.405
that $50 would be the cost of goods sold.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.469
So this $100,000 is actually the cost

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.303
of the $200,000 in sales.

00:01:19.303 --> 00:01:21.316
Then when you just take
the cost of goods sold

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:22.882
from that revenue,

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.624
you get something called gross profit,

00:01:25.624 --> 00:01:26.675
and really, the focus of this is is,

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:27.896
of this video is to

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:28.962
try to understand the difference between

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:30.808
gross profit, operating profit,

00:01:30.808 --> 00:01:33.142
pre-tax income, net income.

00:01:33.142 --> 00:01:34.672
Gross profit is the first time

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:36.469
that you kind of think of profit,

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:37.952
and the reason why it's called "gross"

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:40.271
is because we've just
thought about the profit

00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:42.873
from selling that incremental shoe,

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:44.952
and sometimes some other
costs are thrown in there.

00:01:44.952 --> 00:01:46.297
Sometimes advertising,

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:48.769
sometimes some other cost associated

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:49.698
with the store,

00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:50.540
but for this example,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.071
it's just the profit straight from selling

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.003
that incremental shoe,

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:56.354
and that's why we call it gross,

00:01:56.354 --> 00:01:59.145
since we haven't taken
out other things yet.

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:00.252
Then, below that line,

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.027
we have all of the other expenses,

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:04.138
the expenses associated
with running the store.

00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:06.410
The kind of the overhead
of running that store,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.218
So we have the rent,

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:08.512
you have the salaries,

00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:10.807
you have the depreciation
and amortization.

00:02:10.807 --> 00:02:12.668
Maybe you're depreciating the cost of

00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:14.603
your cash register and the shelves,

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:15.807
and whatever else,

00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:16.805
and then you can have other things

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:17.803
like utilities,

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.077
and you can see both Ben's Shoes

00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:21.153
and Jason's Shoes are completely identical

00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:22.021
up to this point.

00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:23.551
They have the same revenue, gross profit,

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.103
even the same expenses.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:27.799
And so when you take all
of these expenses out

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.474
from the gross profits,

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:31.939
you take 100,000 minus all of these,

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.652
and I've written all of
the stuff you subtract

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.212
with parentheses around them,

00:02:35.212 --> 00:02:36.467
so that these are expenses,

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:37.736
these are negatives.

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:39.767
You get the operating profit,

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:41.837
and you see that both of these are

00:02:41.837 --> 00:02:43.791
the same number.

00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:45.426
What operating profit tells you

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:48.616
is how much profit is
coming from the business.

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:50.733
It's before we think
about how the business

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:51.538
is structured.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:54.396
It doesn't think about
things like interest income

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:55.540
from your bank account,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.362
or interest expense on any loans you have.

00:02:57.362 --> 00:03:00.272
It's from the business itself,

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:01.217
operating profit,

00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:02.769
and since these are identical businesses,

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.705
they have the same exact operating profit.

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:09.221
Where they start to
diverge is below that line.

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.143
Above this line right over here

00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:12.267
is the income statement,

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:13.803
down here is the balance sheet.

00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:15.472
Their balance sheets are identical,

00:03:15.472 --> 00:03:20.198
except for Jason's Shoes
has $100,000 in debt,

00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:22.461
and Ben's Shoes has no debt.

00:03:22.461 --> 00:03:24.273
Ben has no interest expense,

00:03:24.273 --> 00:03:27.429
while Jason does have a
$10,000 interest expense,

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.611
so it's about 10% per year.

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:31.424
That's why these two income statements

00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:32.536
start to diverge,

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:34.105
but notice, we didn't
put this expense up there

00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:35.843
because it has nothing to
do with the operations.

00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:38.216
It's dependent on how the operations

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:39.670
were financed.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.397
Once you subtract that out,

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:43.856
then you actually have
your pre-tax income,

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.927
and if we assume that
we have to pay taxes,

00:03:45.927 --> 00:03:47.891
this is how much we pay in taxes,

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:49.924
and this is actually the net income

00:03:49.924 --> 00:03:53.689
that goes to the owners of the company.
