(son) Riddy body motions. 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.845
Welcome to Smarter Every Day and like he said, 

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.000
today we're gonna learn about rigid body motion.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.010
For any object there are three axes of translation, and there's

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.020
also three axes of rotation. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.530
These axes are called roll, pitch and yaw. 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.040
So for any object you have six degrees of freedom, or 6DoF. 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.750
Let's look at that in a little bit more fun way like gainers. 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.360
(son) Gainers!

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.080
Alright here we go.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.090

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.110
Gainer training.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.350
Gonna watch some pros first.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.680

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.190

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.250
[laugh]

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:15.790
  

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.830
And that's what it's like to tie your shoe under water.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.400
(male) OK I'll see you when you get down there Destin.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.430
[music]

00:01:38.450 --> 00:02:16.630
        

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.660
OK here we go.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.280
[cheers]

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.710
(male #1) Dude that was actually...
(male #2) That was impressive!

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.740
Your first gainer off a cliff.
[laugh]

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.270
[cheer]

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.210
(female) He made it. He kicked that thing though.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.820
Thanks for watching Smarter Every Day.

Go check out our Facebook page we have a lot of stuff on there 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.875
that you don't normally see on the videos. 

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:52.880
For instance right now I am building a storm shelter

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.890
using data from a university study to see if 2x4s could penetrate different types of walls. 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.890
Using this to protect my family. 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.900
So we use fancy book learning to apply to our lives in practical ways. 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.425
