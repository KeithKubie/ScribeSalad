00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:02.599
- [Instructor] Alejandro
was curious if sample median

00:00:02.599 --> 00:00:06.352
was an unbiased estimator
of population median.

00:00:06.352 --> 00:00:10.237
He placed ping pong balls
numbered from zero to 32

00:00:10.237 --> 00:00:12.185
in a drum and mixed them well.

00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:16.753
Note that the median of
the population is 16.

00:00:16.753 --> 00:00:20.565
He then took a random
sample of five balls,

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:23.157
and calculated the median of the sample.

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:25.333
He replaced the balls,
and repeated this process

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.073
for a total of 50 trials.

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:31.974
His results are summarized
in the dotplot below

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:34.806
where each dot represents
the sample median

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.889
from a sample of five balls.

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:40.471
So this right over here
is a sampling distribution

00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:42.610
of the sample median.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.973
You have a population of balls.

00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:46.280
We know a parameter.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.498
We know that the median
of the population is 16.

00:00:50.498 --> 00:00:53.888
This right over here is the population.

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:57.369
And then he keeps taking
samples of five balls,

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.942
so that is five-ball
sample right over there.

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:02.859
And then he calculates the statistic,

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.362
the median of the sample,

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:07.998
so he calculates the median
there, and he does it again.

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.270
He calculates the median,
and he does it again.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.548
He calculates the median.

00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:13.860
And then he does this 50 times.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.079
He does this 50 times.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.387
And so, what you see plotted
over here, do you see 50 dots?

00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:21.807
Every time he took a sample of five balls,

00:01:21.807 --> 00:01:23.168
and calculated the median,

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:25.514
we see that as one of the dots here.

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:29.773
So for example, four times,
he calculated a median of 20.

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:32.554
Two times, he calculated a median of 19.

00:01:32.554 --> 00:01:35.896
One time, he calculated a median of four.

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:38.608
Now they ask us, based on these results,

00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:42.182
does the sample median
appear to be a biased

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:46.591
or unbiased estimator of
the population median?

00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:48.656
So pause this video, and
see if you can come up

00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:50.855
with an answer to that.

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:53.023
In order to be an unbiased estimator,

00:01:53.023 --> 00:01:55.262
and that is what you want
your estimator to be,

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:56.995
you want it to be unbiased,

00:01:56.995 --> 00:02:00.353
the sampling distribution
for that statistic

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.576
has to be evenly distributed

00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:06.142
about the true parameter
for the population.

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:08.052
So for example, in this situation,

00:02:08.052 --> 00:02:09.960
the true parameter for the population

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.081
is a note that the median
of the population is 16,

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:15.978
so that's the thing that
you're trying to estimate.

00:02:15.978 --> 00:02:19.582
So this is where the median
of the population is.

00:02:19.582 --> 00:02:22.657
And so, if we look at the
sampling distribution,

00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:25.236
we see that it is roughly balanced

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:28.862
to the left and to the right
of that true parameter.

00:02:28.862 --> 00:02:32.224
So I would say that this
is looking pretty unbiased

00:02:32.224 --> 00:02:35.210
because the sampling distribution

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.245
is evenly balanced to
the left and the right

00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:42.558
of the true median of the
population, that true parameter.

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:43.503
If, for some reason,

00:02:43.503 --> 00:02:46.501
the distribution looked
something like this,

00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:49.440
then it would not be unbiased.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.555
Or if the distribution
looked something like this,

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:55.485
if the distribution looked like this,

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:57.787
if our sampling
distribution was like this,

00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:00.739
this would mean that we're
consistently underestimating

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.216
the true parameter.

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:04.763
And if our distribution looked like this,

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:08.558
this means that our
statistic is overestimating

00:03:08.558 --> 00:03:10.557
the true parameter.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:13.221
Let's do another example.

00:03:13.221 --> 00:03:15.211
The dotplots below show an approximation

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.119
to the sampling distribution

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:19.035
for three different estimators

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:22.317
of the same population parameter.

00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:26.975
If the actual value of the
population parameter is five,

00:03:26.975 --> 00:03:31.760
which dotplot displays the
estimator with both low bias

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.427
and low variability?

00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:35.790
Pause this video,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.448
and see if you can come
up with the answer.

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:40.181
So the population parameter

00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:42.501
that we're trying to estimate is five.

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:46.349
So let's show that on each
of these distributions,

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.730
these approximations of
the sampling distributions.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.728
Over here, we have our scale.

00:03:51.728 --> 00:03:56.357
This should be one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:03:56.357 --> 00:04:00.712
and one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:04.281
And so, our population parameter is five,

00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:06.747
so that is right over there,

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:09.104
that is right over there,

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:11.854
and that this is right over here.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:18.178
Which of these statistics
seem to be biased?

00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:19.196
Let's just start there.

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:20.029
Pause this video.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.732
Which of these look biased to you?

00:04:22.732 --> 00:04:26.317
The one that looks clearly
biased is statistic C.

00:04:26.317 --> 00:04:29.069
When you look at its
sampling distribution,

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.616
it is consistently to the
left of our true parameter,

00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:36.264
so it's consistently
underestimating our parameter,

00:04:36.264 --> 00:04:39.489
so this one right over here is biased.

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:41.648
Now statistic A and statistic B

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.324
both look reasonably unbiased.

00:04:44.324 --> 00:04:45.894
Remember, these are approximations

00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:47.385
of the sampling distribution.

00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:48.763
If you want to get closer and closer

00:04:48.763 --> 00:04:49.985
to the sampling distribution,

00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:51.501
the true sampling distribution,

00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:52.995
you would keep taking samples,

00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.045
and keep calculating the statistic,

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:58.461
and keep plotting them on this
distribution right over here.

00:04:58.461 --> 00:05:01.129
But for statistic A, it
looks reasonably balanced

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.548
to the left and the right.

00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:05.842
It's not perfectly balanced
but it's reasonable.

00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:07.316
Remember, these are approximations.

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:09.722
And statistic B is also
reasonably balanced

00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:11.360
to the left and the right.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.116
Now they don't just say
which one has a low bias

00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:16.375
but they also say low variability.

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:19.088
I would say both statistic
A and statistic B

00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:21.494
have relatively low bias

00:05:21.494 --> 00:05:23.712
but if we talk about low variability,

00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:26.166
that's how much spread do they have,

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.131
especially around the true parameter.

00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:31.824
And it looks like statistic
A has much lower spread

00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:34.279
than statistic B right over here.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.367
In statistic B, you've
calculated statistics

00:05:36.367 --> 00:05:39.588
that are too way from the true parameter

00:05:39.588 --> 00:05:42.463
while in statistic A, you've
calculated a statistic

00:05:42.463 --> 00:05:46.174
of certain samples that
are roughly half away

00:05:46.174 --> 00:05:48.147
from the true parameter.

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:52.098
So the statistic that has both
low bias and low variability,

00:05:52.098 --> 00:05:54.265
that would be statistic A.
