00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.720
The modern world is deeply attracted to ancient Greece.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.740
Every year around one million people visit the Parthenon and wander around the ruins.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.939
Because they're sure the place and the
culture of which its supreme embodiment

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.540
has something important to say to them.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.420
But it's often not quite clear what.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.660
What can ancient Greece do for us?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080
It's a big vulgar but central question.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.640
There are perhaps five big ideas we can
take away from ancient Greece.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.260
Tragedy

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.280
The Greeks thought it was extremely important for everyone regularly to witness a certain

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.620
sort of gory tail they called a tragedy.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400
Festivals existed to honor these tragedies and

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.860
governments close civic buildings businesses and law courts to enable citizens to go and see them.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.780
Some festivals such as the festival
of Dionysus in Athens which began in 508 BC

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.840
would last a week and involve up to
17 plays.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.000
Famous plays included Aeschylus' The Oresteia

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.800
Sophocles' Ajax, Oedipus' The king and Electra and EurÃ­pedes' Medeia.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.400
In these tragedies
people were seen to break a minor law or

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.640
make a hasty decision or sleep with the
wrong person and the result was ignominy and death.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.920
Yet what happened was shown to
be to a large extent in the hands of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.710
what the Greeks called fate or the gods.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060
It was the Greeks poetic way of saying
the things often work out in random ways

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.200
according to dynamics that simply don't
reflect the merits of the individuals concerned.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.660
In the Poetics, the philosopher
Aristotle defined the key ingredients of tragedy:

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.430
The hero of the tragedy should be a
decent person, better than average often

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.640
highborn but prone to making small
mistakes as we all do.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.460
At the start it may not be obvious that it is an error they are making

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.400
but by an unfortunate chain of events for which they are not wholly to blame

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.000
this small mistake leads to a catastrophe.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.560
Tragedy is the sympathetic morally complex account of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.020
how good people can end up in
disaster situations.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.060
It's the very opposite of today's
tabloid newspaper or social media sphere

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.600
with a mob rushes to make judgments on
those who slipped up.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.460
Aristotle thought it was extremely
important that people see tragic works

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.140
on a regular basis to counter their
otherwise strong inclinations to judge and moralize.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.440
Tragedy is meant to be a
corrective too easy judgment.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.540
Without the idea of tragedy we can make existence for everyone far crueler and far more

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.460
judgmental than it really need be.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.400
We should look back to the Greeks to recover an extremely important idea.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880
Philosophy

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.000
Athens was the cradle of philosophy.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Home of the three greatest philosophers:

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.100
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.540
What unites the Greek philosophers is a search for what they termed eudaimonia.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.380
Which translates happiness or fulfillment.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.090
They saw philosophy as a hugely
practical subject that could help people

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.640
find their way through the dilemmas of
life.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.720
The approach was already contained in
the word philosophy itself:

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.880
in Greek, Philo means love or devotion and Sophia
means wisdom.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.040
Philosophers were people devoted to wisdom.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.560
That would be abstract the concept of wisdom isn't mysterious.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.280
Being wise means attempting
to live and die well,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.420
leading as good a life as possible within the troubled conditions of existence.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.650
What we call the history of Greek
philosophy is made up of repeated

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.520
attempts over the centuries to address
ways in which we are unwise.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.840
So for example Socrates paid special
attention to the problem of how people get confused in their minds.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.540
He was struck that people didn't quite
know what they meant by key ideas like

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.660
courage or justice or success

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.080
even though these were the main ideas they used when talking about their own lives.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.220
Socrates developed a method which still
bears his name by which you can learn to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.000
get clearer about what you mean by
playing devil's advocate with any idea.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.060
The aim isn't necessarily to change
your mind

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.240
it's to test whether the ideas guiding
your life are sound.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.120
A few decades later, the philosopher Aristotle tried to make us more confident around big questions.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.480
He thought the best questions with those that ask what something is for.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.380
He did this a lot and over many books asking

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.560
what is government for?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.080
What is the economy for?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080
What's money for?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.280
What's art for?

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.020
Today he might be encouraging us
to ask questions like:

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.320
What's the news media for?

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.500
What is marriage for?

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.000
What is pornography for?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.020
Also active in ancient Greece was the stoic philosophers who were interested in panic.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.080
The Stoics noticed the really central
feature of panic:

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.560
We panic not just when something bad occurs but when it does so
unexpectedly,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.800
when we are assuming that everything was going to go rather well.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.320
So they suggested that we should arm
ourselves against panic by getting used to the idea that

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.920
danger, trouble and
difficulty are very likely to occur at every turn.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.360
The overall task of studying Greek philosophy is to absorb

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.360
these and many other lessons and put
them to work in the world today.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.650
The point isn't just to know what this
all that philosopher happened to say but

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.840
to aim to exercise wisdom at an
individual and societal level starting now.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.180
Democracy

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.660
Athens is known as the home of democracy.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.040
Democracy was developed in the fifth century BC first under Solon then
Cleisthenes and Ephialtes.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.460
However, democracy came under threat in the later stages of the fifth century BC,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.220
When Athene was in the midst of fighting a lengthy war with its nemesis Sparta,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.820
the Peloponnesian War.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.160
So to remind Athenians of their importance within a democracy, the great general Pericles

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.460
delivered a rousing speech at the annual Funeral Oration to mark the
dead of the war in 430 BC.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.380
What makes Pericles's famous speech so striking is that

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.580
he isn't defending democracy just as a way of running the state.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.500
He's defending what we might call the
democratic spirit,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.440
a spirit of equality, community and comradeship

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.720
that can develop in societies where members more or less feel themselves to be equal to one another.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.540
The voting system is a root to something
much deeper that we might term "fellow feeling".

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.000
An emotion the Greeks
discovered for Humanity.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.560
Pericles declared: the administration of Athens favors the many instead of the few;

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.760
this is why it's called a democracy. If
we look to the laws, they afford equal

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.510
justice to all in their private
differences; if there is no social

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.400
standing, advancement in public life
falls to reputation for capacity, class

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.780
considerations not being allowed to
interfere with merit nor again does

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.560
poverty bar the way if a man is able to
serve the state,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.760
he has never hindered by the obscurity
of his condition.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.980
Against the brutality of the Spartans, Pericles celebrates the
generosity, erudition, openness,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.000
public spiritedness and dignity of Athenian democratic life.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.410
These values Pericles says enables
Athens to provide a shining beacon of

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.660
freedom and decency to the Greek world and now to our own times too.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.660
Architecture

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.960
The Greeks were architects par
excellence.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.020
They were involved in the construction of five of the seven
wonders of the ancient world:

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.040
The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.040
The Statue of Zeus at Olympia,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.700
The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.320
The Colossus of Rhodes,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.920
and the Lighthouse of
Alexandria.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.400
But the most common and inspiring buildings were their ordinary temples.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.720
Magnificent structures typically made of limestone and scattered all across
Greece and its islands.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.329
Aside from the temples on the Acropolis,
other great structures include

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:18.800
the Temple of Apollo at Corinth,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.380
the Temple of Zeus at Olympia,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.380
and the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.299
The architectural language of these temples has spread around the world

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.560
even when their specific religious uses
are fallen by the wayside.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.340
Because they suggest values which humanity will
always find impressive:

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.640
harmony, dignity, calm, reason.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.700
The Greeks taught the West
how to build in such a way that would

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.360
externalize some of the noblest ideals
of human beings.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.360
Sport

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:51.300
Where earlier civilizations such as the
Egyptians, Persians, Assyrians found nakedness shameful,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.100
The Greeks celebrated the naked body of both gods and citizens.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.440
Works such as Zeus or Poseidon of Artemision shows the statue, power and physical prowess of a nude Greek god.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.420
Discobolus shows the action of a naked discus throw mid motion

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.039
again the sculpture celebrates
the poise and physical beauty of an athlete.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.980
His muscles perfectly toned.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.100
The Greeks loved physical exercise.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.880
There was at least one major national
athletic competition every year.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.940
The most famous sporting event was the Olympic Games held every four years from 776 BC.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.280
But what's distinctive in the Greek
approach is that they didn't want athletes merely to be athletes.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.020
The idea was that everyone should train both mind and body.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.340
It's a telling that Milo of Croton, a
celebrated wrestler of the sixth century BC

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.100
was also an associate of a great
mathematician Pythagoras.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.080
One of the important Greek ?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.260
was that a healthy mind could only dwell in a healthy body.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.740
The Greeks thought exercise condition
discipline in people which would enable

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.660
them to be diligent and virtuous
democratic citizens in Athens or

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.240
devoted and controlled warriors in Sparta.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.500
Ancient Greek gyms were nothing like the mindless body pumping places of our own times.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.060
They were both public centers for physical training and intellectual hubs.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.720
Gymnasia and schools were simply the same thing.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:15.660
A great number of Socrates's dialogues about ideas around justice and truth unfold tellingly at the gym.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.240
We owe to the Greeks the remarkable now often forgotten idea that

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.700
our bodies should be looked after just as our minds are and

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.160
that for someone to be merely an
intellectual or merely a body builder is obscene.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.060
True virtue means a balance between the physical and the mental.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.960
There is a sad morality tale about the end of ancient Greek civilization.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.240
They had much nicer ideas than their enemies, but they weren't as well organized .

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.420
So they got defeated and the ideas got lost for centuries.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.100
The Greek city-states fought among themselves endlessly over the course of the fifth and fourth centuries BC,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.980
and were eventually stripped of their
independence under Alexander the Great.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.880
The Greeks failed to add political
stability to their virtues.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.680
The ideas of Greece no longer survive in the country in which they first originated but it

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.740
should be a tribute to ancient Greece
that the best of these ideas remain of complete relevance to our own times.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.380
With the help of the Greaks

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.560
we need to remember the role of tragedy,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.320
emphasize the practice of philosophy,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.320
honor the spirit of democracy,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.040
build with harmony and dignity,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.820
and exercise both mind and body in equal measure.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.900
For all this we can be grateful to the now absent Greeks as we wander among the rubble of the Parthenon.
