00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.180
Vsauce!

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.180
Kevin here.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.760
Aboard Oasis of the Seas.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.540
I partnered with Royal Caribbean International
to travel the Atlantic Ocean in order to see

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.060
the great American solar eclipse in totality.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.160
Which is what, exactly?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.450
This is the Sun, Moon and Earth.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.960
A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes
between the Sun and Earth.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.440
Casting a shadow on the Earth.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.530
If you're in that shadow, called the Umbra,
you're in what's called the path of totality.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.760
And you will see the total solar eclipse.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.730
The last solar eclipse to touch exclusively
on lands now part of the United States was

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.780
in 1257.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.930
Which was a long time ago.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.420
But I’m not seeing this one on land.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.390
I’m 400 miles off the east coast on one
of the largest cruise ships in the world.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.330
I’m seeing the total eclipse at sea.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.870
See?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:30.310
The Sun is 400 times larger than the Moon
but it's also 400 times further away.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.600
This celestial coincidence is what allows
the moon to perfectly cover up the Sun.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.670
1% of the sun is 10,000 times brighter than
the full moon which is why the darkness of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.409
the total eclipse is so unique.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:02:04.880
First contact is about to start so lets head
to the top deck.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:57.530
We’re entering totality.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.989
Two minutes and thirty eight seconds.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.440
That's how long I spent in totality.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.720
Shrouded in the Moon's shadow, witnessing
a brief alteration of reality.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.120
The total solar eclipse is the clearest reminder
that while the celestial bodies are always

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.440
moving, every now and then, things line up
just right and it reignites our curiosity

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.600
in the cosmos.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.180
And all they ask in return is that we sit
back and enjoy the view.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:36.199
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:42.639
Hey!

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.500
Gigantic thanks to Royal Caribbean International
for inviting me to be a part of this once-in-a-lifetime

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.500
moment.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.430
Here on Oasis of the Seas.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.120
Royal Caribbean has a long history of ground-breaking
innovations and first-at-sea experiences from

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.480
surf simulators and a zip line to world-class
dining.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.930
I mean, this ship is so huge it literally
has seven neighborhoods.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.420
I had an awesome time, the entire staff was
super nice and helpful and I just want to

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.040
thank them for supporting science, supporting
learning and supporting Vsauce.
