00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.780
So far we have been talking
about technical controls,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.584
whether it has to do
with authentication.

00:00:06.584 --> 00:00:10.389
Or in the context of network security,
we talked about firewalls and

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.168
[INAUDIBLE] detection and so on.

00:00:12.168 --> 00:00:18.451
And these are used to secure systems
that we have in an organization.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.690
What are the assets that
need to be secured?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.300
Who do they need to be secured from?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.410
So let's talk a little bit more
about this organizational context.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.420
We said, there's something of
value that is under threat, so

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.450
we need to worry about securing it.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.501
But what other reasons may be there for
us to worry about this problem?

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:44.235
While there may be legal and compliance
reasons, financial data and health data,

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:48.090
for example, HIPAA mandates how you
can share online health data or

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.130
distill health data and
things like that.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.740
One solution that we've been talking
about is that of course there

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.000
are various kind of technical controls.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.686
For me to use these technical controls,

00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:03.560
I have to understand what
kind of risk that I'm facing.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.550
What is the threat source?

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.770
What is that threat landscape for me?

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.980
Of course the technical solution or

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.580
control that I have is going to
have an associated cost.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.370
I have to worry about what that cost is,
and, what is the benefit of actually

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.080
deploying this particular solution
that we're talking about?
