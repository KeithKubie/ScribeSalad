and trying to do this problem-solving

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
and trying to do this problem-solving
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.690
and trying to do this problem-solving
without combat if possible they also

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
without combat if possible they also
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.790
without combat if possible they also
have to raise the asset value of every

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
have to raise the asset value of every
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950

country involved in the game which is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
country involved in the game which is
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690
country involved in the game which is
almost impossible to do I've designed it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
almost impossible to do I've designed it
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.869
almost impossible to do I've designed it
so that the game actually fails

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879
so that the game actually fails
 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.819
so that the game actually fails
massively at first it has to because

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
massively at first it has to because
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.069

that's like life life is full of success

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
that's like life life is full of success
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900
that's like life life is full of success
and failure and so we've got to put

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
and failure and so we've got to put
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.610
and failure and so we've got to put
everything in so students can learn to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
everything in so students can learn to
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410
everything in so students can learn to
deal with and manage everything that

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420

elementary school children handle
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.530
elementary school children handle
complex problem-solving and we might

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
complex problem-solving and we might
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120
complex problem-solving and we might
think not because they just simply

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
think not because they just simply
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.850

haven't been here long enough but my
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.649
