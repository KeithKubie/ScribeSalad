00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.790
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Welcome everybody to this
discussion of "Oakland in Popular Memory."

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.049
I'm very proud to introduce my friend Matt
Werner today.

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.200
And it's incredibly interesting.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.379
I've read it and it's over here and you should
definitely pick up a copy.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.779
His incredibly interesting book.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.570
The image of Oakland, California has been
tainted in the mainstream media with salacious

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.439
news reports focusing on street violence,
shootings, gangs, and riots.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.630
These reports, along with assumptions and
stereotypes, feed the fabricated image that

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.030
outsiders have of the city.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.550
In "Oakland in Popular Memory," interviews
with 12 cutting-edge musicians from Oakland

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.649
and beyond, Oakland native and former host
of the award-winning radio show on Fresh Air:

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:40.940
The Alternative.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.879
Matt Werner introduces a different narrative
representing a collection of his best interviews

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.019
with leading artists from Oakland and artists
who've influenced musicians from Oakland.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.859
In the spirit of Studs Terkel, Werner conducted
long form interviews from 2008 to 2012, which

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.989
cover the 2008 election of President Obama,
the shooting of Oscar Grant, and the Occupy

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.299
Oakland protests.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.780
Werner spoke with artists at length discussing
topics like race relations in Oakland in the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.820
post-Oscar Grant era, post literary theory,
and the changing landscape of the music industry

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.180
during the Digital Revolution.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.500
And with that, and I'm sure you'll see significantly
more, I'm happy to introduce Matt Werner.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.310
[applause]

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.750
&gt;&gt;Matt: Thank you.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.560
[pause]

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.350
Little did I know, when I started the book,
"Oakland in Popular Memory" in June 2011,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.750
that I would get tear-gassed during my research.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.000
Little did I know when I started researching
Oakland's history, looking into ways to apply

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.750
it to current events that it would set me
on a collision course with Occupy Oakland.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.070
[pause]

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.990
I know that having grown up in Oakland, California,
that it's several cities in one.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.350
But over the past year, I've seen that Oakland
is a never-ending conversation and it's greatly

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.110
misunderstood by the outside media.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.121
Take, for example, yesterday's New York Times
Magazine article titled "Oakland, the Last

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:15.410
Refuge of Radical America."

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.390
It calls Oakland quote "a kind of Amish village
for retro-radicals."

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.410
And it portrays Oakland as overrun with anarchists,
communists, ineffective city leadership, and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.600
aging radicals.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.020
Essentially, it portrays Oakland as a retirement
home for radicals.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.910
Last Friday, I ran into Boots Riley of The
Coup at the First Friday Art Murmur.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.440
And I asked what he thought of this article
which profiled him so prominently in yesterday's

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.930
New York Times.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.880
And he replied quote that "Oakland isn't the
end of an old radical movement.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.250
It's the beginning of a new one."

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.430
And I thought that was a interesting point
that he made.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.640
However, the Oakland that I've grown up and
experienced is one that, it's quite different

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.220
from that.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.990
And it's this Oakland that I've grown up in
is one that I wanna share with you guys today.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.130
So, I interviewed 12 artists and musicians
from Oakland and those who've had a big impact

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.720
on Oakland artists.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.959
And I collected those interviews into the
book "Oakland in Popular Memory."

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.510
And so, the structure of my talk is as follows.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.190
I'll read the afterword first and then the
introduction.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.920
The second part of the talk, I'll talk about
the design, printing, and the book binding.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.739
And then, thirdly, I'll talk about how I actually
did the interviews themselves on the radio

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.790
show I had in grad school.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.450
And then at the end, I'll open it up for questions.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.520
[pause]

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:59.660
So, I'll begin reading the afterword, which
is titled "Gertrude Stein's Oakland."

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.510
And I initially wrote this as a blog post
for the Google Books blog on February 3rd

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.319
this year, which was Gertrude Stein's birthday.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.040
[reads from book]
"Ever since Gertrude Stein wrote of Oakland,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.720
quote, 'there is no there there,' people have
used this quote to condemn the city.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.070
But taking a closer look at the quote and
the context in which it was written, we can

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.810
see it is an expression of 'painful nostalgia'
and not of disdain or insult to Oakland.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.870
Let's take a closer look at this famous quote
and how it relates to the artists interviewed

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.110
in this book, putting a new 'there' in Oakland.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.120
The quote comes from page 298 of Stein's 'Everybody's
Autobiography,' published in 1937.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.410
The full quote is 'what was the use of my
having come from Oakland.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.510
It was not natural to have come from there
yes write about it if I like or anything if

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.350
I like but not there, there is no there there.'

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.300
Stein's family moved to Oakland in 1880, when
she was six.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.570
Her family lived in a home near today's 13th
Avenue and East 25th Street.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.540
She lived in Oakland until 1891, and left
at age 17 for Baltimore, after her parents

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.540
passed away.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.650
Oakland was a much smaller town back then,
with a population of just under 35 thousand

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.360
in 1880.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.440
Nearly 45 years later, Stein returned to Oakland
on a lecture tour in 1935.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.500
By that time, the city had grown nearly ten
times to over 300 thousand residents.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.490
When she tried to find her childhood home,
it was no longer there.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.280
When she published 'Everybody's Autobiography'
two years later, saying there was 'no there

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.130
there,' it was written to reflect a painful
nostalgia about her home being gone and the

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.350
land around it being completely changed.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.270
The house where she grew up was on a sprawling
ten-acre plot surrounded by orchards and farms.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.229
By 1935, it had been replaced by dozens of
houses.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.080
Oakland held a special significance to her,
and on her return, she found that Oakland

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.650
had urbanized and changed from the pastoral
place she remembered.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.710
Gertrude Stein writes in her autobiographical
novel, 'The Making of Americans,' about her

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.509
childhood in Oakland, where a child 'could
have all anybody could want of joyous sweating,

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:30.060
of rain and wind, of hunting, of cows and
dogs and horses, of chopping wood, of making

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.820
hay, of dreaming, of lying in a hollow all
warm with the sun shining while the wind was

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.650
howling.'

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.460
Returning to her home decades later to find
it gone and to find Oakland no longer a place

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.070
'of chopping wood, of making hay' struck her,
and she wrote her famous 'no there there'

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.370
quote in response.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.650
This makes me wonder if one of the artists
interviewed in this book were to return to

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.960
Oakland 40 years from now, would they recognize
the city?

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.460
One theme in some of the interviews was a
notion of disenfranchisement similar to what

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.449
Stein experienced by returning to a changed
city.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:16.270
People are getting pushed out of Oakland at
an alarming rate.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.430
African Americans made up nearly 50 percent
of the city when I was born in 1984, and that

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.220
number has dropped to only 27 percent today.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.210
There were 33 thousand fewer African Americans
living in Oakland in 2010 than there were

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.680
in 2000.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.830
Like Stein returning to Oakland to find it
completely changed, would an artist interviewed

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:45.220
in this book experience a similar feeling
returning to Oakland 40 years from now?

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.259
When researching Gertrude Stein at the Oakland
History Room, the literary portrait files

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:54.290
had photos of Jack London, a contemporary
of Stein's, who also grew up in Oakland.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.090
The file included other famous authors who
visited Oakland in the late 1800s, including

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:04.009
Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, and John
Muir.

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:10.490
Despite the misinterpretation of Stein's quote,
there had always been a 'there' in Oakland.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.820
Oakland has been blessed with several waves
of artistic movements, stretching back to

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.010
these authors.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.500
And in interviewing innovative artists and
writers in Oakland today for this book, I've

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:26.910
seen first-hand that now, more than ever,
there is a 'there' in Oakland."

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.449
[pause]

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:33.450
So that's the afterword that I conclude the
book with.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.450
And I was very happy.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.120
The Huffington Post recently ran that.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.540
And then, next, I'm gonna read the introduction,
which is a little bit more polemical.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.420
It's called "In Defense of Oakland."

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.810
And this piece, it's a little bit longer just
to give you guys fair warning.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.360
I think it's around 15 minutes.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.700
So, just give you guys heads up.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.870
[reads from book]
"When I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley,

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:07.800
I remember talking with a sorority girl at
a party about where we grew up.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.050
She was from Orange County.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:15.510
I replied I was born in Oakland, and I grew
up in Alameda, Oakland, Berkeley, and Palo

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.510
Alto.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.070
She stared at me in disbelief.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.930
One word stood out to her.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.930
'Oakland?

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.110
Oh, we don't go into Oakland.'

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.779
When I prodded her some more, she said that
Oakland was so violent, and that there were

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:33.660
so many murders, and that her parents warned
her never to go into Oakland.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.700
Eventually, I got her to admit that she goes
Zachary's Pizza only a couple of miles south

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.910
of UC Berkeley and to Fentons Ice Creamery.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:48.430
But she insisted that she didn't venture any
further into Oakland than Fentons.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.320
It was clear that the mere mention of 'Oakland"
triggered something of a fear response in

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.520
her.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.410
Her use of the word 'into' was also very telling.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.830
In a sense, that one little word reflected
not only her fear but many people's ambivalence

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.700
toward Oakland as well.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.540
It was as if the locales of Zachary's and
Fentons--upper middle class neighborhoods--were

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.370
not part of Oakland but extensions of Berkeley,
and that the idea of venturing any farther

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.690
'into' Oakland was unfathomable.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.640
Fear is driven by the unknown, and the fact
that she wouldn't go any further into Oakland

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.791
meant that she would remain fearful of Oakland--especially
if her only exposure to the city was through

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:30.320
the media's violence-centered and racially-charged
depiction of it.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.371
By not stepping outside her comfort zone to
see Oakland for what it really was, she would

00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:40.990
continue to harbor these thoughts about my
place of birth.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.370
This encounter has stayed with me because,
for the first time, I began to consider Oakland

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.269
through the eyes of an 'outsider.'

00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:53.430
This encounter is representative of the many
I've had since, and it is these misconceptions

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.490
that motivated me to offer a different narrative
of Oakland.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:03.540
The Oakland I've grown up in has its challenges
like any major city, but what stands out to

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.800
me is the cultural renaissance happening in
Oakland today.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.320
I've been privileged to have a front-row seat
to witness what's been happening in Oakland,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.410
and this book is a collection of interviews
with those people who know it best--musicians

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.080
and writers from Oakland who are shaping its
art scene.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.060
Wanting to understand the outsider's perspective
of Oakland, I wondered, why do even reputable

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.399
outlets like the Discovery Channel air sensationalist
programming about Oakland?

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:38.350
They have two shows called 'Gang Wars: Oakland'
and 'Gang Wars II: Oakland,' [laughter] which

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.070
follow the Oakland Gang Task Force.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.710
So by a show of hands, I was wondering, are
any of you guys familiar with these shows?

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:49.070
Have you seen the Gang Wars programming about
Oakland?

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:54.570
OK so, just a couple people, so all cue you
guys in.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:12:01.220
The first episode begins with a deep voice-over
saying, 'Oakland, California home to some

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.120
of the most violent gangs in America.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.630
Here, almost ten thousand gang members rule
with deadly force, recruiting teens, running

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.840
drugs, selling guns, and murdering on a whim.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:19.760
Now, an elite police unit made up of just
eight men fights to bring justice to the streets,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.220
and the top gang lords are arrested to make
Oakland safe again, but something has gone

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.720
terribly wrong.'

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.731
The voice-over continues, painting a grim
portrait of Oakland, calling it, quote, 'ground

00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:36.560
zero in a new American war.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:43.600
Violent street gangs fight over drug turf,
and the battle is only escalating.'

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.430
Comparisons to Iraq add to the already sensational
tone, giving viewers the impression that just

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.500
below the surface, Oakland is fomenting with
such violence, that at any moment all hell

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.760
will break loose.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.790
With this much negative press, it's no wonder
people are afraid to go into Oakland.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.760
Given the presuppositions and stereotypes
that result from such portrayals, it's hard

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.610
for visitors to experience the reality of
what is presented before them because it clashes

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:16.670
with the narrative they've internalized from
countless news reports.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:21.320
People consuming this type of media go to
Oakland expecting to find drive-by shootings,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.220
roving gangs toting AK-47s, as well as pimps,
prostitutes, and race riots.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.750
However, people visiting Oakland are often
surprised when they don't see this, but instead

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:39.630
find several avant-garde movements in art,
music, fashion, urban farming, and local food.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:45.589
Chinaka Hodge, an Oakland writer, whom I was
fortunate to interview for this collection,

00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:47.980
writes about the perceptions of Oakland in
her blog."

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:53.260
And then, I wanna give a little extended quote
from Chinaka here.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.720
" 'I lived on the East Coast for a few years.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.381
Tell a New Yorker you're from Cali, and they'll
assume, eight times out of ten, that you're

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.320
from Los Angeles.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.070
I live in LA now.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:09.639
Tell the average Angeleno that you're from
up North, they assume San Francisco.

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:14.830
Oakland is constantly upstaged, asterisked,
and misunderstood.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:20.920
In my travels, I still field questions about
the 1996 Ebonics debate, I talk about a hoop

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:26.079
squad that is more than Latrell's hands around
someone's neck, I remind that we are more

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:32.959
than the riots that followed the Raiders'
loss at the 2003 Super Bowl.'

00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:37.660
Hodge continues, setting the record straight
about what Oakland is and what the city does

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.660
best.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.730
[beeping on screen] 'In short, Oakland is
proud because no one else will be proud for

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.899
us.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:50.230
We exercise a rich cultural legacy, a policy
for introspection and a knack for finding

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.680
the next.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.610
The town is a study in surprise, in artistic
innovation, in movements foreign to the rest

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.280
of the planet.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.200
We are the birthplace of leather jackets rocked
with berets at free breakfast, where Skyline

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.610
High School taught Tom Hanks to act, the original
terminal for all Pullman Porter activity,

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:14.920
where Walt Disney visited a theme park near
a lake and began drafting ideas for Disneyland.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.420
Here, we make ideas that power the world.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:25.680
We do what no one else does, and we do it
well.'

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.480
Hodge's poetic description giving snapshots
of various periods of Oakland's history captures

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:36.019
Oakland's free-spirited character that is
at once tough, artistic, and even sensitive--a

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.040
character often misunderstood.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.300
But Oakland is unapologetic.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.260
After all, it knows who it is--a strong city,
that's gracious and accepting of people from

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.520
all economic and cultural backgrounds.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.730
Oakland residents are resilient, free-spirited,
and confident, qualities which keep the city

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:59.050
at the cutting edge and help it forge trends
in fashion, music, dance, or as Hodge puts

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.940
it, making 'ideas that power the world.'

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:08.029
These ideas are indeed powerful as they go
beyond individual expression and often speak

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:12.320
to the collective soul of a generation or
a group of people.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.280
Oakland often mediates the production of art,
language, and cultural innovation for the

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.060
US and it has regularly produced some of the
country's top talent."

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:29.070
So, I'm skipping ahead to the final section
of the introduction.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.800
It's called "Oakland: The secret is out."

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.990
[reads from book]
"Ishmael Reed wrote in 'Oakland Rhapsody:

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:44.269
The Secret Soul of an American Downtown' in
1995, that Oakland is America's best kept

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:45.269
secret.

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:47.339
Well, the secret is out.

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:49.800
And the media is starting to take notice.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.019
The New York Times ranked Oakland as one of
the top five places to visit in the world

00:16:54.019 --> 00:16:56.300
in 2012.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.779
The New York Times Travel Section gives credit
to Oakland native chef James Syhabout, but

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:06.589
it also points that Oakland is now worth visiting
because famous San Francisco chefs have decided

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.449
to set up shop in Oakland.

00:17:09.449 --> 00:17:15.359
But it's not only such entrepreneurial transplants
that makes Oakland worth visiting.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:20.779
Those in the know would say the media's recognition
of Oakland's thriving cultural realm was long

00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:25.669
overdue, especially given the city's growth
spurt in the art, music, fashion, and literary

00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:28.019
scenes in the last decade.

00:17:28.019 --> 00:17:32.039
In the last few years alone, over a dozen
new art galleries have popped up in Oakland's

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:38.119
Northgate-Waverly district, previously known
for its auto repair shops and warehouses.

00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:42.549
Such a Renaissance no doubt draws inspiration
from Oakland's rich history as a cultural

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:48.919
destination in the late 19th century, hosting
the likes of Gertrude Stein, Jack London,

00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:55.190
Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, and John
Muir, to name a few.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.659
More recently, Oakland gave birth to the Hyphy
Movement, the Scraper Bike movement, and turf

00:18:00.659 --> 00:18:06.149
dancing, while Mac Dre, E-40, and Keak da
Sneak invented much of the hip-hop language

00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:09.960
used internationally today.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.529
Several local news sources have sprung up
in recent years to document this renaissance

00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:20.499
in art collectives, local food movement, urban
farming, and music, including Oakland Local,

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:27.669
Oakland North, Bay Citizen, Oakland Seen,
Thizzler, and 38th Notes.

00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:32.409
The Bay Area's indie and underground scenes
are constantly studies in surprise.

00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:37.999
They've historically been engines of innovation,
creating new musical styles and language.

00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:43.229
What's happening on the ground today in the
Bay may take months or even years to become

00:18:43.229 --> 00:18:46.080
mainstream.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:55.340
Novelist William Gibson said 'The future is
already here--it's just not very evenly distributed.'

00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:01.080
In the Bay Area, the future in music and language
is already here.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.649
Each artist I interviewed is innovating in
his or her own way.

00:19:04.649 --> 00:19:09.750
You can listen to the future of music through
these artists.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.489
Oakland is a never ending conversation.

00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:16.059
In this book, I didn't have to set out to
curate viewpoints or quell perspectives that

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:18.169
differ with my own.

00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:22.639
And I don't pretend to have the city wrapped
up.

00:19:22.639 --> 00:19:27.080
Studying Oakland's history and reading books
like 'No There There: Race, Class, and Political

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.499
Community in Oakland' by Chris Rhomberg and
'American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:37.049
Postwar Oakland' by Robert Self, I've found
more paradoxes about my hometown than I can

00:19:37.049 --> 00:19:39.309
reconcile.

00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:43.789
These artists who voice the paradoxes of urban
America give us a unique lens through which

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:46.379
to view Oakland.

00:19:46.379 --> 00:19:50.239
These twelve established and up-and-coming
artists give perspectives on Oakland different

00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:53.570
from the usual media narrative about the city.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.100
What I admire about these artists is how they've
kept their authenticity as they've grown in

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.110
their music and how they champion the Oakland
quality of having a knack for finding the

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.110
next.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:09.599
And as for the sorority girl at the beginning,
I hope she visited Oakland while she was at

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:11.710
UC Berkeley.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:16.090
If not, she sure missed out on a lot."

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.770
[pause]

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.629
So that was the end of the introduction.

00:20:23.629 --> 00:20:28.700
So, now for the second phase of the talk,
I'll walk you guys through how I actually

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.690
put the book together 'cause it's a fairly
non-conventional process I used.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:42.740
So, I have some photos here on Google+ which
I'll flip through.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.139
[pause]

00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:47.169
So, I ended up.

00:20:47.169 --> 00:20:53.600
So basically, to give context, my cousin is
a printer in Sacramento and my uncle is a

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.440
book binder in Berkeley.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:03.440
So I used the family resources and I printed
and then hand bound all the books myself,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.440
with help of family.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.029
So, this is my cousin Sean right here.

00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:07.309
He's a master printer.

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:11.820
And we actually used laser printers 'cause
he has about a hundred of them in his warehouse.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.379
And so, this is him getting a duplexer unit
ready.

00:21:16.379 --> 00:21:23.019
And then this is example of basically how
I printed out pages.

00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:24.019
And then there's Sean.

00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:25.840
He's, let's see.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.359
I have that he's checking the toner density.

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:35.869
And what was interesting is as being the author,
I did the design, layout, copy editing, proofreading,

00:21:35.869 --> 00:21:39.049
and I mean, I did have a group of friends
helping me out.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:43.429
But it's very interesting then printing and
then binding your own work 'cause not too

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:46.989
many authors do that today.

00:21:46.989 --> 00:21:53.869
But then, having all of this full creative
control over the book itself, I was able to

00:21:53.869 --> 00:21:56.109
do some special things with it.

00:21:56.109 --> 00:21:57.109
Oh, yep.

00:21:57.109 --> 00:21:59.200
So these are the printers.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.899
So, it's good to have a cousin when you're
a writer with these kind of printers.

00:22:03.899 --> 00:22:08.830
And for those of you who were at my Tech Talk
last year about my first book, I used pretty

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:14.989
much the same exact process from printing
the first book as with the second one.

00:22:14.989 --> 00:22:22.950
So, I ended up using Strathmore, 100 percent
cotton paper which is perhaps the most expensive

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.700
paper you can use because it's archival quality.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.980
And the reason I chose this is because when
I was working at UC Berkeley as an undergrad,

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:39.080
I got to work in their Bancroft Library, which
is their special archiving collections.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:44.580
And if we wanted something to last for a long
time, we would print it out on 100 percent

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.360
cotton paper because it'll last for hundreds
of years.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:54.149
So, I ended up going upscale with that one
area.

00:22:54.149 --> 00:23:01.759
And then also, why I chose this paper is that
I used to intern and volunteer at McSweeney's

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:04.369
Publishing in San Francisco.

00:23:04.369 --> 00:23:10.590
So I was there for about five years and I
got to work closely with the author Dave Eggers.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.840
And on a number of the projects, they're very
unique and special binding.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.990
And they use very high-quality paper.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:21.749
And the reason for doing this is that in this
digital age, a lot of the large publishers

00:23:21.749 --> 00:23:26.100
now, they're trying to cut costs and bend
corners any way possible.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.379
So, a lot of them now are printing on newsprint
essentially.

00:23:29.379 --> 00:23:35.999
They're having the books printed in China
very cheaply and then shipped here in bulk.

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:40.599
But if you guys have ever been to like, Wal-Mart
or Target and you go to the book section and

00:23:40.599 --> 00:23:46.969
you pick up the book, it doesn't really feel
like a quality object.

00:23:46.969 --> 00:23:52.669
Whereas in this digital age, I feel it's very
interesting being a Google employee stepping

00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:59.019
back and saying, "Well, there is validity
to e-readers, but I don't think the printed

00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:03.460
book in its form is gonna go out of fashion."

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:09.480
And so, as a counter argument, I've been going
in the opposite direction of showing the staying

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:15.679
power of the book as a physical object and
really making something beautiful and it be

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:16.679
coveted.

00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:23.370
So, that's a long explanation of why I chose
the paper I did.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.340
And then, so here we are now.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.700
This is my uncle's binding shop in Berkeley.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.129
And so, that's my sister, Kelly, and friend,
Sean.

00:24:33.129 --> 00:24:37.009
And basically, he sells these book binding
machines.

00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:39.779
And then this is also a foil printer.

00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:46.510
So usually, to be able to get foil on a book
cover, you need to get a stamp dye, but those

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.440
are, it's very expensive.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.389
And I wanna keep this low budget.

00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:55.820
So, it just happens that my uncle has these
printers that can print in gold and silver

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.820
foil.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:02.799
So, I ended up choosing silver with the black
background to get the Oakland Raiders look--the

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:04.229
silver and black.

00:25:04.229 --> 00:25:07.749
[laughter] So, there's Sean doing quality
control.

00:25:07.749 --> 00:25:10.830
So basically I printed everything out on eight
and a half by eleven paper.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.090
And then we used this paper trimmer.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.129
We cut the manuscript in half.

00:25:15.129 --> 00:25:21.049
And then we would fold the halves back in
to make a book bundle.

00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:24.059
And we put the two covers on both sides.

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:27.049
And then, there's my brother.

00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:34.109
So basically, we would put this binding strip
in this machine and it would heat press the

00:25:34.109 --> 00:25:36.549
binding strip onto the edges of the paper.

00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:44.590
And then once the glue that was super heated
then cooled, then the book was ready to go.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.460
So basically, I got all my extended family
to come out and help out.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:53.279
So, I ended up making three versions of the
book.

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:59.960
On the left, you have the green and yellow,
which is the Oakland A's version.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.749
In the center is the silver and black, the
Oakland Raiders version, which was the one

00:26:04.749 --> 00:26:06.679
that I mass produced.

00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:11.330
And then I had the blue and gold version,
which is for Golden State Warriors, or UC

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:16.129
Berkeley 'cause I'm a big Cal fan.

00:26:16.129 --> 00:26:17.129
[pause]

00:26:17.129 --> 00:26:22.690
And then, by making these one at a time by
hand, we could just do any kind of custom

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.269
cover combination we wanted, then be experimental
and creative with it.

00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:33.570
Whereas, had I sent it off to a large printer,
I wouldn't have been able to have this artistic

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.919
control.

00:26:36.919 --> 00:26:39.940
And then this is my uncle Dick, Jim Kelly.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.830
It was great to have him on-site 'cause he
helped create and invent these machines.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:49.099
And so, if we ran into any problems, he was
there to help troubleshoot.

00:26:49.099 --> 00:26:51.279
And then there's my dad binding the books.

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:55.399
And then you can see the black binding strips
there that he inserts.

00:26:55.399 --> 00:26:58.659
And that machine in front of the binder is
actually a spine printer.

00:26:58.659 --> 00:27:02.149
And that's what we used to print the spine.

00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:03.499
[pause]

00:27:03.499 --> 00:27:09.679
And there's the book being super heated in
the press.

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:14.269
And then there's my mom collating the manuscripts
into a book.

00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:17.110
So, I really got the whole family out there.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.269
[pause]

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:19.440
OK.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:25.690
So that's the collection, a little bit of
the book process.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:32.539
And then next, I want to, I'm going to bring
up, talk a little bit about the artist interviews

00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:33.539
that I did.

00:27:33.539 --> 00:27:37.399
And then after that, I'll open it up for questions.

00:27:37.399 --> 00:27:39.710
OK.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:46.289
So, this is Chinaka Hodge, who is the first
interview in the book.

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:51.460
I had a former classmate of mine from the
University of Edinburgh, where I went to grad

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.460
school.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.029
She's a very good portrait artist, Laura Tomlinson.

00:27:55.029 --> 00:28:00.409
And I asked her to draw portraits of the twelve
people I interviewed.

00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:05.029
And I thought she did an excellent job just
using pencil on plain paper.

00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:09.820
And so, I had her draw the various portraits.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.599
This is Rafael Casal, who''s from Berkeley.

00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:23.029
And how I chose the various people interviewed
was I had this college radio show in Scotland,

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:27.489
but out there people were very interested
in what was happening in the West Coast hip-hop

00:28:27.489 --> 00:28:30.719
scene and the indie rock scene out here.

00:28:30.719 --> 00:28:36.019
And so, I started out interviewing friends
of mine and friends of friends who I had grown

00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:40.919
up with through Youth Speaks doing poetry
slams here in the Bay area.

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:47.460
And so, Rafael Casal is, he's a real well-known
in the poetry slam and spoken word circuit.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:55.399
And he's just now emerging as a talent in
the hip-hop arena.

00:28:55.399 --> 00:28:56.759
[pause]

00:28:56.759 --> 00:28:59.619
And here's Dahlak Brathwaite.

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:01.379
He's from Sacramento.

00:29:01.379 --> 00:29:02.739
[pause]

00:29:02.739 --> 00:29:06.059
So, this is Dave Smallen.

00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:11.629
We went to high school together at Bishop
O'Dowd in East Oakland.

00:29:11.629 --> 00:29:15.590
And he actually designed the cover of the
book.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:21.440
And so, for the cover, I told him I wanted
something that says "Oakland."

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.590
And so we have Oakland in the block letters.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:29.169
And then we have the Oakland Tribune tower
with an oak tree behind it.

00:29:29.169 --> 00:29:32.309
And he actually created a linoleum block print.

00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:37.080
So he carved a piece of linoleum and then
put ink on it and then pressed a paper on

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.200
it.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.619
And then I have the original that I based
the cover off of right over there.

00:29:41.619 --> 00:29:48.460
And then basically, I scanned his print and
then yeah, I made the foil version that you

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.450
see on the final cover.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:55.399
So, this is George Watsky.

00:29:55.399 --> 00:30:03.169
He was the first interview I did back in 2008
because he was very obscure at that time.

00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:08.849
And I knew I could get him 'cause he was a
friend of mine growing up from the poetry

00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:10.610
slam circuit.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.899
But it just happens that, just in the last
year, he's gained a lot of notoriety because

00:30:14.899 --> 00:30:22.219
of a viral video he made on YouTube called
"Pale Kid Raps Fast," which has over ten million

00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:23.219
views.

00:30:23.219 --> 00:30:29.649
And he got to go on the Ellen DeGeneres show
twice this year to showcase his fast rapping

00:30:29.649 --> 00:30:31.080
style.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:37.399
But I chose a picture of him where it showed
his swagger and personality.

00:30:37.399 --> 00:30:38.729
[pause]

00:30:38.729 --> 00:30:40.509
And then this is Ise Lyfe.

00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:46.220
The interview I did with him was one of the
most provocative ones because it really made

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:53.739
me question some of the assumptions and stereotypes
that I had of living in Oakland.

00:30:53.739 --> 00:30:58.940
And he really brought a much needed perspective.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:04.359
We discuss quite a bit around race relations
in Oakland in the post Oscar Grant era and

00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:12.169
also a legacy of Jerry Brown's housing policy
in Oakland and all these various issues of

00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:14.479
gentrification in Oakland today.

00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:19.389
And talking with him really challenged where
I stand on various things.

00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:24.719
And it was very interesting interviewing him
because we've known each other since high

00:31:24.719 --> 00:31:26.089
school.

00:31:26.089 --> 00:31:36.589
And he's been working as a community organizer
in East Oakland, but he also has a thriving

00:31:36.589 --> 00:31:40.929
business and he performs quite a bit with
his hip-hop and spoken word.

00:31:40.929 --> 00:31:42.969
And so, that was--.

00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:48.330
If you're gonna read one interview, it would
be the Ise Lyfe one.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.259
And this is K Flay.

00:31:51.259 --> 00:31:53.809
Another musician.

00:31:53.809 --> 00:31:57.659
This is Kid Beyond, who is a beat boxer.

00:31:57.659 --> 00:32:03.259
So, he, that was one of the most entertaining
interviews I did.

00:32:03.259 --> 00:32:08.169
And unfortunately, the text version really
doesn't do him justice because he did about

00:32:08.169 --> 00:32:11.419
ten different impersonations during the interview.

00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:17.129
He actually can do a spot-on impersonation
of Barack Obama.

00:32:17.129 --> 00:32:22.649
And so, I had him do "Hey, you're listening
to the DJ Matt Werner show on Fresh Air: The

00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:25.709
Alternative, University of Edinburgh student
radio."

00:32:25.709 --> 00:32:31.480
But he said the call line in Obama's voice.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.299
And for a couple weeks after, at school, at
the University of Edinburgh, people were wondering

00:32:35.299 --> 00:32:39.659
like, "How did you get Barack Obama to do
the voice over on your show?"

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:45.619
Or, "How did you manipulate his speeches to
say DJ Matt Werner and Fresh Air: The Alternative?"

00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:46.659
So, yeah.

00:32:46.659 --> 00:32:48.830
He's a very talented guy.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:54.639
And for him, unfortunately, the text version,
it's good but it really doesn't do this range,

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:56.419
this vocal talent that he has justice.

00:32:56.419 --> 00:33:03.009
And so, that one, I do have podcasts of most
of the interviews on my website.

00:33:03.009 --> 00:33:06.059
Matts writing dot com.

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:12.740
And then this is MC Lars, who his trademark
is wearing an Oakland A's starter cap.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.840
So, yeah.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.029
He's also from Oakland.

00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:20.669
And this was Saul Williams, a spoken word
artist.

00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:25.899
And the reason I interviewed him is that he's
from Philadelphia.

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:31.570
He's not from Oakland, but he's had a real
big impact on the style of spoken word that

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.070
a lot of the artists I interviewed.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:37.129
So, I thought he would be a good edition to
have in the book.

00:33:37.129 --> 00:33:42.459
And then, I also interviewed Talib Kweli,
who is from Brooklyn, New York.

00:33:42.459 --> 00:33:49.549
And then, he also has had a big influence
on the style of this progressive hip-hop that

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:51.369
a number of the artists I interviewed shared.

00:33:51.369 --> 00:33:56.460
So, that's why I included him in the collection.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.849
And then this is Victor Vazquez aka Kool AD.

00:34:00.849 --> 00:34:04.159
He's from this band called Das Racist.

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:09.250
And they have this very interesting style
of post-modern hip-hop.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:15.270
And for him, I went to, basically I went to
grade school with him in Alameda.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:20.849
And I had been reading stuff about him saying,
well basically, articles had called him like

00:34:20.849 --> 00:34:25.260
a Brooklyn artist and then some had said he's
from Hunter's Point, San Francisco.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.869
But then I wanted to set the record straight,
like, "No, he's from Oakland and Alameda."

00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:30.970
So, to claim that East Bay.

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:35.639
So, I included him in the collection as well.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:44.379
So, that's the conclusion of the overview
of who I interviewed and a little bit of background

00:34:44.379 --> 00:34:45.569
about the book.

00:34:45.569 --> 00:34:49.039
And if you guys would like, we have a microphone
right there.

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:51.730
You can come up and ask some questions.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:55.000
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Is this?

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.181
I'm curious how you feel about the popularization
of First Friday slash Art Murmur in Oakland

00:35:01.181 --> 00:35:06.319
and the notoriety that's bringing to especially
the visual arts scene of Oakland.

00:35:06.319 --> 00:35:13.030
&gt;&gt;Matt: So, you're question is how do I feel
about the popularization of the First Friday

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.460
Art Murmur in Oakland?

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.000
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Mm-hmm.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.550
&gt;&gt;Matt: Well, I think it's a very interesting
event.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:27.150
I've been going there every month since November
of 2011, I've been attending.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:32.240
And I've written a number of pieces for Oakland
Local--the local news site--recapping what's

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.920
happened at this month's Art Murmur.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.819
And for those of you who aren't familiar with
it, the first Friday of each month in Oakland

00:35:39.819 --> 00:35:44.240
in this Northgate-Waverly district, it's a
little bit outside of the downtown, right

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.490
before you hit the Broadway auto row.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:53.230
There's now 25 galleries and mixed-use spaces
that open up and thousands of people come

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:57.920
out in downtown Oakland between 6 to 10 PM
each month.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:07.420
And it's really an amazing event where there's
yeah, all these artists in the galleries themselves,

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:12.579
but then there's so many different street
performers, street vendors.

00:36:12.579 --> 00:36:17.970
I was actually selling my book the last couple
of months on the street.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.200
And people make their own jewelry.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.109
It's very interesting event.

00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:28.529
But what's interesting is some of the people
I interviewed in the book have mixed feelings

00:36:28.529 --> 00:36:31.410
about it.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:39.529
I know Chinaka Hodge, she posted on Facebook
a while back where she was jogging through

00:36:39.529 --> 00:36:44.359
I guess that area of Oakland wearing a shirt
that said "Kill a Hipster, Save Your Hood."

00:36:44.359 --> 00:36:46.210
[laughter]

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:51.119
And she was getting some kind of nasty looks
or shocked looks.

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:55.829
And then, I know Ise Lyfe, his real name is
Isaac Brown.

00:36:55.829 --> 00:37:02.400
He's been highly critical of some of Jerry
Brown's 10K plan, which a lot of people feel

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.089
was the precursor to this wave of artists.

00:37:06.089 --> 00:37:12.630
So, there are some in Oakland who argue that
turning these auto repair shops into these

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:19.430
art galleries is actually really rising rents
and pushing people out of this area of Oakland.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.730
And I think that may be a valid argument.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.140
I haven't really researched it too much.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:35.809
But the feeling of Art Murmur, 'cause I've
written now a few pieces on this, and I interviewed

00:37:35.809 --> 00:37:43.339
one woman a couple months back who, and I
asked about the start of Art Murmur and what

00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:44.650
she thinks of it now.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:49.700
And she said when it first started up about
five or six years ago, it was a lot of these

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:56.950
art students from California Academy of the
Arts and it had this real hipster vibe.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.700
And she called it like a 'too cool for school'
thing.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.730
It's people come out on their track bikes
with the skinny jeans, drinking their Pabst

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.940
Blue Ribbon, smoking their skinny cigarettes.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:11.609
And it had this elitest-like, artsy vibe.

00:38:11.609 --> 00:38:17.260
But in the last like, six months though, I
felt that Art Murmur has become very democratic

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:23.320
in that there's people from all areas of Oakland,
all walks of life, and they're there, a lot

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:29.140
of people are there on the street just trying
to make an extra buck, you know, selling tamales,

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.140
things like that.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:36.599
And so, for me, I'd say overall it's a positive
thing because I'd love to see Oakland get

00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:43.470
known for its art, its music, its local culture,
get this recognition as opposed to just people

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:46.610
fixating on the violence in Oakland, which
is present.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.610
I'm not going to gloss over that.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:53.380
But it's not the only thing happening in Oakland.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:59.109
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thanks.

00:38:59.109 --> 00:39:01.019
[pause]

00:39:01.019 --> 00:39:06.490
&gt;&gt;Male #2: You mentioned you were tear gassed.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.900
I'm assuming that was Occupy Oakland and not
at a party.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:17.809
But the, as somebody who was also there, I'm
wondering what are your thoughts and what

00:39:17.809 --> 00:39:27.410
are the artists thoughts on Occupy Movement,
its surgeance and its vibrance in popular

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.490
media?

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:32.430
&gt;&gt;Matt: So, the Occupy Oakland question.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:33.430
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Of course.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:38.690
&gt;&gt;Matt: I was hoping someone wouldn't ask
my thoughts and opinions of it.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.579
I'm torn.

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:42.980
It's very complicated.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.279
It was last October.

00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:49.290
It was in late October.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:55.079
There was the police crackdown on Occupy Oakland
where they came in and raided the camp.

00:39:55.079 --> 00:40:00.830
And then, the police shot off the tear gas
and then there was a veteran was shot in the

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:05.480
head by one of those tear gas canisters--Scott
Olsen.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:10.400
And it was very tense moment.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.230
And during the week, I live here in Mountain
View, close to the office.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.680
And then on weekends, I go back to Oakland.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:24.280
And my housemates, who don't really understand
Oakland, said, "Oh, it's just people in Oakland

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.280
are angry again.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.940
Oh, it's just riots again in Oakland."

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.869
And I became insulted.

00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:36.040
I was like, "How dare you just dismissively
say 'Oh, it's just, that's what people do

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.410
in Oakland on weekends.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:39.009
They go out and riot.'"

00:40:39.009 --> 00:40:42.390
And then the police need to go and control
them.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:49.400
And I felt I had a lot of friends naive comments
about Occupy Oakland, so I was like, well

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.210
I wanna go in and check it out.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:56.080
So, I went in just a couple days after that
incident where Scott Olsen was shot and I

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.460
went into the general assembly.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.980
And this was October 28th, 2011.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:07.680
And I wrote a piece on it for Oakland Local
and it was actually made into a play that

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.759
Theater Pub did in January of this year.

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:14.180
And it was just called "My Visit to Occupy
Oakland."

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:19.890
And I felt that I wasn't really part of the
movement, but I was there more from a sociological

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:26.820
or cultural anthropologist perspective, there
trying to understand what's going on because

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:33.000
it's like I was knee-deep working on this
book on Oakland and that was by far the biggest

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.240
news happening in Oakland.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:39.349
So I wanted to be there on the ground, find
out what was happening.

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:45.710
And then, fast forward to, I believe it was
January 28th of this year.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:51.660
There was a similar type of protest and crackdown,
except I didn't know about it.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.000
I was researching for my book.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.430
I was at the Oakland Main Library and then
I was cycling over to the Oakland Museum of

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.000
California, right there on the lake.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.660
And it just happened to be that right on,
I think it was 10th Street, all of a sudden

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:17.350
when I'm coming up, I see these road flares
and I smell this really powerful smell.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.730
And I think it's just road flares and stuff.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:24.350
And I see all these cop cars and unmarked
vehicles and then these protesters in those

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.119
plastic handcuffs.

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:29.809
And the crowd had just been dispersed.

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:34.950
And so I'm there and then I stop my bike and
I hop down and there's this photographer there.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:36.030
I'm like, "What just happened?"

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:39.140
And then I'm like, "Is that pepper spray in
the air?"

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.700
And then he's like, "No, that's tear gas.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.869
They just shot it off."

00:42:41.869 --> 00:42:45.480
And I was like, "Oh, like I need to get out
of here."

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:53.279
So, I felt that people just even living in
downtown Oakland or passing through there

00:42:53.279 --> 00:43:00.869
at any point like in the last six months,
you would inadvertently be part of Occupy

00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:03.790
or it would affect you in some way.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:09.921
And then, but as far as firmly coming down
and saying like, is Occupy Oakland good or

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:11.079
is it bad?

00:43:11.079 --> 00:43:17.789
I'd have to say somewhere in-between because
now there's all these different factions of

00:43:17.789 --> 00:43:23.200
it that I don't fully understand like what
the goals of the Black Bloc are.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.670
And it's this group of anarchists and but
yeah.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:35.559
I don't really know too much more about them
to really make a informed comment.

00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:36.559
[pause]

00:43:36.559 --> 00:43:43.990
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So, Oakland has been on the frontlines
of the medicinal marijuana issue and recent

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:45.940
crackdowns of the Oaksterdam back in effect.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:51.180
Just wondering what your feelings were about
that and if you see any changes, if your interviews

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.180
referenced it.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.089
It's been, like it or not, it's been a big
part of the local economy.

00:43:55.089 --> 00:43:57.319
Not a lot of people are aware of that.

00:43:57.319 --> 00:44:02.780
But it does actually affect a lot more people's
lives than you would imagine even not the

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.250
people who directly are involved with it.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.700
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:13.559
So, at the First Friday Art Murmur, just happened
a few days ago.

00:44:13.559 --> 00:44:16.559
Oaksterdam actually had quite a big presence.

00:44:16.559 --> 00:44:21.480
There was their mascot was there dressed as
a giant bong.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:29.009
And then they had people carrying the actual
marijuana plants at their table.

00:44:29.009 --> 00:44:35.670
But with Oaksterdam and the crackdown, it
didn't come up in the book.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:43.750
The book was more on how did the shooting
of Oscar Grant by the BART police officer

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:47.140
really change things in Oakland.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.660
And the marijuana policy of Oakland didn't
really come up.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.920
But I know that is definitely one of like
the top five issues in Oakland today because

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.710
it is a big tax revenue generator.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:03.599
And it actually has quite a bit of political
support in Oakland.

00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:09.660
I went to a Rebecca Kaplan fundraiser a few
weeks back and she openly supported Oaksterdam

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:15.660
and the medicinal marijuana places in Oakland.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.480
And a lot of the council members are very
supportive of it and they were very angry

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:29.930
that the Feds came in and cracked down, whereas
local law and state law allow it.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:36.079
So, it's gonna be a very interesting issue
to see how that plays out with local and state

00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:38.829
politics versus federal politics.

00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:43.049
But I'm not really up on those set of debates.

00:45:43.049 --> 00:45:44.730
OK.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.520
Thank you guys for coming out.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:53.630
And then I also have some photos from the
book and you can also purchase books over

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:54.660
here for 15 dollars.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:55.660
OK, thank you.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:55.940
[applause]
