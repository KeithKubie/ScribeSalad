so you have to design that in a

actually spend a pretty decent amount of
 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.720
actually spend a pretty decent amount of
effort retooling rewriting headlines so

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730
effort retooling rewriting headlines so
 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.150
effort retooling rewriting headlines so
that they make sense to somebody who

headlines in print are meant to sit next
 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.430
headlines in print are meant to sit next
to other headlines and sort of benefit

articles also online will change based

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520
articles also online will change based
 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.630
articles also online will change based
on the the platform the technology that

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640
on the the platform the technology that
 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.660
on the the platform the technology that
people are using to view them so they

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670
people are using to view them so they
 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.960
people are using to view them so they
may see things differently in one

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970
may see things differently in one
 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.900
may see things differently in one
browser on one operating system and and

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910
browser on one operating system and and
 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.310
browser on one operating system and and
very differently on another browser or

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320
very differently on another browser or
 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.960
very differently on another browser or
even another different kind of device so
